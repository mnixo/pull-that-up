thinking about oh my god this is so bad why am i starting so embarrassing I was thinking about maybe looking up like shamans in New York you know to be like maybe I can get like just explore the spiritual universe a little bit I think it means I'm lonely but like shamans like do you wanna do drugs oh I mean I be I'd love to do ayahuasca yeah so that's if they're not gonna be listed you're

country I mushrooms are I love mushrooms wanna do some right now and I have too many other things to do today I recently did them and I always said I didn't realize this it happened on mushrooms I got so giggly oh yeah if you take the right amount you get super here you like just giggled for hours I was like I was sure I was annoying to everyone around me which is also pretty normal but like you know giggling non-stop at anything well a lot of people are micro dosing now and what they're doing is they're taking a level of they're taking like enough psilocybin so that you don't quite feel it it's like you know it's like knocking on the door or feeling it like almost there but they report this amazing alleviation of anxiety they feel super creative and really friendly and all these like powerful positive vibes but they're basically sober yeah I don't know does it affect you long like if you actually wanted to take Oh to blah blah yeah would you have to take like an extraordinary amount you're gonna be able to blast off every single time yeah I could imagine that somehow another would get in the way the feeling that happens when you take a large dose where it's like you just feel the tingling and you get fuckin scared yeah I always have to put my hand here for hours at the beginning of the Gulf War like right after 9/11 Stanhope and I got fucked up on mushrooms like the

things like hundreds of years out yeah they're good at it yeah yeah they're really we underestimate China well how about that fucking wall how long it take to make I don't know probably like six days knowing how hard they work hundred years we were just like no we got this don't worry I'm just tired of being invaded I mean that country is like I mean they invented everything everything and they around forever they've been around forever and like and we just were like no no reason to be scared of them they've been China forever forever forever yeah yeah I mean America's a baby a little tiny baby yeah we're a little baby baby they have bombs they have the best electronics they steal everything yeah all the intellectual property like fuck you they don't have any rules yeah you know we copy I used to work at this tech company and like we had a lot of Chinese people that work it was a computational biochemistry research lab so of course we had a lot of Chinese people it works there because we try to say very smart and qualified you're like you're racist I just said you were smart I'm so you're amazing is it racist you guys were amazing well then people think they're like not all Chinese people are doing well and I'm like yeah I'm sure there's Chinese people that aren't doing well but you know their parents never talked about well there's a lot of Chinese people when you say not all Chinese people are doing well there's fucking a billion of yeah I mean there's plenty that aren't doing well but the ones that are doing well are doing really well yeah you're concentrating on the glass is half-empty yeah I mean really but a billion people the Chinese people that worked at this tech company if they were Chinese nationals they were only allowed to have access to certain parts like there were certain parts they had to keep separate from them and they couldn't know about did they come over and stare at your computer me I'm just like I'm just recruiting new people to work here you're not gonna get anything from me I don't understand what we're doing here but the one guy who worked there he came over didn't know any English and he learned English by watching Seinfeld so I kid you not he had this Seinfeld cadence any enter rooms a little bit like Kramer no not the full thing but every time you come into the office he'd be like whoa no really wow that's weird whatever these add equivalent show in China or if you went over there and try to learn Mandarin from a television show like what would you concentrate on a way to hold your I'm gonna get to know it's racial you fucks there's a difference a racial and racist yeah I enjoy chopstick it's a great way to eat salad by the way it's a great way to eat slower yeah yeah but if you want to eat salad it's like the best way to eat salad are you seldom at chopsticks yeah yeah could you ever try to like create a fork in a tomato fucking hard yeah you can grab a lot of lettuce with them chopsticks

tattooed always tired on your face I every time I see a picture of him I get angry like I spend I don't spend a ton of time in hair and makeup but any time I have something there's at least a little hair and makeup and I'm looking at this guy and I'm like why can't we just be that like well I think what he's doing and what a lot of people are doing is that they're like going way overboard to not give a fuck just scribbling on their face oh yeah did you see the lizzo thing from the Lakers game know what you did you feel that I've never been here for an earthquake oh we're do we're due for a big Wow that's why everyone keeps saying they said that there was a recent shift and one of the tectonic plates that uh they it was the first time it moved in 500 years the other place that I was thinking of moving to was Bozeman Montana you know why Jamie cuz it's right next to Yellowstone so if it blows it blows right on your fucking head wait if the like the geyser well do you know what Yellowstone is it's like I got like a bunch of water I heard right how much much much much much more than a continent Destroyer is a caldera volcano they didn't find out about it until satellites wait is that the geyser oh it's way more than a geyser okay the geysers there but the geyser is a result of underground volcanic activity cool cool there's a supervolcano under Yellowstone that's so fucking big that when they first saw they didn't know what it was and then they realized it when they started looking at satellite images that it's essentially what happens when a volcano just completely explodes and the mountain disappears and it becomes like a crater yeah so the whole top just blows up and happens every 600 to 800 thousand years and the last time it happened was about 600 thousand years ago oh they have thousands of earthquakes there and you want to live there great place to live yeah it's beautiful oh it's great out there I wanna make you want to be there for the explosion well I feel like if it blows you want to be there because you don't want to be one of those people eating people oh that's true you don't yeah I never that's why I never understood like shelter bomb shelters and stuff like that yeah prepper no no I'd rather ya I'd not be I'd rather not be around if an asteroid hits you wanted to hit you yeah you literally want to see that giant city size thing just coming straight at you yeah it was your eyes and let's see what happens when you die yeah I don't want any shrapnel yeah I want the full the full ashed right to my face there's been a bunch of super volcanoes I've killed people there's one of them that we were we were talking about um what island was that Jamie there was one that happened somewhere around I think was Indonesia where it killed most of the population on earth where they were it was about 70,000 years ago they were down to just a few thousand human beings Toba Toba was that near Indonesia am i making that idea Sumatra yeah so where were the thousand come for them yeah great coffee well the thousand a few thousand people other places other than that yeah because what happens is you get like nuclear winter yeah with the entire atmosphere gets filled with volcanic dust I think it's freezing cold blocks out the Sun animals die look at that bitch whoa seventy five thousand years ago but look how pretty it is now no but I mean when you see mountains that's the result of activity you know that's a result of plates moving yeah shit moving upwards weight with the people really trying not to care the Lakers game last night Liz oh oh Jesus is that her yeah what is she doing there actually I went to the game last night and she wore this t-shirt that had this big hole in the back and she was just wearing a thong out of it my theory is that she forgot underwear and then cut and she was like I can fashion it out of this hole but I think that's calculated she first of all she's sitting on a seat right there right there and her butt is on that plastic Delta courtside seat well you know little Duval you know Lil Duval he had a great point he put it on his Twitter page he said how come when little skinny hot girls wear no clothes everybody gets mad at him calls them sluts but when big giant girls I don't think he said big giant girls I think he's just a big guy out of giant he's like one big girls when big girls dressed like that everybody celebrates I well my biggest problem with it is it like it's you'll see all these women I'm sure being like she's just confident she's confident and I'm like why does it still have to be like it doesn't matter it's still wrapped up in women like needing to feel sexy to feel confident right all right like right or you can just be a really good artist no no to be confident you have to be you have to stick your ass out yeah super important yeah it's a very important people do when they're confident yeah it's like when baboons when they're in estrus look at it they're dancing around well you also got to remember she's only been getting a lot out Jesus Christ hmm how long's she be getting attention for how's it been that long I feel like I've only known about her for like a year yeah so this is all new you know yeah looks like she's got an old iPhone who said iPhone back that up Jamie that shit had bezels on it look see the bezels on that phone back up look at that see that see the top see the bottom she's got an old iPhone oh I do yeah you might be one of them weird people like to do it as a choice I just don't want a bigger phone oh okay my pocket I get it they're coming out with a new one a new iPhone that's a real small one yeah four inch one you caught a lady phone lady tired of fucking staring at their screen all day maybe it'd be like less interesting are you one of those people that wants to get into like flip phones again no I have thought about getting a flip phone but the promise everybody iMessages me yeah and then that gets I've switched over to Android before it becomes a disaster you miss half the messages Apple fucks you they're trying they're trying to keep you from switching over of course it's genius figured out the blue text to the blue bubble carries status yeah you know you don't want a green bubble just like like what's wrong with you like what are you doing yeah or you were one of them tech weirdos like deep deep deep in tech like you use Linux oh yeah yeah you're just like coding all the time yeah like you have your own like you may like your own phone program yeah what do they do with their phones when they they don't it's not jailbreaking you do that with an iPhone but you do something different with the same thing yeah I thought it was a different name cuz I don't think it's jail I know you mean like there's various words for it depends on the boot loading yeah did something like that so basically what they do is they erase everything off of the phone start fresh with a clean version of Android great then they add their own skins and he had their own loaders and whatever makes them happy launchers they have launchers different launchers which launcher are use and think I really geeked out because with Android you could change everything yeah I don't care I went back and forth I tried I tried Android to see but the the Apple experience is smoother yes mother experience I have a friend who only uses an iPad and it only can only get messages when it's connected to Wi-Fi well yeah it's very frustrating when you're trying to get a hold of that person have a friend and does that too it's just like your friend Ari Shaffir I mean Ari does it - yeah but the yeah it's the same kind of thing oh I know another guy who does that - I bet I know how you talking about maybe yeah he does but yeah Ari I mean he'll go well Ari is an addict and he knows it he understands it and I respect the fact that he made a proactive move yeah - like say look this is this is fucking dumb I have to figure out a way to not stare my phone all day I'll just get a flip phone right then he was like texting with the thumbs doing that t9 thing fun oh yeah he has an iPhone too like literally iPhone - he does it is it's the second generation iPhone it's hilarious he pulls it out of his pocket like what is like like fuckin receipts and diner matches it tells all areas not just hilarious as a comic but hilarious is a human character he's one of my favorites heat everyone snow I also do like a joke check and you'll get this weird text from him that's like mmm hey does anyone have anything about raccoons and cats eating flags or something you know it's like it was the combination of like it's like a mad lib you're like no I've I've not heard that one before I guess when you're a guy like him - if you're writing joke jokes all the time like everything's a joke joke yeah like you never know if you heard that before like you don't you're like your memory only holds so much of course and and he's like I mean his joke he is all punchline yes that's all it is but a bunch yeah and it's great it's fuckin the best but it is one of those things where it's like yeah does anyone have jokes about like s'mores and hot-air balloons it to me to me he's the most underappreciated master of our age yeah you know he's a like legitimate master comedian and you know he doesn't get the kind of love that he should like from the general public because he has zero marketing right zero anything other than people saying he's awesome and people seeing him be awesome yeah you know and he's one of the rare guys that got sober and got better he really did and also helped bring candy to the club every once in a while which I love candy so I'm always happy they'll just bring bags of candy to the cellar every once in a while and I'm like I did want a little baby Ruth yeah she's the best everybody loves him like nobody will tell you they hated tell ya I've never heard that once he had this one there's this one story of him doing crowd there's like a group of like Latino women in the front and mean-mugging the whole time just arms crossed like every enough that comics were talking about it you know like after they're set they'd be like yeah but then there's these women in the front we couldn't break them at all I tell gets onstage looks immediately at them and when she goes he goes oh why so sad did Selena die again oh my god that's funny but he has that like laser vision where he can just he like sees it in the crowd he has the perfect reference for it holy shit that's funny oh my god that's funny it's David have to laugh at that you have to you can't not oh my god that's so funny did Selena die again holy fuck oh my god he's one of the greatest for sure like legitimately one of the greatest ever just doesn't get enough credit but there's a lot of calm in that in comedy right now to like I mean he's been around for decades and should definitely be like widely loved who else um but like some of the younger guys - it's like you know like this Mark Norman's a morale Dan Soder just had getting some it's just like I feel like they're all underappreciated you know like they're guys that are like great joke writers you know and it's like hard for them to sell specials now cuz it's you know oh people are like you're a straight white guy is that real I think it is yeah but isn't like um I mean there are straight white guys what's that that fuck John Mulaney he's straight white guy he has characteristics mm-hmm he does he he looks nice he's presentable he has a small dog you know but I'm pretty I'm pretty dressed as well yeah yeah stylish stylish very good comment I think your timing yeah that's right it is they were gained the old days will have a gay old time oh now I just want to see a gay Flintstones remake should do that be inclusive bigots we're gonna remake all these shows let's let's do it gave ones like if you think back like Fred Astaire and things like that yeah if there was a guy like that today you like that poor guy come out of the closet of course you would yeah you're just like you're just like no he's just a straight tap dancer fuck is a straight tap dancer sorry straight tap dancers yeah Savion Glover gotta be straight tap dancers I mean they must exist but but white ones white straight tap dancers I mean mmm I don't even know white guys tap dance any was a few there's like four yeah my parent my parents used to live outside of wilkes-barre really oh shit yeah but it smells out there it yeah it cows right there's a so in town it would either smell like chocolate because of the factory or poop cows or chocolate yeah boy that's a confusing way to grow up yeah it really is how many people live in Hershey I think it's like thirty thousand you get about thirty thousand deer around there too yeah a lot of deer we have a damn bull for deer hunting Oh day off school yeah it was always the Monday after Thanksgiving that's when deer season started thanks for being a lot of anything I bet yeah oh yeah you want some I got something I'm good right now okay I used to eat venison and baloney like how doesn't boloney's delicious really good yeah yeah you get used to eating wild game and you start preferring it yeah I have a lot of like a lot of people I know that hung out there they're bow and arrow hunters yeah which I kind of appreciate that that's what I do yeah really yeah that's all I do hmm I haven't hunted with a rifle in years do you have to wait for a long time for things it's harder it's more nerve-wracking it's more difficult to make a good shot it's uh it requires way more practice like you could if you know how to shoot a gun like if I had a good rest with a rifle I haven't shot washout a rifle a couple months ago but if I hadn't shot a rifle like I shot an elk once when I hadn't shot a rifle in a year yeah and all if you have a rest in the rifles on the rest and the rest is steady all it is is about trigger discipline just squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze boom let it go off on its own just don't jerk the trigger keep the crosshair on the animal and it's not not that hard right but bow hunting is like a lifestyle it's a different thing for the guys who do it it's like when you eat snot like I we ate elk last night in my house I shot that elk with an a bow and arrow in Utah you know like I was there I saw everything I cut it up do you Barry yeah I didn't butcher it myself but we quartered it it means you take the legs off and the back straps off and you take all the big parts of meat and then I send it to a butcher and they'll make sausages and cut it into yeah how do you get the elk back to California cooler tastes like freeze it I'm not playing yep yeah Yeti Yeti coolers they have these things called a Yeti hopper so it's like a bag like a big bag like about this big and you can get two back straps in there from an elk elk back straps like you know elk so bigger yeah animal I just love the idea that there's all these people on planes with like yeah they're going to LA with a little dog and there's just like elk meat and storage overhead you put in the overhead yeah yeah wait for real for real you have elk meat a hundred percent but that's great that's our variable yeah well you have to look if you I could either send all of it to the but what is your security are they like what's going on do you know you got an elk yeah I mean they know only places like Utah they're used to that yeah this makes me so mad because I had an Alexander McQueen purse you know ones you guys know Alexander McQueen purses right you're familiar with the line they have ones that have like rings that you like you put your hand through and it's like a bunch of rings attached to the purse well I brought it through security and they were like no you have to check this because it looks like brass brass knuckles oh come on so I had to check my McQueen purse my little quilted patent leather McQueen purse so dick well Tony Hinchcliffe tried to bring a pool stick we went to this is what's this here's what's really crazy we went to Phoenix this past weekend we're working together and my friend Scott Frost has a shout out to Scott Frost has a place in Tempe this big pool hall Scott's like a big-time gambler pool player a professional pool player very famous guy in the world of pool and so we were gonna go and play at his place and so Tony brought his pool cue and in LA he didn't even check it he just walked right through security with a pool cue pool kills totally illegal to bring on a plane so we're walking around LAX and I go hey man you have a fucking pool cue with you he goes yeah I go how did you do that he goes I just walked right through what because yeah I just walked right dude that's illegal you can't have that he goes I'm pretty sure it's legal now so on the way back from Phoenix they were like what the fuck you doing he's like I'm just gonna bring the pool cue on the plane it was like no you not go check that shit so he had to go back out we had to hold on to his bags he went back out he had to go back to the counter and check it and come back wait why is it so illegal cuz you shoulda brought someone to death with it all right I was thinking poke [Laughter] you somehow get into the cockpit you're just fly to Miami no it's a hardwood club basically oh that's yeah I'm dumb that's a better that would be a better way to use a weapon how many wants a Steven Seagal movie alright but there's so much stuff like that like oh yeah well they sell glass bottles yeah inside the terminal which you could break oh yeah yeah I didn't have a glass weapon right but but don't they hold those wouldn't you have duty-free don't they whole long that stuff and then you get it later and buy glass bottles of like like sparkling water in like in throughout this thing I think you can yeah you definitely can buy a bottle of water like a water bottle but can you buy like a boss bottle I think so I've never seen one I think they have the little glass sparkling ones I might be we might both before should hear ya let's write it out I brought a big fucking knife once on a plane really went right through security at LAX again without big know my friend Jocko gave me this night shoutout to Jocko and gave me this knife and I had it in my fanny pack and I just went right through security yeah it's a fucking click a big hefty knife yeah and I was like whoa I got got back to my place and you know it's like I was in my hotel room that I noticed I had I was like holy shit well look I'm just getting cited when I can get hair product through what's the rule on hair products well it's supposed to be under whatever three ounces but everyone's now I'll forget or like I'll be like running late I'll throw in like the full-size bottle and luckily a lot of times it'll be like black women though I'll be like Oh see you know if it's mine go ahead okay thank you so much oh my god fucking terrorists it's so ridiculous and also it's hard to find you know the right hair product there we're gonna let people bring knives again they're gonna let people bring 4-inch knives and they were gonna let people bring pool cues but then I think something happened and there was another event oh you know what it was you remember at LAX where that guy shot one of the TSA agents like who came to LAX a rifle and shot a TSA agent that's right when that was going down then they locked it down so if I was a conspiracy theorist I'd say they don't want us bring in little knives and pool cues so they shot that guy the false flag I mean it it's logical though I can follow the logic it's just the what they can't what you can and can't bring is crazy like how come you could bring a skateboard I could beat someone to death of a skateboard oh yeah I'm waiting better than a pool cue yeah also it's like you couldn't just have a bunch of 3-ounce things that you combine together yeah make a big bomb yeah yeah you have a bunch of 3-ounce things in an empty tub yes empty tub for nothing why does it have a fuse you don't know this is poison yeah all right could be anything Yeah right like those little - you could definitely take something and I probably yeah I don't wanna give anybody any ideas because if I what if I did say that and then someone did do that see there's a lot of people that are really crazy and not that creative right no no yeah yeah they like there's just like I've only there I knew a way to do this like use your brain but like the shoe bomber that fucking asshole now everybody has to take their shoes off yeah nobody took their shoes off before then he had a bad Shuba it was terrible yeah but he was trying to light it in front of everybody didn't even do in the bathroom the fucking idiot is that what you do you light bombs if I was gonna light a bomb I'd let it in the bathroom yeah I would slide it flush it and then no and then start walking like like you don't even know what's happening like action movies where the bomb goes off behind you yeah yeah do you just walk let's walk down the aisle you're just hoping someone instagrams it at the right time do you like oh we're all gonna die but also what a good post but also hopefully your phone is really durable yeah we did get this amazing action fuck yeah it's a it's a weird thing that that everybody gets super super checked flying but you don't get super super check when you go to the mall you don't get super super checked there's all these other places where you don't get super super checked yeah I mean I feel like there should just be metal detectors everywhere how hard is it to get on the train very easy yeah I do I take I love an Amtrak three tons well I don't have any but yeah yeah I could poison through poison um you know only if I'm trying to kill somebody but yeah you can just get on you can get it you get to the train station if you're there like a minute before the train leaves you'd get on the train there's nothing they don't look for anything you just hop on you hop right on you ride the rails you get to look at the beautiful scenery I love a drink I do love a train we took a train Europe I was with my family in Italy and we took a train ride they do trains really well it was great it's beautiful sit back and watch the countryside drink a diet coke it was wonderful like in in the UK they have like really good service on trains too if you take one of the Virgin Trains or whatever they come through and they're like they have snacks they have imagine being like in the Old West times when they had those really nice first-class trains everything across the country yeah chocolate chocolate chocolate and like everyone's dressed like a gentleman and lady yeah and you're just like you everyone looks beautiful everything's velvet yeah velvet yeah velvet was classic they really liked velvet why was that anything I think I probably just felt soft and maybe it was expensive mmm it just showed that you were wealthy and then all the stains do you know that they used to use beaver pelts to like line the inside of their hats really yeah like that was like a big thing like beavers would line inside the hats and there was something about the inside of hats that they used mercury and the mercury made people go crazy yes bad idea that's where the expression Mad Hatter came from Mad Hatter yeah they came from people not knowing that mercury was poison so putting mercury in their fucking hats this is how like I'm just I'm just like yeah I'm pretty sure that's true 100 percent believe you I think it's totally true right I definitely think someone told me that on this podcast I have my hard drive is so over full so over full like I run into people and I go oh I know that guy might fuck he was on my podcast a month ago of course I know like literally it's like I'm forgetting everything I'm when I was just getting old something crazy yeah all right so this is the explanation I just read on this corrosion dr. zorg which I don't know the validity of it but so it was camel hair that was used as the felt material hmm in order to soften that up and speed up the softening process they would use camel urine to process that mm-hmm so as that became more popular the French workman that were doing that would use their own urine to soften it some of them were being treated for syphilis what was mercury low that would then bleed into I believe to some problem how did you get some syphilis piss on the inside of your fancy hat sounds like a lot what you get for having sex outside of marriage still gives you the clap what fuck they might have even used the mercury to process a bit and skipped all the pee process but that's the first the first paragraph says it was urine that did it and then that's crazy yeah I mean I think I'd rather wear my own pee family yeah or dude with syphilis yeah you ever see people the pictures of people needs to die from syphilis no way to go you get holes in your head oh yeah your nose falls off it's fucking horrific people develop a big big holes in their skin like there's this one guy Lyndsey Fitzharris that's her name right she was uh she's a woman who got his amazing Instagram page and she specializes in ancient medical procedures she shows you the horrors of ancient surgery right and one of the things she was showing us was photos of people who died from syphilis is terrifying Oh terrifying terrifying like I just don't even know who became doctors back then they were like I got this crazy idea that'll get rid of your blood and it's just more some people well that's where wigs came from you know like when you used to see old like rich dudes wearing wigs that's from syphilis people had syphilis here's like father's lady's face is falling off from she shouldn't be a whore yeah well you know what look at that one down the middle leave that guy in the middle with his nose that's from syphilis and he's still alive yeah or is he dead they're nice dying mm-hmm it's not still alive today okay he looks like look at his right eye his right eye still nor his left eye still normal like I should have fucked that or I'm just like god damn it I can't believe I got I got a fucking hole in my head he's like he just keeps walking around being like it was worth it yes I came so hard fuck this base but the wig thing came from France it came from that's why I like the expression big wig mm-hmm the more money you had the bigger the wig you got and it all came from these royal guys I think there were cousins who's royalty but he had syphilis their fucking hair was falling out so they had wigs made and so because these guys were the shit they're like basically the male Kardashian's of the day okay everybody started copying them and people probably a bunch of other people had syphilis as well the hair was falling out so they all got wigs so when you see like a bunch of people in the old days that were in court and how the the judge and everyone would wear powdered wigs all that started because of syphilis you know that's first of all hilarious to think that everyone was like in court man they're like so how's your syphilis they barely knew what syphilis hole in the head I just lost all my hair but look at this wig I'm pimping there's also do you know you ever watch like British crime dramas yes they still wear those wigs for court for court yeah I'm basing I'm I'm basing British crime dramas on what I think they actually still do in Britain I wonder if I feel like they do it on TV they must still do it they must in court wonder when they stopped doing it over here when they don't like to eat enough when was the last guy wore a wig fuck you I'm keeping it who is the last guy who kept the powdered wig over here yeah oh my god that is crazy those are terrible wig those are not even kind of wigs it's like a little carpet well yeah doesn't look like anybody's head looks like a sheep that's like a really well cared for and groomed sheep it like when someone loves their sheep and they brush it my uncle's a sheep farmer for real for real in Pennsylvania in Ohio really yeah Wow yeah these guys these guys this is today they're Tories yeah what's a Tory is that a lawyer it's one of their parties look at the fucking look at those guys wearing those stupid wigs and everybody else is modern behind them and around they're just wearing a wig but they also pull out their phone what's that white bowtie they have to uh a little white bowtie what's going on in the back of his head the guy in the far right what is that looks like a tail like he's got a rat tail is the guy behind him picking his nose I hope so yes yes yes yes you're correct that's why you don't get a wig sir fuck picking your nose what happened to the picture accidentally dragged it oh yeah like so this is fairly recent I mean it's modern color photography yeah we're not 2019 so so look at the old picture down there the the painting the Farb the bottom of the screen right there yeah that that's what they used to do look at these weirdos house like my hair oh hey it's got a syphilis scar on his face he's got a whole way it was cheek oh god we still probably everything got actual back then had to be terrible disgusting the smells oh there's so many smell but people get horny enough they don't care about smells that's why dudes in prison fuck dudes they get to a point like who cares god I can't imagine well it's like you only we have standards until like you get desperate you have standards until you don't have options yes yeah that's perfect wait you nailed it you have standards until you don't have options yeah that's true it's like people get we'll do these guys until what the hell African judges still wear wigs I just kept scrolling they started getting weirder this is this might be some social justice warrior stuff click on that why African judge is still wearing wigs is a glaring symbol of British : well of course it is yeah but also if they still want to wear anyone on the call with stop it opinion Brittany or whoever this is it's look how they did the top though they're kind of like fluffed out the top and made a little different yeah I have their own twist to it yeah we gotta put your own style but I guess like having a judge wear like today why do they wear those stupid fucking robes those are outdated we're making fun of wigs but we're not making fun of these goddamn wizard robes they wear the robes are weird too like the Supreme Court they show where the robes what are the women where they wear that look at this guy hey what's up that guy looks like nice watch Fat ring I think they do they wear the robes so that you can't tell like if they're beating off yeah I can't tell them a boner wear the robes to symbolize that there's something special but they're they're much more important than you I was thinking was like to hide any sort of affiliation to anything mmm that would be the charitable way of looking at yeah I think they wear the robes because they're mr. Kaul like they're the ones who they have control of the law right we understand bang bang bang they have a hammer I would be a terrible judge cuz I wouldn't be able to just I wouldn't just I'd be like no I just don't like this guy there wasn't there there was a bunch of those shows what they were trying to do them with comedians I actually did a pilot once way back in the day where it was like a comedy court and then I would love if we had comedy court the idea was that you gonna bring people in with like disputes like you know you stole his records I kind of shared and then I would have to make a judgment and the judgment actually would stick those people that had like small claims they would go there right and they were I think Don Marrero did one too I think Don Marrero did a pilot for one of those there was a few of those floating around for a while I think it'd be fun if we had comedy court now but like in the way where a lot of us comedians got to decide if you get to stay in comedy or no no no you've been doing too much social justice stuff you're you're you're you're barred for the next six months yeah back to writing jokes if you criticize someone for something and then we can pull up you doing that exact same kind of joke like if you if you get real social justice see ya about a bit and then we go Olek at this ten years ago you fuck yeah you did the exact same joke I mean that's what people do on Twitter all the time yeah they're just like favorite it's so great because people like you I can't believe you do this so racist and then of course minutes later it's like again so are these times you use the n-word 2012 well back in the the early days of Twitter no one totally understood what it was but for me it was I was still had a day job and I used it every day I just wrote jokes yes all of the time just like constantly I'd read news stories and I practiced joke writing I had five followers and I was brand new to stand up you know like it was nothing and then it became a place of importance and I was like I got a delete oh no this could fuck me and then you got a wonder like like today people just store and wait yeah they'll store and wait for you to get something Oh Comedy Central once give you a show my what if they know about this piece of shit come on yeah well it's it's also back then no one understood what it was right like they didn't understand what they were doing so it's like you thought you were talking shit to friends right it's Ashton Kutcher was like the first first guy was Twitter yeah like what we didn't think no one knew and that was during like the heyday of Punk'd you know we didn't know this was gonna turn into a thing where you know it would cause like a what was it the spring rebellion in Egypt or whatever like you remember when it would be you're at like at Michelle wolf is eating pizza like you would say that you would use a weird way of communicating you wouldn't say just stuff you would always say that thing is doing something right it was real weird like Jamie Vernon is working right now right like that would be a real tweet it was like a status update yes yeah yeah it was weird and then you know somewhere along the line it was this guy touch my tit what what happened yeah I became like and then I was like news like if something was like a you know some breaking some rebellion in some foreign country people reading updates and do you be paying attention to Hong Kong yes holy shit the videos from Hong Kong they have not stopped yeah they're still going strong the thing the crazy thing is like you you heard a little bit about it in America and then when the NBA stuff happened they were finally like then then everyone heard about Hong Kong and you were like wait it took a basketball to get this to make the news and even then it was still Sports Center well was people didn't want to criticize China look at that look at that fucking photo so I gotta say again shout out to China is as soon as the basketball start stuff started happening the next morning they were painting over murals and taking things down I was like these guys do not fuck around what was the controversy it was one of the it was like a GM or something from the Houston Rockets he tweeted something in support of the Hong Kong protests and China immediately was like nope no more NBA we're not putting it on the TV and the thing is a lot NBA players have like huge shoe deals and like other endorsement deals in China and like they might have an entirely separate shoe deal in China that's making them millions of dollars and so the players were sort of like let's backtrack on this a little bit did backtrack right yeah rights are not that important what's really important is Nike listen I got it China is at least a little bit upfront that they don't care about human rights right like like here we kind of like gloss over it we're like it's like we go like an extra step to pretend that we care about human rights but we're not the best yeah either we're not the best but where we might be the best of the big countries I don't know who's better Canada Canada maybe but they're weird they have human rights like yeah you're not you could get in trouble for saying stuff yes well you know that kid Mike Ward you know he does that comment comic yeah yeah he just lost his case or he's supposed to pay thirty five thousand dollars because he made a joke about there was a kid who was sick and everybody donated money and then like a bunch of years later the kid was still alive and he made a joke like can I get my fucking money back how's that kids still alive obviously he didn't really mean it it's not a statement he's not saying this like right he's being funny he's an a stand-up comedian yes what he does and they fucking sued him and they won and so this has been going on forever Mike was on my podcast two years ago three or how many years ago Jamie I don't think it was at this spot was it I think it was the old spot it was a year ago okay so it was at this part and it was still going on and he just recently lost so it started I believe two years before that so it's been going on for several you and Ari actually talked about it in 2016 or yeah yeah I remember there was one year at Montreal that people were talking about yes what's a big deal I mean Canada is weird there was another comic who got heckled by this they were in I think this is in Vancouver and there were a yuck jocks I think they've been making this up I don't remember where it was but some was on stage and this lesbian couple was half they're heckling a bunch of comedians he got up and called him a bunch of dykes and said some crazy shit to them and they fucking like heckles out of context are so funny it was lesbian come up in two days you know people get drunk and they yell stuff out at comedy clubs and it was disruptive and so that comic wound up having to pay money to that that comic got sued I think he lost I want to say it was a lot of money I want to say it was like $100,000 or something crazy crazy yeah it's like I don't know I don't like any time a comic is taken seriously yeah well in that time see the thing is heckles it's like is this comedy anymore like what's what's going on here is there someone just if someone's yelling at you while you're on stage they're disrupting your work right and then your job is to make fun of them but if you just decide listen you fucking fat slob yeah oh my god called me fat like is that funny no are you fatty Long's case study one does the same topic because hello guys race is a race where are you even that was a joke right no not serious you know why you learn one and because wherever that dude was in Thailand they want some dope cars yeah we're told make you do think I'll give you this track totally cool promise their windows don't break never seen Kyle Dunnigan of face do you know Kyle yeah I'll swap videos with Ilan yeah holy shit they're good I love everything Kyle does he's the best so funny the best Instagram page by far that one of my favorites is when he does the what's up chicken buddy and he plays his daughter and he plays this like weirdly effeminate probably gay dad and he's like always gossipy about like celebrities and stuff like oh my god it's so funny so perfect and his Caitlyn challenge the best yeah as Caitlyn Jenner's that's the coop DeGraw yeah I love you know commie central this how fuckin goofy they are over there they were gonna give him a show you know like a Face Swap show he's gonna do a face watch a little been the best fucking show on her Network yeah but they were so bad in terms of like cutting controversial stuff out he had Caitlyn Jenner fucking Donald Trump like she was riding Donald Trump you know cuz he does a great Donald Trump too and he showed it to me I was in tears he an tears he goes they cut this I go what he goes they said no to this I go no he goes yes too controversial you can't make fun of trans people but you're not making mocking trans you're mocking people I think you're lifting up trans people she's she's fucking Trump I think it's a pretty good look for a trans person you know something worse look yeah yeah I mean and I think he she was a Republican yeah yeah my favorite part was when uh you know there was the whole thing I was you know when when all this was going out and she was winning Woman of the Year mm-hmm I go do you understand that she's against gay marriage and gay friends mom are like what I go do you understand this yeah do you understand this did you just I want you to stop and pause before you decide this is a hero yeah I want you to look into this is a moron you have a moron who just happens to be transgender and just because she's a famous moron does not mean she's anything other than a moron yeah yeah she's still she's still not good know her fucking this is her response why are you against gay marriage well I guess I'm just kind of a traditional girl she really said that I traditional girl this is where I wish we could get to with some of this stuff is that you can be like yes you have I appreciate and respect everything about you being able to be trans do not like you you're still it's not because you're trans there's nothing to do with you being trans I don't like you as a person I think you're a bad person I don't know if she's a bad person I just think she's kind of like but that's where I wish we could get to know where it's like it's like no no you can it's about being anything whatever the hot-button issue that you are it's like right no you're just still a shitty person well this is where the the loophole has gone into women than sports yeah that's where it's gone in and this drives me crazy it should drive you crazy it drives me crazy too yeah women biological women are getting fucked yes they're getting fucked over and they're not getting fucked like Trump with Caitlyn yeah they're getting fucked the worst way and they're finally starting to step back the Olympic weightlifting the the people who do powerlifting tournaments they stopped it they won't let transgender women enter in and pretend to be a biological woman anymore well there's one thing that like women have to in order to like fight this correctly women have to admit that men are physically stronger than us and they are 100% our men are stronger than women but that's a crazy thing to say that's like admitting that women can have babies and men can't it's like these are biological facts whores but there's the thing like I mean I've gotten into fights with people about Serena Williams and they're saying like well she could be any man and I'm like she literally can't she can't so last time she I'm not saying she's not great but she's amazing she played against the man he was like some guy who drinks and like it was like rakes 600th was like drinking whatever he stopped her and she's still lost and this was back a couple years ago when she was like really at her Pete yeah it's not fair this all the time it's like I love track right I but in high jump the best woman in the world right now is jumping about six feet seven inches the best man in the world is jumping seven feet 11 inches that's close yeah it's close enough let him put like you know also jumping six seven my friend Graham when we were in high school he's an architect now yeah jump succeed room 617 he was a good high jumper you know like he went to a d1 school for it but like he he would have been a world record holder if he was a woman the world record well that's happening now you're getting world record holders now and weightlifting in particular yeah were there trans women yeah it's ridiculous it's ridiculous it was in fighting for a while there was a girl who was a man for 32 years became a woman for two and then started fighting women without telling them that she's to be a woman yeah and so I came out against and all these people were fucking mad at me I mean dozens of articles written about what a piece of shit was and I was like whoa because I didn't understand how far this whole PC progressive culture had gotten in terms of like completely off the rails and not looking at things accurately I was like come on you got to be objective I'm not saying people can't be trans but what I'm saying is you can't not tell someone that I'm by the way I'm a hundred percent for a woman fighting a man if she wants to they weigh the same and she decide only it's smart man he's very dangerous yeah but some women ken is a woman who's fighting for the title this weekend Germaine Duran to me she's a perceiving find the video during remainder anda me fucking this dude up she's a beast but she's a multiple time world kickboxing champion Muay Thai champion she's a fucking Savage and she's fighting for the bantamweight title this weekend in Vegas is her this is her fucking up a dude see now this she just calculated ly decided that she was a better fighter than this guy and knew that he look at this fucking this dude up and please try and he still clubbed her in the back of the head there yeah dangerous fucking dangerous he's getting in trouble for clubbing her in the back of the head but she had a boxing match with this guy and fucking flattened them how is that guy ranked I don't know I don't know the specifics behind it but it but it's super risky for a woman to fight a man yeah but she wanted the challenge and I've completely supported go to the worship flattens them see you like this Judas swing it's fucking dangerous but she's a super high level fighter son out go the lights you just got flatlined by a woman kid watch that again back that up again but it's this is a you're talking about a guy who's just the Schmo I mean not a bad fighter knows how to punch but that's a world champion so I'm if someone wants it like Jermaine Duran to me once do that I wouldn't say she couldn't do it you do whatever you want but the idea that you can not tell someone that you were a man for 30 years yeah I got into a conversation with this on Twitter back when I used to get in conversations with people okay and your life lady actually said this to me she goes she's always been a woman and I go even when she fathered a child mm-hmm and she goes even then I go we're done we're done we're in crazy town now you're just making things up I mentally yes maybe she was always a woman mentally but physically yeah you weren't so yeah it's the same thing like son mean mentally what does that mean I uh I guess I wish you felt inside that you are always supposed to be a woman who's amazing the wrong words anyway but now she's a lesbian so she's into women yeah I mean it hello it's such a located like I and the thing is this is what bothers me is that you can't even you can't even question or have any discussions around it it's we're just like no I want to know and I want to be better but I need help understand even the language I want to be better yeah better be better best but yeah I mean like I don't like yeah I want people to live whatever way they want to live yeah but help me a little bit here like I I don't know and I don't even know how to look it up online you can't you can't it out loud - yeah they find out what you're searching yeah come for you know take a wolf pounce yeah now you can't have you can't have another special because you googled are you allowed to be a lesbian literally have gotten massive blowback on their careers because of that yeah you know because of questioning whether or not trans people can fight I mean Ronda Rousey got a ton of shit when she was saying she didn't think trans women should be able to fight regular women and mmm I mean theological women whatever you want to call it doesn't say regular woman yeah piece of shit of course she is a regular woman everybody so angry and there's such a mob thing too it's funny because these are the people that don't want bullies it's like the same people progressive people are the ones are like anti bullying more yeah bully each other you can't be woken up you can't because they're just feeding off of each other like I used to have piranhas okay and one of the things that happens with piranhas is when one of them gets sick the other ones fuck them up they cannibalize each other all the time it was weird what an animal is so crazy like one of them you seen one of them how a little slight will wiggle to him wrong and they'd be like okay yeah they eat him fuck him up I'd come home and half a piranha be at the bottom of the tank okay how you fucking creeps I'd have to scoop it out I had a hamster that ate the other hamster what I had that happen when I was a little kid yeah there's like wet tail was like a disease I don't know the weird thing to walk home to when you're five yeah her name was fluffy and she was eating her babies in here but we came on she was like a bloody fucking baby she's holding on the baby's head is this her hamster there was no Google back then so now what is happening here I guess I got to go to the library and look this up in the encyclopedia the baby's head like it's a fucking ripe tomato oh so disgusting it was so disgusting was burned into my head I was like seven years old like holy shit yeah but um how did we get to that woke people and piranhas paratus yeah like that's what they're like is like when one steps out of line when even when woke people they don't say hey you know Sheila's a good person she just misspoke and you know and she was like I'm sorry I didn't really mean it that way it came out wrong and everybody's like that's cool this is what's important kindness that's what's important no it's like fuck Sheila and fuck white people and fuck the patriarchy and fuck it goes from we support you to burn it to the ground burn it can have nothing anymore and everyone's trying to stand out as being like ultra progressive and hardcore with it so everyone's like making these hard stances on Twitter where it's like it's so aggressive I think though that my theory behind it is that we've always liked as a as a human we've always liked to watch people die whether it's figuratively or literally because like we used to do gladiator like when people got the headed or like burned at the stake that was like a thing yeah like everyone came to that from the town and they were all just like yeah because in that moment your life isn't as bad as the person who's getting burned right right and I think that's what people are people just want to feel powerful hundred percent they they're there online and they're like oh I can take down this person and it's like did you really do anything today did you really just destroy someone's life who was trying to be a good person yeah you know and like I mean I don't know go after companies using plastic or something like that yeah no you're right it's the there is a thing to that right when anyone steps out of line publicly and then people start attacking them this is not like a personal issue to them right it's not like this person that did this thing it's like really affects your life but the amount of energy that people put into it and the amount of time like when people want to go dig up those old tweets and want to find out things that you said or you know and and this it is similar to that feeling of watching a public execution right everyone's so excited for it to happen like they're just they pile on they'll go on your Instagram leave tons and tons of like terrible comments oh yeah it's like okay good did you really feel does that make your day better what are you making a face for Jamie what's bad I just from something dark talked about this about hamsters eaten they're the last public hanging there was 20 I was like a huge media event like 21,000 people travel to Kentucky to watch it happen there's a sea a white woman hang a black ocean she was the local sheriff she didn't go through with it because of probably the attention so some eager volunteers did it and while this is all going on there's like a media circus people are eating hot dogs drinking lemonade camping out overnight is a huge event and it was 1936 oh boy what did they say he did I was looking for but setup there he scroll up it said he was wanted for the rape of a seven year old woman that was the woman go scroll up scroll up a little higher a little higher a little higher there it is okay yeah see des des confessed to the rape and murder of a seven year old Lycia Edwards a capital crime under Kentucky law and one that fell upon the local sheriff to punish I could appoint the deputy sheriff to deputize any citizen to spring the trap Thompson told reporters as she stoically resigned herself to the role but to do that would inflict an unpleasant job upon someone else so she's she decided this disgusting job she was going to do it and then decided not to and then she couldn't do it not a good look the woman throws anything post-slavery post 1865 there were so many crimes that people were arrested for that were nothing where men were being forced to do labor so what what it would happen was because the fact that slavery was now abolished these men would be loitering right and people didn't know what the fuck to do like imagine you were slave your whole life you grew up a slave and then all sudden you're free like you're like what the fuck yeah what do I do well they would just arrest you yeah and then make you do hard labor in jail for nothing yeah they that's they essentially figured out how to make slavery legal and it did it for decades yeah I mean these don't sort of do it today sure yeah I mean when you make a guy work in jail for a dollar a day whatever the fuck they pay how was that not slavery yeah we given him gruel what are you giving them white bread and fuckin shitty meatloaf what are you feeding him it's one of those things where I'm like we we get so mad at like such a lot of the current stuff that's happening with like who what we're supposed to be saying you know like the right pronouns to use all that stuff and it's like yeah okay I'll try to say the right pronouns that's a pretty easy fix how about we go back and like kind of correct some of this 400 years slavery and oppression that we did for black people oh is it because it's harder to do like pronoun solvable problem save them is easy yeah captain pink hair I think the real problem is these communities like they've never recovered like places like Baltimore there's there's certain communities that have been the same forever and South Side Chicago is another one right there's these communities that they're just they're fucked with riddled with crime and drugs and so many people in and out of jail and this constant recidivism rate yeah you grow up there you're you're in that system like they would have to maybe in a terrible public well like sure you have to work gangs as early as you can drugs I mean the people that are heroes in your neighborhood are drug dealers so what do you how do you fix that boy there's no effort put to that in terms of like like like a systematic national effort on the federal level to step in and do something to these communities and do it on a scale that we do in other countries when we bomb the fuck out of them right and also just admit that we're racist like when apartheid after apartheid happened they had like a date look there was a couple days of reckoning or whatever it was called where everyone went up and they were like these are the things I did really yeah these are the things I did um these are like the laws I broke and it was like this like terrible like cathartic admit to your racism and then let's try to heal after that and then we're all just like no we're not racist and I'm like well some people are racist but what's racist is that these communities suffered under a system that was completely imposed because of racism right in the 1800s and then in the early 1900s and during the civil rights era this is all I mean that that there's no denying that it's the echoes of at least ancient racism that needs to be somehow another addressed but I mean how do you address that like people some people want reparations and like the idea of it makes sense right clearly someone profited right there are to this day there's corporations you can trace their money back to slavery right right well seems like they should pay so yeah like if you look at a giant plantation and they used to have slaves and they profited off those slaves and that plantation is somehow no they're still in operation today right I don't know if that's the case but if it was like where'd you get your money yeah what'd you do and then how do you go back giving it back how do you get back will you give it back - yeah do you give it back to the ancestors of the people who were slaves and the problem is like if you give people money I don't think it fixes the problem I think to fix the problem there has to be some sort of we beaten this horse to death on the show unfortunately but and then I don't have any solutions no one ever has one I don't know what it would be but I think there has to be some way to clean up communities and I don't know how you would do that I mean I have no idea how do you how do you go to a place like South Side Chicago has more murders than Afghanistan mm-hmm I mean it's bad they're fucking bad if I'm making that up I don't think so I think you're right but but that's the thing it's like this is such like an unsolvable problem and the stuff that people go after on Twitter or like the social justice stuff is so easy to do and it's like yeah of course that's what you're gonna like you can have a hard day or whatever a shitty job you have and then you come home you see someone got mad at something or did something wrong and you get to be like yeah this person you're cancelled yeah and then you close your computer or whatever or you watch people retweet it and you're like you're like I did do something today I'm an activist yeah yeah I contributed yes contributing yeah it's a weird tool you know I mean it's a great tool sometimes like Twitter is great for just getting out information letting people know about something you know you find something but I use it mostly I find cool stories like if I read some cool article that I was reading some article about China has made pig monkey hybrids China yeah and they've successfully made these pig monkey hybrids and you know they look like they didn't show they showed a picture of a pig fetus I'm pretty sure it's just a regular pig fetus but they weren't they didn't stay alive very long the ideas they want to get to a point was it Pig human or Pig monkey I think it was pig monkey pick mine you tweeted was Pig we've heard about yeah how's Joan says they're doing Pig humans I bet he's right guarantees right do they do Pig monkey and then just like a little baby boy is born but I think what they're trying to do is develop pigs they're their hearts and a lot of their organs are very similar to ours mm-hmm and their digestive tract is very similar to ours like there's certain tests they do on how things are digested and they do them through Pig stomachs people they do a lot of transplants with pigs man - yes so I think that's the ideas eventually get to a point where you can get harvestable organs from pigs mm-hmm you know so they'd have some sort of a pig human hybrid but you know someone's gonna fuck one someone's gonna bring it home and I mean get some pig lady walking around for you it's kind of a human vagina yeah John always wait where does that saying come from like a drum like a drum pull tight okay sorry sometimes I'm the dumbest person in the world I'm like I'm looking I was like put dress up like a pretty big hole in the back no you're a hundred percent right tight like a drum is a dumb way to describe a vagina for sure yeah yeah I don't think it but I guess it was like a weird covering yeah over a vagina like a like a Mason's fist like a yeah like a stonemason someone's carries bricks every day and as fast wrong hands like yeah but if you can get a pig with a human vagina well that's what people fuck sheep right there's not the whole deal with sheep supposed to be like real close they say probably in Pennsylvania - I mean I'm sure Pennsylvania carried away when people get you know again what you said no options no standards yeah if unit yeah if you found out that no one was looking we don't fuck sheep because it's gross they fuck sheep because the Sheep is that high and right there yeah what about that poor guy who's the exact right height for a sheep perfect like I don't even have to bend my knees at all the Sheep likes it thank you who's the victim yeah yeah maybe the Sheep was like maybe the Sheep keeps like she keeps nuzzling up against him like like like a Liz oh damn so yeah that's that guy's defense in court he's just like no but you've got a look at this video you can't tell me that sheeps not into this here's a video of me entering into the pen now look they're all back towards me backwards yeah they all just go right one of them is buying I'm pretty sure juice it's a ridiculous thing the people fuck animals but animals fuck people too yeah you know you ever see dolphins dolphins get a hold of people I've seen a video of that here's one of the dolphin link came upon a woman trying to fuck her there was an article it's the best it's the best trolling that has ever been done to me there was an article that said I was guilty of bestiality Oh said wolf guilty of bestiality and it was from my hometown newspaper the homeless town son and which is a very small newspaper there's like three or four people that work there I think but like it said that I was guilty of bestiality and they did so much research like they got they got like the paper the right paper they got like all this information about me and then the surprising thing was at the editor article it said I pled guilty and the fine was $1,500 and I was like it was it was about fucking dogs that I was fucking dogs and I was like well if that was what I was into $1500 like it's kind of worth it how much money you have and how big the dog's dick is yeah and I was also like how is the dog is the dog fucking me what is it like a peanut butter situation I think there's videos like that that existed before the internet there was a video I think was called barnyard Betty as me and my friend Billy and my friend Ron we went over their house and it was in the basement I remember one of us had a guard the door okay someone came into the basement was old VHS tape so they put they put the VHS tape on and one of us had to stand by the doorway to the basement just to make sure that nobody opened the door and busted us and we watched this fucked-up video of these trailer trash looking meth girls that were blowing donkeys and having sex with dogs one of them had sex with a German Shepherd it was so gross there was an episode of nip/tuck where that happens like Clara's remember that show there was a woman she put like peanut butter on her vagina and their dog would like lick it off oh that's real how that was all the time yeah and I was like I was like this is I remember I was kind of younger and I was like that's a weird thing to put in TV with a dog bites yeah Tom yeah I was getting greedy it seems like a dangerous situation yeah if you had too many dogs like you sound like one's not enough I want to whatever happened that nip/tuck show I don't know I think I think it went off the rails a little yeah it was one of those shows it started out real good yeah after why like wait what what the fuck's happening here yeah like yeah yester went way off the rails like it started out like wow this is kind of cool show cool idea a guy was like a good guy serial killer huh yeah and then like four seasons in like hey what do you do who wrote this one with that I was I loved the show scandal I mean it was I mean it's just a I mean it's it's not actually a great show but I really did like it and the first couple seasons like this is great this is great season three and four I was like this is crazy and then like the end of it I was like okay they brought it back around but well the term jumped the shark came from Fonzie jumping over a tank full of sharks yeah people like it get the fuck out of here what is this what are you doing have you ever met Henry Winkler I did actually he might be the nicest guy alive he's so nice I saw him at the Emmys last year and he introduced himself to me which I was like this is the craziest thing I can't believe you know who I am ah that's weird right yes one famous knows you and I was like this is like I mean Henry would be a fucking Winkler could not be further from the Fonz character yeah like super sweet really nice guy he wrote a book called I've never met an idiot on the river it's about fly-fishing yeah he loves fly-fishing yeah apparently and he just wrote a book about like fly-fishing a lot of people who really like fly fishing it's fun yeah yeah but it's weird there he is the Fonz Oh he'd jet skied over the shark yeah I don't think this is what it is he's popping up he's skiing in a lake or some maybe that oh that a leather jacket yeah I think it's more unbelievable that he'd wear a leather jacket waterskiing then jump over a bunch of sharks well how about he's got it in between his legs look at look how he's doing that go back to that original picture that one you just had to figure - yeah but that's black and white that's too artsy right there look it he's got it in between his legs that's the pole wait that looks like he's really doing that yeah I bet he is Wow don't work Henry I mean they didn't have CGI back then he kind of had to do it right yeah up until the point where it actually like flew through the air and then they got some rugged Brad Pitt from once upon a time in Hollywood type dude is that the show it's jumped at that moment has not jumped the shark as memes and stuff yeah but it's crazy that it was such a bad episode mm-hmm that it became like symbolic hey of a show going off the rails yeah show jump the shark I like a good two season show mmm like I love I love a miniseries I love things that end to watch Mazal know I wanted a little bit of it okay here's my problem with it I don't think the jokes are funny mmm well it's contextual yeah and I get that but it's like I don't know I just have a hard time boo better listen I've been watching a lot of Lenny Bruce over the last few months I found this one Lenny Bruce channel on YouTube it's got all of his old old clips from various television performances and they don't make me laugh you know I know he's the best I mean it means right I mean I won't say he's the best but he's the Godfather of this thing that we do you and I both do right he's the guy that started he really is the guy who who started talking about shit instead of just telling jokes he started like talking about social problems and why is this and relationships and sadness and all kinds of weird stuff I mean he developed a whole different kind of style of stand-up comedy but it's not funny because you're looking at something that happened in 1950 in 1960 it's just it's so hard for it to translate comedy unlike anything else loses its that or its power over time they give you and listen to like some even like Redd Foxx or something like really great old stand-up this is not that good I don't know though I do think there are some jokes that stand up sure sure I think there's some people that do it that like even you know 50 years from now people will look back and be like that jokes still funny oh yeah well he had some of those Lenny Bruce had one joke that many comics have accidentally told since then mm-hmm because they didn't know any better but it was about gay people that being gay is against the law is a key it's a against law dig so they put you in jail with a bunch of guys who want to have sex with you right it was great yeah back then it murdered I mean back then it was just a fucking nuclear bomb no shit that's what you imagine being in the audience and hearing someone talk like that for the first time like cuz like the best comedy I think is things you you didn't like as soon as someone says it you're like I have always thought that yes you know they're just like vocalizing something you were never able to kind of put together yes and that had to be that yeah in that audience then being like people were so suppressed then I mean that's the other thing about Lenny Bruce he went to jail multiple times I mean he was arrested multiple times for telling jokes yeah just like just kept doing it didn't give up didn't safe well this is obviously not smart right he kept doing I kept pushing the envelope George Carlin same thing he went to jail for it - that's real stand-ups though you know like you know real stand-up ones that are just like you know I have to do this yeah if you don't do it for like a week and people and you're just like crawling out of your skin also the audience is ultimately supposed to be the judge of whether or not something's good and if that's not the case then we're losing personal freedom we're not asking someone to like you know you know like someone's not going onstage and saying you know I'm going to advocate that you murder someone here's their address we're all gonna do it together let's meet up we're not talking about that right we're talking about someone cracking a joke and the audience laughs and they enjoy it and today even today when when people get upset about someone's stand-up set and they try to cancel something and listen to the audience right was that was the audience laughing well they know it's a joke right they're at a comedy show so they know it's a joke and they were laughing why do you have a problem with it you're not even there so you have a problems look at women in Saudi Arabia you got against a you fucking cowards yeah again it's hard yeah it's easy like I hate anytime like I I'm in favor of a comic tellin whatever jokes they want and then like the only way you're gonna know it's funny is if you say it out loud to an audience yes and it might not be funny the first thousand times you say it until you figure it out well that was my giant issue with comics that were going after Louie after that set was leaved the only thing people should have been mad about that is that the set was leaked yeah that should be that should have been like you don't know where he's gonna end up with that he's known for doing huge premises that you disagree with and then he convinces you why he's right in a very funny way and tongue-in-cheek yeah - I mean it's not like you really thinks that someone pushed a fat kid in front of a bullet and that's why they're talking in front of CNN he's he'll figure out a way to make that work this is his first time doing stand-up in ten months yeah like let let's see where the joke goes but you know that and I know that means that's what we do but there's a lot of people that don't even understand the mechanics of creating a joke that right like a lot of times you'll go up and you'll have a premise and you're like kind of fucking know there's something that he might eat shit with that joke for a couple of months before it really starts really starts catching years maybe even you know like there's I there's always jokes I've had that like now I'm coming back to because I was like I wasn't ready to tell it then and now I'm getting back to it I'm like okay maybe this direction yes yeah like it's especially the heart of the premise like it's kind of take awhile people have no idea how hard it is to write jokes well that's our ease entire new hour he's doing you know his whole new hour is is called jus and it's all you know he grew up Orthodox Jewish like in you know he had to go to Israel and take religious classes all day studying the Talmud fucking 1012 hours a day like he was doing the whole deal and his whole hour now is about this and we had talked about him doing bits about that years and years ago he's like I wasn't ready as I my stand-up wasn't good enough yet I didn't understand how to craft a joke yet yeah and I mean it takes a way out and get there and especially stuff that's personal like that to you and like you want to do it justice you only get to tell that story once onstage and then once you do those jokes hopefully they were good enough because you're really not gonna get to revisit them yeah for you to go back over you're like hey I put an album out 10 years ago and it kind of sucks so I'm gonna redo all those bits yeah please don't go back and listen to the week after you see the second version ya know there's some premises I would like to go back redo yeah oh I could have done so much more with that I feel like sometimes though I feel sometimes you can like you know you can show a kind of your evolution by redoing sure some stuff a little bit but you can't I don't know yeah you could show you evolution you could do whatever you want look Jerry Seinfeld still does old jokes yeah I mean they're perfectly good jokes wrong you mean he's done that a couple times for specials yeah did he do the Netflix special and an HBO special I'm telling you for the last time I think that was HBO right that was all his old stuff yeah and I think he did a Netflix special that was very similar it was like he went through his old notes like yeah yeah and I think now I think they made a multiple special deal with him or something like that and now he's putting together his new one yeah yeah I'm dying to see Eddie Murphy yeah I want to see him work out I want to see it work out there was a rumor that he was gonna be at the store and we were all freaking out we're ready to go down there was a Sunday night turn out to be Damon Wayans but there was a rumor that a legend to me he's like one of the most unheralded of the great comics from the 90s yeah and but he was actually really funny - I saw him recently at the lab in the improv so he hasn't done stand-up or anything in a long time and so he started to go and do it again and then there was this rumor that someone some star who hasn't done stand-up in a long time was gonna do stand-up at the store in the belly room and everybody's taxed and everybody is fucking Eddie Murphy going to the goddamn comedy store is that really happening great and we were all gonna go down there and watch but it turned out to be Damon I I'd love to see Eddie working it out yeah I want to see him first time onstage I want to see middle I want to see like the middle yeah I want to see you in a couple of times like see though I was like words out of two months in and then like six months in or how I'm think he's gonna do it I hope so I really wanna I mean like I I don't know I mean I I we know what his early stuff is yeah he had this whole life yeah and I mean I think part of it is he sees Dave just like destroying and I I hope there's like a little competitiveness in him where he's like he's like I got it I gotta jump back in yeah he still looks great yeah he looks so healthy like I don't know what he's doing but god damn it that black don't crack not a lie I mean look amazing he's he's got to be close to 60 yeah and he looks 30 yeah he really does how old is he 58 okay let's pull up a recent picture of Eddie Murphy pull like when you saw him with Gerry in comedians in cars getting coffee he's driving around with cherry he looks great yes and Gerry because we're Tyler right yeah he looks like like in Beverly Hills Cop he's like he's just thinner there's just young and I don't mean thinner that he's fat now I just mean he's like Bob does he's both that I'm a man yeah yeah he was a it was essentially still a child that he's so healthy looking yeah he looks fuck he's doing do that the photo I mean he might be 36 yeah he does not look like he's almost 60 I mean let me get Tracy who those gold chains those are preposterous zoom in on those gold chains again what what in the fuck Tracy that's out of Walmart money we're at the cellar and Tracy Tracy brought jelly beans and he was like he was like yeah talking about the jelly beans like we don't have access to them with our money you know like but I can't do any impression so this is gonna be the worst Tracy Morgan you ever heard of he's like I got jelly beans who else you know good Brooke jelly beans and then he's like eat him eat jelly beans he makes like all of us eat jelly beans and he goes not to green ones what is what are those emblems one of them is Jesus yeah that's a TM on that okay Tracy Morgan a big TM a plate and then I can't tell ya what is that one the back hard to tell find that bitch broke that fucking thing has got to be heavy you might that must hurt your neck yeah it's like a bike chain go down scroll down there with Eddie Murphy with that beautiful young lady scroll down scroll down scroll look at that yeah dad's girlfriend I think if there's a white partner whatever oh well he's um divorced right isn't he yeah look at that I think she's had a baby Wow still fertile yeah 85 years old she was hot she looks very actressy hot slim waist nice booty congratulations Eddie but look at me he's fucking almost 60 years old it looks amazing look at him this is amazing yeah whatever he's doing health-wise incredible this is what I want of all people in Hollywood who like look like that I'm like just tell us what are you doing tell us what you're doing I know we probably can't afford it well I could probably can't afford it but like tell us what you're doing so we at least have an idea but there's some crazy shit behind look at that fuckin picture look at that picture right there like as your water from a different place him vitamin this is him for dolomite right oh yeah he's doing press almost 60 years old he looks like he's 15 years younger than me at least I'm looking side-by-side in the screen now not bad trust me bro I'm pretty healthy but I party a little too hard like he's got like oh he's got like a little wrinkle right here like a little crease in his face he's a little character lightly makes him look a little bit better something that he only has one earring sign of the times right oh yeah one diamond earring he's like I'm not gay gonna have two weeks that was that's a big fucking earring to boy that is a look at the size of that earring that's like a fucking quarter million dollar earring Dimond it's good it's a big diamond big-ass Rock for your ear he had done well he's done why I don't know if you've heard about it and you know he did a thing a few years ago right when Cosby was starting to get into trouble when I don't know if you saw it but he did like this thing where he was at a panel and he was receiving someone warrant he started doing a little stand-up and talking about them taking away Bill Cosby's awards and Bill Cosby's uh his his was it was a yeah yeah I've set in 28 years and I'm telling you his he was so sharp did you see it no I remember I've watched it back then I can't really remember what he said it's really I remember watching it back then and I remember like this guy two weeks on stage he'd be fine yeah like you sharp if he had material he's fuckin sharp yeah sharp his attack I mean how great did you know his brother did you know Charlie that I didn't I mean a huge fan of his as well he's the nicest guy I love that guy that was a bomber that was a huge bummer Charlie and I did a tour together in like 2007 we did like 22 cities you travel together for the whole month like the whole month together he's the best he was so nice he's so cool just just a fucking great guy yeah I was a big fan of his too and a guy that was basically a famous person first and then started doing stand-up which is the hardest way to do it it's definitely the hardest way no one wants to believe you know you're on stage and people like you're famous you see you're a plus act that I paid money to see and you're basically an open mic er yeah and people paying to see you yeah so he started out he would host that's that is a very smart way to do smart dude he would host and then he would you know slowly work up enough material that he could do a set you know and he was older guy yeah good one that happened I mean was deep into his 40s when things really started clicking for him might be an open mic ER and famous and in your 40s no I mean at least then though you have it life experiences to pull from yeah you hear a lot of these people when they're like you know some people start in their teens and they turned out to be you know the best in the world Dave Chappelle no but other people start in their teens and I'm like have some life first what are you telling jokes about right you know like I mean like I had like I had a whole career before I got understand how old were you started I started in 2011 so I was 26 25 26 what was your you we were saying your career you were talking so I was I started in finance I used to work on Wall Street I got a job at Bear Sterns I'm so that's the wolf of wall show I'm still trying to make it happen but I I started Bear Sterns in the summer 2007 and then it collapsed in March of 2008 and then I stayed up with JP Morgan for a couple years after that but I wore a suit every day I worked with like mutual fountains and separately managed accounts when do you think when did you when when we were thinking about stand-up were you thinking about in the beginning well so in March of 2008 a bunch of friends of mine this is like before Barrett collapsed a bunch of friends and I went to see a taping of SNL I have always been such a huge fan that afterwards I was like how these people do this like how do you get here and I googled them and they all started in improv so I started doing improv and I did that for a couple years and then even at my first improv class I was like whatever I just want more of this I'm like and then I eventually got into stand-up after that around 2011 but it was one of those things where I was very much like you know like a very type-a get good grades try to get the best grade in the class type of person and I didn't really develop opinions or a point of view mmm and so when I started doing improv I was like you know like you make choices and you you know like and then more I got under stand up I was like yeah how do I feel about these things like what do I think about them and like really just like I don't know it's just that's how I that's really when I feel like I started becoming a person Wow I don't think I had a personality before that I wonder if I would have been as curious if I wasn't a stand-up if I'm like how much of my curiosity is because I started getting curious about things because I wanted to be able to talk about different things yeah like I I'm definitely much more observational in the world than I used to be but I'm also I might be a little like darker too like I remember thinking when I was a kid like I thought about what my wedding would look like as like a little girl and now the idea of having a wedding seems ridiculous like the idea of me and like a big dress walking down an eye like there's none of that I could take seriously but if you were gonna get married how would you do it I would just go to City Hall really yeah well and then have a party or something maybe later I don't I don't know it seems weird it seems weird to have a party right after cuz you're like let's see if this is gonna stay you're gonna have a legal contract with someone especially you now because you don't want to that rose in bar Taman or old type deal you want to play some dude off yeah now like imagine yeah popping for you you got some guy who kind of like gums with you on the road becomes your tour manager no way yeah well that's the thing that would never happen to me though because one of the things I find most attractive is a guy being really good at something so I really go to Pina tourmanager always has the best hotel rooms waiting for you yeah it's like there's like every time I go in it's set up exactly I want to stocked with great [Laughter] yeah I think well that's the case with most women most women I think like guys are good stuff yeah yeah it's really it's rare that you see like oh yeah I mean we want I don't know it provider someone who's what you want successful jeans yeah that's really what it boils down to one attractive jeans women want successful jeans or they want well they want someone attractive jeans to they want dominant genes like a big man big tall man yeah good features good symmetry yeah and all those things are genetic it's normal yeah I've been working on this new joke about how women we like we're attracted to the exact thing that's the most dangerous to us like we like those men and so we make more dangerous men mm-hmm like we could decide to just only mate with like short soft boned men and make a whole generation of like killable killable men and women would be like yeah we're the ones in power but we're not it's never going to happen yeah but that would have to be a real conscious decision that's yeah against evolutionary biology it would have to be like women have to be like first of all we'd have to get women to agree on something which is it yeah no but then also like yeah you'd have to be like no this is the law like a reverse handmade thing there's nothing reverse handmaids yeah like we're gonna out breed all the Goliath yeah all the gorillas all the savages and barbarians cut them off every once in a while like a baby's born it's like at that height like height and weight is too high and they're like we've gotta get rid of this watch them hold them in the tub yeah oh that's not wise cuz China's not gonna do that China's not gonna use CRISPR and develop Hulk babies we're gonna need we're gonna need the might we're gonna need the muscle dum dum dum are you worried at all about something like that you worried about a war with China everything with everything like Russia China like I've been hearing this term hot war you know like we're involved in a cold war with Russia we were involved in a cold war with Russia what it might be hot war bullets oh yeah I mean I I don't know if I can imagine us getting into a war like that again but I do worry about like like hacking like more of like a what's it called soluble yes I bro why I think that's much more likely it is much more likely but goddamn if there was some sort of like a real attack from China or from Russia I would be more China than Russia I think the what up from what I understand Russia does not really have the money they have you know they have a military but they don't have the kind of military that we have it's pretty big drop off from the United States to what Russia has but they're scary enough and dangerous enough that we have to keep an eye on them China ever since nuclear weapons came about people are like yeah let's not do those kinds of wars and yeah we still do them in Iraq we still did in that past Afghanistan we'll still go in if there's air quotes insurgents right yeah and you know we need the oil yeah oh no I was getting a little low no III were i ho think about I think often like what if there was a war and they had to put the draft back in and then I think about all my guy friends and I'd be like well first of all I don't want them to fight like cuz I like them but also can you imagine like mark Normand like as a soldier he's a pretty fit guy he's very fit but I can't imagine him like killing people you know like I can't imagine him on a battlefield he'd be probably make snarky jokes I can imagine re killing people I can imagine re giving the other soldiers some sort of drug he'll for sure he would definitely dose their water supply guys I noticed obtuse find the reservoir today a lot of fun like well who out of your friends you think would be a good soldier um well I think Dan Soder would be a good soldier he's a big fella he's a big guy and he's also just like a football player he was a football player I mean he's a he's the teddy bear but he's also I think for the right reasons he'd be like I would kill them but it would have to feel personal to him personally yeah the commies I don't think it's more fun to thing about the view I don't think could do it like like there's no way Keith Robinson even before his stroke was getting into a war but after the stroke man he's got less to lose no he's even now now he'd be like he'd be like I'm out I got a stroke look at me I can't walk I can't fight has he had any recovery of his motor skills he it's still pretty much like not super usable yeah but he gets up on stage every night jokes are probably funnier than ever his stroke material is like really really good really yeah wow that's awesome yeah and he's he's one of my favorite people to sit at the table with because you sit down you're immediately making fun of each other right you know you're making fun of everyone else like it's just jokes the whole night people don't understand why that's so fun for us it's to shit on each other it's it's so much fun it's one of my favorite things to do it's one of my favorite things to about comics I shout out each other it's fun and it also it's good for you yes it's healthy to like get shit on to you laughs and like know that you could laugh you're so people who can't laugh at someone's shitting on them they're the worst the worst the worst yeah it's just like we're just having fun I thought so like it allows us to say this stuff it like cuz Cummings will say pretty much anything on stage but there is a line where we're like no this is for only other comments yes yes there's often times we'll be in a discussion and we'll kind of look around and be like guy heard any of that stuff we were talking about having sex with midgets I don't think any of us are gonna have a career anymore yeah if someone put like a hidden camera and a hidden microphone in the back bar of the Comedy Store oh Jesus yeah really really what I'm trying to shock other colleagues shock road hardened veterans because our problem is that like we want to say the funniest thing yeah and normally that's way past the line even past our line or you're just like no I have this sober October group text that I'm in with Ari Shaffir Bert Kreischer and Tom Segura and it's fucking ridiculous yeah sometimes it's sober it's sometimes it's so ruthless and so ridiculous there's no fuck I'm in a few of those texts yeah we test every text with other comics are the best it's so great I also have a group text that's with a couple of my female friends and like that one I'll look away from my phone and then I'll look back a minute or two later and there's be like 96 texts then I'm just like what happened and there's three different conversations going on it's really like a being being friends with women is a lot of work mm-hmm it's like you prefer being friends with men I I love being friends with men I also love being friends of the women because there's stuff that they you can talk to them about that just like either you can say to men but they're not gonna have the in-depth that's discussion about it that you want it to happen you know like women bulges and all II indulge each other and be like but how say you know like oh he put a period like was there a period after the taxes like yeah there's a period well then yeah I don't think that's good yeah just left it open maybe it's casual yeah you know how many times have you had a conversation when someone just writes something like sure yes look what does that mean I do it all sure me I do it accidentally sometimes I'm like yeah sure oh no I don't want say yeah I'll just say sure right do you want to go there sure okay she's mad yeah she's mad sure yeah sure my sure sounds like a fight is about to happen yeah sure sure you always decide you are another that like more aggressive would be fine fine yeah do you want to go there fine Oh fine yeah fuck sir I'm in trouble fons on a lot I travel fines not good you go to pick her up she's not smiling like what are we doing should we do this should we stay all right if you want to fight let's just do it now and not wait till we get to the restaurant fine the fuck does that mean I also think it's good for men when women have a lot of female friends because like oh good for the other person you're dating or married too you should want your girlfriend to have a couple female friends so that she can have the conversations oh yeah with like the more I think about relationships the more I'm like no many women like your husband and wife shouldn't be having all of those discussions like he doesn't want to hear it he doesn't want to hear it have it with your girlfriends and then just talk to him about whatever else like yes I couldn't agree more it's it's an unrealistic expectation go on double dates on my wife and her and her friend and me and it winds up being two different conversations I could stuck with the husband and she's talking to her friend like oh my god so cute oh my god did he say that oh my god oh my god oh my god I just have these these rambling girl conversations I go hey hey let's have one conversation yeah I can't do this two conversations things yeah and it's like it's so it's so nice to have like the girls just to be like yeah I get to indulge the girls side of myself like that's that's a thing that's a real thing it's a real thing yeah yeah they some some people want to pretend that men and women are the same thing this is I think that's such a detriment to both men and women like saying that women are the same as men it's like well we're not but also why do we want to be right why is that happening why is that even the standard right like just let women be what we are yes and men can be what they are and then there's some people that do flow in the middle but like well I think it all gets conflated with equal rights equality equal rights equal laws equal you know willingness to try different jobs those kind of things yeah and then we decide that men and women are not any different and these are all cultural creations and these are these are things that are concocted by society right and I think I mean I think it's kind of it's bad for women when we say well we're just the same as men because it's like you're saying with that sentence that men are correct and when you start finally start to think of us as men as the same as men now we're correct - I like to say is that men and women aren't math I think we're not equal were different things yeah it's not it's not an equality thing you make all the people like there will never be equal to you you make every fucking human that's ever made is made in a woman's body exactly this this whole thing though is weird to me because I'm like where'd this come from this didn't exist before the equal rights thing existed before yeah but this that that it's some sort of a cultural creation that women are different than men that this is a something that society has sort of imposed on women like no women like different things yeah and like we like we just sometimes just like to be around each other which man I think sometimes just like each other - for sure you know like it's like I can hang out with the boys no problem I grew up with older brothers you know like all I ever did was hang out with boys but now like I also see so much value and just getting to be with girls yeah you should I mean it's and men do with men there's a lot of stuff that men like that women don't don't have interested yeah yeah that's okay it's fine this idea like that's toxic like toxic masculinity like all this nonsense that we hear today it's all exactly what we were talking about before where people trying to control people and define people yeah it's the same thing it's like I think that's one of the reasons you see it a lot especially online from white women because we want to have power you know like we want to we want to be able to and I mean us being able to tell other people what they can and cannot do or say is us just being like yep that's our power now we might never be better than white men you know but we can at least control what you get to say about us yeah and I think as soon as white women are like yeah we do like to have control then we'll be like thank you let's dismantle all of this you know like it's just like it's all toxic yeah you know like how dare you tell what black people how to feel about you know like what jokes we can and cannot say about black people did you ask any of them you know like I'll you see in a church I'm sure you see the stand-up shows where there's like white women with their arms crossed and then like when you start talking about race and then black people who are laughing and you're like they're like you shouldn't be able to tell jokes about black people like that it's like did you look well I think a lot of it too is people working in offices all day where they're constantly suppressed right like they'll the way you communicated in an office is so vastly different than the way a comic communicates onstage in front of a nightclub yeah it's so different that most people the vast majority of their day is under the spell of Human Resources right you know they're they have this imposed standard of communication that's it's not how they want to talk it's not how they want to behave and think like look and also men and women working together is strange it's strange and anybody says it's not strange never work with women and men together because people get attracted to each other people get petty people get jealous people get flirty people get mean people get controlling they place social games with each other yeah and I mean it's one of those things where it's like you can't even broach the subject now because people are like it's not an issue and I'm like no there are so many issues it's fraught with issues yes like let's talk about it like okay yeah there's a lot of sexual harassment that happens in offices but there's also a lot of legitimate relationships that happen in office yes like there's flirting there's one-night stands there's you know like all of this has happened you're married and have kids people people fuck for a while and then they might hate each other but they still gotta figure out how to work together that happens all the time all the time the hilarious thing is when that happens and there's a boss and someone who's below though yeah they'll say oh he abused his power and again I look at from my perspective where I'm like I'm attracted to men who are good and powerful so if I were gonna have I worked in an office and my boss was really good-looking and I was attracted to him and there was a chemistry and we started sleeping together mmm like that's what I wanted and you know like yeah this is you cancel just for saying that 100% can't say that you want to be with someone powerful and someone who's who holds something over you yeah I did fuck the janitor be a good person yeah I mean if he's really high get married now there's the whole thing yes but take it seriously it's in support for his culture don't be I'm his I'm his I'm his way in mmm there you go I do think like I do see it now and this is a weird thing but like super feminist women I do see a lot of them kind of dating like jawless like kind of pushover guys yeah and I'm like I'm like oh maybe they're maybe they're the women I'm talking about they're like no I found these short I found these soft bones men you know like jawless is a fun way to describe it they're so jealous jealous jealous men fuck that's such a bummer but really bad genes like that like oh there's not a goddamn thing they can do about that no I don't I don't think you can get a new job things you give you a jaw surgery they can like try to grow your jaw out with like the Hut you're John break it and oh I know lady we got a chant shit up mm-hmm so she got a chin implant I think they might have done something to her actual jaw itself too but it was one of those very unfortunate Chin's mm-hmm no and then she was gonna eat for like I don't know they put a piece of plastic or something where chin like it used to go in too far yeah I don't know well she told me she had champlain I was like what what you know what you like your jaw she don't like the shape of her jaw so you got her jaw reworked some of these guys should get look into that I don't think there's much you can do if you have a tiny little jaw fuck that's a bummer but yeah working with men and women worried yeah there's like there's a way to figure it out but it's fraught with complications it is and the real issue is people holding things over you in order to get you to sleep with them it's not you being someone who works or someone who's legitimately attracted to this guy and then you get together it's still if I was running a company I'd say hey don't fuck each other you assholes I'm trying to make money right yeah I don't yeah like I don't know and I can't I can't condone it legally right cuz if I say yeah what are you banging your secretary all right take a picture we're gonna say you you would have to say that it's in the rules and regulations you would have to say but it's there's no way you can tell me that it's not possible for a man and a woman who working together and the guys the boss and the woman works under him and they fall in love and they have an amazing relationship it happens all the time it does Bill and Melinda Gates Oh she worked at Microsoft hmm she was a shit bill as a piece of shit I mean he's a power-hungry piece of shit who abused his power and you can see it when you look at basically it's basically right theythey had a power over her basically no she's actually been a prisoner oh my god I can't believe this we've gotta give her half of that hundred billion dollars that he has and get her out of that but that ivory Tower of course this happened yeah of course it happens yeah it's what the real issue is someone sexually harassing you like some guy was holding a promotion over your head saying that he wants you to sleep with them or making lewd comments and make you feel disgusted or you show up to work and you're not interested in that person at all you just want to do your job and they're making comments about your breasts or your legs or your mouth or fuck oh the mouth comments are the worst there's somehow creepier than like the breast or the but it's just like your mouth oh stop at his picture and with this just fly down pants still on the problem is there's no equivalent with men there's no one thing that a woman could say to a man that makes him feel like a piece of meat like that like like humiliated you it's so hard to sexually harass men because they're in know so much of it yeah we'd like it yeah yeah especially we're attracted to you you sexually react like your boss yeah it's like you want this job you got to eat my pussy but we talking about here can I also get a couple of certification days does it depend on the performance she's like well let me see I don't know I'll give you a performance review I know you're married and I have a wife as well so we're good 30 40 50 grand a year by the way we are gonna need to get something to lock that door anyone the Matt Lauer buttons yeah but the thing is like even if so even if like a male boss even if you got everything like in writing beforehand saying like this is consensual yes you I think you could easily say afterwards it wasn't I felt coerced into it what's exactly happening with Matt Lauer yeah that's exactly right yeah that's exactly he was he was having a sexual affair with a woman that he worked with that was an even under him she was in a different department and they're still saying that he had like power over her it might be correct though see the thing is that this Rowan Farrow guy Ronan Farrow guy you know he's obviously a real legitimate journalist he's done a deep dive into these things so it's so hard to say until Matt Lauer comes out and just like has oh he has to make statements I guess on all these different things because apparently there was some people who got paid off right and it's something that like NBC denied and then he's proven there's been several different compensation payment payoffs people that were sexually harassed well I mean even when you hear like about payments you're like yeah that might mean it's legitimate or it might mean that they thought this is the easiest way to fix this problem unless you're talking about Bill O'Reilly that is yeah thirty two million you're like what did you say that's just like no we know I don't have to deal with it anymore just give her the thirty two million it's like yeah yeah and we went over it apparently there's also a clause that she has to deny that anything ever took place and then if evidence comes out she has to lie and say that evidence is not valid I mean for 32 million clear for life yeah to work again that lady right now has probably got her feet up she's PO got like like fluffy slippers on sipping tea living exactly where she wants to live happen this every now and then she just like wakes up in the morning and they just realized she doesn't have to do shit ever yes fuck you bill I mean she won oh my god she went she won 32 million dollars yeah if you live a reasonable life you don't have to do a goddamn thing with 32 million you take vacations every year you buy a nice fat new car every year you live in a beautiful house you shit you have help you have like I mean yes yes 32 what is that and just if 10% that's three million dollars a year just in interest Yeah right if you can make any money work for you you're a financial person is that real can you do that but get 10% interest it's a I mean it depends what you're invested in if you have legit 32 million in the bank mm-hmm what would you get out of that well is it just in in in what is it in the county funds and 401ks and what would it have to be into in order to get 3 million dollars a year I don't know Wow would have to be in but I made off type shit I know I mean I only ever like sold mutual funds like that's what we did like due diligence on mutual funds and stuff like that drug attorney you know it really depends like I mean there's there's a lot of funds that like it fluctuates but there's like a good 4 percent you know like 4 percent yeah that's not good enough you need to live like a bar yeah she needs more I'm sure there's higher yield ones that you could use for percents not even a million a year she needs 10 what are we gonna do we got a diversified I don't have anything in the stock market anymore because well after Barrett collapsed and I saw I literally saw people that were working there for 30 years lose everything because they lost their job and they were reinvested in the company which they say you're not supposed to do but this company like bear-like built itself on being like like loyalty and like you know like like work for us help people move ahead and then they'd reinvest back into the company you give it you get stocks like all this stuff and then you lost your job and the stock price went from 130 to $2 you're fucked did it help you when everything crashed to give you a jump to get him to stand up and go balls out no it was art for the male gender yeah because you can't say labia out that's very weird I went real it out on oh my god no it was like I was I was cheap I was cheap relatively cheap labor it compared to everyone else I knew I wasn't going to lose my job I also came up with a Microsoft Access program that we used in the department that no one else knew how to use really yes no so you kind of had your job locked in yeah but the company could go under the company could go owner but it wasn't I was still in the early enough phase that like I I had no idea what this whole comedy thing was gonna turn into and I give you motivation like knowing that all these people that did work hard towards a legitimate career that it could all fall apart on them I mean that scarred me I think in a different way where I was just like oh you can't you can't trust the stock market like that's it more put me like it didn't make me worry about like my career or anything like that like I I was thinking was too young to think about longevity career-wise and I was too new and in comedy to think it was like that could all fall apart I was I didn't assume it was gonna go anywhere anyway and but it really did like people always like well you should be invested you vietmike they're like no overtime and I'm like no I know all the sayings but if it crashes when you want to retire it doesn't matter like if you're 60 or whatever it is and you want to retire and your 401k just completely drops but then you gotta wait what ten more years to retire until it gets back up to where it was hmm so you know keep it in cash baby you know yeah you got a safe at home every now that you throw the money on the bed and just proposal how bad would that be like you're like I'm just gonna roll around this money and then afterwards you're like I gotta clean up all this money i test positive for cocaine yeah you got like you got every germ yeah if you're naked and you're rolling around with money it's the best day that's fucking gross yeah yeah I don't even like why I like wash my hands after I touch I should yeah I mean it's it's everyone's carrying it yeah so it's it's something that we know people touch it's like one of the one things that you know has been passed on from person to person to person to person very few objects like a watch or a light very few objects touched by as many people as money yeah and often and strangers yeah dirty people it's on the ground it's in a machine nice gross and the numbers of people that get dollar bills that test positive for cocaine it's crazy it's all the charts yeah they did some study on hundred-dollar bills like the the percentage of hundred dollar bills test positive for cocaine it's really high yeah yeah it's really high yeah I mean I guess it would be hundreds yeah hundreds in circulation you're trying to impress people you see that Walmart sweater they got in trouble for yeah the cocaine they're so lame didn't even know what the fuck it was yeah they were like no it's snow strong as that what's the percentage of dollar bills does it say what it's not legit fecal matter shut up of course dirty people wipe their hands with their own hands just smudge it on their dollar bills maybe they wipe their ass with dollar bills when they run on a toilet paper and then they wash the dollar bill off in the sink but do a shitty job of it pardon the pun I mean if you did run out of toilet paper solid clean it off in the sink says the flu can last for up to 17 days on the dollar but oh great hmm credit cards that's why credit card when people start getting sick just pull out the credit card that's why when I was little I ate ate dirt ain't boogers hate grass good move and I rarely get sick good move solid immune system music yeah that's what people until that was a gross child for cocaine 94 percent according to 2002 report for poop 94 percent how including on everything cuz people are gross like if they always say like there's poop like there's fecal matter unlike your toothbrush if I'm like an area of like how is it getting there but gross we're disgusting how is it popping with half and touching railings after you wash your hands like I was at Disneyland this little kid was sucking on a chain your kid chain hook it up sock it on the chain what's up I was oh there's so much that's such a high percentage 94 per poop and 80 something for Coke yeah lot of fucking people doing coke on hundred-dollar bill under different strains of bacteria for animals unjust unspecified domestic animals yeah yeah if you wanted to really spread a disease in this country spread it through money yeah I don't don't give you with that idea didn't tell about the plane I tell you my plane idea but yeah you could it would be really easy if you had like cocaine on dollars you could easily just put some sort of a fucking horrible disease on dollars yeah there was a guy last night of the Lakers game who was throwing money just one dollar bills into the crowd and people were scrambling for it and I was like this could be he could be passing anything yeah easily yeah I was like or this is a really great way to see if you're counterfeit yeah or to get people in trouble yeah eat fucking losers have ten bucks for free yeah yeah there's a that's a weird thing right the throwing money thing I'm so rich I can throw money away yeah it feels weird when you're like with no specified target right right right you know if you're like I'm so rich I'm gonna give it to a school you know be a nice thing I'm so rich I'm just gonna throw it in the air yeah it's the ultimate in frivolous spending yeah yeah I mean even at strip clubs like I can get behind it because you're like oh yeah you're paying this lady but it's you're making her scratch it all up together and yeah like she's sweeping leaves yeah it's weird I bet strippers really hate raking yeah in the fall they're probably like oh it's not even money not even money but they must get money thrown at them all the time right oh they do they would get it crumpled yeah and guys would throw it that has to be the worst flattening it back out yeah ironing yeah you're like this isn't gonna get working the vending machine that's another job where there's no male equivalent that's as humiliating because like Chippendales dancers like if a guy's a Chippendales dancer it doesn't even come with a stigma no like he's a good-looking guy with a six-pack and wants to make some money yeah puts his hog in a tube and starts dancing for ladies with cowboy boots on it's normal no one cares like hey our boyfriend used to be a Chippendales dancer yeah pay my way through college I mean it's a real testament to how much better women's bodies are like we're just like like the male bodies like I mean I'm attracted to it but like it's still just like it's not something I want to see dancing around necessarily it's a weird thing guys dancing is feminine - yeah it's like a guy's just sitting there dancing the front it's like what are you doing yeah like you know when women are dancing they're letting you know you could fuck me yeah do you know you could fuck the guy guys I'll fuck anything it's so easy I say like you want to fuck a guy be the last one there just be the one who goes it's so we're just trying to different things to like you know like yeah we like attractive men but like you want to get us like show us your cake of things yeah that's hot like your life is so fucked up to your Chippendales dancer we're like yeah I'm just like what do you uh how come you know your shit dude you're 35 yeah like it's like an accountant or something you have a full beard you should have a real job on a house like stop it it's such a different reaction to like when girls go to see men strip or men dancing they scream they're screaming and yelling yeah guys are just sitting there looking creepy guys are sitting back like this they're like oh your posture it's a reverse of roles for guys like the women are aggressive because you want to make money like would you like a dance to dance like the women who come up to you this is crazy they're coming up to me yeah it's like yeah cuz you're pinging him what do you think would change in society if prostitution was legal um I think it'd be a lot less guys that are stressed I think there would be yeah I mean I know people are probably a little nicer I think people would be nicer I think those women would finally get like like there'd be like they could have like a union yeah you know like they could not really hose and just break I want to be at a prostitute Union meeting I really do I really Jawa charging to no I'm not giving my fees the health care was not good you fucking bitches need to step could you imagine what it'd be like being in a prostitution meeting all smoking fucking job this job is fucking bullshit but there's also like one woman in like a skirt and heels who's just like we're not all like that okay some of us where the we're the classy ones like there's the classy verse the unclassy side of the room you know I think a girl who in college she was she was a prostitute but she was a prostitute like she would fuck guys she knew for money mm-hmm and she didn't want to get a job and she liked these guys they were like older married guys and she fought and she was trying to explain it and I was like okay so you like you knew the guys and you would fuck them for money she's an artist right and she was explaining the whole thing I was like oh okay well that's an argument that comes up a lot where there's there's some women who say that like no I want to do this well if you want look it imagine if you're a woman right and you're in college and some guy says I will pay you $2,000 to have sex it'll take about an hour mm-hmm versus you have to work for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and the guy's a nice guy right and you let you go okay he's like this nice businessman and you maybe would have done it anyway hey yeah probably not but either way it's not the worst thing in the world you see you're not disgusted by he's not treating you terrible right he just likes sexual pleasure from a pretty girl and you like money and then next you know Jed's a millionaire like what is wrong with that if that but that obviously that's best-case scenario right the worst-case scenario I think it's pimps and people abusing women and sexual trafficking and all the stuff that's associated with the same sort of thing that's associated with illegal drugs is associated with illegal prostitution crime organized crime I mean that's that's what the real problem is and look I have three daughters I don't want anybody to be a prostitute but if they were gonna be a prostitute I would like it to be like a legal thing not not my kids right but if you're gonna have prostitution if it was legal first of all why isn't it legal how can I do okay to fuck anybody you want but it's not okay to pay for it that's crazy I mean it's it's it's the oldest profession yeah so there should be something at this point we should go as a society hey we're not getting rid of this yeah let's just figure out a way to make it as safe touch people yeah protect them from creeps make sure you have security but maybe that's also part of why guys some guys like it because it is illegal or biddings dirty Oh God like if you look at porn it's all naughty porn that's popular now it's all like my stepsister stepmother stepbrother that's all it is it's all knotted stuff up stuff everybody step I'm not kidding it's like those are all the titles yeah it's all step step this and step that it's we really people want to be like and it's a site where see cuz porn is so prevalent now and it's so easily accessible right and it's so you just get on your fucking phone you're watching on the nice screen and your phones and Forte you stream it anytime you want so because of that we've we're gravitating towards weirder and weirder shit like to get our kink off like people have to be like I can't even I can't believe we're doing this you're supposed to be my sister I love I love the amount of time it takes to convince someone important you know yeah yeah it's just always like oh I'm not even thinking anything you're my sister this is crazy let me see it I wanted the importance that actually takes the amount of time it would take to convince that what's a slot it'd be accurate but if it's a sorry to slut-shame but if it's yeah in power you just let it empowered I don't think you shame oh yeah yeah some people like like a long drawn-out courtship sort of deal yeah like some guys like I guys that are friends with they prefer that a girl doesn't want to sleep with them quickly because this way this is a girl that is making good choices yeah especially in your 30s you start thinking about like okay this could be the one yeah you hear that a lot of times with guys like I mean that's how they always say you're supposed to play the game it'd just be like no hold out for I'm hold out for him and it's just like you have great relationships after a first one-night stand yeah I never sent I'm pretty sure it happens on it all the time a hundred percent yeah but I also get the appeal of it I it yeah I know that people like to chase it's both things are good sometimes it's good to have a couple of cocktails and go fuck it let's do this oh of course yes why else were you drinking these moments where like the universe creates like especially nightclub moments couple of cocktails the universe says it just puts those little seeds out there like you look at them they look at you and you're like what do you think great yeah Wow and then like I always think about like like I live in New York there's plenty of opportunities for that how do people in other cities you're not even cities towns like you're at a bar what are you doing like what are there farmersonly.com yeah is it all dating hours website meeting up yeah there's a commercial for farmers I like it's like a hot girl and Daisy Duke shorts like with a tractor I think please tell me how many look like that Louise zero yeah I'm sure there's hot farmer girls out there that live in those small towns Hershey yeah I know I know I know a farmer from back home he's really attractive and his wife's really attracted what the hell there you go it's real yeah they fucking work - are they work really hard for not a lot of money it's a whole that's like a whole government yeah and it's you know they have to like mine their books carefully it's I mean and then then part of its just a dependent on like the weather that year you work so hard and then office and it just doesn't rain how about Farmers Almanac s-- like what in the fuck is that you could predict the rain two years from now like they have these books where they're like back before they have like real weather satellites you're not farmers almanacs and they're accurate for the most part how's that possible I don't know it sounds like witchery yeah this is the thing like there's a lot of things you hear from back then where people got you know people said they were witches and then you're like yeah but else how did they know what did you know what that whole witch trial shit was about I don't I don't know was about her got it was about late Frost's of late Frost's a lot of like wheat in particular develops fungus and that fungus is forgot it's one of the funguses that could grow on it and a guy produces lysergic acid produces a very LSD like effect so these people were getting acid from the bread so people were tripping balls and freaking out and thinking that you know and also it's always women right it's always men burning women it wasn't a warlock it was up I bet a lot of it was men who were attracted to women and those women weren't attracted to them and they were angry and then they were on acid yeah and then they like oh my god she's a witch and then they were paranoid and they believed in witches back then they believed in witchcraft and why wouldn't you if you're on acid eating bread he didn't even know and also you're like I'm bewitched been bewitched also it's a much better excuse for your wife when you're like yeah no she bewitched me she's a witch in which there's no way women aren't gonna turn on each other immediately they never burnt them though that was that was a yeah they just drowned them which is kind of more for my favorite thing not my favorite thing my favorite thing it was one of those things where it's like well we'll load her with rocks and if she sinks she's not a witch oh that's right but then she's dead because she sank to the bottom and then we feel bad so then we're like oh she wasn't a witch let's give her a nice burial then if they put a bunch of rocks on you and you floated you are a witch and so then they killed you oh but I'm gonna guess they never found ones that didn't sink to the bottom she imagine if you had a lid back then forget about all the smells and the syphilis and all the fuckin powdered wigs then they're fuckin drowning which is like Christ yeah and then like also you just have kids that and they just keep dying oh yeah but you die you're like everyone's dying everyone was always dying well that's also the whole life expectancy thing you know where people is like someone X my friend Chris Ryan I'd explain that to me like when people think that people back in like the the twelve hundreds only live to be 30 years old right on average that's because of infant mortality exact so there's so much infant mortality and childhood mortality that it like lower that that the life expectancy yeah live into the 60s and 70s it's just that all the babies were also dying there's a great there's a book by Steven Pinker I can't remember the name of it is escaping me but it's a it's a really good book about like um oh my god why can't any of the name uh can you look up a Steven Pinker book and it just essentially talks about like how things are actually because you know people always say good old days and how things are getting exponentially better it'll continue to get better yeah he was on recently oh yeah yeah yeah about five six months ago he's great I really like him I love is well I love outliers oh there's Malcolm yeah I love that too he was on recently - he was on much more recently he was on like double weeks ago but Pinker's excellent he's just his work enlightenment now yes yes yeah he gets massive pushback on that that's what's interesting because he's saying that everything's better that there's less violence there's less crime there's less rape there's less all these things and he shows that statistically and people are like you're belittling all the horrible crimes that take place and you're enabling all these assholes to try to say things are fine and to not be protesting about all these issues like no just using statistics but he's and he's not like what it's again which makes me bad-mouthing for social justice deficit he's not saying don't try to keep making things better don't try to like yeah there are things we should protest he's just saying that like no statistically we're headed in the right direction yes and then even talks about anomalies where we do go backwards sometimes yes but like this is all stuff where it's like if you don't want to know the actual information don't get in the fight to begin with yeah and I don't look at statistics people don't want to know facts anymore they want to go based off their feelings that's a lot of what happens when you talk about women not being as strong as men with sports but yeah with sports like we're women when other people or men who are like trying to fight for women they're like they want it to not be true they want men and women to be the same as good as each other in sports and it's like because you want it it doesn't mean it's true very few people say that but with something that people do say is that a trans woman is equal to a biological biological woman and then that that that argument is horseshit yeah and that argument has been disproved by all these women that are winning world winning World Records and they say well there's there's outliers in sports period so that these people that are athletic anomalies like Michael Jordan or whoever you know people that are just supreme genetic athletes so do discount them but know that they're they're coming from a different gender you fucking idiot yeah but you can't do that like I know what you're trying to do trying to find some loophole where it makes sense where a six-foot six-man can play girls basketball right but you can't because 90% of the population that's not on Twitter the regular people are gonna go hey fuck you yeah that's what's going on right now people going hey fuck you cuz this is crazy yeah Martina Navratilova they're calling you a nigger she's a famous lesbian she's transphobic Martina and her transphobic she wants things to be competitive have a trans only league yeah you're welcome yes super simple and like people are so many it's not fair that it has to be separated it's like yes it is yeah that's why it's that's why men and women are separated well this is the argument that I got in with this guy on the show he was saying that there's not that much difference between men and women I go ok so you think women should be able to compete with men in sports he said well I'm I'm not really saying that I'm like what that's exactly what you're saying do you think that it's ok if women compete against men and weightlifting and in basketball how well do you think that would work out for women yeah how well do you think it would work out in track and field how well do you think I work out in anything it's nonsense there's a reason why there's a diff difference where we define men's sports and women's sports for fairness so we should have trans only sports that way just fucking like if there's that many of them yeah let's have trans oh you're gonna find out how few they really are else it's gonna be really weird exact but it's also it's like is it not fair like that they have to have their own league I mean maybe but also none of this is fair you know like it's not like I don't think it's not fair if they have there only I think it's the only thing that's fair yeah well and it's like none of us have had made any of these choices like I we're all born the way we're born right if you're a trans person and you were born a man and but you've always believed that you're a woman that's also not fair you know like that's like that's a crazy predicament to be put into sure yeah but that doesn't mean I want you competing with me because you're going to destroy me yeah it's not fair it's not fair we know it is fair but you're a commie special that's on Netflix right that a good segue no it's terrible stop lying what's it called again joke show it's on right now right Tuesday yes Wednesday so tonight at midnight tonight at midnight exciting yeah I'm really excited for people to see it I've seen clips of it's very funny thank you very funny thank you I'm really happy that you came on the show meet you fucking awesome thanks yeah I want I mean I think I'm gonna core spawn and center all these people think I'm just a political comic and I'm like all right jokes for any topic yeah like but I don't like I don't like telling political jokes but it was kind of cool the court the the Correspondents Dinner thing because that put you on the map yeah I'm very happy I did it don't get me wrong and I I stand by those jokes to this day jokes Thanks I got the president to tweet I yeah yeah I mean come on was it disconcerting and that was happening I was made where that when he tweeted at me I like cuz he tweeted once out of the dinner and then sometime in like later in the year like months after and I was doing like I was doing a show in Brooklyn I don't have Twitter on my phone and don't know I only have it on my computer and I am i was out in Brooklyn do shows and I was like drinking hot toddies because I think I was like feeling a little under the weather and I was like this'll fix it and I I was someone I kept getting messages about this tweet and I was like what's going on what's happening and I then I finally saw what happened and I was like well I guess I gotta go home so I can tweet something back go home after you been drinking three back at the president I'm like three hot toddies in and I'm just like alright what can I say that was your B best you said something when you fucking roasted him well we actually set it on the podcast just now no no no we actually we were calling we bleep we we said what you said on the podcast he said something about when he I don't remember the exact tweet he sent me but it was like something so called comedian did such a terrible job oh yeah I bet you'd be on my side if I had killed a journalist that was doing the Khashoggi stuff or whatever it was the yeah yeah yeah the Saudi I'm journalists that had been murdered this is what he said so-called comedian Michelle wolf by the way best fucking that is like some of the best publicity you could ever get yeah the president says this bomb so badly last year at the White House Correspondents Dinner first of all not true you can go listen to the recordings people were laughing like come on this is so crazy that you say that bomb so balli what play it back yeah let's play it back no there was parts of it where people got kind of quiet but I remember I was like first of all this is for the audience at home but also I was like I'm it's one of those rooms where you're like yeah this thing at best there it feels fine right you know like it's like a corporate yeah exactly a corporate gig yeah they will have an author instead of a comedian what a great idea good first step and come back of a dying evening and tradition maybe I will go question mark what imagine that like maybe oh god what do you think oh please Donald I have my new mega hat for that event because I don't know if he wrote this tweet though because the grammar is so perfect mmm I'm like right the - in between so and called yeah it just feels like I was like did someone else draft this could be correspondence there's a correct apostrophe to the S yeah it feels like I don't know maybe maybe dictate this one and someone would like I'm gonna spell everything right yeah well they've done various things to try to stop him this is 2018 they've done various things to try to slow down his use of Twitter and social media and I do think that there was a time when someone else was handling it ya know but now I think he just fuckin goes guns blaze and Technology adderall's in a pseudo face after it you know it's fuckin wild to see I had a dream last night and I forgot about it until we started talking about that he was that he was battle rapping and that that some woman made a rap about him and then he made a rap back at her I had a dream maybe was cuz I knew you were coming in here and we were probably gonna talk about it but if we're weird fucking dream and his battle rap was pretty good it was like pretty in people like that it's pretty fucking good like it was a good battle rap he said stuff sometimes when you're like that's like hard you know like this but then there's other times where like then you're like wait but he's the president sometimes the shit he says is hilarious when he put a fucking giant Trump Tower on Greenland when they were talking about whether or not he was gonna we were gonna buy Greenland he was I promise not to do this and he shows Greenlee with a giant gold Trump Tower in it he tweeted that that's fucking hilarious it's funny and then you're also like oh come on why are you president any time he holds up a graph of any sort I'm just like this is great there's no y access you know I think it's always stuff where you're just like this is amazing why are you president yeah I don't I don't know if there's a better person to represent how crazy today is though yeah like if you wanted to look at like okay yes yes yes Michelle wolf
