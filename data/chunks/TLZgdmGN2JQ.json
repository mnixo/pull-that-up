it's like old school Russian 3 - there's something I like about the fact that you could smoke in here yeah I like that people can be relaxed yeah I had to find a comedy club to shoot our special we're deep in the underground yeah the underground they let you smoke Wow just like a rule where if you're a performer you can get away because it's a part of your routine but get like a cabaret Oh like on them still on the books don't take my word for that up I believe I learned that from DICE while he was on stage yeah I think you read that in the dice Chapelle yeah well they just can't get away with it right yeah Dave's always smoking on stage no I I don't smoke anymore but I'll tell you one thing that that year in between like we're now allowed to smoke on stage that was a tough year because you used to like smoking in the crowd smoke and you know it was like I have a fun thing a punch line enhancer - right and Dave's you do smoke on stage not all the time like towards the end of it baby not only that but we're on the road and we do like an hour and a half he'll pretend he's getting a phone call or something go smoke and leave me on stage by myself really yeah but it gives you a chance to like open up a long-form bit now you hear that yo now you really hearing the whole story behind the pumping Mike when you behind the bumping Mike what do you get out of smoking on stage it just fulfills the nicotine fix or does it actually give you something because they say I've smoked smoked one of Tony Hinchcliffe cigarettes a couple of times before I went on stage huh and you get like a pick-me-up there's a little something you get like an enhancement all right yeah I'll say right now it definitely is a weakness that like you know now I don't drink don't do anything but like coffee and cigarettes it's like yeah it's breathing for me but on stage it does focus it helps focus you they say it's legitimately they say new nicotine is actually a good nootropic oh is it yeah it actually enhances cognitive function like if you do a test without nicotine then do a test with nicotine non-users yeah it makes me nauseous if I accidentally smoked a blunt and not just straight weed or some really used tobacco like snoop and to me something the other day and I thought it was all pop but there was tobacco and these things of the shit what is once there's a deal was it on the on the paper Jamie where'd you get these where were they that this company Hollywood's 14 other stores like these are the share these these were my favorite check them out it's Charlie Murphy got me into these things back in the day because he would roll him himself he would get those swisher Sweets and he would tear him apart and then he put the weed inside of it and roll it up oh yeah old school and then Chappelle got me into it again because I smoked one with him one day at the back of the comedy storms like damn this is he's a weird high yeah what it's like you get a buzz it's like you're a little bit high but you're also a little bit buzzy from the from the tobacco well I like it my fan whatever it takes to make the jokes fly bro yeah whatever Sherm that when they made your jacket and I'll take like one hit a weed right before we go on and we meet in the middle yeah one hits good one hit before yeah not much okay yeah have you've gone too much before no this guy got in a long long long long time yeah you feel like I'd like one more but oh that's a dangerous dangerous decision yeah you want to stay a little quick coffee though I need coffee before yeah Red Bull will make me to like jumpy and nervous but coffee will get my brain working just a little bit quicker than the audience's did you guys do this one time as a goof and then start touring with it or did you just put the idea together like how what made you decide to work together like this you know it all started out just late night at the Comedy Cellar where you know I'd be onstage and I would just see Jeff in the room and I would bring him up and then we would just you know like throw down basically gonna have a great time and you know we kept doing it and doing it and people actually we you know like they wanted to see it it became like this kind of like are you guys gonna go up together they would always ask us are you guys going up together to get the next mic go and you know really when I started living in LA or not even when I started but in the last few years I'd come back to New York I have an apartment in Greenwich Village near the Comedy Cellar and you know it's like cheers everyone knows your name you'll and you're sort of going to my empty apartment I'll go let's see who's at the cellar get something to eat and I'd start booking my flights where I'd land around midnight Dave when it would inevitably have the 1:00 a.m. spot and I wouldn't I just wanted to get my Yaya's out and he would just bring me up and he'd sit by the piano and I would goof off or I'd sit by the piano and he would tell jokes and we sort of setting each other up and organically our friend started popping up with us or people from the audience or whatever bachelorette party and we just started making an act out of it without even realizing it yeah it was like it was a lot of fun like in the beginning especially because it was like you know he really kept me on my toes like listening is like the hardest thing listening onstage you know right because once you're up there alone locked in you know like you control all like facets of the performance but when there's another person up there especially Jeff and I we we have so many different skill sets so like it was really cool to like work off of him they brought up my game a bit it definitely made me quicker and faster and funnier to have to like you know really pretty much roll with it you know and I think that the crowd dug that too it was like a different energy than just straight-up like a showcase you know the one thing that you would do on a podcast so you wouldn't normally do on stage which is look at someone else right and it took me a long time and a million arguments on looking at each other not like sports if you look at somebody yeah you're never gonna not catch that ball but when you're wondering what the other guys doing and you're kind of going like this but when I it's like it's like what we connect now and instead of doing like in tandem one of the time jokes we do jokes together that's all like that's a weird thing we're like you said twins we're twins we'll do an act and one guy will do the setup and the other guys do yeah and then they'd do a double punch line together we're hoping for that one day I feel like it's one plus one equals three you know two headliners get together by choice necessity yeah yeah but then and then Dave you know I it took a lot they did not want to go to Montreal we went up to the comedy festival and I basically begged him yeah and do it together yeah I saw it mostly it's just like a fun thing to do you know on seller yeah like it was just like a cool like you know basically like just let it all hang out but Jeff saw like I guess the next step to it so I always just thought it was something that if the comics wanted to see it that bad and then more and more comics wanted to come on stage with us and then more and more like Jim Carrey came to one of our shows in Montreal and and and and all the headliner sort of popping up with us and I thought this is more than just us as a hobby like this is something that no one else is really doing yeah I got really into it really quick and I tried to call it pumping Mike's and Dave was like no that's good for a title we don't have any other structure to our show by the way we don't rehearse he has a flip phone I can't even talk to him before the show we don't have any plan what's it's very stressful job why do you have a flip phone why I'm trying to stay off the grid dude yeah you saw me with the sword in front of the flag I'm ready to go I'm ready I'm ready to be activated no I'll tell you this is the best title for it Jeff is really a good producer and all those different things all this skill says I don't have like he's producer you know showbizzy all those everything but like I I was like we should have like really like workshop some other names like like to castel is looking for an Abbott Nichols and may i other teams out there I'm not gonna say there aren't but the thing is that like we're not really a team like we both have our separate stuff but when we get together it's like this kind of like almost like um you know like within 48 hours we're a team again you know it's always really difficult but I think we rock out in certain situations like I want to go through with you because you've done every venue now you've done outdoor you've done theater you've done casino I think we are one of the best casino acts I'll say likewise I think we really are I think at a casino we take it to the level that needs to be especially in a d-level casino I'm talking like yeah exactly they're hoping for like a you know like one of those electric poker thing like that kind of that's not woods yeah well Fox when we do rock Fox was a place the casinos cuz I guess no they let them smoke as my people right that's true about casinos right but it's also a very bawdy audience and you can sing anything you don't have to hold back at all and you know Jeff was fearless I have a filter up but he is fearless he really is actually but Chang is that place in Temecula right yeah that place is actually nice what am I thinking of I'm thinking of playing a5 what's the fucking place on the five Rudy Moreno you say oh the hustler because he doesn't that would be great we just do a that's our best one I love that which one the another one it's an old steel mill but now it's a casino and yeah Lee I think it is Bethel and we always have our best shows there so excited yeah man Joe Barry yeah mmm those weird Road gigs and the one we were gonna cancel but we never can fold in like Utah or something we did the Oklahoma right one Oklahoma yeah Oklahoma run yeah why did I did one casino one that I drove through like this crazy storms in the next one Oklahoma man you can drive as fast as you want they don't care didn't even have dry they didn't even have speed limits isn't that cool they just had to impose speed limits within the last decade or two because of the federal government they said look we're not gonna fix your fucking roads you tell people they can't go 150 miles I love it you know burse says that Oklahoma is fucking amazing yeah it was fantastic yeah I want to play there for sure but I was playing the casinos and then I met Jeff at this one it's like right on the border of Texas and you know Seinfeld plays there Thacker bill yeah Seinfeld plays there it was like a rough yeah but you know he's got it down to a science man you know fly-in fly-out that kind of thing you know we're at night we're in bed up there night I guess if you have a nice life in a nice house but I like going and looking around the local yeah places and yeah eating the local fare I still kind of love that well he's in that weird place to where I don't think he can go places yeah that's very he's walking Street you like holy shit it's my help yeah yeah it's got to be weird Joe that's what we do after the show cause we're both a little older now we we really eat that's what we do we really like to enjoy it what's your luck do you like steaks and stuff yeah oh dude you should hang with us because we hear Cal steaks counts takes two eats like well that wolf steak and shit like Game of Thrones ladies having kids they're an elk breakfast they really do I need to set up a kitchen here and cook for you guys Oh that'll be great fucking fantastic kids eat your ochio's for breakfast if you ate it you'd want to get it more really yeah what does it taste like an in the meat scale like uh a bison like a little bit more unusual yeah better than venison how do you cook it like deer venison slowly on a pellet grill and then i sear it on the outside of the end Wow yeah so your Thanksgiving must be out of control huh well this year no we just did the normal turkey thing out of Turkey and a deep puffs but he caught it with his own hands that's Jerell roof of the studio we did the peanut oil thing when you deep-fried and peanut oil makes it better yeah but it's like it's a scam how did you learn to do all this things like every time I meet you have like two other skills like how do you do this stuff you're pretty busy I need things to occupy my brain I just have one of those brains the only way I'm at peace is if I have a bunch of difficult shit that I do all the time nicely challenging myself I have to that's how my brain works you know everybody has their own weird kink my kink is I need to be exhausted I guess for your brain itself it needs to be fed my brains needs shit to do it needs things to concentrate on if I don't have things that concentrate are things that are really difficult I start playing tricks on myself I mean mental or physical both both mental and physical yeah I guess I have to have both how do you handle the time management with family and career get up early and get up early so it's morning I was up at 6:30 kids go to school there they're leaving the house by 7:00 I take the dog running I'm gone for two hours and then I come back get a bunch of shit done with the house then come over here Wow then you know hang out with you guys for a few hours then I'm gonna lift then I'm gonna go to the store and do a couple sets have a good time that's what you're doing like a 16-hour day there right well yeah but the thing is like the way it works really good with me with families that most of stuff I'm doing either while my kids are at school or while my kids are asleep so by the time I leave I have a ten o'clock spot of the store dairy asleep right they go to bed at like 8:30 however they know the youngest ones are eight and ten okay yeah so it's there it's a they go to bed you know they get up at like 6:30 they go to bed at like 8:30 mmm you know so that's perfect time for me yeah you got your own and when's the last time you just quit something in the middle I was like fuck it I can't figure this out like what a bit routine sometimes bits you just got abandon them and come back to them in a couple of weeks or a couple months or a couple of years sometimes yeah everybody has that one like great beginning of a bit and they're like where does this go and then you just keep throwing it out throwing it out throwing it out that's the cool thing with Jeff is that like no we both bring material up onstage but at the end of the day it's the stuff that just comes to us like that you know in the moment stuff especially with the audience that's the stuff that I really think you know we should give a shout out to Andrew the director capturing all that Jeff's friend who is now Ricky one of the best directors out there man he really he really you know once again it was Jeff's choice and he did the job and then some I mean it's so good the way he put it all together you know and you guys have it's more than just you guys going onstage there's a bunch of other stuff happening there's a bunch of people who drop by three three episode series oh really docu-series so I don't know if you saw the jinx on HBO about Robert Durst though no it was a phenomenal documentary on her my buddy Andrew Jarecki directed that he also directed capturing the Friedman's years ago as an oscar-nominated doctor what was that about that was about a family of convicted actually child molester math science teachers in Long Island Oh members uh based on a short that he did about a party clown whose family wind up being implicated in this crazy controversy oh that's right that's right thought that was him huh yeah Wow and I Andrew and I are tight and Dave and I were sort of going back and forth on who could sort of direct us who would know our moves but yet had the experience and doesn't like anybody that's too hip I just I like it straight ahead and I and I also think some of these comedy specials are over directed so I didn't want to fall into this whole like you know instead of like lighting the stage you guys hold lanterns you know you know you Swamp lanterns and then you know like that kind of thing like you know that'll be the essence of the humor that could happen - yeah exactly so but he really he really was cool he really was patient and he really like brought a lot of things outside of I know my wheelhouse you know it's a collaboration which is another thing you're not used to doing when you do your own special like you know you're like hey I want to do it this way I've been doing it this way and I want it that way but when you have other voices in the room and you know other ideas then you know you gotta like pretty much measure it together into something that you know pretty much I guess captures the spirit of it and also like hopefully the funny of it you know well if you got that guy as you direct I mean that's fucking incredible it looks cool and he also understood our personalities and our friendship you know I've been chasing Dave my whole career I always I was an open mic or I would go watch Dave or you know I always thought like if no one's gonna make it in our crew until Dave makes it Dave was always the one that everybody even when Ray Romano was popping on TV he would go down to watch Dave Attell you know riff and you know my first TV spot was a 7 hour train ride with Dave to like Canada you know when we were really young and I've heard three versions of this story Joe what's the first version no it's like it's like Canada or Syracuse I think now it was can it was it was a Hamilton Canada whatever we took a train from you anyway I'm just saying Hamilton it's called isn't that an Ontario I guess so yeah but I'm just saying I've been date Davis my favorite comic yeah I didn't know that until we really started working together I consider contemporary you know weird you out he's like you're his favorite comic uh a little bit you know be honest yeah but no I I see I see Jeff is like beyond unique like there's nobody like him and what he does and what he is able to do is really it's really it's not only fun to watch but it's really like you know you're a self-starter he's a self-starter like it's great to see self-starters who find success because it really is difficult to like take something and like make it not only financially successful but also like something that that we all respect and love you know and that's you know I'd say the roasting thing that Jeff really pretty much has rebranded into like you know every every possible way you can do it is always good because he's behind it you know when it's not when it's not really with him then you're like I'm not so sure there's other people who really good at it too but I'm just saying that like you know that is when you know we're on the road and people will scream out the car door it's the roastmaster I mean like you know I had my insomniac time but he like 2030 times that in terms of like recognition I mean it's just amazing it is where the year they're synonymous with roasts yeah you know I mean like people say roasts they think Jeff Ross I earned it because wouldn't people laughed at me and thought oh that's a dead art it's a lost art it's antiquated in horny it's old guys I stuck by it and said no it's alternative comedy no one's doing it I get to I get to hang with legends like Buddy Hackett and Milton Berle you know and I stuck to it because and there was a lot there was a there was a time when I was like embarrassed like oh I'm gonna be pigeonholed as the roast guy were you embarrassed not him I don't embarrass is the right word but uncomfortable yeah because you're like well I want to be more than that when was this round this was probably 10 years ago and I was in Vegas Chapelle again words of wisdom he's like dude that's your lane make that a five-lane highway and ride it and that's kind of what we started what I started doing sort of really owning it and loving it and to the credit of the world as we became more pussies in the world like roasting became more and more potent and important yeah and the world needs to develop thick skin and I think roasting honors people and it's done with love but it also kind of toughen this up a little bit well I think it's of the time when I came back to the comedy store first thing I came back to watch was roast battle yeah and I hadn't really know I had heard but I didn't really know where it was right and they remember that night I remember that night really well because I remember thinking holy shit this is so mean you guys go deep but really good we were at the other Club The Improv sure that's that's kinda backhoe though I'll take a little bit elite belief I can deal right deal with it how about is nobody inside it's my company gonna crumble because of this am I gonna get audited by NASA it pumped him up he went down but then he went back up Tesla went down and then it went out really went down six percent then it went up nine the studio still smells a little musky but that night when I walked in there I remember thinking this is a joke writing thing this isn't just as simple as the art of the info yeah it's but it's it's it's joke writing and one of the things I loved about roast battle is how Moses makes everybody hug right at the end of it it's it's very cool well I started judging it and people were pushing each other and screaming at each other and I wrote the rules of roast battle original material only no physical contact yeah that's scary and every battle ends with a hug I've seen that with them rapid also guys punch each other in the face rap out also like the way more mean version of roast battle yeah those fucking guys I've seen some just horrible horrible shit people say to each other and Moses like he owns that that that that circus yeah you got to admire the fact that he can week after week make that work you know one of the reason why works he's so likable like Brian is such a nice guy the best he's he's such a good good hearted sweet person we were at the improv that night you hadn't been at the comic store in years and years and years and years and I don't know all the details and it never really was part of it and part of my and you were asking me about Rose Bell or somebody started asking me about it in front of you and I saw you getting curious and you get more curious and you were maybe a little homesick for the Comedy Store who knows and I said come on let's go jump on my car you're like I'll meet you there and you sat up on the balcony where the judges sit and you hadn't been in the belly room in five years maybe who knows and Evon seven years and you're sitting there and Moses does a double take and he's too afraid he doesn't know what to do he doesn't really know you you haven't been back there you haven't been in the store and finally I say Comedy Store legend back after a long time say hi to Joe wrote real low-key intro and I've been in that room a lot for roast battle I never heard anything like this reverberate it like I thought we were gonna fall into the main room and it was it that was it you beat him back every day since well I had to go back to because Ari was filming his Comedy Central special that's why I had to go to Rose bow there's no way I was gonna miss a special I was like I have to go there and I want to go there the night of his special let me just go there a day early yes I want there day early and you you end up judging Rose bottle on Comedy Central and doing all that you you're part of our your royalty over there I said Earl Skakel came out shirtless with the fucking gold chain this day that was one of the greatest entrances I've ever seen anybody take on stage and he fucking murdered he was on fire fire it's like the art of the insult you might not be the strongest headlining act but if you can put five jokes together you can take somebody down but here's the question why is it that so many people excel at that like especially young comics but they can't seem to figure out a way to generate that kind of energy during a regular set different I think they don't get stage time I think that's really what it is there's a lot of that sure that this is their moment so they throw all in but can I say as an outsider since I never was really a West Coast you know comic like you guys is that the comedy store from back in the day to before the roast battling - to the roast batter like an amazing difference I remember walking in there and it was like it's like a haunted house you know you're like where is everybody what's going on Sam Kinison played here you know and then like you know you go on stage and it was like you know 12 tourists in the room and then a bunch of comics in the back and then after the roast part I like the energy you could just see it just went pow like through the roof of just like it was the place to hang and like you know became like when you're in town you want to go by the store and just check it out and like go on stage and you know the crowds there became way better and I think that you were part of that of like really help re-energizing that Club % that's what I felt doesn't felt when I went back was like this is a different place even lil rel Howery said there's no other comedy competition where other comics come to watch yeah true harvest and cheer on their friends or kind of roll their eyes at the ones that they don't want to win and there's a fraternity there I feel like comedians and I feel like we're a cult in a weird way sometimes I feel like I'm a comedian before I'm even an American like I meet comedians from all over the world and I feel like I know them my whole life yeah and roast battle is now international yeah so that's a great story it really is a movement like that where it was sort of a corny thing that nobody really understood the roasting I couldn't even try out roast jokes when I first started it was like so mean if I would stand there with a piece of paper and read 10 William Shatner jokes so me you were doing that one night at The Improv I'm trying to remember who you were practicing you the same people that would be at the roast it would be dying right it's hard to put yourself in that roast mindset like when you go to see the roast mindset it's like going to see a fight yeah see if you want to see a fight and you knew you're gonna go see a fight you could handle the fact that fight was going on if you just show up at the movies and two people start head kicking each other we can agree to her if except if we just know it's gonna take place in advance I guess there's part of that and it is a sport roasting has hundreds is a sport it's definitely a game because their strategy involved it's not just jokes there's like you're trying to disarm someone's material towards you maybe like sometimes guys will go at themselves first right and then go out their opponent like in the same joke I think they're already sort of there it's very smart people are being clever with because they've been doing it for a few years now so you've seen people bomb they've seen people murder other strategies like any other sport yeah and you punch back and you have your you have your retort ready yeah and you know there's all kinds of other little things like you know maybe don't mention the obvious thing till the end and then you're gonna bawl sure yeah yeah I don't want to give too many secrets away but better roast battles battlers will study the game tape if you will and figure all this stuff out and you know five jokes I mean yeah it's not easy no it's not easy if you trip or stumble can you recover tawny hints clips the goddamn assassin at that shit yeah left that motherfucker he's an assassin at roasts he's got an evil little black spot in his heart jobs are vicious and clean tight but I do off the top of our head I mean if you can do that also yep but Tony takes it seriously and it's like like I say the it's an art yes that's also the skill of joke writing which is like in today's world of more storytelling and all that kind of stuff that it's it's it's few and far between where you actually see like someone who could put together a couple of jokes in a row and you're like wow that was a great run you know like everybody has one good joke and then like you know maybe a couple of tags but I'd like to actually have a great run you know that's the thing that always excites me about comedy and when I'll tell you like when work together he'll go what new stuff do you have and like we'll just throw it up there and like I'll try and um you know basically work it out on stage because I know it's not like one of my own bits like a form bit yet it's like something that I can work with him and that's fun too that also like opens your mind to a whole other world of like joke writing you know sure especially you're doing it right next to another comic yeah we started we've remains difficult we always start by talking about each other Dave looks like an umpire during a rain delay I'm actually wearing the same stuff right now Jeff mixes it up a bit this easier for me makes a statement flip phone what is it what is it I know how to delete a hard drive I do I do creep it up why do you still didn't answer about the flip phone why do you have a flip phone well I like the flip phone II like you don't get distracted with the web because it takes forever to get rid of on there but it's just I don't know I don't really like technology I don't like the web I feel like you know there's something about the virtual experience and the live experience that like we're really in that world now of like coming to see someone live is getting harder and harder but like they'll know all your clips on on YouTube you know so I don't know I don't you think more people are going to see people live than ever before well Joe not me if there's any reason for that at all it's definitely not your your act because it's gotta be content brilliant no it's it's your lack of connection with the internet yeah if you were connected more with the internet more people would be going to see you I'm not a good promoter I don't believe that I hundred percent believe that cuz you're your it's hard to talk complimentary without someone there right in front of you you're you're brilliant as a joke writer you one of the most prolific I know the most clever that I know but you're also the you have less ego than anyone I've ever met in my life you're like some weird fucking Tibetan monk dude that's been sitting up in some cave somewhere I mean you're one of the best comics ever in my opinion wow you you're so you're so low-key it freaks people out sometimes I I'm all about the I really love to hang like he was saying like the the the comics like I was hanging and like coming from you to do that's like extra special save I don't even like to get recognized I hate it I don't like any of that stuff why I think I've did I think there's a correlation you're it's my own self a more bandwidth for what you're doing your stand-up I know you're looking at this it's a good mixture because like you've obviously you've obviously been really successful with like staying in this groove particularly after you stopped drinking and everything - yeah yeah you're you're in this tight groove present that's what that's what I can say but you're said at the improv that I saw was about like six months we were at the improv together something like that yeah yeah damn that was funny shit but naughty fun you know it's funny like when you talk about that like I love there's no harder fan now than your fans I mean like they know comedy they know a lot of things and they totally respect the art form and like the craft of it and that's thanks to you and you're out there doing it it's not like you know it's like back in the day I was a comic you're out there every night doing it you go on the road so it's like you're talking from now now from like the past and you get it how like I feel like the web the web stuff helps and hurts comedy to some degree but it probably helps more than I'm giving it credit because it really is in connect to people it really did connect with more people you know I think it helps or hurts I think there's always been shit comedy and there's always general that are doing really well there's always been inspiring people and there's always been thieves there's always been all the sheriff the bad things that exist now look what now it is it's like they're way more people can find you and those people it does translate into clubs right and seats it did they do want to come out and the thing about the show the reason why this works is because we can all talk about it in a way that the a person who doesn't do it can still understand it true I think oh there's these guys like this is what you know you could be into whatever the fuck it is rebuilding muscle cars playing chess whatever the fuck it is that you're into when people get really into something there's a very similar thing that happens will you get together with other people that are also really into it and really good at it and you go how do you are you I'm always asking like do you write it out right like what do you did you just work at out on stage D how much time do you spend alone with the bit and how much time do you spend how much do you just because a lot of guys don't like to do anything outside of write little tiny bullet points and then let it all express itself naturally on stage some of the best guys ever write so it's hard to say what's right or what's wrong is there's a lot of work to comedy that people don't get which is the writing but it's also the listening to yourself like taping and listening that's the thing I have been doing I have not been doing lately we worked on this thing I'm working on other stuff and it's like that is the thing where when I go back and go like you know when I was really hardcore into the into like you know material turning an hour that was the thing where it's like you always have to like like you told me you have that tank mm-hmm that's where like going there with your axe like especially like a hard shell on a Friday like Late Show and like listen to it that to me is like a form of torture to hear like all the bits that don't work late chilly on Friday right I disagree he's very optimistic I'm very pessimistic he really is like super optimist I love Friday Late shows I like the active audience it fuels me I feel like a lion tamer up there and when Davis beside me I'm indestructible it's probably a really good show for people that don't want to be quiet - yeah they want to yell out yeah get rowdy we've dragged people onstage we go into the crowd we do all all those different things that like you know I'll say it I'll say there's a lot of things that we do are like old school comedy in terms like old school hockey like it's just no longer done it's like you could say it's it might be a little cheesy a little this a little that but at the end of the day it's it's just inappropriate fun silly like move to the next bit like yeah remember we were looking in the Edit and I go hey I got to tell you there's like a hundred punchlines in this thing so even if like you know the law of averages like you know turtles swimming into the ocean if only like seven or great that's still a lot for it for a Netflix special I mean honestly by the way I'm not I'm not patting ourselves on the back but I have that's pretty good our show is the episodes for three episodes it's Friday well the first ones called Friday they're Saturday and Sunday there's three nights oh wow and I love that Friday crowd we had like Nikki Glaser Amy Schumer Rachel Feinstein Michelle wolf you talk all the people that showed because we really like Jeff called in these like amazing Gilbert was hilarious Gilbert was he completed us talk about like he was the third piece of this like ancient like scroll like once we find that I was like where has he been Gilbert is the thing because like yeah that is the best one Phil it's a savage yeah I mean he's what do you think of Gil were like if okay like your kids are whatever now I'm trying to think of like if you were like 16 years old what would you think of gilt like he's so out of there like like wheelhouse in terms of like what is that I mean I think he's classic I think he's like nobody liked him I think I probably thought he was really funny when I was 16 but when I was 16 I was really getting in the stand-up yeah oh no my parents took me to see live in the Sunset Strip when I was 14 I guess it was when I first discovered Gilbert he was like on the MTV Awards imitating dice so to me he was like not Bureau comic he was the guy that made fun of the hero cry he had you know he was he was always like people would talk about him in interviews it was always like revered by other comedians you know he's a guy that's always been like he's a wild man like a legit wild man he murdered like he's man ago we got a standing out so like we have like friends from our life in the audience my aunt and his family and Mike Bruce Willis is there and he does a bit with us but I had up my friend Craig Moss from high schools in the audience with his wife and kids and Dave like starts to walking around the village underground looking for my guest list Craig Moss where's Craig Moss so finally like they start goofin on this guy it's just in the audience so that was a long walk in and go and I and I go pin and go you know Craig when my parents died Craig was my best friend in a new town he was you know so I'm explaining to the audience and Dave who this guy is and how much he did for me as a young man and and then Gilbert jumps up out of the audience and just screams doesn't even need a microphone he's like when my parents were alive Craig came over and killed them and it says perfect timing he never he does yeah he's just his deliveries and no filter not with him and that's the beauty of him like you know I'm always like I don't know what how they're gonna take he's like boom that's it kid I think gonna say it even I'm gonna say three times you know yeah the kids who love comedy would love him you know it was 16 I mean I I I would listen to everything I always liked a mix of like different types of comics like that episode Bob Saget and Hasan Minhaj or the other guests that's right at one point we're all up there together and you would these are guys who might not even know each other in real life but the comedy kind of brings it together hmm that's awesome it's like a party mixed with a roast mix with a I don't even know Dave no it's really cool because Jeff's family like wherever we would go on the road just family you know be like can I get your comps cuz I you know I've got like three third cousins here I didn't know there were Jews in Oklahoma but evidently they were you know five distinct you know 23andme people out there for me and I was like it's funny to see cuz I'm really a lone wolf like I'm on the road alone you know I go out there I do my thing and Jeff really does like he's very inclusive with his family so I give him a lot of credit for that like you know they're all invited you know come hang out in the green room and all that kind of stuff so that that's cool and he brought that onstage like with your aunt I said that was like one of the best moments of the whole show you know we bring up my aunt as the first episode is is my aunt Bruce Willis Michelle wolf Amy Schumer Nikki Glaser Rachael fine so it's like a weird mix of but you know what for all four just to say one more thing about Dave and the flip phone and like how the process works Dave is also the most like you say present but also informed like he knows all the references he knows what's going on in the world so he's not like he's living in a caveman under the under my eye out there so what do you do do you read newspapers I have a raven sent me because important news from Westeros ya know I even buy he's in the back reading and like really like getting in touch with the world and the audience and he's the first one to say oh we're in Vegas let's talk about this that's going on Vegas let's talk about that that's gonna movin you know he'll say it on stage to me like he'll bring up all this relevant stuff we're like I'm the son of a caterer I'm more about this live experience who's in the audience who's here I like keeping it to like that's that show and I think you agree with it it's like you'll agree with the two it's like each show is its own thing right so it's like you know the fact that it's always like some guy taping in the back you're like dude why are you doing that because this is your experience right now you know you know like stanhope who is my favorite comic Doug Stanhope is like he was the first guy that that like we both talked about like this whole thing of like why do people think that like you know capturing this show is like important and like you know they're also disposable it's like beautiful like fireworks you know it's like it's never gonna it's never gonna happen again like that you know so you might as well just like soak it all in instead of trying to capture it and III think when when we talk about like topical stuff I do that for like as a joke rocketing thing but also as a like keeping the act alive cuz I feel like my job in this team is to push it forward like you know it's like okay Jeff what else is happening like to keep moving it otherwise we can we can always get into a loop of like you know just putting each other down or like working the crowd so I like to move it forward and I think that the the cool thing about that is that like it does it does move forward to an end you know people are making those videos they're not making those videos to look back on them they're making those videos so that other people could see it right that's the difference between today in the past are you for that are you or against it yeah I come not I'm neither I think your your personal experience is going to be better if you just watch it okay but I'm not you you maybe you just get more of a jolly off of filming a clip and putting that clip on Facebook and then getting a million downloads yeah I just know that like when I go to a place and I'm working on new material I want it to be figured out and then then put it on the way I want it but I totally understand what you're saying which is like you know the you know like it's a it's an open it's an open world now and it's just like the idea of controlling is like like an antiquated idea but I think that you know for me at least as the joke writer like I just wanted to where it's where it's gonna be yeah get it out understand I completely agree I think we if we established an etiquette you know and most comedy clubs say you can't film yeah there's a reason yeah that's precious well I don't know what like I have a bit right now that I'm working on going done it twice and it's all over the fucking place and if I somehow or another released it like I'm I had to do a Netflix special tomorrow and it has to do that bit I'd be fucked I'm like what is this this malformed gelatinous butt preposterous yeah you're working on a joke yeah but sick I know for a fact that six months from now there's fruit in this I know the subject is there's something to it yeah all right to figure out what that something is and it's gonna take a while and it's gonna be a lot of missteps yeah there's just no way around it and the only way for us to do this it's like if you are a musician I'm sure it feels awesome to practice in front of a crowd but you can practice at home like you can actually get the band together and play the whole song we can't do that I'm glad you brought that up because people always bring music as like you know it's kind of like music I'm like it's kind of not like music the audience it's not like music at all if anything I I really you know talk about like cell-fate for a long time I'm like how come like my bits don't rock like within six months and I'm like you know that then I started like like directors and writers and whenever said everybody has first drafts everybody has it and like the best people have multiple drafts and it's the same thing with a joke where it's like it'll work and then it won't work and then you'll change a line and then it'll work better and then won't and you're feeling it out you're feeling out the bit you and your head or filling in the holes that you only can see because it's you're the creator and I love that process but it also is terrifying you know it really is like where is it gonna go but basically saying okay that's finished now cuz it got like a little laugh you're like I'm not satisfied there's something more - yeah so you have a you have a real issue with this because they will get a joke you know yes sure he's the creator and he knows where they'll hand the destroyer ELR go ahead watching the process we're like he's right on tour and doing like you know a week of shows I know we know each other's moves and we'll see how it develops he'll finally get a joke not where it's killing where it's like a show stopper mmm like killing like what do we do now yeah well I run around a circle like the jokes hitting so hard that we have to do something while they're laughing you know take a sip for some right we're just like roll around on the floor and I'll destroy it and then I'll go Dave what's your workout room like I'll give him a softball layup to go like this joke and he'll they look at me like I'm speaking another language because I'm already just be like in his eyes fuck you John repeating myself night - yeah and he'll deconstruct and completely rearrange the same joke I will I will turn that funny into like a boring couch Oh hear that joke into a snoozefest isn't that also the mindset that keeps you present well yeah in the bit yeah Tim present it keeps me angry yeah yeah it's like I really am letting down the team there you know it's like feed me feed me and I'm like yeah but I think that's the cool of it I also like have a problem with if a joke works continuously somewhere I'm like there's something wrong with that attack dude you know I think of the jokes as children I gave up a lot of my you know my firstborn there yeah the ugly ones my pharmacist joke my hummus joke it's because it's so important mine said to be a great club comic right cuz yeah show has to be its own thing hmm you know that's that keeps you like Ryan restart for every show you've nothing worse there's nothing worse than seeing somebody go over and over and over there same thing every year you see them it's terrible that's sad well cuz it could be so much better that's what you like as a person who's a comic you understand what they're doing they just don't want to take any chances but as a person who's you know also you know how good it feels to write something new and eventually get it to the point where you could say it Gilbert Gilbert live is hilarious right so like for years like he's gotten out of it now but for years he wouldn't update his material and I took him my sister and my brother-in-law and John Stamos we all went to see him at Caroline's one night I think Gilbert's up there this is like three years ago doing like Calista Flockhart to skinny not even update and we're just dying and by the way like Stamos is criticizing him he's like whispering in my ear I heard that five two years ago I heard that ten years ago you're on Broadway doing Chicago what are you talking about 30 or 40 50 year old play talked about but so I defended Gilbert but I did like I did talk to Gilbert and Dara and like like Gilbert you're too funny to not evolve like your first hitting your prime is a comedian now to his credit he's like on another level he's just that's great though that you inspired him to start running again I embarrassed him to start writing again that's fuckin great but he when he's with us like when that thing I said to Jeff I go if we ever tour again we have to bring him on some of these gigs because he really does like he was the third element of this this whatever chemistry of the thing that really did for me at least I always knew that like if it wasn't going anything with with me and Jeff and that's the truth of it too and people will see that in the show that this you know there's a couple of bits that go nowhere but we left them in to show people that it's real and all that kind of stuff but you norm do you guys do anything with norm I wish we could do something with norm he's got a thing on Netflix yeah but he was in the in LA we were in New York and I another dude he's so goddamn he's good I wish you would stand up I'm not saying we will but if we ever do this again this lumping Mike's day we should get norm did you see his tweets is Thanksgiving tweets no no once again on my flip phone about friends i retweeted it he's is so ridiculous man what there's some about norms just like his ability to uh you know I have this thing about timing I don't know what you think about it but it was like there's something about that timing that like you know I know in today's world that like you know people don't care about that it's more about like identity and also but like norm is a master of timing he really is like a master of like timing and this whole thing that he's trying to do he was finding these classic jokes I love that no he's genius he's he's one of there's no one Road gig ever was opening for norm really yeah father's Road gig ever 1991 maybe I'm a catch Princeton somehow I talked my way into an emcee spot and rich Voss was the middle and norm was that I love rare normally normally famous for doing a few late night shows whatever wasn't Letterman at the time what was the other one was it Thicke of the night or something or Bob Costas no it was remembering later with Bob Costas it wasn't as cool as that even Bill Boggs it was so I'm gonna give ya some show you remembered a few minutes and you go oh yeah like syndicated whatever it was but but like and I meet norm and he's catch Princeton when he doing out for do 45 minutes every show he either destroyed or he got zero laughs for 40 minutes and whenever he got zero laughs he would stand by the door and say goodbye to people as they left that's great if he killed he would go back up to the room with loss and they would play poker and then and then while we were there lost he got booked on Letterman for the first time and I had a jeep my sister bought me a Jeep with the money she got from a car accident I drove and I drilled the alarm hydrant the best I Robin and I drove I drove norm to his Letterman taping his first Letterman that's incredible his cool I learned a lot that week what a great guy to have is you're the first guy open for him it was so funny that's amazing Todd Barry was so obsessed with normies came out and slept on my bed the first guy ever opened for was a guy named Warren MacDonald was really funny like old school veteran Boston comic but the second guy opened for was Lenny Clarke yeah and Lenny Clark gave me advice that was totally contrary to his brothers advice Clark yeah the best nicest guy I love Mike he was in he's he's fucking awesome Mike book me back when nobody would book me when I was just starting out but he when I opened for Lenny goes he goes kid you're funny but you're too fucking dirty he says yeah you just told me like like a certain yeah it just it was like you should gotta clean your act up and then Lenny Clarke came offstage it goes whatever you do don't clean your act up he gave me great advice that's strong yeah I love those two guys they're so Boston too when I was going to be using to the core and when I when I was preparing that I did a a roast of the Boston cops and Mike really helped me like warm up got me a bunch of local gigs and the Boston flavor oh Beautiful for the Irish people the Italian people it's a good place to do comedy man that is definitely of the two towns I'm thinking right now Boston and Philly are the two towns that have changed dramatically comedic ly and also just in terms of like like when you walk around in Boston now you're not like hey I'm gonna get jumped you know cuz I'm wearing a Yankee you know if anything it's like you know everybody here is so like Metro and you know someone's gonna invite me to like a poetry reading and I had a wine you know bar or something like that it's very metro and the comedy there was still good but it's funny that old Boston was such a challenge it really was like especially Outsiders what year did you start going going like in uh in their 90's you know and I every time I threatened them yeah they really were they were they were battles every time and they had local headliners that could destroy the greatest comics ever offstage it was it was definitely one of those things you were terrified what you would hear just like hey you know what Gianna I know what to tell you but um Gavin might come down like okay he just wants to do a few minutes yeah they would go on stage just to fuck with you yeah absolutely yeah for people start now but comics were mean but that was their town and they and they and they saw you coming into their town and they were like you know you better you better prove it you know it's like before step up a revolution yet own it never hold grudges on know why I never people who were douchey to me in the beginning I'm like I wasn't ready for your respect I'll learn it eventually and that's gorgeous that's a great attitude Buddy Hackett said that to me once he said when you're holding a grudge the other guy's out-dancing well that's a great piece of energy you know it was a horrible habit going on back then was a famine mentality and I don't think we have that anymore I think that famine mentality is gone because now everybody realizes that with the internet there's there's literally an unlimited amount of viewers sure and people that could come to your gigs like and it's way more beneficial for them to know that like what you if you're talking about someone that's really good for them to know you have good taste like if dave says all you got to see Jeff Ross is fucking hilarious comedian and I go why I love Dave so he must be right right you know I'm saying that's the podcast world this is this is the not having a famine mentality that's that's the thing that fucked us back in the early days like in Boston it was before my time because when I came along they'd already started bit like Stephen Wright had been on on was he on Letterman and then you know like Jay Leno had already taken off and he was on Letterman all the time those guys had already like broken through to TV but there was a sense that some of them had that like where's mine like how come I do absolutely yeah any amount of slots it's not like Stephen Wright couldn't go on Letterman and say hey you think I'm funny you got to see this guy Lenny Clark or you got to see this guy Don Gavin or you got to see Steve Sweeney all these murderers that he came up with and they were all like where's mine like what the fuck you just like in my head spots of too few spots well but also like we're of the generation and not not to make this like a whole like you know trip to the Museum of comedy but we're of the generation we actually saw people who crush a room like crush room like today I was like oh you killed it you crushed it but like seeing Richard Jeni at his height yeah like caroline's or something like that crush that room people leaving exhausted where it's like two hours in you're like oh he hasn't even had his this thing yet and he's like he'll get off the stage he's like ah what did you think of that tag I'm like which I'm like - do you like throw out like a million jokes up there I would watch that I'd be like oh my god that's that's like terrifying to see it was like watching a wave come at you and it was like what people consider now killing a room or crushing a room like I I never got to see Sam Kinison or any of those people alive but I assume that was the same thing of where people could not breathe they leave the room like just going like oh man I'm just exhausted I got to see Kinison but I didn't get to see him until after he'd released his HBO special and after he released his HBO special all that material was gone like what I would have wanted to see was that because that was a culmination of ten years of doing stand-up Ryan boom he does that HBO special and it's just a murder missile that's I saw him after that what year wasn't that he did the HBO cuz I wonder what year when I saw I think it was either 85 or 86 I think it was 86 so if I slum at Rascals in a sold-out show and I was in college and I knew how funny he was he was probably already famous Lambert was he had Rascals wouldn't be doing a bigger venue by the yes you're right cuz it felt like a special event I saw him at theaters I saw him at a couple of big places I saw him at one place down the Cape he was I want to say it was like if I had a guess today I would say somewhere around 2,000 seats oh really and I saw him at great woods which is considerably larger than that and that's right after his HBO special and this is 80 this is 80 687 Wow it's like a work of great words shut the fuck up I was I worked for WBUR the call it the public radio station and I would record classic music concerts as a as a as an engineer that's hilarious dude I woods they called it Tanglewood or something what they call great woods yeah you were great woods in Mansfield yeah yeah I was a security guard there LinkedIn you guys reluctant security guard cuz I would always bring a hoodie with me and if shit went down I'd cover up my security jacket and get the fuck out of Dodge did you throw in I brought I brought a hoodie with me after like my first couple days in the job the first day on the job there's a dude named alley cat he was the dude who ran the security they caught some drunk kid who stole a golf cart so they chased him down tackled him and he was beating him in the face with a walkie-talkie that was Dave cool and I was like jobs it was and I'm not a big person I'm five foot eight just like that now outside the fight looking in yes so in and back then I was competing so I was only like a hundred and sixty pounds I was really lightens I was not getting any tangles with some big giant drunk dudes on the grow it 20 bucks an hour or whatever I'm getting I said oh just bring a hoodie with me and when shit went down I would zip up and one day shit went down with a Neil Young concert and they looked wow the Neil Young concert the back area is all grass and they started bonfires these fucking crazy Neil Young fans threw a bunch of shit on the ground just started fires and then they started trying to break up these fires and people were pushing security guards and then my friend Larry who's like the nicest guy in the world punch this guy in the stomach and I'm like okay that's it if Larry's punching people like he's the nicest these people are driving crazy out I just walked straight to my car and drove the fuck home I didn't realize paycheck nothing I'm like I'm out it was a full-blown riot two dudes were throwing down piles of people beating the shit out of each other there was fires they cancel the concert they shut the con in the middle of what's happening for Neela who is the opener it was there was two problems sometimes when you were in the back area where the grass was the acoustics weren't so good so like when people went to see comics it was bad it's not good like did that fix the sound but back then it was a big issue you had inside the canopy to hear what the fuck was going on what do you think of a oddball like outdoor comedy what do you think of that I've done some outdoor things I did a big outdoor place in Kansas City this year and it was really funny lookin awesome yeah but it was a summer night you know it was beautiful we got lucky with the rain there was no rain or anything when Jeff and I did the oddball like we went on together that was my most fun doing the oddball thing and I always thought it was a great like Jeff was a supercooled economics and everything like that I love I like feel like I've ever seen like actually look like he's having a great time with Chappelle doing it like I really like he's like so comfortable everywhere but like in the outdoor venue you know he's like taking his time and he makes it like a club yeah like I it's just amazing to watch him do it but the outdoor thing with the can never here you know like the joke going off into outer space that definitely is is is something that uh you know even the theater-in-the-round which is when I saw Rodney Dangerfield in when I was like 17 and that was another situation where the guys just like crushing crushing crushing and the room cannot breathe that kind of thing and I was like this is in the round you know I was like wow that's weird you know I was 17 I was like wow is this how it goes like you know why is he circling around like that is that is that part of it you know I didn't understand that it was in the round you know but that but now I realize that that's another like really hard venue to play is the round you know yeah I've only doing a few of those I did the that place in Phoenix that ones in the round Hollywood theater that's that's a great oh I know the woods like we did one of his 80s right I was there and cuz George Carlin did one right I think so yeah he did so many of them that guy did them everywhere I mean every year that is bananas that's one of the craziest pieces ever and talk about someone who did it totally differently he would basically write a monologue Yeah right you know each take it's not working at all not working out kind of tighten it up onstage they would say you know as you know the bits as you would just keep doing them and figure out a better way to do them he's writing it out right the whole thing yeah that's right yeah and he did it every year wow that was like at the height of of that HBO comedy thing you'd like tune in specific just to see the specimen well he was in a different place than anybody else because of how prolific he was and some would say like yeah but you know some of it wasn't my favorite stuff and like listen it is impossible to write an hour every fucking year and have it your best version of that hour you need more time a lot of the times but he had a hunter that commitment of getting the special out right but what he did was he did something that was slightly different than comedy either because it was even because it was like life it was like a State of the Union a state of like civilization sting it wasn't just comedy it's like here's a really wise old guy it was super smart shit but he has some really good points and he's gonna do this every year so as was it was different it was more that it wasn't like he never worked out in clubs I went to see him once and he was and he had this whole bit about fuck everything it was like basically fuck this and fuck that and in part of it was comedy clubs he's like they say George you got to work out your shit in comedy go up schools fuck comedy clubs really I saw him years later at the storm he was just fucking around but I saw that's when I knew I'd made it I was like at The Improv back in the day and I was probably going on at 2:00 a.m. and I still have it it was a schedule that had George Carlin 30 so like five hours later I went on at a prom show or something but Carlin came into the improv I got to say hi to him in the back patio the store just hi how you doing nice to meet you yeah ice Wow I saw him at the Aspen Comedy Festival in wood comics oh sorry yeah now he definitely didn't hang with comics necessarily right I remember once like he kind of like dissed the Friars Club he's like I don't want to hang with the older guys I want to it was weird mm-hmm I said some comedy festival he was like not doing anything like you know he had like substance stuff going on oh yeah and it was like he was treated himself to one glass of wine a day but you know how like up to the brim like it's one of those words like I see it like being on it you know like and he's looking at me like hmm you know like he's like oh he's a new comic he's a big you know I'm like hello mr. Carlin and he's like mm back to the sipping on this one glass of wine today I love that well he he got injured right and had a pain pill problem did it so many fucking people man he was a hardcore you know 70s guy - yeah oh yeah he did a lot of that back in the day but I think the pain pills was later on in his life and he just had reached a point where he realized I've got an issue I gotta stop this but he sorted it out I respected he really committed to his craft like oh yeah and you know maybe he was trying to do other stuff here and there and cuz you know he did a few acting things but that was not his thing yeah his thing was those HBO specials every year yep no one else was doing whether you figure out what your thing is lucky happy will be yeah well his thing was always you know having a brilliant social point with humor attached to it no that was his thing like some of his best bits we're just like really good points about hypocrisy and the ridiculousness of our civilization with like really good punch line he would write to a subject yeah Chris Rock does that too he also like a religion he was like the first guy to really like you know him and Bill Hicks I always thought we're like you know that was so cool there takes on religion you know yeah well you know Lenny Bruce obviously opened that door he was just a pain in the ass I got everybody in trouble all the time there because I mean he was arrested multiple times so what do we have that many bad words a guy like him yeah I think I don't think we need a guy like him in a sense the crowd is the the problem is different guy if you live today right you know I mean if he was alive today he would just be a great comic he wouldn't you wouldn't have to do all the shit that he had to do like there was it's hard for us to whenever you go back and listen to stuff like Lenny Bruce it's really almost impossible unless you live through it that time yeah in that time to put it that's why like I can kind of put myself back in there I kind of remember vaguely I have a sense of what it was like I can kind of tell you I don't have a goddamn clue as to what it was like in the sixties yeah and so when he was doing this we have to put it in context that there was no there was no freedom I didn't say certain words you couldn't talk Jackson yeah I mean really crazy restrictions on the way people talked and they brought him into court over and over and over again essentially bankrupt them he couldn't work anymore and by the end he just he died of heroin on the fucking bathroom floor and then he became a mess and a lot of him being a mess was him dealing with his court cases like he's got there's recordings of him where he's going onstage with his legal papers just reading the rain showers to the audience right lost his fucking mind right but we also came up in a club system and I consider myself a club comic like that's what I did that's I'm supposed to do but like these guys were before like you say Hackett and all these guys way before the club system they played the Catskills they played like some you know a Jewish camp somewhere you know they that was there like proving ground and I'm sure that was like probably the hardest of the hardest gigs to do you know it's like it's an all-ages show it's you know there may be a Late Show where they get to be a little saucy or but you know it really is a tough thing and it's the same crowd for a whole week I mean honestly you know that's crazy yeah so like I give it up to those guys like Joan Rivers who I think also was like an unsung hero of comedy like she she's like crosses over that that that thing from like you know where TV comedy becomes like a big deal like where you see him on like you know Johnny Carson all that kind of stuff like I love her sets I watched them with her man yeah she really was a great joke writer she was average too she'd go after it well who else stayed relevant in there at 80 years old who else had new material at 80 no but it's really just those two just Carlin and her I guess so right yeah who else and she died trying to improve her voice her instrument like she was still staying in it yeah sad one funerals are really amazing it was like a king died she was the greatest she had some serious fucking horsepower when it came to like her ability to deliver punchlines and mmm one of the best books I ever read young comics out there read enter talking by Joan Rivers about our early days and stand up in acting it's really no don't read ladies and gentlemen Lenny Bruce start putting foil over your windows and shooting up I I did read that it's a great book so I started I took a comedy class in New York who was teaching Lee Frank buddy of mine he's out he was writing and I was a slough fat loser living in New Jersey with my grandfather and my buddy said hey take this comedy class I think you'd be good at it I go what you think yeah I think you'd be good at it than I thought well it's near the bus station where I would go to work and then go visit my grandpa take care of him he was sick and and I would just go to this class for three hours it was like a way to socialize really I didn't have a desired I didn't even know what stand-up was but the first assignment was to memorize a comedians act and do it just for the class just to get a sense of timing and what it was like right and we understood we wasn't our material it wasn't about that at all and I heard Lenny Bruce was the coolest so I went to the Springfield Public Library I took out a Lenny Bruce that live at Carnegie Hall double-album I still have it and I memorized this routine and I didn't get it the odd that the class didn't get it and I realize like God context is everything it should make it just wasn't funny it didn't hold up at all it made almost no sense to me so I realized that it really is like you were saying before Dave like the moment that is the experience of being there people were so restricted back then in terms of their access to information in terms of the way they talk to each other that anything outside of the norm anything being broadcast and we have to also remember that broadcasting itself was only like 40 or 50 years old this is a fairly new medium right and anything that was even remotely just outside of what the accepted standard operating way of behaving was was considered decadent and and racy and list dirt II Lenny they would you know he would talk about things that you're not supposed to talk about that yeah that's happy subjects but today that same stuff has already been he opened the door richard pryor kicked it down lit it on fire eddie murphy nuclear bombed it and then what kept going on and Kennison and hicks and it's those there's nothing there anymore there's no shame and any of these subjects anymore you can't there's no built-in weirdness to it that he experienced back then and he would have never been able to do comedy and he differently I think that's also what we need to understand as if like Eddie Murphy went back to nineteen sixty and did his same kind of material that he did in raw they wouldn't take it wouldn't everybody be like he's yelling at us yeah like what is he doing right this is not comedy like they wouldn't be ready for it there's these stages that have to happen and I think you kind of have to have a guy like Lenny who's like spelling it out for people and then a guy like Carlin takes it to a different place and then again they just keep going and Pryor comes along and introduces this like incredible honesty to it it's like each comic had one less layer of exposition and there has so that almost like they opened for each other by decade or by five almost right and so interesting and Kinnison when Kinnison came around there was the first time that I'd ever saw something I went oh well that comedy could be anything yeah because I thought that comedy was these guys who would go on The Tonight Show cuz that's mostly what I'd see whether they would she ever known us and they would be talking about stuff they noticed and I loved it I would love to stand-up comedy but I never I never thought that stand-up comedy was anything like Kennison when I saw Ken is here for the first time I was like oh this is a totally different thing yeah like this guy's doing a totally different thing right like this is crazy something inner anxious monologue when he was standing in front of a guy going uh you know you look at his face you didn't married yeah I was married twice I was married for two fuckin years I know but nobody had ever done anything like that before and I remember thinking at that time like wow comedy is really fascinating because it can be so many different things but you also wanted to be a rock star rock star yeah but that but when you see seed all those great things that he could do like his staged craft I guess you would call it yeah the things he could do he could really hold the stage and in today's world ways pretty much everyone's low-key let's that's kind of like the new style I'm like low-key whatever it like that that to me always it was like he was like a force of nature that's what I was like it was like this guy like somebody opened the door and a hurricane came in do you know that I love that he has something like very seriously in common frozen okay so yeah they both experienced significant head injuries at a young age oh well then from then on became this new person huh Rosanna had the exact same story she got hit by a car heard that she got fucked up she was in a mental hospital for nine months yeah I mean really bad so what when people talk about Roseanne and say bad things about him like you looking you really are doing I didn't know everyone a disservice by expressing this the way you're doing it because you're not even taking into consideration everything she does you should take into consideration she had a significant brain massive trauma to the brain when she was like 15 years old her head bounced off of the fender of a fucking car right she was laid out she was in a coma she was in a mental institution for nine months after that right like this is like asking someone who has broken legs to not limp even when you're asking even when you I heard you talked to her about it she almost like skipped over it as if it was something she didn't really want to address and you were like backtracked she had I had to get it out of her because this is what I know about her and she ought she knows that I'm a giant fan like she knows I always say if you have to list like top 20 comics of all time Roseanne is 100% in there and probably one of the most important ones because what she did when she first got on HBO and she first when people first started she would first of all she would fucking murder domestic god yeah she would murder and she she had a totally different style Hearst she didn't give a fuck like when she was up there the first time you saw a woman who was like aggressive and insulting and didn't give a fuck didn't give a fuck what she looked like didn't give a fuck what you thought about what she looked like she was just there to be funny and she knew that I had that opinion of her when she did the show so it helped you know it helped like like I'm not trying to hurt you in any way and I just want people to understand who you are she's on a fucking bunch of different psych medicines man they've got her on all kinds of crazy shit trying to even around and then on top of that she's taking adderall and she's drinking and like everybody relax like leave that poor lady alone right like you're going after when she's in her 60s for a fuck up on Twitter right you know you thinks that that lady looks black is lying you're either full of shit like if you didn't know if I said okay you don't know anything about her what's the ethnicity you'd be like oh boy right you know I saved the picture on my phone in case I get in a conversation with people about it cuz it's such a cause it's one of those things where nobody wants to look like they are in any way racist right no one wants a look at their racist I don't want any but you also have to be honest doesn't mean you're racist if you look at that and go that was Laderman she could be a lot of things she could be a lot of things she has long straight hair not long short straight hair like she could be a lot of things this is not obvious you say that it's obvious you're being disingenuous you know I can't talk to you because you're not being this isn't you're not realistic this is not obvious well you know I shouldn't be tweeting about politics at all tonight on ambien well she also shouldn't be tweeting about lizard people or any other crazy shit she tweets about right you know rosanne trails and right before her shell when she went from comedy to her show and Emma once again it was a you know like her act was her show and like that was one thing that like since her everybody was always like you know you got to like throw out in your act like 20 minutes about like what you are and who you think the sitcom should be and it was like it didn't work as well for anybody else except for her because that really was her life right and it was her things right like I like Ray Romano was another guy was really good at that where he would put up you know his act he's really great joke writer too he would like totally like have these great jokes about his family and his wife and the expectations of their relationship and then that became the the essence of that show so then you see like everybody you remember there was definitely a decade of like agents going like hey you gotta get like you know you know did you have a dog growing up do a joke about that you know again I get a sitcom going on that I went through all that shit when we were trying to do sitcoms around people and they would try to get you to put together like some sort of a theme and do it onstage for a sitcom I mean I've seen guys specifically craft an act that they thought was getting the 12 minutes yep yes people got seriously into it man it became like a different thing it's like a goal the goal was the sitcom did you that one was another one do you like those days acting I got lucky okay I got super lucky I got super lucky first of all that I never had my own show all right so never had to carry anything and then too I did a really shitty one first a one that should have been really funny but then too many people got involved and it got too convoluted and fucked up and it just didn't work and that show got canceled me and then I got lucky that I got on a show that was already there he did the pilot when I came onto news radio Ray Romano was supposed to do the pirate the pilot rather he gets fired they hired a new guy and then they filmed the pilot and then after they filmed the pilot they got rid of the new guy and then I came in that's so there was a like there was a lot of steps you jump the hard part of I jumped all of it and I walk but I mean creatively there's no way you found that fulfilling maybe at the time a news radio was unusually free in how much you could create you could constantly Paul Sims is a genius the nicest guy in the world and he would let you like he would just seize no ego would still do the best shit like he would let like Dave Foley was constantly rewriting jokes and constantly introducing new punch lines so he was like you know probably one of the if you look at all the punch lines that had ever been on the show I like a percentage of them you would attribute to Dave Foley a significant percentage genius but they would let him do it they wanted everybody to do that they want the only job where you want to do more than you're supposed to and you're like mad if you did all that there's eight people on the show too it's a lot of human beings to be talking for 22 minutes and of course Phil was the star you know Phil Hartman was a big star he was so talented that guy so talented he was also like super professional yeah that guy would prepare he would have a he would have a clipboard right or a notebook with all of his scenes in there with different colors for the tabs and he would practice them you'd see him sitting there by self just going over his long his head back the doctor yeah I mean he was a fucking meticulous professional like I'm so bad like some guys especially the comics where they go when they get that sick grab that microphone oh sorry buddy the comics they get the sitcom and then they ride it as long as they can and then then they go back to stand-up and we've seen that you know you can throw a dart at like a schedule anywhere in the country and you'll see that guy and I'm always like you know what isn't it sad that you didn't keep doing the stand-up because now you're kind of right back to where you started in terms of stand-up like you didn't get to grow that way like you know part yeah a lot of them don't do it for years and like everybody's always like you know this is the best touring time when you have a sec um but most people don't want to go on tour like that you know to me I would be like yeah you're right let's get out there you know but well you you could do it for a few months but yeah the schedule you're filming you're gonna be stuck at in LA and then on top of that especially back then when you start out a sitcom you're doing 12-hour days until you figure out how to do it true once the show had been figured out by like season three or four we were down to like three days a week sometimes four days a week mostly mostly for very rarely five unless there was some significant crazy somebody to make we did 98 I think Wow maybe did 99 something like that but I did a hundred and forty-eight fear factors Wow and I did six more than we did when when it came back in with six or seven more I think it did we did seven and forty eight yeah that was preposterous that was when I was losing my mind wasn't even one a day or was it less than oh no that one took three days sometimes you get bang out one in two days like you'd have the Beast on early in the day in the sea stunt at night like the final stunt at night that's my you know what again very fortunate it was a great gig plenty of money and it was all good and it definitely helped my stand-up because it gave me fuck you money too it gave me the ability to not worry about like having money in the bank because I don't have like extravagant tastes I'm not too ridiculous with money but I like feeling like I I don't have to worry like soon as you know okay good don't think about that anymore now think about other things so it really helped me there and also the preposterous nosov it was a boundless source of material yeah which is such a ridiculous shit I hosted a spin-off that didn't get picked up who was it called say uncle her what's this show - and I was writing on the man show and that's how I knew David Hurwitz who's produced some fear factor and they had a show called to say uncle which I later parodied in the De Niro movie I wrote the comedian called like stop uncle or whatever it was but anyway the the big one of the big things was a guy a contestant got in a turkey pen mm-hmm and we like put maple syrup all over when he rolled around in these like birds like pecked at him and he's his family's there watching and he starts bleeding and she and I stopped the thing and the producers were man that you can't stop in the middle of like the guy's crying I go yeah it was just a total disaster you could tell it was gonna be a big hit but it was risky and then I remember going to Jimmy Kimmel's like premiere party for Jimmy Kimmel Live and I saw the head of ABC there and I'd never done this in my entire life they it was like getting a drink and I walked over and I said please don't pick it up it's rough it's gonna be it's gonna be too hard to stand behind we're torturing people well they didn't pick it up he just kind of looked at me and smiled here's this this would have been 2003 hmm yeah that was right after fear factor was first launched when when those shows what happens is you get used to one thing and so you have to do something that's bigger and better the next year yeah and so when we came back I felt uncomfortable with a lot of the shit they know how to do it like the stunt guys are top of the food chain they but they were doing some sketchy shit like one of them we had these people chained to a tree look with bungee cords that were attached to a helicopter and they had to figure out the right locks to unlock the bungee cord that they're the straps to keep them to the tree and then as soon as they do they undo the strap and teach they fucking shooting out into space into the center of this gigantic Canyon and they're bouncing underneath this router and I remember thinking like this doesn't yeah if we could do this a thousand times one of them someone's gonna die of course one of them someone's gonna die and it might be the next one but it never have we got lucky dude I really feel like we got lucky I really really honestly 100% feel like we got lucky there was a few things first of all you there's a certain amount of risk that you take whenever you're doing anything like jump your car off of a building roof which we did we had people fly cars across a train a moving train okay there's risk involved in that right but the one that scared the shit out of me that most was bull riding we had people ride bulls it was the only time I told contestants don't do it I'm like if you if you want to ask me I would say don't do it on air no no no no before we no on air I mean I gave them the standard right but when you know what I would talk to them I'd say look this is up to you right if you want to go on me people do know how to ride bulls but you don't how to ride a bull we're not teaching you how to ride a bull you're not going through classes you know slowly they're surely building up your techniques right you're just gonna ride a bull right don't do that right don't do that that's what I would say and we had this girl she was like 98 pounds she got launched off the back of this bowl and she'll do this these people went fucking flying that that thing's kicking gun I had a fall through there yeah barely misses them when it's kicking I mean they're wearing helmets and shit but look at this look at this look I mean come on man look at this I mean that's that default the way she felt like that that is like getting hit in the back of the head with the world yeah so like my personal feelings about trauma and about what's dangerous and shit like this this is a no-no especially for a 90-pound woman like this poor lady oh my goodness she got up cute little fellow I was back then yeah she got up man she was tough as shit but everybody I feel like in that one I feel like we got lucky I feel like we rolled the dice because if they stomp you they lacerate livers and cry yeah crush scorns and they can stop you the funny thing was those stunt guys are so fucking tough those guys are so used to putting their ass on the line that they don't think anything about someone doing something risky right to them that's what you do you showed up for work right and that's definitely a different in your head like an alpha is something they're animals have to do that they're like fighting crave that you're like wonder what we're saying you know does it keep them from having a family there's a woman who's gonna marry you if you're throwing your life in the line unrelated to war or famine no I think there's a certain allure to remember that that TV show the fall guy yeah how about Evel Knievel yeah I love them women loved Evel Knievel if that's a good point women love risk takers they like being Amex guys to do those flips and shit and those guys are those guys really shit and now they have the parkour guys where they like climb up a building would know any any any kind of you could smoke you could do parkour iron iron grid do you exercise it all day I do the kettlebells yeah you were telling me that yeah I'm still doing that I you know can I you know because I wanted to ask you this off the mic but it's like I I seem to be getting more out of pull-ups and just regular calisthenics than I am out of the out of the kettlebell experience I think it's because like maybe I'm just more into it now you know well there's definitely no better exercise for you than pull-ups and push-ups and that to me is if I if somebody had to say for the rest of your life you got a pull-up bar and no weights yeah you know you're gonna be okay I feel like I'll take that over not having a pull-up bar because I think there's certain amount there's certain kind of workouts it's so hard when you manipulate your own body to push-ups I think too because you could vary your push-up with right and you could do so many things just with chimps and push-ups and then with bodyweight like single leg squats and things like that you can get a tremendous workout in with just a chin-up bar bodyweight and there's there's a there's something about like that do a hundred of them like I can't even do like ten like ten would be great for me but like the guys who can do a hundred it's so hard it's almost like torture to do reps chin-ups I know you do a hundred chin-ups as a fucking Sam yeah like I I mean that definitely is the goal but I'm new I'm old and I'm sad 100 in you know we get two sets yeah I don't do it though I do sets of 10 yeah I don't do any more than 10 and I do them multiple times a day like I have a chin-up bar in my house so I'll walk in and I'll just jump up yeah it's an 10 mm-hmm and I've found that like the one thing that's helped my squeeze like with jiu-jitsu and with being able to pick my body and just move around better it's just just do them randomly throughout the day I do chin-ups all the time like when they're like oh those the bars in the back I'll do a show here and then I'll go back and do tension ups I'm like that with masturbation since I can have sex anytime don't you ready to go was ready to go but if I had to pick one thing it would be that'd be a chin-up bar and then bodyweight stuff you could do that for sure that's you're not into the kettlebells on the road it's it's like hard to do you know like I don't like going to the hotel jam or anything then I like to keep it in the room so sometimes you know jump rope or something like that but I would say I've gotten in better shape but I still feel like you know you know crap most of the time but when I was a kid when I was a kid like it was all that stuff like push-ups and sit-ups and all that kind of stuff and now that I'm back to it I'm like you know I forgot how great this is you know it's really cool you know it's a great thing for the lips I have thirds with those TRX things oh yes trap it into the door of the hotel room and you could do all these crazy exercises and it's real small you can just tuck it in your bag I love that I love the hotel room like we've all seen that in the movie the assassin doing a couple of write a couple very slow push-ups sometimes if I go down to a gym and there's nothing that I want to do in there I'll work out my hotel room no you never were like a runner were you like a run now are you do it's only been over the last couple of years really but even when you were like doing a Taekwondo right yeah much I thought that was part of the thing they had like a military kind of feel to it they would definitely had a military feel to it and some some different they would call it dough Jang's you know Jeff's a black belt in Taekwondo I know we are actually on the show he pulls out the nunchucks that's not a part of it but that's okay you know I'm rusty I have to admit I need to get back sir sighs these days I've been doing a little bit of yoga but honestly I've been doing a lot of not exercising lately he needs I feel good yeah like I'm in a place now where I need to start exercising again we talked about this in the parking lot the other day I've been a stand-up hiatus and when I'm not performing I don't care as much about my instrument right and I've been editing and writing and producing so I'm I don't know I've gotten a little not late I guess lazy and and I don't feel this good like I know I recognize me in my body if I need to snap out of it I think he needs like like a like a group or like people to hang with hmm because you know that was more fun and out by myself yeah if there was like if there was like a group of guys you know come on and don't let us down you could find like a CrossFit class to join or some shit like that I mean they always have those kind of things there's all sorts of different classes that yeah you like is awesome they I've done one of those high-intensity interval training things at a yoga place too whether you do some yoga and some like really light weights but all these crazy little exercises that's fun too you know dancer pose we're doing say easy oh you try to do that don't hurt yourself easy yes oh that is that what's called standing bow things called standing bow keep it going we going no one can see you yeah yeah you supposed to grab both legs but that's okay do it grab that other leg bitch you got it no this is yeah come on son here he goes yeah nice and the headphones on take it to the new level like a NASA mission called again cry for help how often do you do it when I would go I would go to hunt you oh there you go a couple times a week or now I just kind of do it in my backyard to stretch out after a long flight or something that's good anything so kind of like you at the tank like that's the time to think about life to think through a bit to think through a mission that you're working on some family issues it's like quiet you're it's about you for me yoga it's like giving yourself a massage it's more gratifying than going to your weights except I like to stretch out before set so you ever do that do stretches before you go yeah yeah it was real good that like there's something about that that's very relaxing who'd seen a good I think you carry around when you're tight you carry around a lot of like and your attention that you don't necessarily want pigeon pose that's where all the tension is pigeon pose that's the one where you're doing oh wow yeah that oh I've seen this one yeah I've seen that one that's called a hip opener yeah that looks so sad Yoga people will do that pose and start crying this there's so much emotion and anxiety release from the hip yeah that's not real Joe you're just crying because someone told you should cry nonsense they always want to say that this is opening up your colon you don't have any fucking there's no diagrams you don't know where the colon is like you better stop you better stop saying that you don't have any fucking there's there's tension in the hip cat-scans what's head stuff called magnetic residents MRIs you don't have that bro you don't have any like real evidence there's emotion get the fuck out of here with that shit you're not you don't have any memories specifically and people say no no no but when I'm in that position and they tell you that it's animal if the emotions come out here you just let them like what emotions are gonna come out someone told you mission to be emotionally vulnerable yes that you that in hypnosis and you can get that eating lunch at a deli or working out with the boys in the gym if you're in a quiet dark yoga place with other people that are staring at their own at the floor right you can relax a little emotionally that's a logical definition that's a logical way of explaining what's really going on namaste means yes good still let me ask a question do you eat before you go onstage no me neither this guy has to eat like he has to eat before he goes onstage like right before mmm like pretty much right before I mean I don't think there's anything wrong with eating some fruit right before you go up on stage but for me I don't want to there's a certain amount of resources your body is going to use for digestion that's just a fact yeah okay there's a reason why fighters don't eat a fucking so yeah and mashed potatoes right hate that because your body will be like fuck you dude we got to digest this stuff and it's sloshing around your stomach it gets in the way I hate it obviously this is that I know plenty of people who have to eat I sometimes I in that first episode of our show I eat during the show yeah to the stage that's how hungry I was by the Late Show there's nothing wrong with that man it's not not to say that you can't do it and for you you're so casual like you're probably better off feeling good then you are like being having more mental alertness like there's annoying yeah I ate in the car coming to your studio today and the first thing I said to Jeff who answered the door was there anything to eat around here because it's like it's an anxiety thing to like before you're gonna perform and I remember reading years and years and years and years ago that David Letterman would he pineapple right before he went on so he was that I always asked for pineapple and my writers hi Stacy pineapples a good Stacy market yes he also would do a fasting and then he would like pig out that was his thing Letterman that's what I heard that like he would like not eat for like two or three days and then he would do that and that's how my friend Russ does it not like that kind of thing of like where you like just basically Spartan like nothing nothing nothing and then like you get to eat whatever you want I believe for sure the people eat too much food and me included I eat too much leave and when I when I is fast like especially intermittent fast I do like 16 hours at night when I do do that I feel way better way better wait what fasting between dinner and I the next time I eat is 16 hours Jeff can you imagine that no you just decide in you go to I would have to be getting a colonoscopy you just look you eat dinner you done it ain't you go to bed or do whatever the fuck you do but just no more to perform how do you what are you talking about you can't yeah you have to eat - come on agent ten the last thing I want to do is eat any later than eight I go right to the cookies in the back of the comedy cookies are different though that's quick carbs that actually is not a bad idea I say that's not really no not bad idea at all like you don't eat that stuff do you I'll eat that stuff look when I was doing this sober October fitness challenge with Ari and Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer I ate everything in sight I eat pizza and cookies I ate everything because they just want calories but the problem with cookies and stuff like that is like you can eat them but you just can't make a habit of eating them all the time or will fuck you up it's just gonna fuck you up before you go onstage not a bad idea got a little pick-me-up energy with carbs body's gonna break down those carbs and those sugar and glucose is a very good fuel for the brain yeah it works yeah yeah carbs are good for the brain especially in like if your body's carb adapted if you eat carbs all the time and you can eat some carbs right before you go onstage that'll give you like a little energy I feel so much better even lift yeah really like if you wanted to have a cookie or it may be even a Snickers bar and then lift weights I wouldn't I wouldn't say don't do that well I say that'll give you some fucking sugar to burn off like it's not the best food for you in the world but you're asking for it for a very specific reason like after it's over I'd say yeah go have some salmon and some vegetables and eat healthy but right before you want to work out like you could drink a coke right like you you could drink a coca-cola and if you're gonna live for an hour okay drink a coke it was a shit right you're gonna burn that shit off and it's just gonna be fuel that you use just I wouldn't do it all the time but it's not gonna have a negative effect on you it's really a cumulative thing with people in diets it's eating too much sugar too much bullshit for too many days in a row and not giving your body a chance to relax see when I when I don't eat I never considered like oh that's lightheadedness I'm like I'm probably having a stroke I got this is it I bet you find place to lay down food mortal over X I think that's awesome well listen food is fucking phenomenal right and you're lucky you live in New York City and then you come to LA so you're in both places and you're in two spots that have some of the greatest restaurants on the planet Earth if you're like a food yeah some cash Jeff Ross you can do whatever the fuck you want I do yeah nice bottle of wine and have a fucking beautiful steak with the right accoutrements and you know why wouldn't you I mean it'sit's a beautiful pleasure and if I eat a steak some red meat mm-hmm I mean it's fucker fight yeah like I'm either on stage as soon as I eat a steak and I don't need it as much as I used to but we eat a lot on the tour remember was you mean yamaneika that was a great what was it well because having there like a porterhouse you know the thing we're like not only the ribs still there but the hooves like that kind of thing like really basically like do-it-yourself do-it-yourself kind of at stake bone-in rib we really went to yeah we went to town on that she did more that I love a good steak I don't think there's anything wrong with it I think what's wrong with steak with what people think was wrong with wrong with red meat is all the stuff you eat with it all the sugar and bullshit and bread and pasta and then alcohol and sedentary life there's a bunch of things but I think if you're a healthy person who exercise all the time I don't think steaks bad for you at all I don't anything a little bit I think it's good for you I think it's the opposite of bad for you I think all of our preconceived notions about what's healthy all of them very cuz some people that really don't do good with red meat some people don't do well with fish people are weird Barney fish I don't like it either do you eat it love it you do love that is that right away like steps up your whole game right that's for sure a life-saving thing well if you get a lot of those essential fatty acids that you can get from like an oily fish like a salmon they're so good for you man that's so good at reducing inflammation do you take fish oil at all yeah one of the best things you can take fish oil krill oil anything it's getting those essential fatty acids which so many people are missing from their diet just getting a good healthy supply of it every day it's just good for everything man it's good for your skin it's good for your brain good for muscle development so soil yeah official it's phenomenal it's good for inflammation if you have joint aches and stuff like that fissure booger booger you know how you like touch your nose and it feels moist you like what's happening here do you have a clinger what's going on here we're good I think you're clean you're good but uh official is just one of the best things man it's so good for you what is it what is fish oil oil extracted from fish and what the tears of the fish yeah now a little bit of calm they they sell merch booth yeah Joe so David have you ever like caught it caught like what is like a sport fish you know like a big one or anything and then you would make steaks out of that too I've done that with the the most delicious thing I think I caught was a wahoo I think that's used for it sort of a dick now we caught it in Hawaii it was phenomenal man because they we brought it we were staying at a hotel we brought it to the the waiter or the chef in the hotel would cook stuff for you and you would just bring him the the the fish and you know he would go how do you how guys think we want to prepare this and so we said I don't know like what do you think like it's like what would you do if somebody brought you this he goes I would prepare it a bunch of different ways because is a huge fish so I could make you guys like a little bit of ceviche a little bit sushi yes perfect Wow so was he cooked it six hours after it was dead I mean we caught it and then six hours later we're eating it for lunch it was insane it was so good that is cool oh that's it right there Wow that's what it looks like this is another name for and though Hawaii they call it an oh no oh no that's right that's right it's delicious it's so like how the fish is looking at the camera too oh wait that's crazy you know but yeah it's you like fishing over hunting no fishing is harder I like them both you know hunting is way more intense and I feel way worse for the animal like I don't feel bad for fish yeah exactly cuz you know whatever reason I'm just being honest like if I catch a big salmon yeah I'm like sorry dude right but this is what I'm here for like but when I shoot a deer um there's always a little part I mean it's like who this is what I you know I eat and I know that if I don't do this they're gonna die of either starvation or disease or they're gonna be ripped apart asshole first by coyotes like this is not a good end for them no matter what and me shooting them it's probably the best end they're ever gonna get interest all those justifications aside it's a different feeling when you see like an elk down then when yeah it's a salmon salmon it's 100% happiness but what about when you pull the trigger seeing the animal down is one thing but what about no one it's coming it's hard to keep your shit together that's a hunter that's the hunting you get emotional no you don't you get nervous you don't want to fuck it up you don't want to injure anything so there's a lot of anticipation in that moment it's sort of it's very intense and whatever amount of meat you get from that animal whenever you eat it you're gonna think about that moment you think I think about that moment every time ie Alyssa lips well you think about it like this is a this was a intense life-or-death moment in life like this circle of life the chain moment in life that I participated in and now I'm eating it so I know exactly what the food is as opposed to going to Morton's get a nice steak and you know get some mashed potatoes I don't where the fuck they grew that potato oh don't worry I get that feeling when I opened the can of Pringles when I'm in the refrigerator I you think do you like fishing at all I used to fish as a kid in the Hudson River with my grandfather we would catch bass and I really loved it I haven't done it since I was a kid really yeah it's fun it's a fun thing to do it's a passion yeah it's just if you could find a like if you're doing a gig and you could find a spot that has like a party boat especially and they'll take you out and everybody dunks the line and people pulling fish left and right numbers laughs and people drinking beers it's fuckin fun man it's fun yeah but that was a big thing in New England we should do party boats for blue fish and just go to a spot and everybody dropped in line and they'd be pulling these fish up and then you know you cook them later that night it's fantastic Wow just makes you think about what a fish is too and how weird it is we got this alien world connected to us we pull these things out cut their fucking heads off and cook them well you've been to Japan and all those places I've been to Japan but I fucked up when I was there and I didn't go to the fish market yeah oh man hurt the fish market in Tokyo is one of those like a million fish we don't even know about that they like that it's crazy with yeah it's it's so so interesting to see like you know we're so used to like you said bread and all that stuff is like you know is it a meal without bread it's like these people like go make months without seeing a piece of bread yeah they're not in the bread and they're all thin yeah hilarious they're their noodles a lot of times our rice noodles it's very different you know there's wheat noodles there too though right they just they eat different than us they have a completely different style of eating and just it's one of the coolest things about Tokyo man is that it's almost like an alternative country it's all you mean the city because it's so different like say if you're in Los Angeles right you leave from Los Angeles and you know you're here in 2018 and you're driving around this is the way people live over here and this is how people are in traffic and this is how people are when they come to the Comedy Store all these different places and then you go to Tokyo you go oh wow this is also people in 2018 right we're living at the exact same time but they're doing it totally differently like everybody's super polite as you walk down the street there's no people bumping into anybody nobody's yelling at anybody either very polite but they're also very Japanese right the majority of people you see are Japanese yeah that's homogeneous lightly integrated right I mean there's something you see some Africans there you see some people like us there but it's mostly Japanese people it's let it's interesting to see have you seen this TV show on Amazon called the man in the high castle no what is it it's a future it's basically America if the Nazis won the war whoa and they partner with the Japanese Wow and the Japanese owned California Northern California and the Nazis on the rest of the country and the Midwest is sort of a no-man's land so New York is not seen New York they split it at the rock but but Japanese whoa series it's been its third season I'm obsessed with it Philip dick is the is this I know he's classic it's one of his books oh no he's the mayor he's great that guy's been a lot of stuff what is his name I forgot it the actor's name Rudy see well Rufus see well that yeah that I say it yeah governor of New York what Cesar is Ruben foofer the Abba group in proofer is the governing Fuhrer is it governor in New York yeah but it's a very interesting show basically New York cops wearing Nazi armband so they're still New York cops like hey the Fuhrer says I gotta give music you know it's like that and it's fascinating how they do the show but what's interesting about Japanese culture on the show is you see the the fancy class the the aristocratic class of Japan runs essentially San Francisco and you see how they're very snobby and very particular and and hmm they don't really like to mix with the Americans Wow with the Anglos really that guy philip k dick you know his name yeah he really is he's really he's really super cool like in terms of the sci-fi stuff and I'm yeah you know what else is he written I've seen there was another movie that I saw of his like within the last two years right could you could you bring up his books cuz I would know what are the movies that they do or did they do they adapt of his movies what do we got here so this Scanner Darkly Wow that's right damn he wrote a lot of shit the adjustment team isn't at a movie - mmm Bureau okay interesting yeah the art direction is really cool the idea of not so fine American you know what's interesting too is you can still do that in a movie where you can still play Nazis as long as they're you know the bad people and some historical thing or some something that's going on now that's really the only way you could portray Nazis like you're not allowed to being Nazi for Halloween sorry yeah right you can't like people have said like people have tried it and you call out for it like there's rules now you can't be you can be a nice agent on that show what are you what did your kids go for Halloween today do they do that or they be my maids it was very adorable there were mermaids but when you're if you're dressed up for Halloween you could be so many terrible things right you could be vampires and werewolves and demons and never it's a very cool cool dictator I went as a plastic straw Genghis Khan Genghis Khan can't be Hitler you could be Saddam Hussein and people will laugh yes Saddam Hussein we got him we got that guy but if he dresses Mengele you've ruined the party if you dress as Osama bin Laden that might get your ass kicked you might get your ass kicked right for that one all right that was too soon but if you dress like you could probably dress like the President of Iran what's that dude's name that dude that came over here and said a bunch of crazy shit people Abu Shah Baba I'm talking about what why let's just talk about it for a second I remember when people were offended that there was a Anne Frank Halloween costume mm-hmm now if the point of talking about the Holocaust or something like that is never forget and a fourteen-year-old in a non mocking way wants to embody Anne Frank why is that offensive I don't understand that but they're never gonna do it non mocking every time you're making a hallway and costume you're almost always trying to be silly right Halloween accost but I don't know it all depends on to me your intentions a hundred percent you should be able to wear whatever the fuck you want no Brenda stood when that Prince Harry got all this shit for dressing Lincoln Nazi it's like I don't know maybe when did you dress like a Nazi he just for it was a costume party yeah and all the World War two veterans like what you know what would you do why would you do that you know cuz it doesn't mean he's horrifying it does it I guess if he's the prince right but you could be a Mongol you could be one of the Mongol horde tour through Europe but he's also a symbol unto itself he's assembled royalty and all this because it's hundreds of thousands of years later okay but he grew up all right he got out of it that motherfucker's living under a microscope though I mean what would he can get away with but pretty much no one can get away with being a Nazi anymore there was a guy from like North Carolina or something like that recently him and his son were Nazis for probably one person that can get away with it and I can't say too much this we haven't released it yet but okay Gilbert Godfried you know I know if you're a Jew you can get away with it yeah no you can yeah everybody zips you know well then - yes all right go ahead yeah you're right I mean remember when she did that she dressed as a Nazi yeah I always think that stuff's funny when I was a 13 year old kid in Hebrew school or grade school learning about the First Amendment this is one of the reasons I became a comedian was because I used to just draw swastika on my notebooks just cuz just cuz I knew they would teach us about dictatorships that I would go wow so in any other country they can't do this and I would just do it make myself smile and then cross it out and I go in any other country I'd get my tongue cut out I go that's the beautiful thing is that you can say fucked up terrible you can dress like an asshole like bad taste is not a crime right yeah and that was what one of the you remember the Yale uprising a couple years back there was a guy nicholas greek name and his wife they were at yale and the wife sent out an email saying that we need to stop policing people's costumes Halloween costume right she got fired yeah and you can have politically incorrect Halloween costume like you should relax and people started freaking out they cornered him in the in the square right we're screaming that's right Nick here it is Chris Christakis Christakis I don't know fuck I was so Nicholas Christakis so he's a Greek American sociologist and physician and he was teaching at Yale and these kids were they confronted him and they were screaming at him like this is our safe place you fucking ruined our plate it was so bizarre and strange and hostile and he was just trapped out there with these nonsensical kids screaming at him that like he's racist and this whole thing is racist and he shouldn't be able to wear whatever costume you want like what no one even specified like what we're talking about it was it was ethnic costumes that that's supposed to appropriate another culture yeah even even though like you know it's it's just for the party I gotta man people are just looking for a reason to be upset it doesn't have to make any sense but but the whole idea of like this one thing ding ding ding this woke thing like my niece and my niece and nephew were going to call you know they're gonna get ready to go to college and I'm like oh god this is gonna be so difficult you know cuz they're gonna come out of this machine you know pretty much looking at me as like you know pretty much I'm already not that relevant but like just like all of my references to stuff like that just gonna be so you know inappropriate you know right right and it's like when you go to college you're supposed to go to the open your mind not to really focus your opinion that you already have so that's what I felt was like I felt like everybody's like I don't want to play college show and we're all dreading like the day when we have to play a show like that where you know everybody there has that groupthink you know you have to adapt and you do a dance I know you know I'm yourself enough crying to have iTap fine but I'm just saying like playing a college and now you probably could do it but I don't think I could of course you could yeah you adapt in terms of doing a set you can do you hate yourself that right home you won't want to do that yeah just be able to do whatever you want to do and it would make you want it to it's also you're not wanna go push it you're not offensive or mean yeah you're not a bad person so whatever they don't take that into account it's the words coming out of your mouth they take them literally that's why we're in this state that we are in exactly yeah they don't see the irony or the sarcasm in it that the sense of humor in this country has never been lower and I can say that as like what Jeff's talking about like when we're little kids like Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein these movies that like everybody was watching them enjoying them and some like that now they have all these hidden meanings and people look into that and I'm like you know it was like just a fun time you know it's just like a fun experience you know it was it wasn't like that was like the and played for how to live you know I think you can bounce back but I think what's happened now is there's a certain number of people that want to be able to change the way other people talk and what they talk about because they're ultra sensitive so they have this giant reaction to things that may or may not be relevant and it's a debate whether or not it's relevant right and things we've changed right like certain words that used to be able to say easily just a few years ago way hard to get away with saying now because the culture is shifting in a way that's becoming more sensitive so probably that's good as long as they understand context and intent see context intensifies Val Mel Brooks because he used the N word fifth course sometimes in a move of course not of course not it's a different time when my uncle Murray said you know I brought off when I brought a a Chinese girlfriend home to my pop Jack and he's like East is East and West is West and never the two shall meet we didn't kick my grandfather out of the family we just said in Carolina Congress listen I grew up like we were watching weed that guy grew up in World War two of course I mean that this no one could ever there's no way we're gonna understand that right the difference in the way people saw the world that had to deal with an actual World War two this soft pampered ass life we're living I don't condone racism but I understand why people hold grudges right oh yeah if you went over to Vietnam and lost half your fucking friends and you came back over here and your fucked up still because of it like I don't condone racism but I think that anytime you're forcing into a situation where your country is at war with another side it's probably really hard for people to forgive people you know I mean how hard is it that was one of the things that someone said about the Japanese and not really too thrilled with Americans and I said well how how do you think you'd feel if you were showing up forty years after someone had literally nuked your country who twice just annihilated hundreds of thousands of people with one bomb I mean made shadows on the concrete of where someone's body used to be just vaporize them women children babies grandma grandpa everybody gets it boom I mean who the fuck is gonna be nice after that takes a long time to forget that shit right who's that baseball the Japanese baseball guy sorry oh yeah they got to negotiate that into the contract and you got to give me a little extra for you know hiroshima reparations well things they did it twice America doesn't give itself enough shit for having the internment camps here I've been on one of those there's one up on Washington State on Bainbridge Island right there's one on Bainbridge Island real yeah Bainbridge is beautiful we had an internment camp there it is Jesus you know we're not all when we got into that war late man we don't give ourselves enough shit for that either hmm yeah this is what's in um the the guy from Star Trek yeah isn't wasn't he yes his name the George Takei George Takei George he lived in a Japanese internment when he was a little kid and FDR was president for four terms isn't it crazy was he really yeah president for four term he died in a year into his fourth term how can you sure about that was it for three but it definitely was military and then he got elected and they stopped after that they were like it can only be two right but I bet you that I'm gonna you know that's amazing if you had a great president though right keep doing this job did that awesome CEO of Google kick an ass now step down bro yeah only two eight years right it's like the only gig or when you're really it has so much power we're like this isn't it you just can't keep running this you got to give up the reins well like everybody has to give up the reins we never let the best person run it forever you would think once Clinton got a head of steam under him you know just feed his carnal desires and just like quarterback you know you're only gonna have a few good years seasons right but how many years do you think the public would have kept him in like see if you had to get like Barack Obama how many years if they just let him go yeah till he doesn't want to do it anymore until we don't want him to do it anymore how many years you think you keep doing it man you might be able to do it for five terms easily more easily especially if it showed that his policies were working because you know his policies economic policies they take years in order to see real world benefits look if you take the actual campaigning out of it you know they're really only president for two years because it's like they're campaigning on the way in and then they're campaigning on the way out and it's like you know that's for all of our government and like now we're all like I guess victims of that so it's sad but Kalin was trying to explain it the other day about the amount of time that a congressman or senator or any politician spends raising money versus the amount of time that they spend actually doing their job it's not even close and it's so humbling that their job is awesome we see them on c-span banging a gavel and making a point and handing out of metal to the soldier and then you go see an actual political fundraiser boring it's like cory booker standing on a basement floor and Cantor's on a Sunday morning and fun yeah there's no glamour to it at all it's worst gig ever if I took you to a if we the three of us had to show up where politicians have to show up to raise money you'd be screaming at your agent going are you fucking kidding me with this microphone and there's no there's no lights and no one could hear me and I'm fucking talking to a wall right there's no food storm it's like the worst that is so you know why anybody would do this freaking job of China I'm gonna try to help people fuck you we're gonna expose you we're gonna beat you up we're gonna go at all your business you know what Trump was the only one that did it with a built-in giant audience right from the jump like right from the jump he had a giant audience and we're going crazy tours yeah on our dime if Hillary or not right now Real Housewives instead of the Senate she would have been president she just did you imagine Hillary around the house for just being a lady instead of being a politician that's true she probably would have in in some ways right she was almost like hindered by the fact that she was Bill Clinton's wife if she was just a senator by herself with a lawyer who became a senator she probably have way more of a shot of winning same person right people always say you know what did bill what did Trump do for the working man he entertained them like that show is great people love that show it's true even now don't you click on the on the stories first well you don't go to you know you're not reading about the the genocide in Rwanda you're reading the Trump like accidentally spilled something wrong right top news story that's all right yeah well this lately there's all these new charges being brought up that I'd you know didn't know about and new people are getting arraigned and it's a crazy let's like watch separately a very short attention span in this country and like we expect results you know and that's why in the news cycle the way it is now it's like you know have you ever been in a hotel where you'll watch like for some reason you caught in like the three or four hour news cycle where you see the same story whatever and then it's like one more detail and then they like start it up again and you're like wow you know anyway I'm gonna get a phone call cuz now I could be a panelist I know everything you know like we figured it out he was wearing shoes but I used to watch TV news shows though you know yeah yeah Dave knows every show I love I love I like the I like watching the whole day like cycle you know like I just think it's especially what is something like an event that's happening and you get to see you know them figuring it out because they can't wait for to know this whole story now because he has to be immediate so you get you get to see them like started you know and it's like it's really it's like going to journalism school almost you know you're like okay something bad happened here and then like they're working on their bits yeah exactly they have to introduce them like right we're breaking news breaking news we've been told they don't know exactly what the fuck's going on that's definitely like you know my mom you know we have she has some memory issues and stuff like that but like waiting until 6 o'clock to find out what happened in the world you know like that's those days are over can you imagine if we did that like that's a new rule you know those days are over like I remember when the lecture go through the whole day you know right how did we get I remember when the Challenger blew up what they used to do back in the day they would interrupt yes and that was exciting yes big we have some terrible news in the world of entertainment we have to pause the game just to Howard I was sitting on the bed with my dad watching Monday Night Football and Cosell just changes mood all of us all right the music Beatles legend John Lennon and I thought he said John Jack Lemmon you know John Lennon was assassinated outside his apartment and that's like yeah you remember broadcasting Howard Cosell announcing something or when the moon launch took off there's no moment now where you're like remember a certain remember certain broadcaster announcing a certain thing no no you hear one version of it but then you hear so many versions of it you forgot which one you heard first like I remember when I saw you know well yeah yeah when I saw the first time I saw it on television I didn't know I don't know who said it I don't know who was giving the the newscast it didn't doesn't even register just have to they just have to be believable that was yeah that was definitely a local news moment cuz I was in New York and my mom goes turn on the TV and then we could see the coverage right there so I was like that was before the web where you could go like okay I'm gonna get deeper into this it was like waiting on the next bit of information so I was I was laying in bed in New York and I found out from the great newscaster Ralphie May who was screaming as I was flying out of New York that day and and he had just he was in LA and he's just trying to he's like turn on an T it was just him yelling to my answer machine is like wow entered my dream I kind of heard sirens in the back of my dream because they're all the ambulances are running down Broadway and I turned it on just to see the second tower fall down and but Ralphie he was my Walter Cronkite miss that guy we lost a lot of good ones this year Shawn rouse yes do you know Joe is like great opener of mine he man great guy I always saw him in weird places with Dave like guys were pals yeah he was really good and you know at right out of Texas and he was such a good guy he was out of that huge scenario yeah Houston he was such a mr. it was a lot of that old laptop in River Oaks yeah there was a lot of great comics those local guys they had quality local comics like you would you would do a set there and the guys would open for you you'd be like holy shit you guys are funny and and you remember like the whole myth of the Texas outlaws like I used to eat that up I was like tell me another story I want to hear another story that was Hicks and Kinnison really an elbow and and a jimmy putt pineapple pineapple I worked with Jimmy pineapple first time I ever did that Club there great guy funny dude - yeah those guys like you know Jefferson Jimmy Jeff I never thought can be pineapple I don't think I even heard of him - funny - he was one of the outlaws of early outlaws with a Schubert when Schubert used to go on the road with him - you know Marin Marin was one of the guys that was with him in town I didn't know that how did you become one of the Texas comedy outlaws it was like a grill like these wild comics down and now they're looking guy glorious must bring its own microphone funny dude though I don't want to put any new stuff out they're gonna watch good guy though - I've worked with them was really nice James sign up that was when Wright worked that Club I love that Club it was right I was one of the greatest rooms of all time man I did my Warner Brothers CD there in 1999 Wow yeah that fucking Club was so hot it was packed tight ceiling wild motherfuckers Texas people wild Texas Pete I like just chaos drinking good times fun nice people that are smart but they're also liked to get fucked up Absalon you in Texas this weekend I I don't know where I am yet you don't know where you know I'm waiting here on my schedule exactly yeah it's buffering but I actually took Dave to a phone store yeah you know we were preparing for the tapings and he never text me back and I'm like we're walking by this and I'm like just come in and look and he literally looks at the iPhone like it's the enemy of the people it was sustained I have an iPhone also I got the guy goes you could do anything on this you could text you can make a point you could do anything you could regulation to record your shows and Dave goes should we really play God I had a couple of good lines but I don't go past an iPhone to I feel like you know that's pushing it because now it's like up to ten right you have an iPhone to like yeah how many are like how many iPhones contains me Jaime bursts how many iPhones how many Rocky movies are there it was on me great shades Rocky's cuz now we have dosed Creed's CDs act now I guess it is cuz it's working off of the actual narrative of Rocky dear Michael B Jordan is talking about boxing Roy Jones jr. yeah oh god I hope it's a joke just straight-up boxing out one more time listen don't do that Michael just don't do that I'm sure he's a great athlete he's a beautiful kid he's got a great body looks like he knows how to box when he throws punches it looks like he really actually knows how to box I'm sure he's a really good athlete he was built like a brick shithouse right boxing Roy Jones jr. preposterous I don't know how to get hit the upside you never work again or you become a box you hang in there with them and you look like a hero I mean you clip them and hurt them I mean it is it is a humanly possible thing like when two people are throwing punches at each other that one of them could hit the other guy but silencer the downside is just ruined Roy Jones Jr's one of the greatest boxers of all time and still to this day knows how to box it's not like he forgot how old is it he's pushing 50 49 yeah he's pushing 50 if you think you think somebody whose idea was it I think he was just talking shit he was just probably being asked like who would you like to box who's your hero how many rounds though to that the quarter now what like that he said he would yes um who would you want to fight today and he said Roy Jones he would probably beat me in his prime but I'd probably fight him today's probably just like oh that isn't outrageous thing to say just an asshole thing to say is George Foreman listen he probably would kill you in his prime when the idea that he would just beat you I mean Roy Jones jr. when he was in his prime you were just waiting to see he was in a NAS song they said Roy Jones is in the new mike tyson's Roy Jones it's in this is like in the 1990s people forgot how good Roy Jones jr. was he was putting his hands behind his back and then knocking people out he was doing ridiculous she knocked out light heavyweight champion Virgil Hill with a body shot during hear it so he so we can hear the context okay listen do it after all your training for the Creed movies it you can hold your own in a fight I mean I did my thing a little bit you know something working out with Rocky we're going out with like you know Sam Apollo Creed I'm going one thing absolutely so who all time would you want to step into the ring with whether it's a boxer wrestler anybody by Lori Jones bro boy john-boy join that's my dude do y'all drop like I do my thing a little bit yeah well my thing right now is prom now hip-hop not in my cell but like right now I could do one thing why he was a Joe were you funnier than George Carlin in his prime now since he did I know you've had a few drinks from the rest some questions John Jr what he said he was training with rocky that was the best part know their names the black eyed the black guy blacc panther2 he's awesome plays a good superhero he's a great ad guy I love his movies he was a good bad guy in that movie but you know I it's like you just shouldn't answer that just made a mistake you know young cocky full life everything's going well you know and again built like a goddamn superhero yeah thinks he could box the world there's just a different thing that's gonna be happening if you're standing in front of Roy Jones jr. it's a different thing he's got a computer that's many many times you bring ROI more robust than yours when it comes to box just taking the punishment it's not like you know it's like okay that's enough it gives you a concussion and you never ask that's the upside for you by the way a 50 year old boxer looks at this actor pretty boy and it's like when they bet then when they brought um what's-his-name out of the box and pulp fiction yeah I mean he's jacked though look at them twos Bilger seriously bollocks but see the thing is like there's such a giant difference between learning how to box and being a good athlete like he clearly is and being Roy Jones jr. the the the gap is so wide it's so it's like if I did a movie about playing basketball and then I wanted to you know play a one-on-one versus Kobe Bryant you know I've been playing this movie for a couple years now I'm feeling good even though I never did any competitive basketball player you were in the white shadows like he got beat up well that was in the movie I'm sure he knows how to throw his hands I'm sure he does he looks good in the movies he looks like he really knows what he's doing but Roy Jones jr. is one of the greatest of all time he was a phenom he knows how to box in a way that you're never gonna understand so how long has he been since he boxed ten years I mean Roy Jones had a fight within the last two years well I think his last fight was I want to say it was to less than two years ago I think he retired he had a bunch of fights over in Russia he actually became a Russian citizen is that it this year Jesus Christ play some of it play he's not just challenging a retired boxer dude challenging a box he's fucking Roy Jones jr. all right just just this is a different thing it's one thing if you're like a top level pro right now while you feel like you would have got knocked out by Roy in his prime but you can give them a go right now okay that I that is that's believable you're a professional boxer you've been honing your craft in the gym for years and years you've been sparring and work with high-level coach it's look at it he's still roid Jones jr. still Roy Jones jr. even though forty it doesn't matter he's boxing one can either once a boxer but Roy Jones is in a boxing match here and he's looking good I mean he's obviously not fighting a guy who's the best in the world up here Roy Jones jr. do you call your agent right now serious what's the money he's already been doing all these interviews he's like I don't want to get out of bed early in the morning but if you know if he wants to really do this we could do this would be a wonderful opportunity to show people with boxing is all let me see what he said I would love to see that here let's hear what Roy says of course I saw the video first thing is you know I never ducked a fight in my life nothing right never came to come down here so ain't nobody if michael people's real contact were jones me and we don't make happen yes it you got my number he can contact you and get my number system from TMZ listen baby right now he said in the video he said I think he would probably have killed me back in his prime that's true do you ask what many can't beat you now even though you are 49 money I know you can't beat me steel because I mean I know he's probably in better condition because he's younger and though you could probably think even go along go ahead probably things he may be a bit even not working now but I'm a bit old that's right if old school been ain't going out like that to have the heart come with me I love you hear me so I open unstable box me so I'm not this just change my right away because then you don't get the experience for box I'm a professional like I am and I know he's big and strong cuz you got strong for the movie yeah I should be able to pull all that taking the deep once we understand what a boxing match really yeah now you don't know what does oh I got no no no no i'ma need five six rounds at so I want you to see how I really feel so that's why I'm talking like that not because I think he can really match my skill I really don't even that for the net and how long would you need Roy to get right to where you could step in there like what's the soon as we could make this fight happy I probably for him about four or five weeks to time it's on Michael please listen to me don't do this someone call StubHub just don't do this this is not gonna work out well especially if you're but I would assume both of them are not gonna be drug tested I don't think either one of them wants to pee in a bucket and if they they just let Roy Roy go to dr. feelgood yeah pop them up with hormones this is gonna be a rout this would be terrifying imagine this is a new getting that call from his agent hey we have an offer for you to do this like new superhero movie it's gonna be amazing Michael's like I'm booked that whole five weeks I got a train for Roy Jones jr. like don't do it but this is a new this is a new genre of TV show of the real guy versus the guy played in the movie well I want to see doctors against guys who played a doctor once the astronauts against guys who would feature an astronaut I want to see it all versus chicken I want to see isn't that what Mark Wahlberg said if he was on the plane will ya down Spy vs city did he really say that though that's what everybody says I'm sayin I never heard him say that it's funny to think it's a crazy thing to think you know who knows what the fuck you would do if you thought that you were just gonna land somewhere you know that's the idea that you knew what was gonna happen before it happened nobody knows well while that shit's going down somes got box cutters they're holding a waitress there holding a stewardess by the neck like you know oh you don't know what the fuck's happening you have no idea what's going you're afraid to move yeah and you know I'm sure that a lot of people would step up but you you know it could potentially cost that person in their life and then when the plane lands that person's dead when they maybe if you don't know right you don't know the actual scenario now obviously we know was a horrible thing and you should do whatever you can to stop them because they're gonna kill everybody no matter what but back then you didn't know I mean if someone just took the plane and landed it stewardess you didn't know that's right he would be like glad I didn't do anything you jumped up and he cut her face off yeah you know it's like in in those moments when you don't know what's gonna happen said if I was on that plane okay if with my kids the winner went down like it did there would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin than me saying okay we're gonna land somewhere safely don't worry hmm that see I I see where he's coming from right he's got a he's got kids that he loves he's got a family that he loves he wouldn't have sent still that's what he's saying yeah that's what he's saying and in his mind he probably has that conviction even if it meant killing everybody's life would you you know would it work if it didn't work like what do they have do you know what they have they don't know you know they have a box cutter do they have anything else how many of them are there you don't know like yeah is anybody gonna back you up does anybody else know how to fight you know you could get fucked up you could you could step up thinking you're Billy badass and this guy is some trained actress yeah who smashes your face in and and cuts you up with a box cutter that could happen to still pulls his belt off and blow the plane up you could who the fuck knows Matt that's why there's professionals right that's where there's professional those air marshals that can assess a situation and figure out and obviously you know they weren't either they weren't there on that plane or they couldn't help thinking about if I was in that position I'd you know how could you I mean who the fuck knows what you would do well since I look like I'm on the other team I would have said my friend I'm like I'm part of the team Dave do your fine fuck man yeah you be you know have you ever been so scared that you're frozen instant for a second oh yeah yeah you you can't know what the right thing to do is and the wrong thing could be so catastrophic right as far as to say like that he's making announcements on the plane yeah when this is all happening like we're landing say like he's now the pilot in the right that's true yeah movie you get to grab the intercom at the end and go thanks for flying so and so air sometimes you say things like that because that's how you feel and you don't about how other people are gonna perceive it that's what I would assume that statement is it's guys how he felt like fuck that I'm landing this fucking plane I'm confident fucking terrorists Yeah right that's what he told us kids one night the problem is you're saying that to billions of people and billions of people hear that and they go what and then all these people get to assess your your statement whether or not hasn't he makes any sense like what are you gonna do you can kick everybody's ass okay sure I know a lot of dudes who if they were there and you tried to do that you'd get smashed right like there's scary people in this world there's some weapons on them oh no and I would assume if you're ready to die like that you have a very strange kind of conviction too if you know you're ready to die and you know how to fight like Wolfe Jesus I don't mean who knows but it's like just the idea that you would have to think about it that's what's really terrifying what do you mean the idea that you would have to think like what do I do if something is someone does hijack them don't you all think that yeah every every situation now there's that what we do do what happens yeah what do you do I mean so you hear people run and they survive and you people run and get shot down and they go to the wrong way anytime a tragedy like that happens like what the fuck no horrific random set of sequences and you're in the wrong spot you do the right bro ik how about how many people must do the heroic thing and then they die anyway you never know about it all for sure I wonder what uncle Steve did in that situation yeah it seems like those fucking things are happening more and more lately all the time Fitz is the rate more accelerated now then it's ever been before as well as the numbers of these like shootings and shit it's like what is happening what the fuck is going on that this keeps happening if they happen like every couple of days there's like a little one like a two or three people one right just like not that big a deal anymore well that's what it was when it was about knives and swords people would go on a killing spree yeah but now it's you kill more people and you you know not everybody would die with a knife London has a bunch of knife attacks London has so many knife attacks that they're there their murder rate exceeded new york city's murder rate with just knives Wow Google that make sure that's true the machete attack the fucking president or the the mayor of the president the Mayor of London was saying something that they won't tolerate knives anymore can't have knives sounds sounds better I know but everybody's like why in New York you know it knives you have a guy who's off his meds and he's just like walking around with a hammer you know so it could happen it doesn't really matter what the weapon is okay London has overtaken New York for murders for the first time in modern history after a surge of knife crimes across the capital verdict though selective use of statistics from the start of 2018 appeared to bear this out but the reality is that New York still appears to be more violent than London yes right now man New York's on fire it's great you love it it's great I haven't been there as much late in the last few weeks but when I'm there and all summer I was there though you're a freedom guy yeah I love the way you live in your life you just fly here you fly there have you been to his houses have you been seven I've seen photos of the pool the LA one is awesome the New York one is like I don't know don't he you can tell like he doesn't live there you know it's like a crash pad but it's a it's a nice place I'm not saying it isn't but it's an old-school New York building with the elevator what the guy has to use yeah you know the elevator I don't fancy snobby Fifth Avenue co-op but like you know I had to go through a co-op interview Buddy Hackett wrote my recommendation that's New York it's all rules so many permits I'm you know oh God LA it's tricky there's shootings there's fires that's why that Caravan turned back does that one do you see the photos of people like running towards the border and gas coming at them and though the whole idea is like knowing this is a big group of people headed towards the border like what is this like what's going on here what's anybody fleeing they're terrified imagine what they are leaving to come to that oh for sure ya know imagine what's at home but it's playing on doors that it's all like this planned out event like everybody's watching the ride my gracious Lord the Bulls this ever happened before yeah there was something that someone posted about Obama in 2013 the deal during the Obama administration wasn't like Obama was Hawking tear gas over the fence but somebody during that administration appeared to have used tear grass tear gas on an illegal immigrant as well but it wasn't I don't think it was this kind of thing this this kind of thing seems like the Cuban boatlift like that's what I felt like about it's like they're fleeing you know like a despot or you know yeah it's political and economic it's everything I mean we they want to come to the promised land like all of our ancestors did that's why we're here but then we got to a point like yeah I don't think it's just about just about they want to come here it's about what's at home that they got to get away yes yes and now with the internet and information they go wow maybe we don't have to be in this gang sure maybe I can get my kid out when he's three instead of watching a guy at 15 yeah and have opportunity I mean that's what everybody wanted to came here in the first place it's just at this point if you're a poor person from Guatemala I mean how hard is it to emigrate to America if you don't have any skills you have a very short education it's got to be really fucking hard to become a u.s. citizen probably super difficult you got to be super brave I would go in another language - really yeah figure out how to get through all the other countries and into America you don't have to learn it but it certainly helps if you want to thrive I would go to Costa Rica have you been down there love it yeah like everybody I know who's been there they're like this is the place like I'm gonna move here after I retire so you know that might be like a good second place you know guy offered me weed girls and coke in front of my daughter while I was holding her hand and surf lessons everybody there's a professional surfer girl I'm like yo bro I'm holding a five-year-old hand this is outrage she's like Congress rule discount I'm like what dude is offer me coke hanging like right there what you need to monkeys are everywhere man there you go monkeys fucking they eat Oreos they open them up and chew the white part first yeah they eat so many Wow if they know how to pop them up and they chew that white shit Wow like ya know yeah we were concerned we were like should we really give the monkey a cookie I mean cookies are toxic it's all sugar we gave the monkey the monkey took that thing pop the time probably lives on a steady diet of Oreos because Oreos are in the minibar the hotel and the monkeys right there Oreo man I want to see they have no fear of people just know they have a little bit of fear a little bit of apprehension there's definitely size you up because I'm sure they run into dickhead humans and they're fucking dangerous man I mean if they decide to fuck you up they they can hurt you they can claw your face apart thank you yeah they can really do damage if they especially decided to act as a group but they just seem to be a kind of monkey suing at me once on a TV set and I'll never I'm never gonna hear another one sweetie your face yeah just I don't know if I was holding his hand we were entering it like we were entering I was hosting the gong show pilot a million years ago and I was entering with a fucking chimp pole in his hand we were an awesome champ matching tuxedos and I got along with them all day rehearsals and then whatever when that man kicked in and the lights were in the road and the audience we cherished yeah hey really I don't know if he was asking for more money or like oh that's makes sense man it probably hurt his ears probably so confused all the people there doesn't speak your language nobody has any good what I I do like where I was on another TV show and the they had the monkey yeah and they go hey like whatever clarabelle whatever your name it they're like this is Dave shake hands and the monkey didn't even stop hugging that person just let the foot come up and I shook their foot cuz their feet are like hands and I was like how cool is that I couldn't get over it I was like if you could shake hands with with your feet like wouldn't you do it all the time it's like oh hey what's up okay so I can keep doing my other stuff yeah like not a bumpy yeah I was like that's really cool I just shook feed him they're versatile yeah alright maybe it's not that great a story but I still think that's a good monkey story that's a win for both I like communication but then you know parrots of course we could talk about it all night people keep parrots as pets and then they die cuz parrots live to be like nine yes we do so you get some old lady's parrot that still got sixty years left in it always want attention there we really yeah they want to sit right on your shoulder or hidden in your hand they want you to open up the cage talk to them they want to be around you all the time parrots are smart man they do not like to get just left alone if you think you're gonna be some asshole as a cute bird sitting in the cage the middle of your living room oh that's my paradigm interesting know that parrot needs you hey hey that's right they want attention like come on motherfucker I don't want to just sit in this cage let me out let me out let's walk around I'm just setting your shoulder but I don't know TV come on I'm fucking bored this parrots are smart man the reason why they'd be I mean you're not smart didn't know they live that long they live all long this time a long race yeah they smarter or more than owls Davis right I'm always insert to the next aisle joke that's over I'm my big thing well we know that Ravens are really smart there's a super smart they saw puzzles and shit like scientists have set up all these puzzles or our Ravens with I'll tell ya they'll take a stick and then use the stick to get a longer stick and use that stick to get the get the food out like multi-step like problem solving Ravens can do weird shit but uh and we know that you know but a bunch of other different birds are pretty fucking smart but I don't know my Hawks my Hawks I've Hawks in my neighborhood they're smart who fly right over my house all the time and they're they're fascinating the watch they they really like to show off yeah I would assume that all those predators have to be smart I mean they just had they have to be ruthless and smart you know to get along if you're out there picking up squirrels and rats and shit like they're doing did you firebomb and out of the sky yeah snatching things up from angles that only they understand my friend tom was in his backyard sitting down having a cup of coffee and he saw the dove land on top of his fence yeah and then out of nowhere this hawk just Wow boom he said it was like a big explosion of feathers that the hawk just swooped in going like 150 snatched the Dove right off it and took off the hill and he was just sitting there with his coffee as him like what the fuck wow I was like 10 yards from my head I just thought it was that dove I would have fucking it I would have landed safely back on your buddy fuck if I was a dog with kids the plane well that would make him motivated he's just you know pretty sad I see yeah well I'll give him that he probably does have to fight a little bit too it looks like he does does in that movie play Micky Ward looks like he knows how to box he definitely knows how to throw punches you know this Michael B Jordan thing's fascinating to me cuz he'll listen money on it I hope he does someone will tell him I'm look I'm sure he's a smart guy and I'm sure he's a great athlete and I'm sure he probably knows how to box but if you kind of box a guy like Roy Johnny you know what you do you started the amateurs and you learn how to box then you become a professional and then one day you box Roy Jones like Paul Newman and the racecars sorta but I'm not going you're not getting hit see the the very unique thing about combat sports is you're getting hit yeah so it's not like someone's dunking on you look if you play basketball with Kobe Bryant you're gonna get lit up you're gonna look like a fool but you're not gonna get hit a few boxes Roy Jones jr. you're gonna get you're gonna get dinged Michael B Jordan got knocked out during the Creed filming axed by with an accidental punch that landed with really yeah well they're hitting him and he tried to like turn his head at the last minute but he didn't turn it quick enough and he got clipped and dropped maybe that's why those he can take a punch now well I mean maybe that's given him the confidence he did it on purpose he was I think it just I think you know the way it was is like you take the punch then turn your head but it looked like you took the punch just a little too hard that's real right but really real gloves there then I use them are using boxing gloves oh goodie people I love those Korean movies and these die all time so you see something like this you don't know if it's like some thing they do for a publicity stunt like watch this though see that they're practicing it like this see right there no see that's real dude yeah that's real see the way his head snaps and his eyes go play that again that's real I know what a real knockout looks like I've seen a thousand of them in person that's a real knockout watch this look at this he fucked up and he's out yeah he's a cold dude he's out cold 100% watch this he ran right into the punch his head snapped back his eyes rolled behind his head and he went unconscious but that is 100% legit knockout but that punch was not even a punch what what he was hit with he'd never the body behind it he didn't have any power behind it so he was basically knocked out just by coincidence no you know there's definitely power behind it yes yes that listen you could KO someone easily just doing that really that was a perfect punch it was a perfect punch that landed on ja as he was moving forward that's the key the key is that he was turning his head into it and he didn't think it was coming and he took it right on the jaw if you want plate one because I didn't see this he's there choreographing how the sequence is gonna go and somewhere along the line either is a miscalculation or a mistake was made totally Jordan what's this what's this right here see that he fucked up and he turned his to do it yeah and that guy is throwing like I mean even though it's not the most powerful punch in the world it's faster than I thought and he knows how to punch okay so his weight is behind that his shoulders behind that that's a guy who's punched people in the face before he knows exactly how to do it so even though he's only doing it like this even though he's only doing that so who'd like run into it and he catches her in the chin you're going out of course that's what happened so why why how did that get leaked she didn't know if it got leaked or if they put it out on pi think they put it out to show they think they probably probably put it out the showing this is hard training they're doing for this and you know there was an accident on the set and he got knocked out I would be not to what clip I'd want out there if I was him it was like that's it very even that was he was younger than he's bigger and stronger now he's older his body's more mature but either way oh what a box Roy John that's in the first one you gotta become a career boxer I mean this is unless he's like so old why you can't take Joe he's not gonna do it or he would never have given up his strategy like that I need him five six right no no that's just shit talking anything did that his whole career exactly how he was gonna beat guys his whole career joy really yeah he's still right Jones jr. this is crazy talk like him saying I played dumb and be like maybe he's good I'll do it that's not what he would do he would say this is how I'm gonna do it and then he would go out and do it Sam I'm gonna need you to get tired out and see what it feels like to be in a real fight you take a beating yeah man look it's like when Tom's jr. just gets you into the third fourth and fifth round you're all your adrenaline dump is gone because you're not used to boxing a world-class boxer in a professional match that's on pay-per-view that millions of people are watching you not used to that experience so that experience is taxing it's nerve-racking you're gonna have all this adrenaline rush through your body even if you're the the cellist of chill do sure you're gonna be just a little bit too amped up so then we're on that second round comes in you started heaving and you can't breathe that good and you're just kind of like Roy's just kind of boxing you just boxing you it's not hurting you he's just boxing you occasionally you could stung a little bit then the third round moves in and then he starts moving left and right and coming in stinging you hard the jab stepping in with a lead hand uppercut you're like oh fuck yeah now you're getting teed off on and now he's talking he's danced and he's moving around and then he's just starts throwing bombs on you and you can't defend him because you're exhausted and he hooks you to the liver and drops you he's starting running around trying to get away free can't get away he's too good he's been doing it for too long but Jones said that he says yay poppy could go long and hard on me because he's all trained up but do you think he would come out I'm like Full Tilt in the first round or two and just like really like take him to school you know like beat him down that's a dangerous because when you get real aggressive is when you get hit because when you get real aggressive see if I know you're coming at me you're running at me you're running at me all I have to do is figure out how much time and space I need to get something off as you're coming at me because I know where you're going it's dangerous when you don't know if someone's coming or going when someone's not you don't know if they're coming or going that's when the fight is weird so the beginning of every fight people are feeling each other out and they don't realize someone's coming - going if I know that you're just running at me and I'm Roy Jones jr. I'm gonna step back and I'm gonna time it and I crack you and I'm gonna crack you in a way that you probably don't see coming you probably don't see it in the gym too much I'm just gonna stiff arm you with a jab pop you in place step to the left boom he's gonna trust God right hand on your chin he's gonna fuck you up and then he's gonna turn around he's gonna be behind you and he's gonna look at you to see if you're still okay and then he's gonna do it again he's gonna keep doing it if you keep chasing after him you're gonna still get fucked you gotta get fucked up trying to get your face punched in so the only other thing is to do is like you got a boxing so okay now you're boxing one of the greatest boxers of all time and you just an east you're gonna just figure you're out like what do you got what do you do when I do this what happens when I do this what happens here uh can I have punched you or I could have and then he's gonna figure out when to move and when you're gonna get tired he's gonna start dropping bombs on you it's gonna be awful would you inspected it if he said oh you know I want to box a few matches first and then get to write I think he's just talking shit he's just having a good time he's probably didn't expect anybody to run with it he didn't expect people to analyze it that's the guy who you know him in that video this guy he's an actual real officer oh yeah he knocked out David Haye before his name is Tony Billy oh dude that's just that guy's a legit boxer he just got stopped by that badass Russian motherfucker on look one TV really recently like his guy that's he's a top-flight boxer so for him to knock him out of course it was just he's so good man so for him to do it accidentally makes complete total sense that guy's a beast man that's like a legit top-flight boxer so he's in there even just accidentally getting punched in the face by want to see the movie I'll tell you that Michael to recover and get back to training and and and filming after that it's like you never in the heavyweight class you never saw absent old the movies you know it was always like I know right you know they were like they were like basically punching bags you know no no it's like they have to be said Tyson you saw abs when he came out of prison remember that I guess so when you before Peter McNeeley dude he was prison jacked that was like maybe the scariest Tyson everybody system and all you've been doing in jail is was enough I don't think he could box in jail so I think he was just lifting weights remember he was SuperDuper jacked when he got out of jail I think he was yeah see go to Tyson's Pete yeah that's Tyson versus McNeely that was in 1995 he looks good there terrifying that was the most terrifying movie Tyson ever he just looked like he was made out of steel just think of a man and I'll never forget the fucking way in or the staredown rather because during the staredown Peter McNeeley signed up for that fight knowing that he's a tough guy who's gonna take a fucking vicious beating that's what he signed up for he knew what he was doing he knew he's gonna give it his all but he knew it if you had a bet most people are not betting on Peter McNeil yeah but you could see it in Tyson's face when he's staring him down there's this crazy but he's following him everywhere he goes like a frat dude it's like a predator who can't wait to get the green light to let the genie out of the bottle watch this this is Tyson's first fight like look see Peter McNeeley kind of looking down and you look over Tyson look at his eyes oh yeah that is fucking terrifying if you're looking at that and he's smiling and trying to like he's trying to like make light of it oh my god and he looks just like a prison guard dude he is easy oh yeah he does be definitely done that same hair after the truck Green Mile hair I sat next to Tyson after the at the Charlie Sheen roasts and made a lot of jokes about him and afterwards dice called me I didn't really know dice at the time and called me like a couple weeks later he's like he's like he's like he's like he's like basically said that he couldn't believe I said those things to Mike Tyson like he was offended now what do you mean well he's like do you have any idea what that animal could have done to you would two feet away that we've been friends ever since I didn't think about Tyson he seemed like a pussycat at the time at the time but if that was Tyson for like 1986 I think if I watched an old fight yeah by the end of the night I'm literally like laughing into his lap well what I loved it yeah yeah he loved he could take jokes he could take jokes oh yeah but you wouldn't wanna do that imagine I said I don't want to piss you off Mike if you would do that to your face imagine what you would do to mine [Laughter] he's basically the only celebrity to ever pull off a face mask right off a stack I don't know who else has done it what celebrity if you Charles Manson well those those mumble rapper duties yeah like postman alone type characters yeah Takashi's 69 but he was the first by a long stretch and now you're saying pulled off as if he pulled that off still Mike Tyson like good you know me Gucci Mane oh that's right he had the ice cream cone was that first though Wow wow that's a commitment look at that that really she has that on its face anymore there's new pictures and I get that all that'll get you a moved yeah they can laser that shit off but I haven't but looks like somebody carved that into his face it doesn't even look like a tat well

though he's got more cats oh so they're all over the place that dudes always smiling ever since you got out of jail he seems like the happiest guy in the world for real he's got a beauty good on him so but why is there ice cream like right there like does he have a tongue where he's like hey look I can know because then we'd only be able to lick the bottom part he wouldn't even get the real ice cream I would say the ice cream cone somewhere else it's got a lot of tattoos yeah it looks good though but the pearls take some the mean out of it but the highest tattoo you have to your face so it

of them that show was fun that was a good one Joe you really rock that channel it was fun that was a great show that should never take it off the air pumping mics yeah but I hope it's not a I hope it's not a bad like I give him always a hat from every show he always helps me out and it's like I thought they'd go nowhere the show's that's not true now this one's listen this is our moment I don't believe in that kind of jinxes this is our moment this is gypsy curse don't you talk about your last special took a long time they get together this took took us a lot of years go not even it was it came together pretty quick from Montreal to a year later we shot it but like I feel like it's also like about our friendship or whatever you want to call it for 25 years so it kind of puts a puts a nice button on it it's the first button maybe what are you doing over there mixing up I just don't want to leave my ashes has a lot of weird coffee kind of straw so you letting me smoke in here was like thank you I think you've got no problem glad it works this thing works great there's any like low spectrum people watching our show you can watch watch davidís cigarettes you'll learn a lot of my weird phobias dice was the reason why I put it in microfiche is he smoking now he doesn't smoke his master I haven't I haven't seen quite a while but last time he did the podcast was he smoked the last time or a time before that he takes time off I think for a while he would just bring him on smoking he's smoking smoking a lot I saw him I came on his new podcast recently and it's I'm over here he made me he made me pretend he was half an hour late even though I was 10 minutes he had a whole bit worked out where I got to go in the studio and just wait and talk to myself basically that he has to come in pretending he's late that was that was the only direction for an hour and a half it's so funny man that's he cracks me up so much my first time so my second time headlining was opening for Ray Romano in Poughkeepsie and dice is at the height of his fame I'm dressed like I'm like you had to be to even get work and it's like I'm a Jersey comic 1990-91 it dices at the at the hip see Civic Center right next door to the comedy club and uh and our hotel we heard dice was staying there people were pulling the fire alarms it's like it was like the biggest basil rock star yeah they're pulling fire alarms try to get everybody evacuated yes so dice would come out right finally our show on his shows on Saturday Friday night now ray Romano's headlining epic ipsy whatever close bananas and just I'm up there I'm doing my 10 v 12-minute opening and through the darkness this guy I kind of recognized from like you know news articles was a club soda Kenny comes through the darkness with a note it's Friday night and the note just says please welcome the undisputed king of comedy and so as I read it and a place on stage he does whatever like a 15-minute guest set the crowd goes crazy they loved it and then I learned a lot actually Ray Romano came up as the headliner who was not known at all he wasn't on TV yet and killed Ray's agronomic crops but I really learned like oh you know what the audience will follow we'll watch a great comic no matter what just happened ray was in his prime back then - I open up for red Jimmy's comedy alley in Queens yep and Ray was that was when Ray was just he had done HBO he'd done something on HBO but he was just a machine man people people didn't realize how means he is break down those guys that people don't talk about when they talk about like great stand-up comics that's right he hasn't put a lot of stuff out there in a long time ever since Everybody Loves Raymond you know a lot of stuff as far as to stand up he just shot a Netflix special at the cellar you know so that should be coming out soon but you're right he hasn't put out anything until I think this is like his first real hour so he I know he was working with Kevin James they did a bunch of gigs together some I'm friends with Kevin yeah he goes on the road but he still murders was my point that's right he's still Murray coming he was always so funny and you could always kind of someone once described the like you could air drop him anywhere in his act to kill yeah like anywhere in America before people are late able we're all kind of the same like we all kind of listen to the same stuff now but he's another guy that couldn't be a nicer guy one of the 90s he's always been really cool to me anyways yeah you know like do the height of his fame never changed for a second mm-hmm never mind of weird how the asshole sort of disappear eventually you don't even know where they evaporate to well when I'm still here you know you're talking about you're a comedian you almost before you're an American right that's when and that doesn't mean I don't love Mike I'm not trying to act like I'm very horse of course I made this thing you're so attached to being a comedian this is my blood right in a way that well you feel more comfortable with comics and how devastate it would be if the other comics didn't want you around [Laughter] man without a country that's that's where it gets fucking dark man right yeah that's where it so anybody who falls into that group like you've you've fucked up like the whole thing is to be friends with the comedian yeah the hang is what it's about you know the hang so how did you feel let me ask you how did you feel when you were in self you know you you pulled yourself out of the world at a comedy store where you started did you feel like on a desert island by yourself or did you find community at the other clubs or I never found the same thing but I just kept working and I was working with ari and Joey and Duncan I still kept working with those guys so it was like I was working with most of the same comics and I was just doing practice sets at the ice house and at the improv I remember all that it's just to me it was more it was you know the hang was not the same the hang is I would do my sets the end problem just get the fuck out of there there's no place to hang out it's not like the same now you get to do for show you get to do stand-up on the spot roast battle main room o R and whatever you figure out in the parking lot without everything and then a podcast in the basement you can take it literally you can put a gym in there you'd probably never leave everything in that place you could do three I've done three shows no I've done four shows on the night because one night I did two sets in the main room one set in the belly room and one set in the or because it was to show that's crazy this motherfucker so many times everything I ever taped with you on this show I developed having to try to follow him Wow like steamrolling like civilization everything from Harvey Weinstein to like his own inner fucking craziness that's that's all in 20 minutes so it's like the crowds you know like like get spoiled when they see so many great acts like just come by and just like for like 10 bucks 20 bucks whatever they get to see you know Chris Rock yeah you know you Joe and like just like people dropping by and working on stuff they're like is it like this all time like you don't even get it you just saw a $500 show for like you know two drinks you know well I always say that to the people at the cellar too if you're a fan of comedy it's in New Year's right together I had tribute all this to the thing that you hate things when the internet did all this that's true the reason why everybody's aware of how fun it is to go to a live comedy show how fun it is to watch guys like they'll go to see you at the store and then they'll go see again six months later oh that fucking comedy central and HBO and Showtime and Netflix that's definitely central definitely made it for sure Comedy Central for sure all those things definitely a tribute to it but about evening at The Improv tube is one of the biggest factors the fact that people can watch stand-up on YouTube that's a giant factor the people that are watching YouTube is off the charts and the fact they can just type in right now Jeff Ross stand-up comedy boom and instantaneously get it right and a lot of those clips come from Comedy Central right and going which Bo and all the other places which is great it's like it's all it all contributes not one thing that did it but I think the one big important factor was this new channel of distribution and that's the internet whether it's Netflix which is probably one of the biggest thing right now for stand-up comedy specials ever right and there's never been a thing like Netflix well we're dealing with three episodes it's like exactly who else would let you do that the pressure off like one shiny special you know like you can do be more creative with how you present your art oh yeah well if you wanted to do a two-parter next time you could we're gonna have to narrow it right re did was right that yeah not the turrets but one that he's working on right now but the last one that's right in the same place yeah yeah that our he's so good man he's a preview with my harping on was that like the comedy special is completely reinvented lately but do it as a series you could do whatever you want but as a comedy fan Netflix is perfect because you know you don't have to you know you get to control what you see you know and you can watch it and stop it and watch it more and even stop it I was watching our show when it came out last night I was just laying in bed watching our news show cuz I was by my sisters and like when it gets to the end of the episodes you gotta know where that remote is try to get you to binge come on our first episode ends with Dave just looking in the camera I mean like our next episode starts at five four three I heard that you got to see the new Mike judge animated show about country music called yes stories and was wrote stories from something that sounds great yeah he is another guy man that guy is so down phenomenal my folks even Ella was just talking about it on his podcast was it called tales from the tour bus yes from the tour bus is supposed to be insanely funny yes about George Jones and all those guys but it's all like gunplay and drugs and chaos country music stuff and then they animate like the story it's really cool he really is a talented guy man funk music race this one ah yes that's it there's one elbow ways I thought was all country guys yeah I thought so too but there's a different separate season click on that the Highwaymen click on Highwaymen oh that's with Willie Nelson Willie Nelson Mel Oh Spotify Waylon Jennings Kris Kristofferson and Johnny Cash that's an episode damn that's just a song highway Ben so that's the song that with the group the highwayman when y'all got that mega group yeah but but that's not an episode of yes it is this is a playlist of songs here and oh I get it okay this must be a new season whether it is in the seventies people do you know that song highwaymen yeah that's what a starship across the universe devised and when I reach the other side that's a creepy song right it's about yeah a carnation and dude yeah you never fade away yeah got the people built built this country yeah blood sweating but getting them all together I wonder what that was like I know right those those guys we're singing how's it going how's young gunner doing you know boys it's already 3:30 oh wow time flies rogon this is amazing man when everything I do
