the Joe Rogan experience no the guy who has the accordion the monkey dance the monkey dances and I love the sound of the accordion and I just I saw it and I just wanted to bring something to the new studio I like how you have a lot of weird shit here mm-hmm and this is weird that somebody loved this sound so much that they decided let's make an instrument out of it yeah are there like real complicated ones of those like do people play them and were cast risen shit no I don't think they made it into the orchestra so it's never been like a really respected piece of musical instrument design ICO New Orleans buckwheat zydeco you hear that sure yeah Sam fear master of the pan flute of course what happened that poor bastard like he had a whole marketing team behind they like dude no one's done this but we're gonna do this master the pan flute DVDs CDs VHS tapes we're gonna sell it all there's literally no competition there's nothing you can do that your Zamfir he's the Tony Hawk of the pan flute he looks like a guy that works in the deli that is a very forgettable sound it's a recorder it's for like when the one things you learn when you're in fourth grade and they teach you music yeah I never I never paid attention to the recorder because they gave me the recorder and I go well boy how come I don't see this in bands yeah the fuck out of here I'm not gonna spend some time learning an instrument that no one plays you had to though you carry it in your sock they didn't even have cases yeah old tube sock from your dad and put it in there that's right no it's a taste for the fucking recorder no yet to put in your dad's sock and it didn't make any sense either that it was oh he's got it but he plays a flute right well it said pan flute when I typed it in but oh well he's a bad motherfucker yeah Jethro Tull's he's crazy looking dude he looks like he lives in a hollowed-out tree on the trail hello has anybody else figured out how to use the flute in rock and roll music besides jethro tull we need to know we're not alone yes when all our madness what was it like on the set when you were working with Dave Chappelle it was great well I've known Dane for a long time I was actually on the very first episode we by chance I was walking through New York and I saw Dave and this is before the show it even didn't even know it existed but I ran into Bobcat Goldthwait who's there and Mike what's up man what are you guys doing he's like he was oh hey Joe we're doing a TV sketch man you want to be in on it and I go I only have like 20 minutes I mean it was here he goes we're handing out ribbons for New York boobs and he had a box so it's me and him walking through Manhattan and he's got this crazy fake mustache on he's like you've got the best New York boobs and he would give someone like a ribbon for having New York boobs him it was really silly but fun and so I was like wow Dave's got a show and then you know turns out it's the greatest sketch show in the history of the world and a year later he calls me up again and asked me to do this thing for they wanted to do a fear factor sketch with Tyrone Biggums yeah so that's me and him fresh-faced Joe Rogan and Dave Chappelle thank you yeah well this is like what yours is that's 2003-4 yeah I think it's before that is it I think it's before that I want to say it's to 2002 maybe yeah because I wasn't even doing the man show back then and I was doing that in 2003 so I think it's 2002 The Fear Factor bit is one of my favorite that's a season two if I recall I think so yeah and is really one of the summers and one of the funniest bits in a show that is I would argue perhaps the greatest television show of all time I think it's the greatest sketch comedy show of all time yeah I'm saying something bigger it's hard to say that though because if you boiled down a lot of the all-time great shows like in living color or some of the other ones boy they had so many seasons if you boiled them down to two seasons maybe there would be some but he's got some sketches that worse just groundbreaking like the black white supremacist who was blind what about I was watching last night because Jeff and I were talking about Chappelle last night so I won the car ride home from this event we did together I was watching black bush which was another I think unbelievable which was about season two where he plays george w bush his version of George Bush and all the rationales for going into the war in Iraq and it's unbelievably funny yeah he's a real comedy genius but also a guy who's you know you wouldn't get it if you just sort of see him do stand-up but he's deeply introspective yeah very intensely well thought out you know he's not he's not a surface guy by any stretch of the imagination but it ended up being just this amazing finish so anyways when I tell Ari I want to go to this I'm kind of thinking that's the ballpark like cuz that's the only experience I have so the games in Atlanta he buys tickets and I'm like I go you're not flying coach you know that he's like no champ you go first Bert Burke his coach bill extension oh cool but Bert end up going from somewhere else so anyways he bought the ticket he got an air B&B a really nice house you know for a few days in Atlanta and then it's a you know it's the big thing is game day I'm thinking like oh that's cool that you got these tickets and you got you know but I think it's like reasonable and then we get to the stadium it was a total fucking disaster to get in because Trump went to the game so it was raining it was wet Secret Service everywhere to our lines to get into the venue and I paid a guy a security guy a hundred bucks to walk us through the line which is which was almost impossible because it was so packed but I don't know he just started walking us through the line like in front of people people were yelling at the security guy which was like so uncomfortable he's like a young black kid and like old white people were like the fuck are you doing he's like I'm security and they're like you're not security you piece of shit like right to his right in front of us I was like god damn like I just have never seen someone flip out like that what we were doing was highly unethical we shouldn't have done it like we just weren't gonna wait in that line and then Bert of course Bert in a crowd like that he's like it's okay I'm famous we're famous guys like yelling that to people which is like no he didn't oh absolutely he's like everywhere we went if he went to a restaurant they would come up like hey can I get you guys something to drink and I he'd be like do you recognize like they're like what was he serious I think it's part of his like you know whatever style and then and they were like I'm sorry so part of a joke or part of it yeah kind of a joke he's joking but I'm not he's like half way in the middle because one time one time he was like we're famous comedians and the lady was like I know who you are he was like serious he's like weird but it's like you see him in his element it's like him in with crowds is really like you realized he really enjoys it like he really enjoys the large groups he enjoys being recognized he fucking like sometimes we were walking and people were like hey you're the guy I've seen you on Facebook he's like you my picture I know we were talking about how like people would say like Tom and I'm like yeah and they're like hey and then they would walk away they wouldn't come over to me they're like hi and then they'd walk another way but with Bert they're like I hug you and take the shirt off they say I think 55 is an amazing weight class right now we argue on Fox that they think they try to get under my skin and say light weight is the best division said don't blow me what's he after a beep yeah Abby was Abby's I haven't watched many of his fights I watched him I said I need to go back to my arm my mat he fights like it every time yeah he's a monster you see the Michael Johnson fight he's tied up I must be jump give up smashing alone his wrestling and his his his ground-and-pound is just so ferocious it's just on such another level and when he gets a hold of guys he's getting a hold of guys that are really good and just ragdoll on them like what he did to RDA did you ever see that fight yeah all right so yeah I haven't seen those fights I gotta go back and look rag-dolled RDS you know just beats the shit out of people get you to the ground how's the big fan he something special dude he's something special and the fact that he did that to Barboza he wants to move up 72 no he don't okay metabolic meals shit out sitting see my man he'll be by the pack nutrition is anybody out there I'm picking up the tab psycho has down there 55 I'm not trying to see no Kobe right now yeah he's making 55 easy now though so who knows I think what I believe is gonna happen is I think Connors gonna vacate I think they're gonna strip him cuz Connor has got a hundred million dollars in the bank and he's having fun and talking shit and he's gonna keep training and he's gonna make a big fight in the future yeah but I think beebe versus Tony is the big fight and fuck they might even do that one in Russia they do that one to talk about doing those big fight in Russia or that yeah if that happens well that's a good fight I mean everybody's been waiting to see that fight fuck yeah that's [Applause]
