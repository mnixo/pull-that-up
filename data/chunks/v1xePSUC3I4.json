five four three two one fresh from fucking table Brendan Schaub returns in the motherland you were in the motherland for days I was man the mother left that's the motherland well it's sort of one quarter of my heritage the capital fighting that's for sure Brogan is an Irish name I don't know if you know that lad yeah I'm one-quarter Irish everyone out there I'll bring Brogan alderman what do you want me I've ever been really yeah man those are savages they're just they're not even saying that they're savages they're super friendly yeah they're right from so friendly not that people were you know in Australia or London or Manchester weren't but in Dublin they're like house like damn I don't want to leave man look I loved it I was thinking yesterday where I was watching like comic Reger workout and like all the people were surrounded my was working out you know when those open workouts real weird and run hit in the bagging he's he seems to just be doing his work doing his normal work you know hitting the bag but there's just a circle of people like right there it is a lion well he can't even move no he can't like dance around he can't back up too much he's just right in front of that bag and he's got to pretend those people aren't there as he was the show right it's just a show to hype the fight more I guess it is of course make fun of them yeah yeah they won't make fun of them if he lands the way he did in that clip of Polly that's what I'm saying dude when he landed that straight left blam and snap Polly's head back I'm like hey Polly why didn't you talk about that really significant but if a guy like Connor McGregor does that that's straight and clean and sneaky and he announces to him and a little off-speed like a little off-speed in the initial part of the movement then he drops it in bang it's like snake like left hand like he's getting super comfortable if he can do that to Paulie Malignaggi like whatever you say about those clips all we know is that that's that's what we've seen we've only seeing these little short little clips like white here watch this left hand what should I sneak this in onto that left hand is fucking legit cause it's super legit here it is again watch this dude that is down the pipe call it what you want I mean grant that's the 12th round but still pot world champion yeah I don't know what round though was I don't care I mean I don't care can do that with that kind of speed to Paulie Malignaggi and time that like that that's the look you can't sleep on him he's got magic it doesn't always work that's always work kind of Diaz has a little magic to type imagine yeah that you know in that fight Nick Diaz had the magic it was just knock Connors night but the rematches collars did not really know I don't think it was I think the rematch was both of their night I think if you really want to look at that fight honestly the second fight I don't think you see a winner the only thing that I think you could say makes Connor a winner is that he dropped Nate but in able times the Nate was saying that he went down with punches anyway because he was hoping Connor would follow him to the ground which may or may not be true but it is a good strategy if you have a winter sport way too long Nate's got a wicked guard wicked aside like to get like when he gets clipped just to go down with it and to try to bring him to the ground like fabbrizio does that for Reese over noon absolutely does that he'll do it right given drop in the face with a left hand well it was a very good shot no doubt about it but the idea is if you get hit with a good shot you can decide to get him in you can decide to bait a man three times in a row I think you have to take it into consideration as a possibility once the Maharani every time he would try it we've never seen a good try you're right we never have he doesn't have these tendencies really fucked up Nate in a fight is Josh Thompson Josh Thompson head kicked him and every other fight even when he's gotten beat up like the doscientos fight he's got his legs beat up and just dos Anjos definitely want a decision Nate didn't get fuck up and stop he's never got his ass whupped josh is gonna stop them yeah but he still never got it like his that well you know what you could say the dos Anjos fight was kind of a beating dos Anjos is kicking the shit out of his wife coming forward like still that set never been broke you buy that they've never broke his will 100% even in the Thompson fight if they let it go you probably would've recovered eventually if you didn't go and correct see I think if the the real test of who's better Tom MacGregor are Nate Diaz is if they fight it 55 in the trilogy fight cuz 70 is a toss-up you know Nate 1 1 cotton 1 1 that's whatever they but they're both not fine at 70 then go to 55 you have your true I think win are there well you know what I mean I like Nate at 55 me too that her anyway like way back he gets real lean like in the michael johnson fight to destroy johnson i'm assuming that's what he's waiting for cuz they bought him fights right but he's just waiting on that big Conor payday I think him and his brother are smart you know they're huge cultural icons they can go places and get paid and they're still in the max for you know whatever weight class was defense for 70 they sure he is if he wants to be suspended for a long very long she's got a pay you just got a pay attention anymore really yeah he owes them $100,000 and he won't give it so I think he gave them like 65 you can't argue that though like Ramon with Conor like listen you're suspended you're not fighting you got to shoot a commercial for America shoot a bullying commercial yeah antes 175,000 comment cool just not fighting Vegas do it no no money just a 15-second tweet and then well we'll let you fight him but you gotta realize when a guy's throwing a monster energy drink and they're throwing water bottles this is so I don't like to say this but this is true dudes a big part of what's going on there that is theatrics that's no different than pro wrestling's called selling a fight it's called sound a fight and that's they're doing that throwing shit at each other selling fight do you think he's really trying to incite a riot like you know occasionally yes like the DC Jon Jones thing that was legit different annum innum and how much that sell the fight like the UFC was let's just keep like we do not approve of this this is ridiculous one more time show it again one more time I love that though best clip ever yeah you know thing they did they capitalized I don't know if they did on the John John saying you know I did cocaine a week before I beat your ass no they didn't that pest but greatest like the most savage line ever ever John Jones no joke and John Jones like in shape with something to prove like he did against Cormier he kicked him in the face my about how the fact he says the exact perfect thing after the fights over correct about damn smart mark Daniels it's just you know I mean it's so real for sure yeah he probably felt so much gratitude you know when I said to him like I didn't know what I was gonna say to him but when I said to him you made it back that's how I felt like not just that he made it back to the title but like he made it back from the Darklands from life made it back running away from a hit-and-run accident with who knows what the fuck you've got on you you know all that made it back understatement but I mean homeboy and people never stopped cheering for him very interesting you know Moody see ya but then John Jones his fame went up lady rope around and ran from the scene it's crazy I don't know first of all I don't understand how you could not be a fan of DC I don't understand it I don't understand there's nothing wrong with him like what what would you not be a fan of the guy's a fucking animal he's he won the Strikeforce Heavyweight Grand Prix defeated yeah I mean he's throwing around Josh Barnett who's a 255 pounds gorilla Daniel Cormier is poisonous he's macho man I mean the guy gets an MMA fairly late in his career right massively successful amateur wrestler gets into MMA and says running through people has a fight the first fight in the UFC is against Frank fucking Mir beats the brakes off former UFC heavyweight champion your first fight in the UFC and beats the brake and beats the brakes off I mean it wasn't satisfied no still whooped his ass yeah I got an underhook and it worked he says people like people got mad at him for the Anderson Silva fight that he liked he'll vanish that won't bother me a little bit to like I can see why fans like come on man there's until about two day notice or whatever the hell it was come on but Anderson front kicked him in the gut remember that yeah her her especially you'll see 200 such a big card and there's so much help when you don't perform pure like come on man and with DC I think the biggest thing is and it's not his fault he's better than everyone in the world at light-heavyweight except for John Jones so when John left and he had the title people Ike that's fake right his fault it's not his fault that's John be mad at John could you imagine if you get Daniels brain inside rumbles body oh my god that doesn't happen right it's not interesting how that doesn't happen it's like John Jones is the closest thing to a guy who's got insane talent but he also has like almost like dad Darrell Elkins Darren Elkins rather the Darren Elkins mentality of like never quit like remember when he got his arm hyper-extended but I've been real bad by vitor his arm was fucked up never tapped you know like when he fought the Gustafson fight he wasn't shape at all and went for a father which is the best fight ever and was winning the final round how about what against Ryan Bader who Brian Peters frickin good I think your time is right for or five in the world doesn't even really train they said they saw him like two days and went in there cradling like a baby whooped his ass in the first lady's ass I mean it's just time on a different animal man there's a different animal but he's also got this mindset like he has a real champions mindset or as like Rumble doesn't really like to fight he's just super good at it you don't think Rumble likes it says he doesn't he says that says he doesn't want to fight anymore so there's my brain trauma he doesn't want to be rolling around with John sighs what you're seeing I got that confused with DC no yeah rubble done yeah yeah but Rumble is like the scariest guy ever at 205 when it comes to striking my COO Fox ever been scarier than Rumble nobody owes Domeier pretty goddamn clothes right now oh he's scary right no technique just fucking display Oh Jimmy man he's like your power puncher dude cool check this yeah q interesting cat man interesting cat number three was he three in the world yeah he knocked out sir Coon off right knocked out Misha and then just mercs Jimmy Manoa in this like walkthrough and called it twos like I'm knocking out in the first minute or so he can go do it Jesus criminy v'n land anything like inside this clinch he catches him with that hard left hook these he's got hammers for fists too bro but he's like rushing it like you don't say calculated like you're John or you know like you're JDS where he's sitting back he's got confidence in store there's brick hands to your shakes hand oh cool Brock Lesnar style yeah now does that work against the Gus Finn and John Jones to the question might be champion the world just 70 Twitter followers you know I don't know he's changing his nickname to no time as nobody changes nickname - that's awful short time no time because like he points to his wat he was like pointing to his watch time that was like his move oh yeah no time focus Oh time like after the Fighting's like point to his watch it's like this is my new nickname is time I have no time no time he's nasty man he's very nasty he's got real legit 100% one punch power and when he Clips weight clips guys you can see they're like oh shit and he goes bananas on him see I think they should do Gusman jones right mm-hmm and then do Oh's de meyer verse DC mmm well if DC wants a fight again we're gonna see what he does he goes now I'm gonna fighting him i'ma fight John again Christ give it up my heart can't take it you think you should give it up I think it gets right back in there why not there's a good fight up until the moment John mind a high kick I agree I I don't think he ever beats John I think you might be right but you might be problem and then it gets even crazier but see I don't think he's ever gonna get the fight either I don't want to see it again certainly could be twice if he beats a few people you certainly because you could play clips of that fight and say you know he's doing very well in that fight I think John was winning I think John was landing more volume and he was mixing things up really well those bring rust - that's John kind of feeling things out and then once he got comfortable oh this is what we're doing he do shit he didn't seem ring rusty at all I see smooth right from the beginning a little smooth but III do think DC's pressure and stuff like that and just getting under his feet and once he did then he started tee off and take over I think yeah he found his rhythm and he found DC's timing you know started and then they settled in a little bit - once they got on to the second round both guys had exerted quite a bit energy hit each other quite a few times in that third round and then you're gonna be that I think that was DC's best chance to beat them now John's off to the races now yeah Oh's de Meyer good luck with no time there's oohs de Meyer there's gusts been then Brock Lesnar yeah it's deep a I think goes the heavy weight who knows man I mean if if they work out some sort of a deal where he fights broccoli as well oh come on Joe the course stay well when he called him out at the end of the fight I was like oh my goodness I saw Brad I saw Brad Pitt shadowbox on Instagram oh you better be careful son UFC gonna reach out signing CM Punk you know watch your rank Pitts would fuck CM Punk the Brad Pitt from snaps you know also I think Brad Pitt that guy lived with Angelina Jolie for like ten years no much rage he must have pent up inside I hate him with Johnny Depp just Orca talk of organic sustainable farming and adopting new kids smash just go in there fucking smash just Pitt smash on bitches just so angry at listen to that crazy lady lived with for decades made I'm not calling do you know that's a raging alcoholic it was we have to try to kid because I love kids which is a new one every goddamn day like I can't keep just kid after kid oh my god yeah I mean that's just my opinion he'd slap a bitch I mean maybe she's a wonderful person I mean she obviously is very charitable maybe she's not very nice the exhaust day that's the vibe I get hey bro she took she had a vial of Billy Bob Thornton's blood they she carried around her neck and billy-bob I'm not hating onion she was and is fucking beautiful I get it then I can't how people make mistakes you got around your neck for a guy like him Wednesday I can't get a girl like that universe's have to like collide that's would be some wormhole yeah you gotta talk to some such mad shit she puts her your blood around her neck he's a bad motherfucker though super strong dick game she ran her blood around her neck oh I think they both did they were each other's blood yeah that's what they're doing they're both weren't each other's blood that's another level now with that but here's the real problem with it you tell you all about it yeah man yeah you telling people I tell people it's dragon blood or some shit when you tell it's it's hers little weird well I think anybody that is good and actress as she is and she's a really fucking good mazing she's really good I think you have to have a good percentage of crazy like it's got to be way up there in the 90s actors to that I mean even for men like the the man actors who were really good like David a Lewis knife like it was a shoe cobbler for six years just to play like some thirty minute rollers legs he went full fuckin cobbler yeah he's working as a cobbler right now in like London or something like no I think he lives in Connecticut he makes furniture or some shit God you never go fool listen but that's because he's legit like that's really who he is like an actual artist yeah but that's why he's so interesting it's like his art or what his mind goes towards it's not dictated by finance it's not dictated by the the box office success could potentially out it's literally dictated by what he's interested in if he's interested in making shoes he's just gonna make shoes yeah like you're not gonna see him cast a Superman like he's like that's not his art you know admired shit out of that because we compromised all the time people are always compromising you're always like you know trying to suck up to the boss hoping you get that raise or you know you're compromising what you say around the office because you know you're at this level of the company ladder these people above you that'll get upset if you things we'd love someone to diss free inauthentic to like what play Batman I got a white man bad bruise wait it's like the dog away from me out of here yeah Ben Affleck was like I got this yeah bad looks like this is perfect yeah this shit is perfect surprise play Batman well Christian bear was the best Batman in my opinion is what just his voice bothered me ooh it was a little fake right yeah was that Batman but it mean you got a go comic book a little bit and that's how you go comic book but anyway why would it change his voice with a suit he's got to make a fake voice you're gonna make a fake voice so people don't recognize your Bruce Wayne yeah at least have like some mouth thing that you catchphrase or some people that know that'd be dope if you covered your face like why do we need to see the lower chin of Batman first of all I don't think that's a good idea for protective measures you leave you have a white button where the most vulnerable part of your face is yeah it's strange like if I came in here yeah what's that if I can Joe you know I'm saying like it's not a very good fucking well the chin part is terrible because like that's the part you'd want to punch and it would be like so white if you're in a fight with Batman just shoot for the chin you can't miss it it's like if you if you're hitting focus pads you guys like looking at this one spot yeah it's like you have camouflage on everywhere brick nut spot you get knocked back ever like you're gonna not protect the most vulnerable just open open the nose part up to let your nose get smashed that's so crazy that's so strange why don't they I mean do they really have to have that same suit look this up I don't no one's ever figured it out to us it's like Bruce Wayne from Batman in the fucking like Dan the Batman at least he didn't have like a protective suit on I don't west know I just had this thing over his eyes he was just in disguise like this bad spandex this Batman is gotten to the point where he's in this article basically of an arm suit right I mean while he doesn't cover his face oh it was Superman you covered a little bit of it he's basically a knight there anymore he's going to war with Superman do you know how goddamn stupid that is and doing work I watch a Superman is from another planet he can fly so fast he makes the world spin backwards he makes time goes backwards he's a master of time he can cut things in half with his eyeballs he's got laser shoes I'd pick his dumbass up and carry him as high as he wants and lets him go yeah in David's movies over he could bring you to the Sun yes throw you into the Sun you fucking be talking about Hollywood he's shit on my face how crazy is the idea that gravity is so dense on Superman's world that when he comes to earth he can fly and then the atmosphere is so different than his body's bulletproof but he looks just like us people to understand if you went somewhere if you're like from Earth right and then you go to like somewhere that has like less gravity like space like those guys that go to the space station they're fucked up after a year like it doesn't make them stronger it makes them weaker they get weaker there their bones shrink yeah like they come back man and they had their bones atrophy like they lose bone density they come back and they're there can't be healthy that's like there's just only surmount of time you can be there right I think like the longest is a right over a year yeah I think they've like hit the new record I think a guy hits a new record but I had a jam what is his name commander Chris Hadfield I had him on the pocket he was fascinating and he was describing what it was like coming back from how long was he up there for I think it was a year right they just came in looking like Smeagol it was just he just said would you land he said 879 gasps oh my god rushing up there he's been for five missions okay those Russian came the man who spent the most time in space when he surpassed so that's like over all time ever that guy just called on a space 2.2 years over city like six trio that is trying to get away from wife that's five years yeah Russian zuzia taken another level don't they I think you'd have to say like what's the longest space mission or something considered 16 days oh that's the most huh that was 2015 a believ commander Hadfield was after that still an unknown time I might not be right about that but either way fucking hundred days shit from what I wanna do 100 days in the woods dude I don't want ten days on the road ten days I was super lonely I felt like I was in space yeah we were talking about that like you gotta bring friends big big part of it and it's good for the friends too it's you know get guys a gig like that or they can open up for you yeah in front of a packed house just cool venues yeah also nice warm up the guy like I'm going out he's just like Oh which is fine you know you know when the only time I ever did that in last like ten years was when I was helping Kalyn out when I warmed a crowd up for Callens especially I was like this is so weird yeah to go on stage just go on stage and say hi ya not have someone in front of you but it's a good it's good exercise you know yeah because you got to get them into you know yeah I brought me right back to how when I used to do it it was like like right away start thinking of how like when I first started out that's mostly shows that we do the opening act yeah like in Dublin doing a shot two in the afternoon was cray I mean just crazy man but why'd you guys do it like that that's uh that we they booked on such short notice that's the way I'd do it at two and I do another one at like seven oh wow it's just the way they wanted to do it I'll have like you know how did you get away from those savages after the show is over I just a die like I did a meet-and-greet with everyone and then they bounce they're like hey let's get a pie in like which one like up there like see you there I drink so much Guinness is ridiculous yeah I'll put you down I love that man loved it yeah there it's a different world over there it really is Ireland England you know um there have a long history of tradition that we don't really understand you know just just what their cultures like then you know the language and the history you go over there you're like oh this pub is 700 years old like what yeah I went to so it's supposed to be the oldest pub in uh and there was bullet holes from fighting you know the rebels wow they were in there and his family owned since day one and the owner was this dude who's old as fuck now but he was born and raised upstairs he lives there now he's the only one still alive we're there just all night with Paddy hooligan is great that's great it was so awesome just sipping wine some eatin crisp shit my pants afterwards but no potato chips right yeah come Chris I'm from oh you from the Christoph football football or soccer I say American football because I have a big talk about football ago Americans are screwed yeah but you know what's best for me Joe is like I did what was it like ten shows and four days or something like some ten shows in five days or something like that and I wish I could do it more here it's just the reps for me mm the reps oh yeah that's what we're talking about comedy club weekends are so good so good like when I did Salt Lake Salt Lake City when I did wiseguys I was like man I really get to feel it again like what it's like to do for one hour shows in a weekend yes like he gets le timing down and then taglines they started like adding on and you start coming up with new ideas mhm - what is it about coffee the kids you phlegm even just fucking really this is just a cold brew caveman cold brew night those nitro pros here I'm always like shitting I'm always ready to cough and it's annoying I feel like it's an older thing nah man it's always been that way with me with car it's an older thing old guys get all Fleming get my king oh yeah I drink a shitload of coffee and my voice is good you know what it is for whatever weird reason when like if a guest is talking like if you've got a good story and your story goes on for a few minutes and they don't talk for a while it all builds up let's count secret accounts always trying to avoid coughing I told Johnny you get your fucking throat checked out I mean he's been doing since I've known oh yeah not indict so about football man I wanted to ask you about this because uh we were talking recently about this guy who were tired super young he was like 26 right some dude just retired from the NFL yeah I'm dying to ask no no what I'm asking is like you as a guy who's played football and it's a guy who sees all this this shit that's coming out now do you think you're gonna be a change in the game do you think it's gonna be like less people that are signing up for it that that's what they say and they say like with the youth leagues now they're like oh or teach them how to hit proper but it's like there's no such there's no it's not real like that's a fun campaign and stuff like that but you know it is America everything get rid of football because CT no man I just it's part of the game it's literally part of the game you know wait wait oh wait till the the UFC numbers come out yeah you're gonna be surprised I have friends now I talked to Mike oh my god man do you not realize what's going on here and so once that comes out now we know it with boxing and mixed martial arts like of course there's gonna be brain trauma guys you can punch in the head with football people like Wyatt yeah but if it's literally part of the game it's just it is what it is now juice worth the squeeze and football the argument is it depends for your health if you come from nothing it pays for your college you make you know forty million dollars your family your family their family set for life God the juice might be worth the squeeze depend how bad you're gonna have it if you can get to that level correct yeah I mean there's probably a lot of guys who wash out a bit more likely than not they watch out yeah I know dude who washed out and he was really fucked up the point like he was seen shit there wasn't there he would go out in the yard and start talking to himself such a bummer man not good everyone responds different but they say the biggest thing and you know I guess it's the biggest thing because I played football since I was what six years old but when you're young hitting when you're young hitting it's just like they you shouldn't hit until you know they say probably high school but if you don't hit two you're in high school you're gonna get left behind you know what's interesting about that is that there's a real good argument when it comes to striking that if you can teach kids how to play fight when they're young just make sure they play fight you know you know you don't want them not going to war teach you like that though the quick wage them it teach them how to play fight striking when they're young like do like Thai style kickboxing or you know like just wear your boxing but you're not hitting too hard because they're not gonna hit each other art anyway yeah right they can't they don't hit that hard and then on top of that teach them to not hit hard at all and they teach them to like be real solid on technique then they they're super custom to the movements of striking and then you get them to a position when they're like 16 18 they've been boxing their whole fucking life and their movements are like fully ingrained to the point where an average athlete coming into it at a later age without all those like super fine-tuned humans ingrained in you while you were growing up and developing you almost don't have a chance you know like when he gets to like a Roy Jones jr. in his prime level for sure you know if you're like an average athlete who learns boxing at 26 and then you at 30 have to box Roy Jones I mean good enjoy that good fucking luck I don't care what kind of athlete you are it doesn't matter fucking life yeah and something some people make that argument with you know Floyd Mayweather listen his uncle his dad he's been doing since I was six he's the best argument the best argument yeah the best argument he never gets hit it's been hit in a professional career that spanned 49 fights he's been hitting maybe hard seven or eight times true that the only and there's a few X factors in the in this fight the only kind of thing that gives people hope if you're on Team MMA or team Conor which is not Emma Mayen force boxing but if your team Conor is these X factors of Floyd's had two years off right is it two years off but in the past he's taking time off and comes back better but he is 40 so the four that has to be something you know and the other thing why is he doing it easy do it for money what's he's doing for attention why is he coming back to get 250 and then they announced gloves which they officially approved today announced gloves is a huge huge advance for Conor I think man so it's all interesting man Karl x-factors right like we don't really to be honest no one really knows I think I have an idea what I think is gonna happen but no one knows right but and that's why I think the the footage of Conor sparring poly such a big deal cuz people oh shit no he can actually and I even think Dane and forty deuce who were there watching oh uh we actually got something here and that's why it was such a big deal so I think everyone's like guy Connor mm eh he's good I've seen him move around I'm saying this this dude as far as box and he's got some problems using you the best all time problems who knows what what kind of training and Paulie been doing before that fight like what kind of shape is he in yeah nine nine twelve round shape you know Paulie just like the plane why did he do 12 rounds why do you guys what is that right but had he been training he died he got word from Connors team that they're gonna use them so he started to train some but not like it's not like he was getting ready for a fight fight you know so that's what he said he goes man you know for me to go 12 rounds was tough like I wasn't expecting to all 12 rounds to the first day they used to him I think said he only did six or eight rounds and then he was like oh we're gonna spar tomorrow more and I'll get in better shape stuff like that get used to the fighting shape and they they didn't use them then he flew to cover the Mikey Garcia Broner fight and then came back and he was fresh off the plane and then he sparked 12 rounds hmm so he's like they just did me dirty man that's his whole thing his his feelings are hurt he's like why why would they do that man it's here to help him well they did that that's the kind of help they wanted they just want to kind of help that he didn't want to give they wanted to kind of help where Conor beats the fuck out of a world checkered act and that's what Connor said that like in Connors defense when they go you're bringing Paulie Inga's yeah I'm bringing he says on Showtime during the media scrum he goes yeah bring him in to fuck him up and I think Paulie thought oh was it that yeah Hughes I'm like yeah I'm gonna bring him in and fuck him up word for word yeah that's on that's on it doc yeah it's documented so then Paulie get Singh goes oh well spar and be all good but remember six months prior to this Paulie does I could be Connor with one hand tied behind my back I was like a baby elephant he stores that was a guy man oh he said that whoops but he thought it was just hyping the fight you know he's not gonna spar and be like boys but that just didn't happen like Connors literally there just to prove a point well he it's a very important point to prove before a giant fight like that like that video alone is probably worth who knows how many thousands of hundreds of thousands of Bizon priceless priceless that's worth so much money I mean how many more people out of people were gonna buy the fight anyway but how many more people gonna buy the fight now that you see continent landing that straight left and then drop in Pauling and Pauly said is a push down and you could see that it's not a push down I mean it's just not if you get pushed down like that you probably concussed already yeah if your balance is off I see that's so bad I keep saying something about him getting grabbed in the back of the head you could watch it watch the knockdown probably just saying it probably saying it's dirty and he you get that I get that but that you signed up for the fight but the other thing is probably saying you know and he goes take what you want from the videos but I think Connors team and Dana fucked up putting this out cuz now now Floyd Mayweather team knows this is this how he fights like this is the dirty stuff he does so they can worn it dirty there yeah that in boxing that's dirty you can get away with it but that they found upon it's gonna happen those rabbit punches but the boys gonna do that see this this part right here give me some volume on that so you can hear that he's hitting him hard man okay you know he hits him with straight left that's clean and then it looks like he's wobbled and he hit someone the right hand afterwards like play that part one more time when he goes down like you can't I don't see an argument I've tried to look at it of a push down I don't see it I don't see it this is the beginning part and that's a legit ref by the way yeah yeah Joe Cortez super legit OH he's beating the shit out of him okay I don't give a fuck what anybody says it's like if he can land those combinations on Paulie Malignaggi like that at any point in life that is worthless yeah maybe see that power to me that validates counter at the same time in Polly's defense you know it's nine 12-round fight shape but still I should have never done that yeah you missed he must have underestimated them you know I had a Andre Berto my showing he's supposed to help Connor out and he's like ain't going up there so I need to eat he's aggies good friends it's kind of him Connor did rehab together he's like now I'm not going up there man he goes just because any etiquette point he goes let's say I go up there and help Connor and for whatever reason he doesn't think he's in Windows let's say he blasted me with in the face I mean it so much hate from the boxing world like a fraternity man he's liking the way he did Paulie like we just can't do it man because I wish him the best but I'm not gonna help him well I also think that if he's peeking and he's in full fight shape but they're making you fight 12 rounds I mean that's when you're in the gym and you're sparring 12 rounds done it's not unusual that you get one guy to box 12 rounds you oh no no it was designed for Paul you get beat up yeah but I feel like well you know paulie's a team player if I don't feel Vermette Paul he loves you if you ever met Paul II like I feel like he's such a good guy didn't say anything listen if you want me to do anything I've had guys offered that wanted me to help him with camps I turn it down and you're like hey we need to go 5 5 s that ain't happening I'll give you one round two rounds but you for your for the best condition usually do a shark tank yeah bringing fresh guys for different looks and push you harder so this is just a showcase of Conor's abilities at paulie's expense yep I like Paul he's a commentator I think he's best in the world he's really really good he offers like real legitimate insight he's vitally really good do you think that he got rocked and doesn't remember how this went like did he think that he maybe did think that he got pushed down no I again I think it's combination of both I think you know Paulie had won some and he says he goes I want some rounds Connor wants some rounds you know I'd like to see it all right me too and the UFC said they're gonna release it after the fight that that's gonna be the real test it's gonna be real test away cuz Dana said it was one sided beat down yeah there's like hassle for 12 rats which I don't believe that what if it's true like you you gotta go with what Paul II did say happen and then what you see happened I think it's combination of both I really do I think again I think it's people were like yeah you know everyone's on this Conner wagon swishing the FC Dana that's his golden boy right and I think we knew Connor could box but then when you seemed to against Paulie like oh shit and so even I bet one watch the tape we're like oh damn Connor did pretty well I don't think you beat the shit out Polly for 12 rounds I think towards the end he probably like you see that yeah like that well obviously listen this has obviously been very valuable if there were more moments like this don't you think they would leak those to correct they'd be everywhere I mean they're saying they don't want him to see what Connor is working on okay just show us a mom punches that landed give me like well as Mike Tyson cookies second highlights just show me a few yeah yeah I mean you don't have to only show all of its patterns but how well did this hype that like this is priceless man giant and now Paulie I don't you know you have this huge soap opera in boxing going right now paulie's a main character now so Paul II might have to fight Connor if Floyd Floyd even in Floyd and Connor if Floyd beats Connor and then Paulie can say look I want my shot at him you know you talked a lot of shit and I didn't get in shape if you're know that's the play but it's only it's only the play if Connor has a good showing even if you live in decision it's not easy to get showing right then you do McGregor promotions against Paulie Malignaggi yeah and I'm buying that shit the only way I'm fighting khabib Tony Ferguson all that elbow just Jitsu shit now we're put on these eight ounces go 12 rounds and make some money some serious money that's a lot of people think he'll never fight MMA again I mean he's gonna make a hundred million dollars from this fight yeah probably more that's the sponsors you know that's a lot of money all right so that's scrooge mcduck rich that's that's we go it has a son you know he's a smart guy play wood and I know a lot of us CP way that's you never fight or shop and I get that give any UFC fighter 100 million dollars they're both throwing up deuces going fucking seeya yeah this is way too hard of a life hundred mill satin sheet and I can go fight Paulie yeah another whatever 50 mil pry of my own money whoo or or I'll go fight Nate Diaz in the trilogy you know 90% are more Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather money man says notorious will lose 90% of his 75 million dollar payday if he's disqualified yeah yeah I know that yeah oh yeah that's that's if he doesn't name I may move on you want that people upset all the time can you throw a Superman punch spin punch like get on my face absolutely not you can't it's you can't throw spinning backfist oh whoa some got some gentleman rules for God's do you imagine though if if Floyd said you throw elbows I'm surprised he has it eight ounce clubs will do whatever you want to do let's do this let's do this you a man oh yeah and you get elbows and you throw one kick around and the guy can clench and throw elbows from the clinch do you ever see that's the sequence word Jordan me and knocked out cyborg and Strikeforce nasty is one of the nastiest nastiest sequences of standing elbows it was like like a fucking seminar on how to land a standing elbow hit the most vicious of all time cyborgs taking some shots to the dome dude that knee he got from micro venom page the new K page killer guy he did god damn near killed him I mean yet to have all constructive oh he did like he basically had to put like man wiring all over his face now he's a superhero knee yeah and he said he was gonna fight again they need to change his body yeah let's not do that though I mean who knows how his dome works right now I mean after you get hit like that yeah I said call poison poor to very poor who knows yeah everyone's different one change the dip here it is right here look at this he hit someone a deliver shot left right don't have until they get to the killer boom boom boom boom boom boom boom I mean look at that I mean come on man he's hit him with like a 13 fuckin straight elbows to the head did you think they'd stop deceive Jones early I mean a late yes yes right yes yeah brother I think you're you know like you're given to God the best chance you can your John McCarthy know how tough he is John's the best in the world too so it's right there two punches too late yeah well into three also like the delayed effect that head kick I got head kick then he sees like legs buckle and he's wobbling around and then when he goes down up against the cage I mean it wasn't like a real significant thing that he's like his legs weren't working right no it's game over games over there's already hurt bad yes and then John jumps on top of him he's just wailing on him you he could have stopped it one or two punches earlier but you know in his eyes what if DC recovers what if he rolls over it gets to guard what if he holds on to John I believe he's low to fight another day I agree with you two I totally agree with you but I'm just looking at it from John's point I get it and I don't like criticizing giants like man I thought those two late a lot of people thought that was too late yeah yeah it's tough to watch with DC my thing with DC and you talked about him coming back he's you know he's was he 39 38 so 39 he has a great job with the UFC as far as you see tonight right he's kind of becoming that the guy you'll see tonight he's doing commentating with you he's traveling all around now he's great at commentary he's you know does he ever beat John I don't think so so what are you gonna do fight dust and again those de Meyer you know I don't I don't know what it's pay is but you know at some point you know health has to take into account with this yeah the Gustafson fight was a grueling five round fight you know remember there was a very very great fight very good for this has been testing close man Gustafson's better now than ever before we - that's why I won't see him and John against Glover I was like Jesus Christ looked amazing and the combinations he was landing that I think that whipped like uppercut from on the outside see the thing about him is he's the only guy that can match John for distance and reach sighs yeah yeah I mean no one else is like him not even close and Gustafson is also more mobile than John like he's John is like very creative mixes things up more but Gustafson is more like bouncing around better footwork and his better footwork for sure yeah he's very agile and he's also the first guy to ever Lana take John yes and I think he's better I think he's better now that he wants that me to that bit that'd be a great fight fuck yeah that would be you know that they were asking John how about John was on Good Morning America getting interviewed by Michael Strahan good lord the things change Wow yeah right so he's on Good Morning America and they asked him about what's next and he talked about you know he'd like to fight Brock like that's always been kind of sting and Connor kind of set that with these super fights but you know Brock can't fight to I think whatever he has 18 months or some shit I'm sure that's slip in the back door so I'm like wow that's what this juice to the gills I'd still watch it so they talked to about guts when they go what about mess Square Garden he was not happening cuz they want to tax me another ten percent of fight in New York so he's like I won't find Matt Square Garden Wow I know I feel like you see black fuck you're 10% here's my card let's figure this out take a little extra Peter Mighty Mouse give us some in-person yeah what if John put a no steroid test clause go ahead Brock take your shot you do your shit I'm gonna do Mike okay you know we must gonna be up all night long no drug test cause that's all talking about doing like Debye or some shit but if he just says Tom look I don't give a fuck what you do I'm gonna beat your ass and then Brock said oh my god it's like full bein shit rock gets up to 290 cuts down at 265 I don't know if John the fuck with that I don't that's a scary dude but Kane fucked that back up yeah King kind of food by them but also yeah issue diverticulitis right ovary muscle fucked him up when he his bane product well that was a crazy fight for him to take after recovering from surgery where he got 12 inches of his colon removed we talking Boober yeah that was boring to them thank God like just straight-up murderer when he was 265 keep doing the gut well he just had surgery there he did that Oh brain see that it's like he's like one of the best arguments for no testing but he's still kind of killed it with me though he's great but it's a different over him like this Overeem the heavyweight grand prix came Heavyweight Grand Prix Overeem there's never been a fighter like that before like look at this side they're never gonna see that again ever in the you see it was physiques he was so jacked they look like giant Phil Heath like you're never gonna see these two again and I kick like that yeah and he's just all over Brian to the gut down he's got some of the best knees in the business man super good technique with just I I missed this Overeem where he was just dominating people with power you never see the the the Overeem now that could God thumb but fucking kick to the gut Dover him now that is steroid free like he does that move where he runs away yeah steroid ovary never like steroid there is good luck in with Stephan it's bad yeah now he's clean I'm a fucking sprinting Remini fought Todd Duffee and dream to ever see that fight train time for that fight and I supposed to corner him Todd Duffee was super promising before that fight with Todd took that short notice I'm gonna do it broke got a fight who over him dream Joe I don't listen you have a lot of talent you could be huge this is not the way to give you I guess the bad ideal iterated in Japan with short notice Japan what is it about calling people like a week before the fight going what are you up to Saturday advantages for it for the home team man and wasn't this post UFC Duffy cuz he had that UFC fight where he won like it was one of the fastest fights ever won my knockout and with a jab seconds breaths and peace Tim Hague yeah rest in peace terrible terrible story Duffy's JIT Jack - he was super jacked so talented I'll really really talented so he goes in there and he fights Overeem at is most over him ever yeah it's like a death sentence he was a monster back then and then when you think about him like bordering on both sports right he's like k1 grand prix champion still fighting MMA it's all like in the same time period and his striking is just off the charts because of it and you can't take him down yeah so Gaddafi just went after him strike taking shoes on and everything boom he gets that's the move for dummies oh yeah there's a move he gets the body shot buddy gets Duffy here then you're right here but I'm not backing up to look just boom so much power forward right hand left hand finished no running from Marine he wasn't running his thought process now yeah slide out the way well he's also older and he's taking more punishment - you got to think though knockouts that he's had just in the UFC steep ain't knocked him unconscious traps Brown knocked him unconscious a while ago yeah yeah I mean there's been how many how many people knocked him out you know he has more knockout losses anyone in the UFC yeah broth well knocked him out Rothwell Steve Bay he beat JDS didn't he yes he did he knocked him out he's got a couple issues yeah but I think of other fights he's I'll tell you what I'd love to see over him versa your boyfriend you know oh my god I would love to Francis sjds coming up but oh that's right Bigfoot Silva knocked him out - oh that Bigfoot Silva one was brough that was a rough one it was real rough cuz he was standing up and Bigfoot teed off on I'm just ding ding ding ding ding ding but then like I'm he merge dudes shave nelson's radius Orlovsky loosely pay for the title this true fight was brutal know that Mark Hunt fight was wrong market well that's fine again yeah it's right in that Russian dudes rank like Tennyson yeah yeah he's fighting isn't that uh is that in Australia yeah yeah Australia New Zealand good move man you have a fucking mark hunt fight in New Zealand he's a huge draw oh my god gigantic knee Tibor isn't loves a fighter man Marschallin Tabora is like that sneaky sneaky left hawk dude these Russians and note that whole area they my fuck you they're taking over box and they're slowly creeping in Mme how about could be I know what's going on with him the bowl you got Tony first and Kevin Lee now for an interim time they just don't think of you could make the wait I don't know what's going on they asked him to fight right and he was like not any more time it's just the boats passing them by more time what's he must be injured not tiramisu I don't know and I like to be such a talent but it's so frustrating I fucking love tiramisu you know it's like when you don't you know you shouldn't be eating this but you like fuck it let's get dessert dude if I go what do you have dessert and they go well we have world-famous tiramisu bring that oh you got some coffee with it double espresso please come on I get it I get it they don't here's the thing my man campaigns runs these ultra marathons every year last year he ran the big foot 2,000 or 200 205 205 miles and this year he's running this Moab 1 234 miles he cuts down from a hundred and eighty pounds which is what he weighs normally lean he's down to 160 now Jesus you know how he does it he works out and burns off more calories than he eats that's it but and he feels good doing it yeah he'll like burn off 3,000 calories eat mm I mean if he's a little different though if he can do it if he can do that then kittib can do that too they can all do that all you have to do is just work hard do a lot of fucking cardio put a lot of hours in training and eat less than you're eating here's the thing though you shrink you'll shrink yeah that's its science but here's the thing you can hire someone to do that to make sure you make that weight well he's also like a very strict Muslim and so he celebrates Ramadan yeah which makes it a real issue for guys to fight although someone who just did that in the UFC Ramadan yeah and got through it look through but his nickname is remember the name Bilal Muhammad Bilal Mohammed went through Ramadan while he was training he just did it very smart and he scheduled his training for after his me a lot of bad ass yeah and he fought great with khabib though it's like you know at 55 kind of a clusterfuck there and he's just getting left in the dust I think it's his bot I think he has real issues with his body from losing weight those boy unless I love 8k and they've done so and uh you know I think you know crazy Bob cook should belong to the UFC Hall of Fame Hall of Fame he's a straight-up genius hey man Javier yeah but those boys I don't know what's going on there with Kane you know you got you know well you know what a while here's what I think it is you got at the top level of that you have two of the best first of all arguably the best heavyweight ever and Kane and then you got one of the best light heavyweights ever in Daniel and they're going to war all the time Tom got cold in there and but and Luke Rockhold in the mix too and they also you only have a certain amount of years being able to do that so then you see Cain's body breaking down I mean you can't just attribute that only to his training there because there's some questionable weightlifting videos of him online the deadlift yeah well it's it's not even a deadlift man it's like he's doing a kettlebell swing with like shit form and they're doing high reps of all kinds of weird shit I got saw a lot like Steve Maxwell saw it he was furious yeah but the thing is a lot of MMA guys if they don't come from like a football background and most of them you see left like that to be honest well it's problem was he had a trainer and people were feeling like the trainer was doing a shit job oh yeah I mean yeah yeah I mean it's I'm not blaming injuries and delays and fights on a K but I think and it's not up to them you I think you again you have like you're saying you have the toughest guys in the world competing every day you have khabib you have all these guys and things are gonna happen I think there's two different schools of thought and I don't know who's right there's a school of thought where you just fucking go in there and you go to war all the time and the cream rises to the top and you get hardened by the combat and you come out of it the best fighter in 1997 you know what it was Kane for a while right until all these injuries started piling up but I think there's another way of looking at it well there's two different other ways of looking at there's the when you get to a Connor situation then you get a super camp that's designed around you and then you get these people who are working with you on various aspects to your game your sparring partners are planning accordingly there's a bunch of people that you work with that you know are their goal is to get you better for this fight so and I would say GSP is one who really started yeah for sure for us a hobby yes yeah and I think these guys that are doing this today you know it's like how do you do it do you do it the old-school way which has always been proven you can make some tough motherfuckers that way or do you do it the ATT way where you have this gigantic program where you have all world-class coaches and athletes and you're putting together all these people and you know I mean you just have a giant super team look at their roster too but again the but you know not that Xavier didn't have a competition background but the reason why ATP so good and they're killing with Jana Jinjin check with fucking Amanda Nunez all their big athletes Mike Brown right he's been there he's yeah it's awesome yeah yeah to me you know the definitely top three in the end Liguria labora - but Mike Brown really he's only focus on Yoanna and Amanda Nunez and he's focusing because he's been there he's done those meet had days he's going yeah we need to focus more on this yeah so when you have someone you know even team alpha me I'll have a ton of injuries really you know granted Cody carbons having his things but your I have favorite he's been through it so you need these younger guys who have been through it who can take control who are saying listen we can't be Wanderlei Silva man this is a top team this ain't working right in football same way like Jim Harbaugh at Michigan they don't hit you if you know how to hit at this level you're not gonna make it right they'd only hit on game days when it counts so you see this kind of trend happening with people who've been through it before it's not way cowboy hardly ever spars anymore yeah he does mostly drills mitt work you know it drone to like this you see this kind of guys like man I can't be him beat up and training him or it doesn't make sense goddamn especially at heavyweight you know big guys the size of Mitch your own give me to the brain damage bad idea terrible better you know we do it so many times and I think when you see a guy like Connor with all the different experimenting that he does with like weird movement stuff so that IDO portal guy long weird bike rides and the weird ship that he does like we need you see him like switching stances in the Rings switching stance is like a Taekwondo guy yeah like he's in a Taekwondo tournament all that weird shit if he can do shit like that but Floyd all that stuff that he's never seen before sideways stance you know moving more like a karate fighter he's gonna come out more karate than people are expecting I asked I asked Paulie you know I said you know Paulie has his issues with him like you know that's terrible but how was you know how was this was it as awkward as I'm predicting cuz yeah enough Connor goes it goes in and get to starch my time I'm out Showtime that's my time I look like an asshole he was saying he was like nah man he it's even more awkward than I thought like it's tough to deal with yeah said one time is palm up like this yeah cheetahs yeah definitely gonna do that please I have no idea who that is only look him up he doesn't know who the ODA Machida is how dare how dare you he knows that was like my Moore's prediction of all time welcome to the Machida era probably my worst predictions you know there was a Machida era no not like that like he lost right away after that we merked the Shogun's right merked Rashad well he didn't Merc Shogun Shogun knocked him out oh that's right so show get lost him yeah but they had that back-and-forth right well he fucked up a shot he fucked up Rashad title don't entitle who beat him right after that and then Jon crushed him and then what Jon crush don't crush his dreams yeah and then he drops down the 80-foot look great against munos there was a lyoto machida like we say the air I me yeah we still but I changed the game he definitely changed a lot but I thought he was gonna go on a crazy run man so let's we got there Jon Jon did you do well he left a rampage but that back a little bit more go back a little bit more so where does the Rashad fight okay so he fought Rashad and then he fought that's what it is he fought Shogun next but he should have lost that fight anyone but still a lot and then showed him a lesson in two years so remember he beat TL Ortiz now and that's real T Ortiz didn't Merc Thiago Silva at the time the other still was a straight savage yeah and then destroys Rashad then he eats by Shogun when he jump in front kick tranny in the face and knocked out Randy's - yeah that was yeah then it was a little rough from then he fought John beat Ryan Bader with that crazy knockout that was nuts where I'm bein I ran into that crazy straight left hand just rushed him that's here in LA in the munos fight I remember that was in like London or something dude I remember you know spent I was trained with meeting us he found out through social medias fight Machida it was like oh fuck that was in England whoa then he got smashed by Weidman they did they Merck CB Dollaway and then you know who croc hold one was the worst and then he tested positive for something right yeah and then I don't know exactly what he's doing now yeah man you get a certain amount of knockouts against guys like Rockhold and especially the rock hold one was rough he's been doing it though yeah you've been doing karate since he was fucking three months old oh he's just been doing it for a long-ass time man yeah it's interesting like these guys like Vitor and him where they're there their technique is still there their mind is still there but their body just can't keep up and get look it was shot your shot that's to me when I watched his fight in Mexico City he's fighting on the undercard against Sam Alvey oh my god oh my god man and I love Rashad and you think I've been training with forever and to see him and I don't think I don't know if the matter of physical but mentally I you can tell he's just not he's not there yeah as far as not that he's punchy but he just doesn't want to do anymore like he's not pulling the trigger he's knocked out before I was the same way once I got knocked out see your things change go okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fight like that anymore Brian that kind of cautioned the win let's go let's sit in the pocket and bang no no no no I've learned from that and then brashaad just couldn't pull the trigger I I think I think he's swing towards being done well he's holds worse try now shit out of holidays were shutting he gets thirty nine yeah he's up there yeah he's had a great run he's definitely had a great run but he obviously enjoys doing it or he wouldn't be still doing it or the money yeah I don't know 37 37 but the other thing with her shot is the game's advanced so much further than wrestler with good boxing yeah you can't you can't fuck with that anymore right heavyweight middleweight welterweight you go down what you only have to ask you only have two tools you're screwed man like y'all Rodriguez all these young kids go the only wrestle and box oh my god meet on the line but he can kick I mean memory knocked out Shawn salmon with that high kick Jenna's old school and Shawn salmon looks like every UPS driver we've ever had yeah but I would would think that he would get better at that you know and it just never became like a big part of his game his game was never like full-on Muay Thai oriented know it's like the Chuck Liddell thing you know where sprawl and brawl yeah I'm gonna fuck you up with me what's crazy as he trains with Tyrone Spong I know I mean Tyrone Spong is fuckin demon when it comes to stand up man dude he mercs this dude so bad and this was at light heavyweight which is interesting because all along a lot of people thought he should be at 185 he won the ultimate fight at Heavyweight no comes easy is that fought Brad Iams yes giant ass dude in the finals yeah Rashad is just tough man and he's a do to play football too right yeah high school with any wrestled at Michigan State and his roommate was a Greg Maynard crazy man and then the other roommate is a big agent at c8 which is hilarious all are killing it you know you remember his knockout of Chuck Liddell that was probably like the biggest highlight ever o ever and the UFC really went at play just Chuck Liddell was like the main man remember for a while there they went play the Chuck or Rhonda knockout yeah they turned that bitch on foster salute well once WME became the owners they like was and Mike we don't play that game we're here to self-correct I know he's your boy oh there it is right there one shot that was a crazy the hard rock crazy high kick I think they showed the Chuck Liddell knockout they just didn't highlight it over and over for a long time they would show Chuck or Rhonda that Chuck one was so like I remember the sound of that right hand landing it just BLAP Chuck was going to fill uppercut is famous up again just that and Rashad stepped over with an overhand right on the fucking button like a punch Irish I just turned up at like his heart he's like yeah it is Chuck's just Chuck was just such a fucking executioner you know Chuck this rumors truck won the fight again he's in Thailand training shit Wow great timing by Rashad perfect see look at the fucking impact of that right hand that is crazy my god no talking about Chuck and Tito again in Bellator welcome Tito they're talking about chianti toe first the chianti were talking shit to each other they just fight they just fought and she's kept our neck reconstructed he's a tube in his neck but then she'll stretch it to fake disks oh my god he got discs replaced we go to Tito's Instagram page he talked about it and he said jail I'm kicking your ass was like so progress hey Tito jail I

Smith an amazing job Valerie thank you so much Bellator thank you my friends family thank you for sport everybody reached out to me bridges for I'm alive I'm fixed now it's time to get ready to chill I'm kicking your ass oh god wait a minute know how to but how crazy is that a guy coming out of knee a neck reconstruction you got three discs replaced like you do in the UFC if you have more than two discs replaced you know they don't think they'll let in your fight right now it makes sense they were talking about a Rick story Rick story has some disc replacements his neck ya know like if you get to a certain amount like you got one your lower back one your neck like ooh son we're not sure if we want to fuck with this liability well who knows how good the guy did the neck thing like who did your thing like it saw almost like like who's building your car well send me your guy then yeah UFC like 72 one guy who we can trust yeah how shut down his career how many dudes are doing this neck reconstruction thing everyone supposed to be looking for a deal Eddie Bravo's got his back done you know Eddie still having problems with it though it's not a hundred percent a lot of people have problems with it yeah I mean the backs tricky man but one of this one of his students Victor had his done he's a big dude he's real big it was like heavy weight dude and for him it's fine like he was lifting weights like really quickly and got back to Roland within a few months I think it just depends man but with tito he's had so much a you know abuse as far as wrestling and fight he's got fusions too he's got all sorts of shit go on you talk about a straight-up fighter it neckbrace italian chill get your ass ready at like a year from now bro how long does it take to recover from those surgeries I wonder because uh what Eddie was saying was that you know like he might have pushed it too quick and like re-injured it a little bit I really came in here did he come in here like the next day we're gonna fight your panting he's like drinking high off his ass and we're talking about he's like I'm not gonna rush into it like I'm not doing but if you're on the mats and you know this problem is rolling it's too fun yeah you can't roll if you're injured you know I think the the only thing you should do ever if you're injured is drill and just use it as a time to drill because you can get really good you can get really good by drilling but as soon as you're like if you're dealing with something that's recovering like a surge if you like have to explode an exert weird energy in weird ways you never know like you you don't want to get tapped you don't want your guard to get past you don't want so you'll just fucking wow you're in the middle of it you laugh and when you do that ma'am messes it leg up you feel the back where you got surgery twinge again like game over fucked all that work up I'll tell you what's crazy speaking of injuries is when I saw Patti hooligan in Dublin you know he's yeah he's an outgoing Chris you know smart dude speaks well we're talking like dude so when's the next fight this whole team was just like god damn it job I'm like what no I didn't hear but he has a rare blood disorder like less than 1% the world have it and it's really not that dangerous but if it did if something were to happen it's like super dangerous so the UFC's like it's too much of a risk we can't I can't clear the fight so he's done whoa so how does the blood disorder work I'm not sure you got me I have to look it up Jim he has some super rare blood disorder super super rare where I do have to look it up for it I don't knows this concern look if he needs a transfusion I've a risk so he's done but he was open a gym without SBG with Connor at their gym and then he decided to do his own like up the street doing that but crazy story man crazy so I had no idea I felt I felt bad for him but good spirits man good spirits he's gonna start doing podcast and want to start doing some other stuff but that's cool you know here it is he was born with a factor missing in his blood called factor 13 I never disclosed it until now and came to the UFC's attention if from a third party I could no longer pass the medical requirement to compete only one in five million people are diagnosed so I knew that it was rare organizations wouldn't understand or take a chance at me as I've found out now I never explained enfold to John or my team the actual risks because I didn't think there was excess or excess risks what it's a if it's not if he doesn't think there is an access risk it's a disorder that is only dangerous for me and not my opponents I really did see MMA as a way to have a real shot at life for myself my fan turns out I was right Wow I've mixed emotions this is sad can you look up the disorder how sad is it but you talk about a guy who his spirits are super up like he was joking about he's just like what the fuck gaming is a he's a son mm-hmm his girls there and I was like oh I felt so bad for him but he was like Donald Bo I got this job doing my thing here at SPG I got my own gym you know like things are good and I'm start getting the podcast he's gonna be good at it two men if you can get that good at fighting you get that good at anything you just have to think about it the right way here it is there it is it's a rare clotting ooh a bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of clotting factor 13 clotting factors are specialized proteins that are essential for the blood to clot properly always luck to haemophilia uncontrolled bleeding episodes fuck all that like what if you get Marvin Eastman in the head horn blood and I can't stop it yeah you know like something about for heads like forehead just bleed a lot so sure with the elbow yes peak of the elbow here I think about how much more for heads bleeding like a knee oh yeah you know I'm saying elbows like fucking yeah we get need it's always in the face your shits all fucked up yeah that's a bummer man one in five million crazy and what are the odds I know man super heartbreaking do you know the odds on Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor are only four to one five to one right out of Connors I saw it plus five maybes change odd swing it's like I've been on this hound this this collar dick ride hound changing complete Connor dick diver just changing me on do you really think he's got a chance yeah I do he's baby dudes a lot bigger man it's like an act truck he's awkward Floyd two years off I'm a little curious why Junior Bernard Hopkins correct plus 325 whoa it's down to three take it back Jesus Christ crave one Mayweather's at - 450 don't hear something hilarious those odds are those are odds are smaller than when he fought Canelo that's those odds are changing because of the the fucking video well that in the just a matter of amount of people are betting on Conor yeah I know how how you win a hundred bucks most people I have to explain it every time we go to the UFC to someone yeah when the odds first came out I fucked up I thought you got 26 when I got it 15 to 100 win by knockout it's so so weird when you see the numbers like plus 450 like Howard what who comes up my silly name open with it you know if they open with an odd that's when it gets really crazy how do they do that is it like in the expert opinion they do it on purpose to get that you think cuz they want betting so they sure are perps get people to go here so yeah Floyd loves us because you know Floyd oh he's bets on himself and a shitload of money so Floyd's a gas keep it going did you see footage came out that not footage but news leaked and I think it's all honey taking that Zab Judah knocked out for weed Mayweather in training in Floyd shut down the gym Wyatt yeah look that shit up Jamie pull that shit up Jamie tell me that zapped Judah yesterday they said knocked them out I think it's all smoke and mirrors I think Floyd's just trying to sell this to the max well that would be smart I'm Floyd it's part it's brilliant how close is he would Zab Judah that they would organize that I mean zap Jews like yeah I'll take that shine what's the last time you mentioned the name Zab Judah very good point word from inside the money team Zab Judah knocked out Floyd maybe they're inspiring during a while exchange we're both boxers began to brawl apparently Floyd kicked everyone out of the gym afterwards more to come that was mimicking Conor and just came right after him wow this Mario Vegas post Mario Mario talk to me you know that glamour that glamour shot headshot bothers the fuck out it doesn't bother me at all he looks like a very reasonable American 14 tweets 300 followers sure he votes conservative you know what but I think I'm pretty miserable conversation with I think he's a troll I wouldn't mind having a beer with him see III don't believe that I think there'd be more smoke I think little boys just playing this fool Sheila might be I got knocked out look Connor definitely a week before or Zab Judah and him might have gone to war because he does go to war in gyms he does make you seen talk shit and go to war with people in sparring sessions and zap dude ain't young Ethan's absolute it's true but Zab Judah can crack we know that fact yeah he cracked Floyd a few times when they fought out of that and crack yeah Boyd made with her and Zab Judah unleash chaos in Las Vegas yeah well who's back at the tempered battle between mayweather in the current sparring partners AB Judah yeah they had a great war man phenomenal fight and if Zab Judah I mean look who's em Jude is lightning fast if he hasn't lost a step and they actually did get into a wild exchange and Floyd got crazy it is entirely possible Syd hasn't lost a step I mean I've guarantee he has yeah probably but I mean as far as like his speed and power I bet it's still there I mean he's like timing but I'm what I'm trying to say you right it's reaction losing a step is probably not the best way to describe but he still got his skills he still got some serious power where he knows how to drop bombs and if he drops a bomb on Floyd if they really did have some crazy exchange it's a hundred percent possible you could imagine correct a guy like Zab Judah not at least knocking down Floyd I'll tell you this if he did get knocked out a week before the fight and you fight Saturday we know we go on sizzler I might just fuck you no bueno problem show time everybody like the same story kind of happened before the Pacquiao Mayweather fight and well maybe it happened it said Florida floorings I would you too nice flooring Mayweather during sparring is prepare shit maybe that whoops is that my favorites that's probably so comfortable with being there with Floyd he's box Floyd professionally as a fighter and as this training part true like you know like you get each other's patterns you understand to this pattern yeah and who knows also you know like who knows how seriously Floyd's taking this that's the only have the money for sure that's the other things like rumors coming out like again these are all rooms have you seen the condition rumors lead to I love the drama I get so excited me too I guess what else um have you seen the picture of Floyd at 40 he looks good good that motherfucker looks like he's on that Brock Lesnar he looks ready yeah he looks great under under 2.5 Wow Wow Wow interesting yeah that's the only way McGregor is gonna win I think if it's under the two-and-a-half oh no not in another two and a half but by stoppage I think yeah me too I can't imagine him out boxing no that ain't happening yeah you're living in a run fucking planet if you think you seen out bottom unless he figures out a way to Maul I'm like hey Donna style like he's doing they're withholding the back in the head and throwing punches so that's after he's worn Paulie out I think you're gonna see I think you see Connor using his footwork still the distance behind that you know still do what got him to the dance he might what if he drops one on Floyd and Floyd ghost if he's plants I would love that I think he's gonna land one on Floyd I think so I think Connor wins the spectacle but probably loses indecision but if there is a stoppage its Connor not gonna mount well you know we were talking today about them going to eight ounce gloves and how how significant official Commission just granted it shows you you could just you could just pull those commissioners ass I'll go have some fun I wonder if WME came along like when they bought the UFC the black guy another six months can't we listen let's just direct that guy towards weight cutter do you just have him like folks on the guys in the undercard do that hundred percent oh well Andre Berto said when he fought Floyd he's never been tested more in his life he's like four times a week they're knocking on my door yeah that's four people dressed up like agents that's what he says he goes are you testing Floyd like this they go that's none of your concern he was just the promoters obligation is the promoters Floyd Mayweather yes you'll figure it out you just did not stop yeah he wants more of your blood he wants to make you tired yeah I'll tell you what though I don't know what the drug testing is like on this bad boy but well then Alvarez right it was interesting because he made canal get down to 150 you know they fought it 150 and can you always make people come to him like you have to play by his rules to and then that's fight though that's what's so scary yeah that's why I took my hat to Floyd because he went Alba fight 154 oh that's like that's like that's perfect for Conor yeah I would do a dance clubs what the frills yeah yeah yeah we'll do that would all take him short notice to this motherfuckers crazy I just think he thinks he's so good he might just not understand like first of all Conor is whether or not you look you're looking at his success inside the Octagon which has been pretty spectacular but it's the way he's doing things he's got this special fucking air about him and this very psychotic belief in himself it's a it's not a fake belief no he's not he's not trying to con anybody he's trying to manifest like some sort of miraculous existence he's trying to be the guy who literally goes in there and drops and smash his Floyd Mayweather as a UFC fighter and it becomes with that the biggest athlete on the planet Earth ever maybe ever he flatlines Floyd Mabel if Floyd way mother steps in and Conor fucking karate stances him and blast him with a straight left hand and we see Floyd stiffen up and faceplant North Korea nukes we're gonna turn the ocean green shit okay this we're all we're gonna manufacture all of the color that green color that you put some drinks on say Patrick Jason people pour in that shit in the ocean we're making the ocean green just all green just huge statues of Conor you're gonna have people that are faking Irish accents it's sort of like that Rachel Dolezal check pretending to be black there's gonna be people that are changing but put these on her chest yeah they're gonna change themselves and become Irish they're gonna be trans Ilya that's what the world's gonna come what is that when did that happen toggle on st. Patrick's Day they do that yeah really yeah oh my god we're so gross people are so gross let's have some fun and get fucking hammered and make the ocean green like what the fuck I can't believe they really do this it's awesome oh my god Dom no look it's only in Chicago met bottom amazing that Boston doesn't take this on miles Mac you're fuckin telling me they do it in fucking Chicago holy shit I feel like it's a bad idea uh can be well it's probably some food base not the family that dies the Chicago River green Wow The Hulk family how where's pure toxic yeah wonder how bad it is what if there's like some environmentalists that are protesting 100 percent that can't be right for anything in there that's just die it's natural not really why don't you um Google environmentalists protest Green died in Chicago River see let's see if there's some environmentalists that think it's fucking teri 60 pounds of die that's a top secret formula awesome as we call it leprechaun dust I'll fuck you how about you tell us what the fuck the top secret formula and take that shot right now with your tit who's the dad on the right oh yeah set of sweet old old man Ted it's like a mock turtleneck that looks like the kind of guy who kills a burger with his bare hands he looks like you kinda got it kills millions of fish look at those guys goddamn it yeah you're right though man if Connor were to pull it off I don't he's the biggest athlete of all time all the time he's gonna be worldwide and in the craziest way possible you see a Nike shoe like to join but with it if he actually can land that shit there's the thing nobody who's gonna ever box Lloyd like that from a karate stance never he's never seen it before and he's been doing a lot of that Taekwondo footwork thing where he switches back and forth switches stances on if he can keep that kind of distance it's gonna be very hard for Floyd to hit him - it's a totally different feel different feel don't the only thing I think case scenario the obviously worst case we get starts in like ten seconds that's not gonna happen but worst case would be with eight ounce gloves if Floyd starts slamming and beating him up and he gets stopped like seventh or eighth or came in through the belgians taken so much punishment for an eighth round he gets really tired from moving so much yeah and it could be a shit show for ya it's a different expenditure of energy for sure different animals switching legs like that and switches dances but listen he's doing and training you you don't get to Connors level without realizing what you're saying like yeah to me if God were the gas in this fight there's just suits then then everything we believe in Connors fake which I don't think is gonna happen well the only other explanation be he's not quite efficient enough yet to go 12 rounds of the world champion you know if he really started gas like you know you're talking about something that he has a part of his training but it's also kickin takedown defense jujitsu elbows knees some say is more difficult yes we'll definitely call your wife a lot of people say is more difficult like in boxing get your rest like in boxing which is why I think Connors gonna win a majority of those early rounds and you know Floyd you know four or five six rounds before he's really even starts sweating he downloads your patterns then goes to work yeah Andre Berto said that he comes out and he'll force you to come to him and he's looking around he's literally downloading everything but it takes him a while to get going before he gets it and then starts going to work with Conor I think in those rounds he can land something big there man if he does see the exciting thing is if he does that's the exciting thing that's what that's what's gonna make it the biggest pay-per-view of all time those white power people gonna go crazy that Twitter account is fake account apparently which one new it's not a real newspaper and some people have found out that the picture is even like a small business owner from some somewhere else which which the Zab Judah was a troll account but so okay so the him knocking him out is fake income coming Dennison I told you yeah boy do better trolling that guy's at or the fake guy fake he looks like the average American or like Iowa you went to Iowa you went to a family restaurant hi welcome they all look a Google Las Vegas post and nothing comes up oh that son of a bag that dammit Floyd you got to do better at selling us man there's some well it might not even be him it might just be somebody just going for clicks you know having some fun a lot of people make up stories it's true and Flay doesn't come out said anything but you know like my mom they'll be like why have you got knocked out buying it it works it does work it works well especially after looking at that video I mean that's what ramps it up looking at the video of Connor landed on his the full foot it'll taste you from what I heard from what I heard is they thought that footage was gonna make it an all-access and Dana was like Kaplan all-access if Connor doing what he did to Paulie need to put in there so Dana was like release the hounds and then released on his end oh so Showtime didn't put it in there no no they came from Dana it did not come from Showtime okay why would showtime not want to put it in there so they doesn't denied putting it in there they didn't want to put it in there I don't think that I don't I don't think they denied it ever happen they're just like we're not putting all access like it flying I do put that in all access but that seems ridiculous I don't know but you try self I turn a but yeah and then Dane was like oh you're not gonna do it release the hounds everybody real indicate that's when it came from his account why the fuck would they not play that clip I guess they loved Polly and Polly is an analyst for them right yeah but still it is what it is yeah if anything I listen man it's sparring we're talking we're talking about practice like it's it is what it is loss those those those in those exchanges there was a clear loser and a clear winner doesn't mean the entire sparring session no and we won't know that until after the fight and most knowledgeable fighting fans know that like oh that's that's a part of it but shit Conor can actually hit like shit he looks pretty good he looks real this is even if you're a box and painting like holy shit that's Paulie Malignaggi he just got rocked shit maybe I won't buy the fight yeah it's give me a kiss no matter what I'm gonna buy it I'm gonna buy it from fucking DC I'm gonna be in Washington DC yeah your work and the night working that night so I'm here the god oh my god Showtime but uh be like I don't even know what I would do like what would I be doing like to be bring my opinions well I have none I fly out next Monday I'm working I'm on the whole coverage team up with Showtime Tuesday through Saturday I don't know what I'm doing on Saturday yeah honestly dude I really feel like if they were smart but this is this kind of shit like the kind of shit that we do when you and I just sit down talk yeah this is really what they need yes you get a bunch of goofy people sitting around with ties on in some circle and everyone's talking over everybody and there's a production meeting at you say this and you say this I agree yeah and there's more oh and then there's fucking two or three boxers and everyone's Bernstein yeah they're all talking over each other it's it's uh it's not in my opinion it's not the most entertaining way to listen to people break down shit and this is a fight where you really you really want to consider all the different possibilities like Max Kellerman is always saying like Floyd has the advantage if they're fighting on the moon Floyd as he'd match bare-knuckle Floyd as the advance like okay are you totally sure are you totally sure it's the Skip Bayless but you know did where it's gonna make headlines but they don't believe that max believes that I don't I don't think max Lisa I think he's so so old-school boxing he has to say well he loves him and may - man I've had long conversations with kind of but I think he's my he's my favorite analyst I love max yeah he's very good no when I got me a favorite you're well I'm saying boxing come on come on brother there comes a box and then when when he goes when he goes comes I can hit him and I was like no disrespect but you $100,000 open a joint account yeah sent to his team like this house seriously I got to land a glove oh really come with that the hills come on man it could happen that law just storms out from one punch chaos I think with Showtime I had this chat with this one knows about it and I said I don't know what you know I don't be part of it I'm not sure I'm gonna do I said but what you have going on is you have your traditional box and commentators what which is great let's choose what you do this is not your typical fight you cannot have a biased panel who don't know anything about karmic record yeah they look this fights up or whatever or they just mimic or say what they've heard previously but they really don't know what Connors doing you have to have someone whether it's me or not but yeah it's gonna be me do you have to have someone telling you what Connors doing what he needs a duty to in the fight you can't have just a pro biased boxing commentating team because what's gonna make this the biggest papery of all time is the UFC fans of course we're the ones that are gonna buy this bitch yeah the old boxing heads look at triple G that's your best boxer two hundred thousand pay-per-view buys probably three hundred thousand sheep out but you know Andre Ward is right up there with him and Andre Ward gets way more no and he doesn't they don't do very well look up Andre Ward verse Cova left to what it was the past lightbox 275,000 that's it but still 100 more than in triple G still still for a rematch of a huge fight - and I'm saying so the Dana White the UFC comic Berger that fan base - UFC fan base is like nothing else man isn't true so you can't have just a biased box in Compton Kovalev does just over 160,000 oh my god I'll put a picture of me lifting weights in the bathrooms 165 thousand buys Wow so that's basically the same as triple G in the in the ward Kovalev two dozen around 25,000 pay-per-view buys how crazy is that is that which one's right Jalan ones July oh the first one versus the second one no the second one does 125 it's a paper loop flop so the most it did it said it pulls in 165 that was the final thing which is terrible which is longer or to that magnitude of that fight no one is June 30th and it said 125 and sylvans June 21st 160,000 second 125 oh no really yeah oh my god that's terrible that's that's a failure like they're you losing money when they're that yeah and you paid Andre Ward you know six and a half million dollars did he get that much yeah and you know you're talking about one of the best fights of all to especially thank you the fire is amazing what was more troubling not only the pay-per-view buys down but attendance numbers and gate revenue at Mandalay Bay Event Center in Las Vegas was not even close to matching the first bout which is held at t-mobile Arena tickets sold 6,000 tickets whoa that's crazy mm-hmm Wow so if you're gonna make this the biggest pay-per-view vault time you've got a bank on the mix martial arts crowd by having yeah so you want them to buy it they're gonna buy for counter anyways but you gotta have a voice in there that boy he's gonna be late to the people yeah and here's our argument for the Andre Berto fight which was the retirement fight for Floyd he only got like three hundred thousand papers whoops horrible when you're considering that he got four million for the Manny Pacquiao fight right wasn't something biggest of all time so he goes from the biggest of all time to a fight worth three hundred thousand people buy which is like really mediocre horrible the only people are buying Floyd Mayweather fights are people that want to see Floyd Mayweather get fucked up yeah and when he doesn't get fucked up they go down they get upset see I love even Floyd apologize for the Pacquiao fight yeah he's like yeah my bad like that sucked like that was not fun man well was crazy cuz Pacquiao was injured now Pacquiao fought that fight with a fucked up shoulder I got pack yes hating on this fight I won't even watch it yeah I guarantee your ass it's more entertaining than your fight with Floyd I guarantee that he's just still salty yeah cuz he's not you just lost a fucking homeboy horn in Australian you have to rematch him lost to a schoolteacher straight up straight up let's the Rich Franklin boxing yeah yeah just I don't know if that was a correct decision because I didn't I didn't try to score that I see both ways I watched it twice I can see both ways but but uh well I was watching my girl like darling god I feel like corn might have pulled that off she's like really I'm like yeah I can't listen the commentators they're so biased against Warren I feel like you might have did enough or especially early on like I kind of bring it to him how many times you get dropped once or twice Horne in that I think was the tenth round they almost stopped it yes that night eight ninth or tenth one of those rounds they're like hey if you don't show some improvement here we're gonna stop the flame so that was a rough round yeah but still the the accumulation of all the rounds I thought Horne pulled it off interesting either this argument for either one yeah still Pacquiao you lost a horn you get a hate on you know Mayweather and fucking Conor come on man you're the watch he's still salty because also he's got class-action lawsuits against him because he fought with the fucked up shoulder and a lot of people bet on if you fucked us yeah that's a weird situation if you're a fan and you know that the guy came into the fight compromise get that back but at the same time a lot of fighters fight with injuries right that's a big one now means a puncher and his shoulders fucked like you can't throw him so what do you do I guess they schedule I wonder what they did they give him a cortisone shot what do they do yeah woody if you're Manny Pacquiao what do you do just like hey I'm into every after schedule asleep well I think you figured well I'm gonna fuck it up I'm gonna get surgery anyway I just fuck it up further true going in sling bombs and hopefully our catcher and did nothing horrible fight well just I think he was really compromised in his movement you know I still don't think he beats him but no I don't think so either I think his style and particularly he's much shorter and smaller than Connor he's very fast but you know he'd also been knocked out by Manuel Marquez when Juan Manuel Marquez knocked him out with that one punch fucking devastating Bob Lam KL earth like literally stood still here second when that happened to I mean that was as clean a one punch knock okay so I'm never gonna see my face yeah it was a horrible knock out perhaps Marquez was on the supplements of his own country I think all of them were I think there's Mexican steroids and that wasn't about Manny is that Manny had gone up so many different weight classes and kept his power and in people like come on son [Music] I don't hate on them either I mean look the deal is that you pass the tests you're not testing on a Gil fuck you fighting Marquez who's clearly on those Tijuana Tijuana tamale fucking protein powder and a fucking testosterone son the Tijuana test you know in a hundred percent if he got in that Filipino you know what's crazy is that dude Juan Manuel Marquez had the same trainer they used to be a trainer for Manny what's his name angel I think it's Alex something like I was like it's something like that really smart physical conditioning trainer hey I'm Manny doing a bunch of really interesting stuff he's very good very good but he got picked up before help us it before for like injecting the Bain stuff yeah he had trouble before he was at the same guy like that's his thing right like that's what I don't know I know you supposed to be a really good trainer regardless well you know I mean you kind of think when you've got a guy like Floyd or one man Mel Marquez or anybody or Manny you got like a championship caliber athlete you know you got like you know Ferrari yeah I mean yeah make sure the tires are good suspensions tight and like you're a physical conditioning trainer you can't fuck the guy up too bad by the time he gets to his boxing skill work you don't want to be that exhaust no but also if we're racing cars and you know homeboy over here put a v12 and is he can be running with a v10 mastery 12 12 I mean yeah like that's that's the game though yeah when Manny was in his prime - oh my god whatever him jacked jiu-jitsu an American was like get strip clubs like Wilin out Barry John Jones ish and then his wife was like this shit has to stop and then he's like Jesus let's do it yeah he found Jesus that's all weird man for government and changed his life changed his life who knows it's especially now with testing you know they show up your house and knock any door you got to be clean yeah I've got a rubber game a really good friend even man blood even then you're in trouble man yeah you gotta have a twin and have that twin like live a steady healthy diet I don't don't tell anybody about him just leave him in the basement look at him there against Marcos Center umbrella do I got piss so back yeah Tim he looked super jacked there there's wonder he's bit look jacked damn Jack there - what's doubt that's the the Floyd fight yeah when it when he was like when he first started out he was I think he was I think he started out as a flyweight I'm not sure though I have to look at his a career record pull up Manny Pacquiao's career record is that I'm pretty sure he went through eight different weight classes which is crazy really stop and think about that I don't think very many people have done it so this is boring for a podcast we're just going over stats of Manny Pacquiao who the fuck knows what's gonna happen man what's interesting is that it's actually gonna happen I'm just a big fan of freak shows and that's and I don't mean that disrespectfully like that it's not a real contest obviously obviously it is from a betting perspective and obviously it is because Connor is a real combat sports world champion but it's a freak show in that it's we don't know it's not like like if Connor fought half el dos Anjos at 170 it's a fight like whoo that's gonna be interesting I wonder how that's gonna play out I wonder if it's you know they were supposed to fight at 155 I wonder if dos Anjos can fit you know that kind of thing happens that's an interesting fight that's interesting to think about you have all these variables you've seen their fights never seen counterparts you see you like little tiny clips that's all you ever see when's the last time where there's a fight like this where was it made like by the people I don't think ever UFC at all ever well there was James Toney versus Randy Couture but James was well past his prime and you know really didn't train for it at all he didn't know I mean there was a video James Toney preparing for the Randy Couture fight and he was way out of shape and he was just kind of like hitting pads and the guy would like shoot the worst double leg takedown on him in the history of the known universe and James are kind of sprawl and he'd be like yeah I'm working on my grappling you know working on my box and I was on my boxing rights and discipline issues they said he barely trained that but that's the boxing experts like I mean it's like James Toney coming to your world no it's not it's fucking not he came in out of shape didn't respect the game yeah just kind of was doing for the paycheck it's like if Anthony Joshua gets you know if he's got an actual black belt in jujitsu we don't know about and then decide to fight MMA yeah it's already Anthony Joshua yes yeah that's really what it's that's what it's like how's he gonna deal with kicks I was gonna deal with that that's where it's like yes there's some X factors like I don't know but I know he does these two things very damn way he's super good at knocking people dead yes yeah yes that's one of the things that guy does like that's that's a real threat he's at Conners in his prime he's 28 years old it's a real threat and you know he's gonna do it yeah like that why think Connor is he 100% believes he's gonna win this fight which is when you got a guy like that and he has momentum I sign you get the fucking nation of Ireland behind a god man that's some game throttle shit and also Floyd legitimately is almost 41 like I think he might be 41 at the fight like I think like his birthday happens between like what's his birthday like he might be 41 now the training camp he turned 41 definitely really saw this game though I was like he does not look 41 oh yeah he's great February okay so he's real close whatever is so when he gets to be whatever the age is when the wheels fall off why is it for knows what he knows that's the thing yeah who knows what happens if he gets dinged I think he well be slower and because if it's Floyd in its heyday yeah kind of insane a chance but Floyd thus not slower man well you remember my Donna you know my Donna came in fucking winging bombs at Floyd yeah and the first fight Floyd Conor I think maybe either underestimated him or didn't understand like the like the style that he was gonna be uh sent and he got clipped he got clipped with one punch at the end of one of the rounds where his legs wobbled and I was like whoa and then remember Flo did the rematch got it yeah what's he downloaded it but oh yeah I think Matt's made didn't take him serious it's possible or it's possible Maidana fought really well in the first fight and didn't fight so well in the second fight for various reasons you know but the only thing with that is Conor so much different than Madonna oh yeah yeah it's way more skillful he's also he's very capable of doing weird shit like at a distance his ability to move in and out is very crisp you know it's like you have to you have to respect it like what he did to Jose Aldo Slezak and drop that left hand in silly that was not something a lot of people are capable of doing under fire no no especially that what the stakes and you are Joe bear and it makes my truck just so much smaller than boxing it's just you know it's his timing that makes him special this time will be better than Floyd's Boyd's gonna be a little slower I just think Connors timing with the speed and power that's right that's why I give him a shot if Floyd sleeps on him at all and Connor comes in and does something very unusual and catches flow with the big punch early it could be chaos hey how about Floyd you're crazy man well here's the thing MMA fighters fight with four ounce gloves so like why is boxing decided that eight ounces are what's safe for everybody 135 pounds and up 10 ounces yeah eight ounces would say for anybody hundred thirty-five pounds and down so that's like only a few weight classes it's not shit but also those boxing gloves man ten ounces when you got the wrap on I mean if you have clubs on your hands man literally clubs just protecting somebody that's ten ounces you know wrap yeah interesting it makes us so interesting yeah it becomes like an MMA fight more mm-hmm it's nuts it's gonna be real weird it's gonna be real weird until we see what happens you know we might see Floyd pick him apart yeah and odds are that's gonna happen by just I don't see it man if he really does start fighting like this though ooh weird if calm starts doing yes Machida you know see it it's gonna be those those first like four rounds people hopefully whoever you're watching with there's people just silence just what in the fuck are we seeing right now well Floyd is also a counter striker and so is Connor but if Connor starts doing some weird karate shit and get some on his heels get some moving back and it's somehow another can get him into some weird position where he can move really faster than Floyd understands or he could close the distance quicker than Floyd expects I listen that's Paulie I go playing I know you guys hate each other all that but when you're sparring with there things out where Landing goes he did some things that we're all expected in death landed like man that's the thing with Connors if he's gonna if he has that in his bag his bag of tricks and when he throws it it has to count because you throw it Floyd you know got it yeah downloaded you got it downloaded how many do you have four five over twelve rounds you've got to make them fucking count man it's like you got five bullets you better you better hit the target man Yeah right and here's the other thing how brittle are Floyd's hands really pretty brittle broken them a few times right but it was a huge factor for me if you've ever seen like his training stuff like that after every session his hands are in pure ice and he has the most masseuse at night massage his handsome mafia factor right that was was that before his last fight yeah Roberto is well that's been going on for quite some time I still get sore yeah so think about this eight ounce gloves he hits Conor on that giant Irish head that right before his a forehead let's be real it's good-looking do be as a dome on him he hits that hand break his hand oh we going sizzling certain factors I like the bank on that's one of the recognizes that his hands broken and he starts talking to him but all you have is a jab and he starts shoving put his hands like this broke your fucking hole you folk to book your fucking hand didn't you little core and you let her head do can you imagine and then he just annihilates boy just walking down was an interesting like you people were really mad at him for calling Floyd boy oh man you can call you to the bitch motherfucker yeah don't say boy but the song is oh do you know Johnny yes my boys wrong with that hammer boys I said with Andre Berto I was like I kept saying the homeboy don't he left I was like racist hashtag never homeboys okay I was like yeah homeboys like oh he's my homeboy hey homeboy you got to really figure this out it's weird though because it has boy in it like you can't have any pause between home and boy on the home homeboy yeah you can't say that to a bug I know what it's too much boy and it's too be careful man cuz I know he said someone that's my boy it's hard to say triggered around the black guy trigger trigger trigger why sounds like yeah right yeah you like any word that's close what did you say I said shirt red true tested T bro trigger yeah boy you just can't yeah you can't like to see Cody go back to call sterling boy yeah college boy too yeah boys a weird one we just got to take it out though you like on social media can't do that but why not well because the I don't mean come on Joe but it's weird but good but here's the thing if al Jemaine start talking shit about Cody that boy can't touch me no problem at all I know the problem with that crazy yep no one has a problem with it well but black people can use the n-word and boy right cuz they kind of that like they would do some shit to earn that title but boy but boy used to be fine no it wasn't fine though right boy was probably always used like specially down south as a derogatory term for young black men always the white people had always hey boy hey boy over here all those fucking home depot candle carrying douchebags fucked up boy it's a fun word two great words those are my boys now I can't say that anymore definitely say that's do not have the token black guy yeah those are my those are my men hang out with white people just for that reason all whites all Heights I get Charlottesville fucking yeah about Ian Edwards I can't ever say Ian's my boy nope that's not the window no but with with Cody I don't think Cody's racist you don't wait to you boy keep fighting like but again you gotta know the connotation you got to know you're talking to a black guy so you like just don't use it like there's no use bro right give me some rice white guys don't bro you we we did but it used to be a black guy thing no I know sup bro no black guys own brah no no no that's new bro was like the 70s back when they had platform shoes on and fuckin bell-bottoms oh I feel like like it's that brother they had brother and bro what a bro it really yeah they're all of the meets over a sixer ya know it's like a wine your brh I'm talking B ru h brah brah brah what up bro yeah that's like from ice-t I think he perfected that correct so then they own it boys I say Ice Cube which one iced tea cube right she's little older mmm you know I'm saying though like this different brow man why people fucked up bro the race well became like guys who wear like loafers and go to private schools hey bro yeah maybe like The Fat Boys bros yeah the guys trying a little too hard but now yeah now it's a bad connotation cuz we go oh my god such bros over Bros like oh they're such bros like I don't know sighs oh my I get bro science all the road using bro science no vegans love to say that bro science it's a funny thing but it's it's anti male in a lot of ways and it's really rude they get upset if you mock anyone thats transgender or anyone that's a woman or anyone that's gay but they have no problem calling us bros yeah you have no problem shitting on the very essence of being a man is rolling out rolling out bro and I'm embarrassed to say it that's toxic masculinity man it's toxic I mean if I post a picture of Spartacus and with me my bros we're getting roasted get roasted the bro squad rode it out didn't used to be that way it's become that way over the last few years when so many douchebags use bro we did it to ourselves we did to ourselves but a lot of tools did it cuz they took it over and used it yeah it's not we we're being generous including ourselves the rest of the men who fucked it up true we didn't fuck it up I feel like we made it cool but we use brother now that's right brother yeah brother the other can work yeah brothers like you can't just turn brother around a guy barely know tonight oh what's up brother you can do the tricky what's your honk oh yeah that's so friendly you want everybody to be your brother like whoo okay you could be that guy man I don't trust guy use his brother just with anyone don't say you can't I throw it around a lot from high from high and I meet strangers so really you have to mean greets I say Bravo what's up brother yeah see that's different right he experienced something with them they saw your show I know a little bit different brothers yeah in a way in a way hey man what do you think about this Tony Ferguson Kevin Lee fight that's a good goddamn fight I love that fight Kevin Lee is a bad motherfucker isn't he we took Michael kisses back and strangled him I definitely choked him it was maybe maybe he was survived but the bottom line is that shit was locked up and I should've never gotten locked up well where I come from when you go like this and you're and then your body goes limp you're about to go out well he was saying and he was just concentrating on his neck flexing it's now yeah me too I was pretend I was asleep when oh your punch in the face but no for real like if if a guy's really good at getting choked and he can figure out how to like kind of tuck his chin and flex his neck and just ride out the choke and if he thinks he's got enough air not a rear-naked and Kevin Lee only is a straight-up strangler that's a strong fucking you know hundred percent I know I know black belts man you get there you get there through cheese's is the black belt yeah he's not ranked but he's a grappler I believe he has black belt level especially in the UFC yeah I'd say he's a black belt you have all grappling the yeah oh yeah I definitely think it's our black level I know high level competition black belts where if a blue belt gets on your back and they have a full sunken-in rear naked children there's not much you're gonna do you can hand fight but it's actually in your fuck especially a strong athletic guy like any III get Kevin Lee on this and I love my pee Michael he's a beast I like all his fights I just feel like Kevin Leman I think that the division needs him too he dresses well speaks well he's exciting to watch you know 100% he's just the mistake that Mario made and stopping that fight before an absolute conclusion is a big mistake oh my that's a joke yeah a joke you got a live one you have to live now we have to have this argument then Kevin Lee is like Nike is choking them out Cheech is is arguing it wasn't when you fucked up Mario damn it because if chiesa just did go out unconscious then we got debate and then Kevin Lee has this amazing clean win and there's no bullshit attached to it to me though it was amazing clean win we just moved on with Mario fucked up but he was going out anyways what's accepted because I'm fighting and stone inferno they did in it Walter good yeah you're on the undercard it's a good move too because Tony and Kevin Lee were John back and forth to each other yeah you know that's a good fight it's a very good fight Kevin Lee is a beast and he's a young guy he's he's one of those guys are like you see from his first fight to the UFC's his giant leaps though yeah it was a big kiss-off I thought was gonna give him a lot of problems when he took him that got his back was like Jesus Christ man he Castle landed a left hand on him but when I watch it over in the replay you know sometimes when you've seen it live to your look sure through the fence yeah it's hard to tell what lands what doesn't land he moved away from it mostly caught on the end of it moved away from it and then you know once they got to the ground it was crazy that he took es is back and he dominated the position super dominate the other thing is I find interesting is Kevin Lee wonder he wants to fight could be after the fight for the past three fights like you I won't be in rushes like Joe take a superstar chill son well that's the way to do it man you know ask to fight the scariest fucking guy in the game you know but it didn't the thing about Habib is I don't know where his body's at when they're saying his liver shut down when he was supposed to be fighting talking about a different game yeah what does that mean like a use case so much weight that his body literally was shutting down if a fucking Russian goes to the hospital before a fight yeah we got some serious problems serious problem you didn't cut weight right and cut too much too soon and it's not even that they canceled the five-round fight for the interim title and have a three-round fight for a catchweight they don't even do that though you can't fight the commissioners like nominees livers shutting down this is why when people like oh we got to be Bruce Conner next let's just talk about that logistically yeah got a guy who can't make weight almost died making the way you go on a world tour against the biggest name ever mixed martial arts and your McGregor yes that's gonna be your fight you think I was just gonna commit to that how could he do that why would you why would you do that not only that Michael Johnson fight with khabib apparently same issue but he got through it like they're saying this the same thing that happened in the Michael Johnson fight so this means like as every weight cut you do especially as you get older apparently your body resists like a sponge you get yeah it's bigger and bigger it gets harder and harder your body does not want to do it no yeah in just every time you get fat as fuck in between fights direct you know who's hilarious cat Zingano was talking about chicks like gaining weight in between fights about you cut all that weight bro I'll fuck your body up like for a woman getting that low in weight and body fats probably even more fuck the thyroids are fucked like like my brother my sister-in-law my brother's wife she did competitions cut weight and her thyroid let me it just fucks their bodies up oh when they're doing a bodybuilding competition all that water like for the girls like you know some of these girls you see in the UFC like the day of the fight I gotta that's a super model yeah three weeks a god damn yeah how does page event look like a delt right now like how did like they just blow up like it's literally like their body's good well the body just probably really resists that weight cut it's just not doesn't want to do it anymore no probably your body goes into famine mode you know it starts taking we got to retain some water on this but that's looking for that cyborg fight but cyborgs trying to fight Holly and Matt Square Garden that's a big fight that's that I talk cyborgs two days go and she's like man Holly massacre guard that's what I want well I get where there's some money you know I mean Holly is coming off that Trent Germaine de Ronda may fight to I'm in the way yeah but but what I'm but bets go hey was really not in her League my opinion not at all whereas you see the rent to me is she cracked her me Duran to me with that high kick and then dropped her with that straight left hand like Jermaine Duran to me is as legit as striker as you're ever gonna see the Guardians mmm I agree so long as she's not playing cyborg well Holly to drop her yeah she just didn't want no part of that have you ever seen anything like that ever and makes my large damn I'm just went radio silent fucking six months they came back like she did stuff like ten years ago I'm gonna cut down to fuckin 135 when I was talking to her post fight and I said well what about cyborg you know was asking her and doing the post-fight interview just like them fucking a hand hurts right now let's talk about this later Joe good question though probably if you do have a hurt hand which I believe she probably absolutely did now's the time to do it like hey I got this title I definitely don't to have one hand your fight but she didn't do anything right she was like no that was an excuse she might have but she vacated the title cause like now I'm not gonna do that ha fighting again soon yeah she's 135 she vacated the belt was like now the good side have fun up there Holly for cyborgs an interesting fight because I think stylistically Holly's the perfect matchup to beat cyborg not only she beats her but style wise she's made to beat cyborg thinking about yeah let's just go through think if Holly beat cyborg she's a great to make smart female makes monsters from all time merch Ronda with a head kick so she beats the greatest something grants wealth on Mercer goes on a little bit of a tough run who gives a fuck right then beat cyborg should be Ron and cyborg right we're going sizzler yeah and then me to take comes back get to get you some shoes what her ask for five rounds and then just got choked up at the end but think about it you beat Ronda who was undefeated them then you beat freakin cyborg if she beats cyborg and Misha comes back and fights her again that's a giant fight so Chyna fight but for me she wants to fight again if she want I bet you do it for that sitting around supervise that got this you see tonight blanket poor poor - it itches fuck the state still first team all all cutie up there oh yeah yeah first team booty hit hey there was a recent those UFC tittays UFC today so those are some period you see - Holly if Holly can somehow again I don't think she's going to but you never know I didn't you know who I didn't think she was really gonna beat Rana but if she somehow can pulled off beat cyborg and she beat Ronda move did they do we just give her like some weird statue for the UFC gym now like how does this work he's a net but you know don't you think that in their eyes like there's always going to be even though she beat Ronda like Ron does the one that put the on the map she's always gonna be revered more UIC I don't think so I think she has such a crash-landing like the worst of all time and she's gone radio silent that we don't remember that that climb do you think people are upset at her like you weren't really a fighter like you only fight her for a little bit if you were really a fighter you'd still be there you'd be getting back into it you're still young people your watch no matter what no matter what no matter what they thought you were one thing and you fail like I know fuck in those I know they get mad if you were their hero for sure and you're not doing what they want you to do or you talked about being a do-nothing bitch and now you get knocked out and you're you're doing nothing you know it's like how dare you I bought the shirt whether she was hosting battle the Network Stars you know I mean I could see not wanting to fight anymore right you didn't want to fight anymore at a certain point I'm a little different you know she was a world like she accomplished a lot more than me you know I I love my life now it's never been better man like I love what I'm doing you know I don't know she doesn't have a thing like no no maybe was bad all the Network Stars I don't you home I can't believe I talked to him to doing that and also maybe she makes so much money like maybe she's good there too I don't know but even if you make so much money the yeah everybody thinks that that's gonna be enough to make you happy it's not it'll definitely be you in a position where you don't have to worry about bills no maybe that's your number-one problem and then you're gonna be happier that's possible once you check that off the other problems start to come up yeah all right well now what am I gonna do like I don't have a passion what am i waking up for there was a study on income and they one of the things they said was when it comes to like overall happiness see if we could find this I think they said everything over seventy thousand dollars a year is kind of a wash I thought seventy five thousand right strange and like don't from if you go up from a bike to a car your happiness nice when you go from a car turn didn't just buy another car you have two cards nothing nothing that's not true I agree my Corvette you know I fuck you're talking about the perfect salary for happiness is $75,000 a year wouldn't depend where you live what you like to do yeah see I don't know about that for like the magic income as people earn more their day-to-day happiness Rises until you hit seventy five thousand dollars after that it's just more stuff with no gain and happiness that someone has never had a really cool you never like had a deck that overlooks the mountain we drill with your buddies you never been able to go on these dope ass vacation had a steak in a different of Japan get some sushi fresh out of the fucking ocean is a master chef that private jet you can have some power times hell yeah yeah but maybe you get a fucking yacht you're in Pitt and go through the Caribbean yeah Mon you do whatever you want to get kids you take it on the case wherever you want fuck shit dr. Phil be just as happy if you made seventy five study bro yeah you think you are must be super pumped to go down to about seventy five thousand a year I think Oprah is fucking getaway cars we can say

moose lives matter I don't discriminate light down I've never shot them I look the thing is man here's the thing about animal rights activists and people that are nutty about animals again what this is is a genetic anomaly it's not like this is a specific breed it's like a normal person right it's not albino though it's not an albino apparently it's just got some weird genetic anomaly one of a hundred yeah there's a hundred of them so what is it look see it as if it says scroll up a little bit I think it says what the genetic mutation is yeah see it's fur coloring as a genetic mutation and it's not an albino not albino unlike like all white animals I heard they taste like vanilla they taste good dude well you never had a white one though you never seen one event same same shit Sam on the inside it's like white people it's all the same look at that wow it's crazy another some some people have the stream coloring might be another sign of a Shore to be coming apocalypse when you see a hoard of white moose yeah there was only 100 of them though I wouldn't tell anybody I'll tell you one thing if I did kill that I'd keep my mouth shut I wouldn't tell people they'd get too mad even if it didn't matter like if you find a bear okay like there's a black bear if you're hunting black first of all if you're hunting black bear people get mad at you anyway cuz you're killing a bear cuz then on brown bears they think the Bears are extinct or there's very little bears there's so many bears that they're all cannibals they eat each other well that's a fact yeah they the Cubs yeah they'd the Cubs like crazy including the females eat their own good Tama seniya take out the big older ones cuz the fuck up all the cub yeah it's actually better for the population to take out the big males because the big males eat correct like what when we were there oh wow these white deer moose bro I'm going through a little baby why twins eggs grab those and run off in my car they're cute as shit

dangerous I'm down okay well dear I mean if they did want to fuck you up with those things they could stab you but the thing is they're their prey and this is what they are in nature they eat grass and they get preyed upon they are the food source of mountain lions wolves and countless bears and countless other animals I mean that's just what they are they're beautiful while they're alive it's not like you should somehow or another you know diminish their existence but that's a prey animal if leather here that's why they mean in the system that they're in the system yeah we didn't know this they're in there goddamn delicious so we had some access deer for Darrin had access to but when you post those are you so hungry good I've been that in my opinion is like the most if you can get to Hawaii Hawaii if you can get to Hawaii that's the most ethical place to hunt because they don't have any predators so they have to kill these animals so they have like some insane number of deer on Lanai they have access to you're on Maui they haven't been uh I think Molokai hasn't - there's no predators no predators none so the only predators are people so they actually bring over snipers to take out some of the deer to keep the population numbers down less because if the population gets too high what happens is these deer start getting disease they start you know they run out of food to eat the good thing about y2 is there's so much growth like so much plant growth they can love it you weren't there for your birthday would you do for your birthday nothing what a Disneyland just took the kids at school yeah I'm not a big party guy you're still a birthday party that had your family it's speaking to a video a good idea right anyway yeah I'm not a big birthday yeah it's just like I don't want to be the center of attention like that it's ironic as that sounds because most of what I do you want to be in the center of attention awkward yeah but it just seems like you're just weird

I was I loved it I loved swear to God when the movie guys I stood up stand ovation slow clap everyone else sit out I love when they made the AI guy he gave them I don't wanna say too much spoiler has been out for a grip doesn't matter some people out there don't have a car god dammit it's been out for how many my okay you're gonna have to really tune out now folks cuz we're gonna talk about I've seen alien covenant that came and Amy has seven months ago go ahead and shown up fucked he has to eat it is to eat it well alright you do have to tell a story that one alien that hybrid alien yes whoo dude it was fun I like the fact that that the AI guy like they they cut out his creativity and I started getting weird good so he makes sense I give you give artificial intelligence the the need and the ability to create so but this movie went prometheus first then this right yeah yeah I was like ten years after Prometheus yeah I love Prometheus I like that what was the movie with the alien they named him Calvin you know I'm talking about and yeah I like that too do I watch that on every plane I watch them laugh those movies is theirs cut the shit scenes like when the you know life one let they're playing with it and they try these experiments with it and the shock e-electric like come on man you doing this out in space don't you want to bring this back to earth before you start fucking with insecured laboratory we can't because you do that and look if we brought that bitch back to earth and you know I'm saying I thought that we're doing things like zapping it I'm trying to like stimulate they thought he was dead though remember that in today's abdomen he went rich yeah that movie was so dull tense he was scariest shit was scary you know the problem was they don't they gave him a little bit of a CGI face I didn't like that either like that demon face ah man I don't need that keep him tavin I like how they call him Calvin yeah because they couldn't make it too demonic cuz then it would be alien just the most demonic that thing is the most amount of things so scary oh it's awesome god I love that tongue thing comes out all this I like all a slobber and shit that comes out of its mouth to it this big giant fucking bug head dude have you been to the the theatre it's right off it's in Westwood there I picked now you're talking you get steaks you can get chicken tenders and you gotta be off your diet where is it it's right off of I think well sure well sure and I was it like until I pick like cine appleís there comes that kind of the VIP it's gonna come out 60 dogs getting the door that's the way to do it though that's it son where's that that's it take your wifey there that's the movements really get less people they have all outcall drinks mistakes like everything like it I like it and you can look down upon the people who didn't buy the VIP tickets it's cool and judging by you also there's people below either of regulars yeah give out their peasants move on peasants don't look at me what if they talk enjoy the movie pass down below you know they're angry about their position in society excuse me ma'am ma'am phone now that is a system that you can get for your house where it downloads movies as they come out you can watch brand-new movies I need that Chazz they come out because with a kid like it like Annabelle the new Annabelle camera I love scary movies you see it I want I'm dying to see it that new it you seen that new hit trailer shit your parents scary it looks come in September here's how these movie papers in pissed-off why there I think it's run by Netflix or the same guy that started Netflix started this sort of thing it's been available for a while at 50 bucks month but now it's down to 10 bucks a month what there's some weird catch there's some catches to it like it's only for 2d versions and then like you still have to pay for a ticket or something that need and paid back to some weird okay good I would pour like one dollars a month to watch movies at my house this is not at your house though this is different something totally different this is just cheap movie tickets that people are mad about yeah but the house thing's not cheap the house thing is a system you get I think it's like fifty thousand dollars and once you have it installed in your house then you can watch movies as they come out and they're on like a hard drive such a movie buff too if you have like a home theater that's what I'm saying having a home theater it's cool because with a kid it's tough to get the babysitter I seem like fuck man yeah just saw like Star Wars you know like it takes a while like I'm like I can't wait for that come on DVD you know fine thank you most movies that are out I think that is exactly it and it's very expensive like I said I think it's like fifty thousand dollars and it just comes with the service to provide the movie yeah I think you just it's like a hard drive and you download whatever the movie is that you want to see you gotta watch it I feel like you shouldn't do that now because with this technology's coming so fast and like Netflix are going you know big movie stars like Will Smith and these guys announced it and do these Netflix deals so you don't have to go the theater do this it's got a fingerprint reader finger swipe with liveness detection liveness liveness means someone wants to cut your fucking hand off and have a dead hand that they use to start up your screen or just take your fingerprint on a piece of paper or a dead hand whoa liveness we're just like you see life right up there under fingerprint Center what kind of a person wants to kill someone so they can see Pirates of the Caribbean oh dude I would I might kill a bitch at home dude how great would that be I don't like getting ready going out I want to chill at home my undies watched all the new movies the real problem is other people when they can't keep it together and they start answering phone knocking I've been in so many movie theaters where people start talking it is so annoying I screw this one movie theater a little urban take that how you want a little urban and there's a move to homeboy in front of me just on the phone the whole time people are cut and so I go bro off the phone man and he keeps going he puts up his finger like this oh my god Oh

god what am I gonna do here I got my girl hair what you see with all those people right I'll look similar get my drift what am i gettin doin am I gonna get jumped like hell I could I can tell you what movie I saw it was your whole experience yeah I'm just balls deep in popcorns I'm gonna fuck our bags up carving up car bloated car boom movie gets done you didn't say shit but the whole movie up though we shoulda said something I was stressed mmm probably three four years ago I think I know I think if I was you if I could remote control your body on my cold there's smack them in the head there's a bunch Banyon with your girl you know what I'm saying through it depends on how many you got but yeah that's it it is a very very rude and it's degraph like I can see your phony on Facebook and what the fuck you're in the movies he's a dummy people got me addicted you're a dummy they're goddamn addicted to their phones like do you know if you people have the ability to sit through a fucking podcast without looking at their phones you know how to do it but a lot of my guests I see them checking their phones texting hold on just kept Texas so disrespectfully would you do that if you're on SportsCenter no yeah especially not now no no at this in this day and age but for some people the requirement of an hour or two or in a podcast 3 without checking the phone impossible chill out you're not that busy folks it's not that it's they're addicts they're straight-up junkies they're getting that little tweak that little rush of intubation right that doesn't mean if they get an email or text they say literally we don't and we don't even know how addicted the phones are but people their brains have come and addicted to it just to the sensation of feeling it yeah and the colors and mentions and Instagram and DMS my mouth the South 80 it's never as fun as talking to friends well you go to a restaurant you'll see five people on their phones I mean looking at each other I hate that and when you're hanging out with a friend and they're on their phone all the time it's brutal its little do it like maybe here can be come in here put your phone down put your phone down there's some restaurant they take your phone at the door you know that fuck and there's some that give 20 bucks then the some if you don't use your phone you 25% off what if you don't use your phone at all so your cameras overhead no you're in the restaurant you checked it no I tricked it when I got up from the table now doesn't count don't get the deal I'm in I was taking a shit no I didn't have anything to do you can't check it still you check in the restaurant in the restaurant I don't know how it works please they can prove ain't shit so you can check your Facebook took a fake shit just to check your Facebook addicted son yeah man people are super addicted you and Joey Diaz are pretty good about calling oh yeah I caught you always get your great copy and I take so much my sometimes you know sometimes I don't know cuz you're busy so now I'm busy so you gotta text you texting novels no we went back and forth there was a we had a question I'm like okay I gotta hear this yeah you gotta talk yeah yeah man there's some people that just they what for whatever reason are tethered to the hip and then there's some people that decide they can't use it at all so they just go straight cell phone like like button phone flip phone yeah re re Aziz Ansari Aziz Ansari's gone totally off the internet I was watching some video the in or no it was a reading of Vice article he was vice they interviewed him and they were asking about it he's an offline he got rid of his social media really got rid of all this shit he's a little anything so did I ed Sheeran cuz he appeared on Game of Thrones and he got such backlash he was just you know he doing it for what it is you know these trolls who gives a fuck on everything everything there's nothing you do to get away from that nothing it is 100 to Kevin Hart's post and it's like fuck you little mints like Kevin Hart yeah there's too many people and everybody having access to you everybody being able to communicate with you if you just decide to swim in that River and you wonder why you got poisoned yeah I agree the problem is with your kids like even now my son he wants to get my phone and you know do it like Justin he's not going to Twitter and checking teams and dick pics but he's like scrolling through you mean just as the stimulation oh yeah like your daughter's how old are they seven and nine their phones no your nine-year-old doesn't know she can let them dust no she shut the school back if you give kids phones you let them see beheading videos you're letting them to come on the latest news I'm liking where they can see that car run over those people at the white power rally yep in all that shit a kid can see and they're gonna see their friends gonna tell them about it just think of the shit that you look at I mean think of the shit that I everyday I'm posting some new ridiculous video someone doing something stupid and some brain damage but good luck keep an eye on your kids 9th grade is weird 9 years old is what grade 3rd going in 4th wait till she gets the 6th grade yeah I think like in school or some sometimes they may have the the iPads to write your notes and shit oh yeah for sure and those things go online yeah yeah it's one of those things where you got to wonder at what point is it okay to give it to them and you do how much do you regulate it and how much you do you do it by example you know if you're at home with your kids and like stay up the phone kids and you just like constantly check then they're gonna be pissed at you there should be no phones between whatever you know especially dinnertime so no it's gonna be a beast man what do we do with a big thing we do in my house a lot of art a lot of art school constantly constantly like they're always painting and drawing and doing shit if you give kids that opportunity to do something and then they they get like in a pattern of doing it all the time where they're not still you know they're stimulation doesn't come TV yeah no yeah we let them watch TV we don't keep it from them but we don't let them watch it all day yeah so it's I think that like I think especially creativity is important for kids because the more they realize they can make things even if you could just make something out of paper mache or something were you writing something you know something that didn't exist you like my daughter writes stories like a story that didn't exist now the story's written like you wrote it you created it like you realize you read stories you can also write them you know paintings make a painting make it a drawing the more you realize you can create things it's my thought it opens up your idea of what's possible for your whole life you can create things in your life you don't have to think on anyone you can create businesses you can create a career you can figure out like how to work hard at something and create it I also think it's really good for their little brains to like make things 9% yeah for me that it's wit because every morning I live across from a school at the elementary school yesterday was there the first day of school so there's all these parents dropping off their kids I was watching the kids play outside and I walk my son every morning I was singing God how the fuck is he gonna make friends like it's all the cliques I've never thought about ever ever in my life about how this little dude gonna make friends ones V doesn't make friends you can't either do you can't be paranoid I think you be 10 push-ups even when they don't make friends that that's good too yeah realize like what's wrong like why aren't you making friends like what adjust your behavior accordingly yeah well don't be the introverted kid who's and balls-deep in the comics maybe you know yeah I agree or do and then and then take over the world like Hollywood hmm you know but it's the first time it ever crossed my mind I saw these kids play I thought ha one of them to be doesn't make friends I got a deal with that what are you gonna do if your son gets older and he is like sort of introvert II kind of nerdy and you see some predatory bitch move in what if your son becomes like some super successful producer type character yeah and you see some pred like a predatory coyote type woman just moving on to leeches no runs and tells them what to do home oh I can see it you go over the house and you're like son you can't let her tell you there's nothing you can do there's the power of the pussy there's no nothing to do do you know that feeling that you have on a friend and you see a friend is getting taken over my god like almost like I go like a a pod person you know like one of them Night of the Living Dead no not it's like avatar what is it fucking movie they vage of the body snatchers remember no dude well there's a couple versions of it there's a really really old version for like the 50 what's the new one that well there's three there's a Donald Sutherland version which is I think want to see like the 70s which is excellent a young Jeff Goldblum's in that it's great it's a great movie and it's creepy scary and then you know like good special effects for the time for the time and then there's a more recent one with jennifer Tilly I think is in it or Meg Tilly Meg Tilly Jennifer Tilly's sister there's also an actress yeah yeah yeah what it is is while you're sleeping it's somehow another like the fibers get a hold of you like it climbs up like if the pods like near the bed it gets all of you and touches you and then it puts you to sleep and starts replicating you underneath the bed so like wow while you're sleeping it's like draining your body and replicating you and then in the morning you're dead you're like a dry husk and there's an alien is underneath yeah so this is Donald Sutherland as he's asleep this thing had was taking over and recreating him and he woke up that's where it was too late dude it was a dope movie let's keep her Sullivan's dad is it I don't know that no wonder what keeps it so months were fucked up dad was done with other one oh that's that's Jack Bauer if you if you grow up in a your dad's a famous actor and you're you become an actor you're somebody gonna be fucked up yeah and be a little weird that's the end well that must be the new like there's that poster mmm what is that one invasion of the body snatchers yeah 1978 no that must be the 78 version because of the newer ones oh the newer one is below that in green seed and green down there well no no that's the really old one that's the 1950's one dude it looks pretty there's there's one more that happened with meg tilly I don't remember what year but I want to say it's like maybe late now don't recreate it already mmm yeah there she is ah age of the Body Snatchers the dork report oh it's just called Body Snatchers realize oh really I'll check that shit out um do you not movie was that's the porn version body stencil you know movies dope I watched on the plane with 1993 oh yeah that was pretty good but it's one of those things like you don't even make those things so many times what was dope I watched that movie with Ben Affleck where he gets he moved to Tampa he's a like a mafia gangster was the tamest accountant no no see I thought of the counting I was taking sleeping pills I was a little out of it I thought was the counting and I was like counted to the accountant that's not this it was something else that shit was so good really yeah he's like he's involved with the mob they wanted to go run the the Tampa Bay Wing of it so he goes down there oh fuck it was good huh oh man it was fucking classic was it yeah hi were you you're high as a kite I might have been fucking an ambien and chef food they don't work on me really I took in my nice gym people are like gonna take one I was like I'm not that sleepy so I pop a three of them I was fucking what I open live by ass six point four on Rotten Tomatoes fuck it haters how dare you ever see his argument with sam Harris on the Bill Maher show no I have it in a very uninformed huge mistake he argued with Sam Harris about that but what's in Islam hey listen Sam Harris you never seen it no it's hilarious cuz Affleck doesn't know what to do so he goes full social justice warrior starts calling Sam Harris a racist saying it's gross you're so gross it's so racist he's so gross and then sam harris is like super calm there's he's the problem like you can't like yell and argue with harris cuz he will never go there what makes you look in it makes you look super amateur especially when he starts spouting out facts oh we're talking about an ideology did ben affleck go on there to debate him i think what it was is he was getting ready for batman this is my personal belief it has no basis in fact and it's just pure speculation brother he's on steroids steroids getting ready for Batman he's got Jack for Batman he got jacked and I think when you get jacked like that get a little fucking testy yeah he had no yes don't know Dana just fucking robot he tried to swing a little Dana look with Sam here and he just got just got run over oh my god what are you thinking and everybody was super mad at him afterwards really he's like oh yeah online you got torn apart they just handled it very poorly I see I don't get the hate well obviously he fucked up there but I don't get the hate with Ben Affleck he makes good movies but Gigli alright your fuck you don't see that and I go that's the real you well that's it was Lane on steroids could be could be could be I think that I've never seen him behave like that before and he definitely got jacked for that movie and when you're 45 years old or whatever he is you don't you just don't get jacked like not put on muscle you don't put normal it's not know unless you're on some radical supplements which if Hollywood calm is that K won't you be Bruce Wayne I'm gonna get on that but Gotham City cycle I'm gonna get on some of that clenbuterol to lower my body fat oh I'm calmed at all I'll release the hounds I'm a fuck didn't even need a mask it's just gonna be fucked look at that he gained 20 pounds 228 pounds total got down to seven point nine percent body fat Ben Affleck stranor Walter Norton jr. talks about Ben Affleck spotted during the days filming the town he lost 12 pounds for the town he was stronger in every lift hey Walter Norton jr. how would you tell us the cycle is uncut the hell yeah the truth about testosterone but if you know of him with his shirt off at 7.9 percent body fat because I think I'm calling bullshit on to don't you know how low that is very low you never got that ripped he wasn't even as ripped his last Batman Christian Bale yeah coat hanger though you know he's real thin now he got jacked he's a muscle he's always thin um yeah yeah I don't think he's an ectomorph mesomorph no I don't know well let's look at him look at him next but I think you're wrong on that Wow let's uh you see he got a good picture pull it up so we could say show us what do we got here no that's not good shirtless Ellis with a tank top that him rocking just one right rock oh that's rocks bodies guys Jack that's the rock oh that's face yeah that's the tattoos well go up to the one right there that's Superman is it a damn Superman surprise jacked yeah Ben Affleck is kinda sorta jacked but Ben Affleck shirtless that's that's Ben Affleck fucking dad mode though that's not him shirtless what's that word there that was ten years ago you let me suck you stop this right now that is so not seven point nine percent body fat go back go back to those pictures of them right there that is not even remotely 17 so that's why that's not more like 20 yeah yeah limit this is an Argo okay different movie good low upper right-hand corner okay right hand corner no that's not him son that's the wall from True Blood died asked Joe Manganiello why are they lying here benefics is ripped sexy you know Jack no Chris Pratt got jacked I don't know if that's real that's pretty enough recognize Chris Pratt you that see that's not really that jacked there was a scene of him in that's how it used to be used to be fat he looked pretty good yeah but that's not like the rock jacked Jesus Christ that's fake all these are fake pictures who's that guy that's American Dad him in Batman that's a Caesar suit son's got a bullshit suit on so this o total homeboy there yes Jake Gyllenhaal oh yeah he did get jacked you know who else got is that really Jake Gyllenhaal right there yes that's what the set looks like to go back to him now you going to gay porn Jamie stop it Ben Affleck see if it's a guy George often now he's fucking super Jeff that's like 10% their summer scents so unheard of that looks like a guy's fighting in the UFC right now correct yeah Jake Gyllenhaal's well my face yeah see that's the kind of dedication I don't know and have like house dude get down to that Good Will Hunting you never saw that and I've never seen that that's some shit now go to Christian Bale see much more jacked there's some good pictures of Christian Bale jacked type in Christian Bale jacked that's pretty good right there really yeah yeah now he's he just looked more like a guy who could really fuck you up then I feel like Ben Affleck looks true no no just respect that no disrespect like right there upper left-hand corner alright Ryan Reynolds first team all by fucking jacked right there it is I mean that looks like a real Batman oh my god that's the machinist that was like one of the worst movies he ever did in terms of like the reception of God people watched it it wasn't bad it was really weird but the difference between being the skinny guy on the right hand side which was like him dying I mean he essentially starved himself almost a death and then a few months later he's the guy on the left that's him in the movie fuck they couldn't sleep didn't eat look how skinny he got man he's all good of an actor is that fucking I don't know if that's acting that's just being a psycho that's defecating dude that's defecation - yeah your craft is starving to death you're really good at it I mean that's the mental willpower it's a oh yeah for sure but it's really bad for your body oh and it's not good enough it's not good enough of a movie - I'll tell you who got jacked was Ryan Reynolds oh he's jacked yeah for Blade 2 Christie ball body oh yeah that's right yeah he's wrecked yeah but why wouldn't you do that if you're playing a fake character I don't get why you wouldn't do a nice cycle oh yeah for sure or you do the yeah who's jacked yeah or you do the Gerard thing what's that guy's name from 300 Butler yeah they just CGI the fuck out of you I have a hilarious story with that where I'm 300 they're you know they're making the movie everyone's doing Crossfit non-stop doing the Spartan workouts right and Butler's not showing up and they're like what the fuck man you think I'm not doing this I don't want to do that he goes just tell me when I have to be ready I will be ready by any means necessary like really is like I got this and they didn't do what everyone else didn't came fucking killed it yeah well it probably the thing about the cross is that really what his body actually yeah yeah Wow but now he's like what the fuck he was super jacked and then he let himself go wow it's hard to maintain that well that's not right yeah that's you can't mean how much it's real how much is what he really looked like oh go upper left-hand corner yeah was that okay that's that's more realistic now there's even a better one keep so let it go that one set of tits on let himself go imagine if you're a girl and you think you're fucking 300 and you get that goddamn and you feel that God rest on the top your ass why bang you from behind [Laughter] that's the worst night of your life what you gonna do when they come for you mm-hmm Brendan

awesome headlines do you have any any prediction I just you can't what do you think I've been your heart of oh this is what I like I like shocking results a shocking result is Mayweather comes out
