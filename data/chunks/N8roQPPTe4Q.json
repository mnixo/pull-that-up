yeah he's uh I think he's too smart too smart to talk to regular people boom how are you buddy I'm great we just got back from playing a little techno hunt we did mana ah greatest thing of all time right I was just saying I don't care what the price is it's worth it it's a bargain at twice the price of whatever it is yeah where people don't know what it is it's this game that it simulates bowhunting so what it is is is a giant screen that's made out of Kevlar and then it's got us like a projector projects HD images of elk and deer you could set up for a bunch of different animals but elk and deer walk across the screen and you shoot at them and it's like the perfect there's a we show a little video of Shane and earlier it's been really cool man it's a perfect practice for bow hunting because one of the things about bow hunting is a you get nervous and the more you could do something like this where you just shot a perfect shot the more you could do that over and over and over again the more it becomes ingrained in your your your nervous system grained in your muscles ingrained in your memory and then it becomes natural yeah it's awesome yeah it's pretty dope we're gonna make this podcast about 15 minutes long and go back and shoot so yeah that's what we're actually talking about cutting off the podcast short yesterday so tell me about this movie man yeah so I'm in LA for the premiere the HBO premiere of the momentum generation it's a it's a it's a sports documentary that HBO and Robert Redford did so it's cool man it's it's really cool it's uh it's a story about my friends and I we you know we all grew up competitive surfers and in high school we all sort of met each other through through competitions competing so this tells the story of how we basically how we met how he grew up and how he became friends and family basically like traveling around the world you know together as basically like little kids with no with no chaperones on on tour around the world so I'm crazy it's a it's a wild story pull this up to your keep just like a fist way how old were you when you first started surfing I started surfing on a stand-up surfboard when I was five and when did you start traveling serve when I was 12 I went to England for the World Amateur Championships so I was on the Hawaii team doing this traveling surfing thing yeah most of your life yeah I have it's crazy that is nuts man I didn't I've been putting my surfboards in a board bag and you know walking out the door with my passport since I was 12 and going to so many different destinations around the world literally just for surfing Wow not such a crazy way to grow up and that's a cool thing about the film is all of us had that in common and it's it's crazy the way the story set up too because there's so many things in it that I didn't really realize were happening at the time like like I came from you I came from a broken family alcoholic father you know kind of radical situation at home and then like a lot of us had like broken families a lot of us had that in common so we sort of have like this weird fucked up family dynamic in common so we all became sort of like our own family on the road so we we were competing for a world title we were all competing and going around the world all the time staying together so he became best friends like this nucleus of surfers and we all just became ultra close and then when things get got really serious with a surfing competition and there was a lot on the line with sponsors and money and big brands coming in the shit hit the fan and then we started like breaking up it got too serious so it was almost like a band who just couldn't stand each other anymore or things got too radical or you know girls got in the way or money got in the way and so there was like this kind of like breaking up element you know throughout our group Wow I would imagine when you're living like that those people must be so valuable for you though people that can understand your way of life because it's their way of life - because like - a regular person who commutes every day and goes to an office and comes home like your life is alien yeah it is I still get like I still get uncomfortable when people ask me what I do for a living you know like I'll be in like a normal random setting and some of the hell yeah what do you do for a living I'm like do not ask me that because nobody understands you know it's like what do you tell them I tell them the truth but it's I just tell always tell them like it's it's really hard to explain but I serve for a living I mean the fuck is that yeah do they go how does that work how do you paid yes all the time and I just got have no idea well you don't really compete any longer right now just right not at all ride big waves I do alright big waves that's my focus and I also ride all kinds of waves I surf every day and you know the waves don't get big that often right when the waves are biggest I'm on it yeah for a person that like is just meeting you for the first time and doesn't understand surfing and is trying to wrap their head around making a living yeah riding the waves of the ocean what the hell why no I went to accounting school and I and I don't have there's not like a there's nothing I mean there's there's not like another category I can really point to to to make the point go quicker to there's not like um you know it's like there's basketball players and football players and all of them are like scoring goals and getting these brand endorsements from that from competition elements so because I'm a free surfer who doesn't compete at all it's just it's hard to wrap your head around but baby harder yeah basically I you know I I should I uh you know I have a large surfing profile and so like I work with a lot of brands and that's just the kind of the way it works it just sponsors yeah yeah now this movie this documentary do they have footage of you guys from when you were really young oh yeah yeah they do is that weird watching that stuff yeah very weird cuz we're all in our 40s now we all got kids and yeah for most of us except for Kelly Kelly still going before 46 years old I I saw him on your show the other day is pretty classic but so so he's like a focal point in the film he's he's part of the momentum generation and and so he there's incredible footage of him when he's you know nine years old or ten years old and he's in Florida like a little rat like a little sunburned rat and it's me you know I mean I mean we all had that in common that's we we all grew up in in different places and then we all fell in love with surfing you know separately and then we all just became super tight so Wow it was great it's good it's great and then now we're all like best friends again because there's no there's no points on the line or world title on the line or like brands getting in the way or girls getting in the way we're all we're all you know yeah we're finally growing up that I mean that had to be strange though to be so tight and then everything it's sort of get bottlenecked by the pressure yeah anything serving how much pressure could there be but you know we're all trying to make a living right it's like no you know that was our dream to like surf as much as possible and see the world and that's the only way you could do it for us whenever there's competition there's got to be massive amounts of pressure whenever there's someone trying to achieve something or chomp someone trying to rise to the top of a profession and you're surrounded by a bunch but you also must have pushed each other too and it must have been beneficial to have people like you around as well I think it's it's part of it's just you know I think it's like part of our our like human DNA to you know to be naturally competitive I think especially men I think we feel like we have something to prove mm-hmm you know like where we stand like compared to the other guys whether it was like in the caveman days or like the hut you know the first hunters where was like there for sure they were there they were competitive to see who could bring the home meat for the for the tribe yeah and then it just you know kept going from there and now we we we compete with whatever we're into and you know for us was surfing became hyper-competitive and especially me like from the time I was like maybe 16 or 17 till the time I was like my mid-20s I was like super competitive our own rip people's heads off am i he like I would like visualize horrible horrible things happening to them while I was competing against them and it's so crazy how is that's gone 100% gone from my my being now I can't even imagine doing I'm like the most relaxed non-competitive person I have no competitiveness left in my body well I've only known you for what four years or something yeah that in those years I could not imagine you having evil thoughts no towards someone who seemed so chill I was a shit talker are you real yeah III I remember I was surfing as a sky Damien Hardman and and he was like an Australian World Champion he was like an older generation we were from the young like new-school generation we were coming up and there's these established guys who didn't want it but you know like be dethroned and there was a Skye Demian Hartman who's a badass competitive surfer but he was a very like tactician conservative you never fall he seemed like a nerd to me not I mean I was like a raw kid from Hawaii and this guy was like so presentable and professional and I just like resented it and I was gonna heat with him and he got priority which means that he had first right of wave and I just needed a tiny little score to win and he basically sat on me which means he uses him he used his priority to chase me around the lineup and sit on me and keep me from getting a wave and let the time run out and the whole time I was like you surf like a girl you surf like a little bitch like I was like totally shit talking him and did it work did he get you he got me because he wrote the right amount I basically cracked and started like getting emotional and he loved it he went I got this guy beat he started to talk me he loved that I any any he actually came out to me later and goes I love it that you're that passionate I love it that you got that psyched and that emotional where you just started like trying to like insult me he's like that's my goal when I'm in heats with people is to get them to that point you know it looks like that's that's good there's got to be a lot of parallels the fight world right huge yeah well it's also when when you can get someone emotional then the fighting in particular is so dangerous and so when you lose you're not just losing like someone's taking a piece of you you know because they're fucking you up they're not it's not just beating you on points I mean they are beating on points sometimes but they're punching you in the face to beat you on those points you know they're kicking you in the body they're fucking your legs up there's there's something about that that's so intensely emotional so when you're fighting if you're fighting at your best you have to be in like this sort of flow state this sort of Zen not think about anything but what's happening and reacting and just going on your train your instincts and if you can get a guy to be angry and emotional it will severely impair for most fighters severely impair your ability to perform most fighters they lose up to get tense they tighten up they look to wind up instead of just letting things flow we're talking about this guy's style bender who fought this weekend mm-hmm that guy fellows like when you watch him fight he just flows I mean he walks into the Octagon dancing yeah I mean like full-on dancing right like pop in and moving how's that mindset he's just he just gets loose and when he gets in there he's switching stances he's but there was a mad shit talking session between these two guys for the last six weeks right but he stayed calm through the whole thing and you could see when the two got into the Octagon Derek Brunson just couldn't wait to just grab ahold of them and style bender just avoided all that shit and one of Keio and I'm in the first round but the emotional aspect of the shit talking and the tension that it brings because it tightens guys up like we were talking about bowhunting like you see a big elk you have one shot at a big elk one shot yeah you draw back your bow you're like holy shit it's literally a life-or-death moment so there's all this tension yeah and if you could alleviate that tension that pressure you would you would perform better the mindset is everything it's everything everything yeah it's really good I'm sure it's everything with golf it's everything with pool it's everything with any - anytime there's something on the line well what's fascinating is like for you like you've watched thousands of fights like ringside right yeah so so like he you must be like Kay we're in the second round and this guy is you know these two guys are like up and up it's you know it's like a it's like a super tight fight you guys is a good fight there must be inflection points where you instantly know that one guy's gonna lose like something happens with their psyche or something happens out there you can see in their eyes you can see it in their body language all of a sudden they lose that that edge that mindset and they're basically have already lost even though it's like right in the middle of the round so when you see one guy that's like one of the crazy things about fighting is it's so unpredictable even when you think a guy's gonna lose sometimes they come back and win by knockout out of nowhere I'm just that Friday support who those yeah the guy with the awesome Instagram yeah dude he was losing that fight yes I'm not a fighter nerd no he was getting fucked up he was loose I'm like dude the guys losing the fight there's zero chance to win next you know he won yeah that was so exciting Volkov the guy he beat had just beaten Fabricio Werdum who's the former heavyweight champion meet him by knockout so Alexander's the real deal I mean he's he was what I thought was the dark horse in the heavyweight division but he stood in front of Derek for too long and Derek hit him with a fucking bomb he had hurt him earlier too because Derek Derek hit him and knocked his mouthpiece out and he didn't know his mouthpiece was gone yeah referee was trying to get out Nazis yeah he's like no that's not my mouthpiece that's his mouthpiece the referees like motherfucker you don't have a mouthpiece I'm holding your mouthpiece that's your mindset he's in the zone dude I don't think it was the zone I think he was in space well that's that mindset but fighting like the nature of fighting is built for competition it's perfectly suited to competition surfing's not right surfing I think surfing is like the Lee Suh tadam petition I don't see surfing as a sport whatsoever because when you're on the way you have to be Zen you have to go with the flow of the wave you're not really competing against another person per se even though you are you're really riding the wave and you're being judged yeah which is weird because it's artists like humans yeah but I think the I think the single most important aspect of surfing that makes it not good for competition is you're dealing with mother nature right it's completely unfair right right right like you might get an awesome wave the next guy might get a shitty one yeah some kid who on a scale of one to ten their ability level is like a three can beat the you know Kelly Slater in a heat easily because it is just like if that kid gets the best waves in the heat and Kelly accidentally falls he loses you know like that's just the way it is we're like if I was playing you know LeBron James a thousand games in a row I'm never gonna win right never gonna win it's impossible um but I mean surf competitions cool surfing it just as a lifestyle as like a way to like stay sane and how of peace in your life and and meet friends that's what serving is about serving it's fucking awesome for that do you think you appreciate it more now that you're not competing yeah I do because I don't see it is it's my my my this the surfing Timmy is tied to like only happiness and only like surfing with my son and his friends and and surfing with my daughter and going to the beach and and traveling to get epic waves it's not about like pressure and points and a world title and sponsors putting pressure on me and me putting pressure myself that basically like the the the the pressure part of surfing is gone which is amazing you know I still listen pressure on myself to surf at a high level and perform at a high level to myself and and you know be able to like you know have having a game still for sure I love that I love the I love the performance aspect of surfing but the the actual competition part is gone for me it's so cool though that you kept the love of it after the competition was gone because like one of the things that happens to some well it definitely happens to fighters they retire and they get fat they don't want to work out anymore the the working out was so torturous yeah and it felt so much like work that after it's over whatever love they had for martial arts sort of goes out the window and they start putting on weight they don't want to they don't want to train anymore but you even after the competition was over you kept the love yeah is surfing is this unique thing as I don't know how you can fall out of love with surfing surfing surfing I when I'm in the from the moment I stood on a surfboard and rode my first wave I knew that was out that was who I was in my DNA Wow like pure and simple this is this is why this is Who I am first wave my yoga teachers become obsessed with DNA with DNA my yoga teachers become obsessed with surfing yeah all over Instagram now is just surfing she just surfs every day and it's so weird out of nowhere and like 35 years old she found surfing surfing is weird thing but it takes takes it's it's uh there's not very many things that are that are really similar to surfing in that way where you can fall in love with it being five years older or 80 years old yeah I think being a yoga teacher - she's got incredible balance right like having balanced probably yeah really helped your ability to pick that up you know what's cool about surfing is it's is it's uh you know like if I if I let's see if I if I took a hundred people and said all you guys are gonna learn how to drive a racecar and you had like a six week course just pure racecar driving 100 the hundred of those people are gonna become really good at driving cars and going super fast and racing and know how that's really accelerated learning curve and get pretty damn good at snowboarding yoga like almost anything is surfing like I know people have been serving for three decades and they suck I'm serious what is it they've never gotten a tube-like in the - that's like that's like the holy grail of surfing like riding inside the waves like right in the center of it um surfing is freaking hard man it's like it has it's like um I don't know it's it's uh but it doesn't mean you have to be good to enjoy it surfing is awesome no matter what level you're at and that's the beauty of surfing but surfing is hard to do man it's really hard to get good at so that's why you get people surfing you know five years and they're pretty good and there's people who surf 50 years and they've never been good but what is what is it is a balance issue is it ability to adjust your ability to correct while things are happening like what is it I think a lot of is like body awareness and and and just adapting to something that's changing all the time like say it's like you know say for instance like basketball did you know the hoops there the basketballs in your hands it's not the elements never changed there's no variables really we're gonna sides some dude trying to block it or or golf you got the club you got the ball you got the hole but with with the surfing you got your board and you got you but that waves never the same there's literally never one wave is not the same to any others in the world and so every single time you're adapting to things that are changing in the real in real time like up to the like millisecond the waves changing shape as you're riding it's here so you're never like reacting to something that is going to stay put your like anticipating the wave changing shape and that's what you're gonna like I'm gonna do a bottom turn into a big turn or an aerial maneuver or whatever it is but you're not reacting to something that's happening now you're reacting to the future does that make sense yeah it does make sense now if I was a guy who'd been surfing for 30 years and I sucked ha ha and I was friends we would still love it still yeah surfing is awesome you could be the biggest kook in the world and have the most fun that's why I surfing is that was someone who sucks was called a kook no Luke is someone who has who has no awareness in the water oh that's really what a kook is like a kook like like if I'm out there surfing and I'm sitting out there and I'm waiting for a wave and you paddle out and I've been waiting for a wave over a long time or some some some girls 16 year old girls out there surfing she's been waiting for you know 15 20 minutes and you paddle out and you paddle right past or the next way that comes in you just turn around and go you're a kook okay so that's that's if you're unaware at a situation yeah that's just be yeah that's how people get in fights surfing right oh yeah which is common yeah well a lot of surfers are really into jiu-jitsu probably pretty dangerous yeah to pick a fight with a surfer oh yeah was that one guys named Joel from Hawaii hey he's from San Diego what's your tutor yes yeah he's Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt he is yeah and you would never know it yeah he looks like so unassuming yeah he looks like a guy who fixes computers he's and he's a Stoney baloney super skinny yeah hippy cruzi dude with like Stoney eyes but he'll fuck you up he will fuck you up but he's cool man he's awesome and he's incredible surfer incredible surfer I've seen some footage of him surf amazing style and stuff but yeah he's he's um he's very unassuming there's Joel his jujitsu is super legit - yeah I've talked to people that have trained with him oh yeah he's super legit he'll tie you up really and I would imagine that from that background like surfing and that body awareness and the ability to adjust and change that's one of the things about jiu-jitsu is like every role is different you have you're rolling with different people different sized people and you're ability to adjust and change his always change it means it's always reitman so he that's exactly right have to adapt that weirdness of the movement so jiu-jitsu in surfing or you know they totally other similarities because you're you're sort of anticipating the guys next move yeah which is very similar to surfing on the wave you know reacting to what that guy's gonna do in the future not to what happening right that that very second right a lot of times if I was a guy that had been surfing for 30 years and I sucked and I knew you I'd be like hey Shane Dorian what the fuck am I doing wrong how do I fix this yeah I don't know is there fixing surfing's not like golf were you where you need to get better all the time mmm you know what I'm saying like like it like if you could enjoy it even if you suck is that what you mean like if you're a golfer and you and you're I'm I'm not a golfer but if you're a golfer and your average game is like an 82 and I said Joe if you buy this putter for $1000 your average score will be an 80 you're gonna buy that that putter it's the frickin world to you to shave two strokes off your game that's the biggest thing in the world to improve no one gives a shit if there's slightly better at surfing it's all you care about is like the is like waking up to crack it on having your coffee cruising down to the beach see in the waves and reading the tides and the wind and the and like going surfing with your buddies and having fun and then you go get breakfast and you get some breakfast tacos and go to work that's the lifestyle it's like keeps people same that's why they do it they don't do it to get better or surf super good or go really fast and that stuff's fun but I mean I don't have any more fun than a guy who at serves half as good as me we have the same run but I bet he wishes he could surf as good as you yeah for sure so and I wish I surfed as good as the best surfer on earth but it doesn't make it more fun which is that's that's why I love surfing that's winning that's fasting so what doesn't make it more if you want to get better at it if it doesn't make it more fun what does it make it more it does something it doesn't make it more fun doesn't make it more satisfying if you're better at it like when you surf at a high level which is important to you now it gives you more options because the waves get big right we see more fun so it's really difficult to surf really big waves with with real ability right so when the waves get big and really heavy and technical you can't go out there unless you you have really good ability level like and unless you have a high ability level you really can't perform in really great great conditions right so like when you see the the crazy conditions where that you guys get towed out and you ride those 80-foot waves that kind of shit no one who's Goofy's doing that there's some goofy guys doing that because you're using machines tell you in two ways is that you yeah a shame such anxiety watching this how big is that wave I don't know probably 60 feet on the face star damn son oh I feel like right there when it's over this part is cool watch I get air on the way down oh my you'll see my board cos completely in the air right there do you are so high that is so high that wave is so giant it's like 40 feet above your head right now oh my god this gives me anxiety you know what's cool about surfing is in those moments like there's very few things in the world other than like I don't know I don't know how to relate that but um like that moment right there for me was like the pinnacle of like Who I am what I do best that moment that wave coming in at that at that minute in my life where I was in the right square foot of the ocean when that wave came in that was the best that was one of the best days in history at that surf spot Wow and I was there I was prepared I was healthy I the right board the right equipment the right energy level I wasn't sick didn't have any you know everything was just lined up and the waves are lined up and the swell was lined up and the wind was lined up and the tide was lined up and I was in a perfect spot when that wave came in do you watch that video all the time no but every time I do I remember all those things because it seemed so much so so much luck how to do with it it's just like alignment the stars aligning it almost seems like something I want to watch every day like right get get the day going you know your first kiss from a girl yeah that's what that is Wow that like mind blown this is this is like an important moment in my life I need to like have this moment in time frozen that's what that right there and so I think as an adult you very rarely have those moments left I mean I'd like really like mine expanding mine exploding moments really holy shit this is life 100% life right now and that's that's what I think we're all chasing you know I mean those people sitting in traffic outside right now driving the freeway they're not having those moments not right then that's a real problem yeah it's a real problem with life is that people aren't having enough for those moments and when you're 75 yards away from that elk a few weeks ago and you had an hour to really think about what you're doing and where you were in your life and you know how you got to 75 yards away from this animal and the whole year of practicing on the target and all the millions of arrows you shot and all the preparation and then this thing stands up and times ticking and that moment is there for the taking and it's so easy to fuck up and it it all happens the way that you you hope to visualize it though those moments don't happen very often them now they don't that that is what what a lot of people like yourself or myself or chasing you're always chasing these these above average moments these high-level moments these moments where just everything's elevated you know like when you're drawn back on a big elk there's not another thing in your mind there's nothing on your mind other than your shot execution and getting it done and everything's heightened and all this just pressure around you some guys shake like I've seen some guys drawn back on an animal in this shit their arms are shaking like they're shaking yeah you see it in everything so much anticipation they could barely keep it together I mean that's what target panic is right it's like there's all this yeah week out jitters different look yeah there's a lot of different levels yeah well I've seen guys do that where they had a perfect shot opportunity animals standing 20 yards away broadside exactly what you pray for and they getting the shakes and you have to let down let down Wow don't even take a bad shot they let down and I can't do it just too much anxiety that's probably better than shooting it's much better yeah for smart yeah it's better that's a that's an aware person yeah yeah but I mean I think human beings are meant to have a lot of those kind of experiences those experiences make life richer and more satisfying yeah you know I mean sounds like to people who love animals like oh you piece of shit you want to kill an animal that makes life better it's not that like you're you're I'm eating meat no matter what I feel better when I eat meat I believe it's healthier I've had these discussions with nutritionists and scientists and I just think it's better for you I really do and for me to get it that way is way better because I'm getting my meat along with this insane hobby that's super difficult to do I mean I could go out and just shoot a bunch of pigs with a rifle and I could get my meat that way and it would still be fun would still be thrilling it would still be ethical wouldn't be the same no it's not the same experience no settings use do you do you hunt a hundred percent just for meat you can get me to the store like the experience of that of those moments out there with your friends and the under the pressure and and and and just putting yourself in that position where you like you need to make it count that's right that's that's part of our human existence that's that's part of what makes life worth living is is is have it having to I don't even know but just we're like you know I don't know but yeah I know you mean you can get me to the store but you you can't get wild elk at the store and you can't get it that way yeah there's a bit just just such a giant difference between your relationship with the meat that you're eating when I take an elk steak out of the freezer and I defrost it and I season it your food looks amazing by the way like really really well the week after you were in an elk camp and yeah we were there with Chad Ward whiskey whiskey bent BBQ on Instagram who's a master chef I mean he's a fucking wizard he's a pitmaster he wins like those World Championships and chef he taught me how to cook it properly that's awesome and you know it's all about doing it slow and then yeah searing it afterward right and you just maintain all the people screw that up everybody yeah even one of the guides one of the guides was talk to me about you know he said wild games kind of tough and we were like well how you cooking it cuz I go I just throw it on the grill okay you can't do that you can't just lay it on high heat yeah yeah like they basically sear it and then serve it yeah this is not sashimi right well you can if you do it real thin slice it crazy thin yeah you can click it's not bad but it's way better if you do it low and slow I've brought it down to 225 now I like to cook it at 225 yeah I just said it at 225 and I'll cook an elk steak for fuckin than an hour yeah you know what rigor yeah because you if you set a trigger a 225 you use a setting called super smoke yeah and so it just fills that the inside of this things are so good for wild game off they really fantastic yeah it's all just the beautiful thing about them is the people don't know what we're talking about a Traeger is a pellet grill and these pellet grills like this tables made out of oak right when they cut this table they would take the sawdust from this table and they compress it and just using the natural sugars in the wood that create these pellets and then these pellet grills they have these worm drives that feed these pellets into a heating element and the heating element it just it just gets hot and then fire and then a fan blows on the fire to keep the fire going and it's all computer-controlled so it calculates the exact same temperature and it maintain it's so good it's just so pure it's just wood and fire no gas yeah no no chemicals like on charcoal briquettes or no bullshit if it tastes so good all the things fucking phenom every time I every time I have people over at my house and I cook well game on my trigger I have these people like what the hell I need to get one of these things like me that's a sold like a million of them right once you know how to cook with them and learn how to do it correctly they have those little ones especially wild game because while game is really easy to screw up and it's really hard to screw it up on a trigger right really because of the fact that it doesn't have much fat in it yeah it doesn't try it out doesn't cook out though you know the moisture and the Ryan fir right do you take yours afterwards and set it in a cooler to let it rest I don't do that that's next level is it see yeah I'm getting gems here I'm getting gold this is from Dudley he does is he'll sear it and then he'll cover it with aluminum foil and put it in a Trager or I put it in a Yeti rather put it in a cooler yeah seal that cooler up for like ten minutes and what's in the cooler besides the meat nothing there's no like a little like ice packard and like no you don't you know what he's let it's a but it's actually still cooking okay so I let it sit I let it sit but I don't I don't wrap it up and look if you really minam file and then let it sit inside a cooler the cooler actually allows it to continue cutting just a little bit okay so how many degrees do you take it out before it 115 you take it out at 115 then I sear the outside of it and then I seal it up with aluminum foil and then I put it in the Yeti and I'll let it sit in that Yeti for 10 minutes so it's continuing to slowly slowly cuz if you take something warm and you put it in the Yeti it'll keep it warm yeah if you take something cold it just insulate yeah incredibly fantastically elated and so it works with heat or with cold all right all right all right I'm gonna try it talk to Dudley yeah he's the wizard at this stuff you know I mean and he's constantly cooking wild game essentially that's all he did good cook it's a very good cook yeah have you ever been with she freaking he does a lot of hunting he better be done a lot of cooking too yeah he just drove all the way from Oklahoma to Kansas he shot a deer in Kansas drove from or not Kansas Oklahoma shot a deer into Oklahoma drove all through the night in Oklahoma and parked his truck and got into a blind in Iowa I mean he just lives it he's our core he's as hardcore as you get yeah but that's all he eats I mean yeah he's constantly eating deer and cooking deer and and he loves cooking for other people like large groups of friends and family and he's always cooking and entertaining III I love that about him like when when we're on Lanai he cooked for ya ten of us yeah that was awesome incredible meals and everything was well gained this is friggin awesome that lanai trip man yeah is that I look forward to that every year it's like a highlight of my year yeah you know what are we doing it this year hey you gotta feed us you gotta talk dates we got to figure out the dates cuz that last year was so amazing to have everybody down there and you know and everybody's such a good crew so far yeah cool you know green tree and jam and yeah it's it's just awesome and then the first first year we invented the cat lady drink yeah yeah no I think Dudley might be still drinking and I don't think anybody else cut it died off Red Bull and wine and was it tequila does little add a little bit ambitious I was uh fucking nasty I was a deadly concoction he was already hammered he was just raiding my minibar just take whatever Sydney Airport I think I mad scientist liquors isn't he he's not afraid that was such a fun podcast overall just enjoy it is something about lanai too you can hunt in Paradise yeah I mean and it's such a small island it's like you use there's not very many people there the whole island only has 3,000 humans and I'll shitload a deer it's crazy around every bush it seems like sometimes yeah the great thing is it's so easy to screw up hunting those access deer especially with a bow that it's so neat to go and like find your arrow and then you know five minutes later you got a whole another group of stock yeah it's awesome well it's also the most ethical form of hunting because you literally need to be hunted okay I have to be they don't have any predators it says and it's it's not something that some person who was a greedy person said oh I'm gonna put all these deer in this island and I'm gonna go hunt him now they were they were brought there from a gift for King Kamehameha yeah in the 1800s and it doesn't take a wildlife biologist to tell you that the numbers will get out of hand if you don't hunt them yeah like when you're there it's really obvious that's a perfect example of of how somewhere it needs to be managed yeah and I know those guys on Maui have that project going on where they're hunting deer and then they're giving the meat to poor people yeah which is the best meat in the world I mean it's such fun access right here is so delicious and that's a great program it's a fantastic program yeah that's uh that's Jake muse and Anika hiki newly project yeah that's the Nikki Nui project see you're from Hawaii you can spit those words up yeah my mouth is making me yeah it's funny it's a you should have Jake on the show he's he's a he's a really good dude and he's some great stories and he's really well-educated in those his business really well so he started to meet company yes so he does eradication in Hawaii because it needs to be done and needs to be managed so and they're on Maui yeah and so he you know he wanted to you know to be able to actually utilize that meet because he you know these big ranches and golf courses and stuff they actually pay him to come in there and do it and so he actually flipped it and figured out a way to start a meet company so it's like a win-win situation because the deer need to be managed and you know he's feeding people and then the Kiki Nui projects totally different like he doesn't have a meet company for that but he's able to harvest the animals in a really good way and then he's able to utilize that meat by giving it to families who need it simple is that I mean it's just phenomenal and it's great again it's meat that people would pay a shitload of money for it would be like if if you could buy commercially raised access deer it would be one of the most prized meats because such an unusual flavor it's extremely delicious and people that don't like wild game and they were like I'm not really into venison I would like to cook access to here for them I'd be like just let me cook this for you and tell me what you think cuz I've cooked it for like I cooked it for my mother-in-law and she was she like took one bite of and raised her eyebrows and she goes what is this I'm like it's access deer she's like what kind of deer is that I had show her picture bushes if this is unbelievable yeah so delicious it's cool to baffle somebody with wild game yeah if you can if you can cook it right especially access dear Jesus that's an incredible and how beautiful they are they just in general just walking around and then we get one they're like I don't know just incredible animals I think they're my favorite your favorite to hunt yeah well what I like about them is we generally go on this access to your hunt like a couple of months for elk season so you get all the jitters out of the way because they are they're like seven times faster than you think an animal that size can be yeah when they move you're like how did you how did it even do that like how does something move that fast it's that race straight matrix straight matrix yeah and axis arrows I'm probably gonna piss some people off by saying this but the axis deer in Hawaii are different axis deer in Hawaii are different Danny O'Brien when we were on lanai and he is hunting access deer he had it was very challenging very very challenging they were ducking arrows and matrices used he was having a hard time and he went back to he went back home back to Texas back to the drawing board and said okay I got to go hunting he went a hunted access deer first morning shot a huge buck and he called me and goes I shot a huge buck and he goes up but I gotta tell you they're fucking different in Texas dude the deer just don't react the same way I mean in in Hawaii Hawaiians there's there's no season there the Hawaiians are eating that meat 365 days a year they're there hunting them with high-powered rifles all year long Maui Molokai lanai and those deer are they just react like crazy yeah they're living in hell yeah everything in paradise it's also hell every day they're getting shot at there's there's a good reason they're paranoid yeah I mean then said in Texas they were just like head down feeding chilling yeah he was like a different breed but he was also there that during the rut to them right get a little bit more real for sure during the run I'm sure they're switched on in Texas but yeah in in in Hawaii they're hyper switched on if anybody ever wanted to understand human biology like male versus female biology they should see deer and elk in the rut yeah to see animals in the rut that normally would be super spooky afraid of everything jumping at every snapped twig and they just walking right up to people like they don't know what's going on they're in a horny fall yeah right here you get the ever see that video of the guy who taps the deer on the antlers with his arrow he's got an arrow on this deer in front of him he just tapped I think there's like wood yeah well I think that would ever happen it wasn't right in the mating season yeah once once they get those throbbing boners they don't know what the fuck's going on nice wandering around I saw an elk actually having sex this year you ever seen that in real life up close like not through your binoculars yeah so I saw in like 30 yards and it's elk and they Matt they get up and mount and then they go by one big thrust yeah I was like that's how they get down like that's crazy crazy huh it's literally limits our double yes and he was so proud of himself and he got down and he was just like shit yes got that let me moved on there was like 20 other 20 other cows right there that he had that he had the service that's ridiculous just wandering around yeah I saw it from about 60 yards out it sounds crazy right it's it's a fascinating experience just to be around them when they're behaving like that they're screaming and yelling at each other and and rutting and mating it's because it only happens once a year for those animals we're gonna see it right here right it's very climactic I would wonder how accurate it is it's gotta be accurate I got to line it up yeah I mean I could even lining that up I guess he's lying but does he really know what he's doing he only does it once every six months or once every 11 months must be frustrating on yeah you can see why they all fight each other for it they rut for about a month right yeah yeah but no how cool is it how one bowl if he's a badass and a good fighter he can have like the first bull that I actually arrowed with my bow he had a harem of 45 cows one bull and there was like three satellite Bulls but there was one bull and he had 45 cows with him that he was hurting that where his girlfriends and they're all basically in heat yeah so they're they're like relying on him to service all of them 45 cows and I from what I hear there's places where it's like there's like one bull for 80 cows that's crazy it's a lot of work it's a lot of work it's to my be exhausting you really want like three it's like it's like Dan Bilzerian you like a human bowl yeah boy very similar you know isn't that his fucking logo did you have him on your show yeah yeah yeah it's so good he's always invited me to parties and like listen man I'm married I can't go to your fuck that's these playlists he's pointless to go to a party of his if you're married I think his his logo is a bowl not a bull elk but a bowl he's a goat is it a goat - goat really yeah I think so so yeah does it go it's like who's mouflon right that's what it looks like move on - she yeah that's a goat I think hmm but uh so this is super random who's the best podcast you've ever had every time I think I have the best podcast we'll have another one that's better I talked to someone that I respect recently and they said that the Elon Musk one was the best podcast ever it's pretty damn good in history yeah that was rapper that best podcast in history though yeah strong best podcast ever been made well he's such a unique mind I mean he just so they just he just posted a video of one of the boring tunnels first completed tunnels and so the let's see that Jaime oh yeah it's an insanely long tunnel through LA and they've been doing this only for a few months yeah but apparently in December they're gonna start doing this like look how long this is this is inside LA I mean this is an actual completed real tunnel that's underneath LA right now okay can we talk about how there's no like like a like a prototype that we heard about is like all of a sudden it was just like how'd you get who owns the land underneath that's a real good question I I don't think he understood what I was asking when I asked him that I'm like how do you how do you do this like who do you ask to do this I call this I call my project manager to make a well and they want to dig under their house to make a well and they go through the roof of your tunnel are they allowed to I love that there's humans like him that are thinking on such a massive scale that are trying to fix the biggest problems that humans are facing yo guys like you were out there riding waves and I'm telling dick jokes this guy's digging holes under the earth yeah I mean he's also sending cars into space right he sent his own car he shot into space he's got SpaceX he's talking about colonize Mars he's got a Tesla company it makes the best electric cars on the planet Earth I mean he's got so many different things going on simultaneously I just don't understand his capacity for work he's trying he's trying to fix the energy you know the energy problem yeah with you know you know getting energy from from the Sun to power your house to power your car power the cities and you know I'm like it's crazy he makes solar panels now that are actually tiles for your roof or you're a seller if incredible like you replace the tiles on your roof with these solar top solders freaking cool dude I just got it on my house I got I got it on my house and and I have one of those test the power wall to batteries and things insane and it's got like this crazy smart algorithm that knows when like a hurricane is coming to Hawaii and it'll like power up my my my battery to 100% even if I'm not home even from not watching The Weather Channel it just does it automatically cuz it knows it might need to backup my house Wow somebody all my elk doesn't go bad in my freezer so are you on the grid are you off the grid I'm on the grid but you have the solar light yeah yeah your power comes from the the solar and you could sell some of it back to the grid no my knew that no they used to do that in Hawaii but I think they stopped in the power companies weren't down with solar really it's hard to establish solar it's hard to get permits and everything to have your house set up like they try to make it kind of difficult for try to make it very difficult yeah but I it's pretty cool though I've offset my my power needs with solar by like 80% Wow it's great so you could conceivably just exist purely on solar yeah now you're on the Big Island ya know why all this fucking crazy volcano shit is going how's that you freaking out about that at all not freaking I was freaking out yeah so so I live on the west side in Kona the volcano is on the east side so is the east side is that near just south of Hilo okay that's where the that's where the volcano was but they'll win like the trade winds blow east to west so so where I live it look like Shanghai for like three months whoa the air sucked like crazy it was like la smog times 10 that freaked me out I started up fog blog like volcanic haze my daughter is severely allergic to that really yeah we went to a store on the Big Island we were staying at the Four Seasons and we left and went down to a store to get something for a cellphone she came with me and she just starts sneezing and sniffling and her eyes were puffing up and Mikey okay like what's going on you sick she's like I don't know what's going on and the guy at the counter said it's oh it's probably the vog and I said what the fuck is the vaad volcanic smog yeah and it just didn't bother me at all but yeah with her she's allergic to cats and a couple of young like make her sniffle it was bad for about three months right live it oh yeah that's what it looked like that's insane that does look like that looks like Beijing you know and the crazy thing was it you know like if the if the if the wind goes the wrong way then like Maui Oahu and it's it's all Vaugier like all throughout Hawaii but it was basically like that that whole the the volcano essentially had a crazy eruption for about three and a half months yeah and then now it just stopped and the air quality is incredible where I live now really yeah just so blew off blue skies crystal clear like just insane sunsets sunrises a it's just beautiful so what did geologists best air quality in ten years really for sure yeah why is that I don't know because there there was like a constant eruption for like 25 years oh my god but it was just kind of small but it was continuously going but now it's like like nearly shut down completely so there's hardly any kind of anything going in the air so the volcano blew its load did kind of like that elk yeah bang it was it was lining us up for a while and they go Val so the vogs gone so now it's probably a good time to go there it's a very good time Wow come over and visit does it fuck with the that's why I texted you I said come over hunt we're going hunting mm-hmm oh my god dude did you hear about the freaking boat that had a big like a lava like a boulder lava Boulder and go through the roof of it yeah like a spectator boat yeah they were a tourist boat watching the volcano psycho dude they were so close yeah yep slow to that Jamie that you can bring up it's nuts yes these tour boat companies if they're there it's pretty opportunistic you know it's not it's not easy to make a living on the big island and so you get these people all want to go see the the eruption that all the lava going into the water oh if you can look for a photo of the boat near the eruption there's there's some images of like this these boats that were like they look like they're like 50 feet away from this mega eruption like crazy really scary stuff but you don't have messed with lava man yeah and especially when it's it's spitting things out at the Earth's pissed that's when it happened well back that up I want to watch it fly through the air and hit them and I wanna think what would I do look at it flying through the air the time to think about what you would do is before you get on the boat yeah once you're in that boat you're you're just locked in dude that's crazy the hole in the fucking boat roof you see the redness in the hole of the boat just the hot shit just tore right through the roof well in all of these tour boat guys are competing right there they're like jockeying for position to get the closest unobstructed view so everyone can take videos and post it on their Instagram Wow but you're 23 people injured okay just talk about if one of those like little like lava nuggets just having to fly to you just blow a hole right through you yeah what if I hit some in the head how about the guy next to yous headless and you're sitting there your fucking camera out trying to get a selfie for Instagram but the thing is that everybody trips out I'm like oh my god is this unprecedented this lava just can you believe this lava this volcano is happening I'm kidding me we live on an active volcano that's where we live i've born and raised on this island interrupting almost every day since I was born true right yeah yeah most of your life yes interrupting yep yeah you can go almost anytime of the Year any year and sea level I was pretty cool Kona because Terence Mckenna used to live in Kona this is out you don't know he turns weekend no he's a very famous psychedelic I guess you'd call him a psychedelic speaker a scholar he's he was a botanist who an ethno botanist who set up this place in Kona and he was uh he was off the grid completely off the grid like he has ayahuasca oh yeah camp he had his I don't know what what's going on with his old property but I think some of it burnt down there was a fire up there and I think he lost like oh no no the fire was up in Northern California had some of his books up in Northern California but he has a place up in the Big Island that there was like 30 different types of psychedelic plants growing on his you know and like ten acres I'm there that's a spot up there and he had have you been in that house high as a kite no I'm friends with his brother I would like to go there he's dead now unfortunately yeah yeah it looks like a pretty freakin cosmic joint right there well that's a weird picture right there II see that the regular picture yeah is it he had a dope place so he would get all his water from the rain whoo he had like these cisterns I guess they would call them what are these containers that catch rainwater and he had everything you know filtered that way like horny hippies probably some freaky shit go up there late-night activities of dinner but he was doing a lot of lectures on psychedelics and we school one of the most influential speakers ever on psychedelics because he was so interesting such an interesting guy to listen to a lot of people like that really gravitate to the Big Island yeah there's something about the Big Island where we live that is just it's alive it really is the island is freaking alive it really it is yeah and you feel that and there's like this there's like an energy there and there's there's people who are like I'm meant to live here I had moved across the earth to live here because is like just pulled me here I mean people I got all the time did your boy and I'm frickin shocked he's one of those guys I mean he's from Colorado he was originally from Colorado but I mean for him he was like a bit of a recluse and he would fly six for six months of the year he would fly and give these lectures in like you know Austin in San Francisco and all over the world really and then he would fly back and live on the big on the right books it's a cool place to live man yeah awesome I love living there and if you're a bow hunter saw a bad place either or not it's not a bad place either why isn't incredible for hunting wow this is incredible for people everybody's got a really good attitude there it's like it's more you know I just got back from Manhattan which I love I love going to new york city and but every time I go there I'm like I don't think I could do this I don't think I could live here it's just he's too stacked on top of things and there was this one thing that I had seen there that I'd never seen before they had like this rotating rotating machine that you parked cars on so say if you parked your car in here would light up like this and then your car would go like up here and then underneath there be like 30 cars underneath you yeah I was like what the fuck is that I seen that in Tokyo crazy dude yeah that's and you can rent one of those spots one of those one of those car spots for like huge bucks in Tokyo I'm sure like fifty grand a year well Topher like a like a parking spot at your building where you live have you been in Tokyo yeah Lots so condensed yeah yeah such a strange it's another step Tokyo is strange too because it's so polite yeah I love Tokyo yeah it's like everyone's it's almost like you're visiting an alien culture because I don't understand I don't know what the writing is yeah I see it but I I recognize it as Japanese but I have no idea what it says yeah and then the people there they're all like super polite and very orderly and then everything's electronic and it's almost like time yeah they're like with big like this is almost like a like a parallel civilization like on another planet and how the hell they get there that's where they ended up like if you look at the history of Japan yeah the opposite of that right right it means true old-school Japan is the opposite of that like all of a sudden there's like this full-on like forward technology hyper futuristic civilization there now yeah that's a fascinating thing about Asia Samsung in Korea they make the some of the best electronics in the world and you drive just outside the city and there's like rice fields everywhere people work you know working with those cool hats on and like everyone has no shoes and just on their own mud then you drive right to the city and it's just like this giant electronic city yeah wonder what it is kind of cool good food though in Japan and all over Asia by I love Japan dig it now Japan's pretty I'm just fascinated by the culture period I mean that's obviously the birthplace of a lot of martial arts judo came from there karate a lot of a lot of not the exact thing you want to be stealing I was afraid that we were gonna have nothing to talk about that was gonna be interesting or we get stuck on like archery for like two hours so I looked up a couple things what did you look up I look I just like was kicking out in the car was that impressive when I just pulled up in like a big old Cadillac bug a black Cadillac with a driver or what no it's normal yeah yeah I don't do that very often but we drive like a Tundra Syme shit I do I Drive a Toyota Tundra from big on a Toyota everybody in Hawaii has a Toyota he'll break this fricking state car it's the move right they don't break yeah they don't break they don't I've had three Lexuses Lexus SUVs those fucking things never break down they never have a single thing going on amazing nothing yeah they're incredible vehicles yeah they're just long and and you know in Hawaii you're going off-road so much that yeah I for surfing and hunting I'm always going off-roading camping taking my kids and stuff so you want something reliable and you can freakin buy oh you know I can buy a Toyota truck for like 35 grand and like six years later you sell it for 32 yeah the like resale value is nuts and it'll go for two hundred thousand miles yes they're great with zero problem yes I Drive a big Tundra that's the other thing that Japanese figured out how to do how'd they figure out how to make things so goddamn reliable yeah you know is that you there's my truck yeah that's me look at that lifted Toyota Hawaii that's my last truck although I got this exact same truck now though it's a good truck get you anywhere you want to go yeah well I'm actually sponsored by the local dealership where I live oh really yeah Big Island Toyota shuttle shoutout take on Toyota look at the fender flares and everything that thing is that thing will drive straight up a mountain oh I bet it will I know to hold about 10 deer in the back event have you ever seen that company called dev roll oh they take those things they make a bulletproof and they they spray the outside of them with what does that fucking coating that make some bulletproof I might need to get that for all the PETA people you don't get any because hunting and surfing you would think that they're both actually unnatural but yeah you'd get a little bit of it just because there's a lot of granola crunchy people that get upset there's a lot of like dolphin riders in the surf world that are like you know we're from that where it's it's it's peaceful from the earth why do you got to kill them Shane why you got to kill the why do you have to kill the animals man let them let them live I always get these guys let them live always always always they understand that if you don't kill them there's gonna be way more problems for them if you don't not only do they not understand it of but they're never going to understand it no that's it I used to consider like trying to explain that to people but there's there's there's really not what is there's a coating that they it's called it so polyuria is the is the type of material but uh there's no there's an actual name for it Adam green trees got a really really badass Toyota yeah well he had his built he's pulling the whole back area where the cabin is is all like stuff he's is not just looks though he doesn't have like red wheels right he's got like real shit like frigerators in there and a friggin shower to shower off all the mud and we actually drove to his property and it was so mud it out that it was impossible to get up the road this is pure mudslide and he use his winch to winch us up his up his Road it's like all the way up his road for the winch so cool so it's just I mean the thing is like bad it's got actually good for something you know been in America now for like a month and a half I was hunting she's been almost getting killed in a tree Stalin's hell yeah dude get the hell out of that tree yeah if you go to Adam green trees Instagram page the idea of it where he's in a tree stand he's waiting like he's trying to hunt deer and he's waiting for a deer to walk by and he hears guns go off and then he hears the leaves crack because bullets are whizzing by his head and hitting the leaves near him literally and his video of it and he's like what the fuck mate he's fucking wankers yeah he said there's two hundred two hundred gunshots in six hours oh yeah where is he Kansas Kentucky Kentucky yeah yeehaw yeah Kentucky not a lot of tundra isn't have you ever been to the Midwest during opening day if you drove a tundra in Kentucky it would need to be bulletproof why they would shoot at it yeah I'd be like freaking Chevrolet man they have a lot of Toyotas down there today yeah they give in not only that Toyota's Toyota trucks are actually made in America believe they are yeah now my Tundra was made in Texas yeah there you go yeah there's a lot of Toyotas are made in America you know the Acura NSX which is a Honda that's actually made in Ohio yeah they construct they designed and constructed in Kentucky there you go all I see is so they employ people they do hydrogen's people that used to be an issue in Detroit if you're in Detroit you were driving for a non-american car they'd shoot at it but now I mean so many car companies moved out of Detroit yeah start selling kinda just kind of give up on that line X is that the code yes line X thank you that shit you could take a lot Linux is crazy that black coating the plastic coating that they put on those trucks you can take line X and cover a watermelon with it and drop it off of a building to the ground yeah that's so they take that that that matte gray are matte black sort of covered that thing looks sick that is line X and so these line X covered trucks they make them and they also make them with Kevlar windows and door panels and bulletproof plates underneath them they make like a if you like just a total piece of shit and everybody wants to kill you you get one of those things just drive around a line X armored vehicle how much of a eight do you look like driving that thing around pretty badass just wears mirrored sunglasses I like the like I love the friggin line-x the whole thing that's like watch watch this bouncing look at this boom that's a watermelon bro yeah we think I might look at this boy well almost like a basketball yeah so any scratches that you would ordinarily get from like branches and shit like I bet you're mean the kind of travel that look at this I was thinking of doing that to my truck do you get scratched up oh yeah yeah and I just like that you can just like pressure-wash it your yeah you have to worry about decals coming off you don't worry about anything you just shoot the shit down and it's clean yeah one of our guides in yeah Lanaya his truck was line-x yeah it was Green completely yeah yeah yeah that's great that was Alec it's good stuff yeah like yeah that stuff just doesn't scratch too you can go over somebody can key your car and just fucks up their key it's it's pretty impressive stuff when you when you see trucks like mine here in LA that's funny or what there's a lot of masses this one look like a killer and a lifted truck but you can't park in any like structure you get true you can't go underneath like any underground parking okay you look cool that's important down here yeah yeah you look cool and like gridlock traffic and like 5 p.m. on the 405 yeah but you're above everybody is this a strange thing when you come from your place what I mean what is it Big Island have a hundred thousand people or something like that in the entire island and it's the biggest island in all of Hawaii yeah and you know you go from there to here where there's a hundred thousand people you know go to west hills right here it's probably a hundred thousand people for every like three blocks yeah it is weird coming here I spent a lot of my life in California actually even though it's born and raised on the Big Island like and every time I get off the plane I just it's so baffling the freakin LAX Airport and getting on the freakin shuttle for the rental car and getting a rent-a-car and getting on the 405 and everyone's going 90 yeah that's crazy there's always like an adjustment period of like a half or so when I'm driving I'm like in the slow lane like wow this is really happening and then costs fly by going 80 miles an hour everyone's going 80 and no one's getting stopped and I don't know it's just a shock well you're used to place where people don't even pass people on the highway yeah like on those roads if someone passes people on those little single lane roads people get mad right yeah hey man they like get mad if you're going too fast like slow down yeah well the same the mainland that's that's that's it Hawaii is Hawaii like yeah I think I think we were talking about this on the on the lost on the last time I was here but Hawaii is just a it's a different kind of place where yeah you don't you don't pass people just because they're going a little bit you know slower on them on the highway and if you do you better make sure they're not the wrong person right yeah you want to show respect to the people and yeah and I you know I think there's like a there's like this dynamic in Hawaii where you know I mean that everyone who moves there is that's fine I don't think anyone gets mad at that but you just don't want those people to move to Hawaii because they love Hawaii and then try to turn it into California right respect that culture respect the way people act behave and then respect the the vibe that everything is more relaxed yeah that's why it's so cool to visit yeah cuz you you literally feel relaxed when you get there because everything's relaxed it's different it's a different vibe people forget that though people move to Hawaii for that and then they move to Hawaii I want to turn into California does it happen you want to buy a big house and a beach and put a big giant wall around it and keep everyone out of the private beach and like their own little zone and this is this is my zone and my stuff and my giant house and you got to own the beach it's kind of hilarious yeah it is loading like a chunk of beach like you don't own that bitch like you decided to put a giant they'll try next to the ocean well they have security guards in Malibu yeah try to keep people off of public beaches yeah they say this is a private beach I know no it's connected to the ocean motherfucker like your yard is the ocean yeah like my friend has kids he has a beach house my friend has kids and the kids surf and the kids were surfing just you know a few hundred yards from their house yeah and they were in front of this guy's house the guy comes out the house fucking screaming at them said and get the fuck out of here you're not supposed to be here like no you can't tell people that just because you spent a lot of money on a house that's on the beach doesn't mean you own the beach you don't that's the beach it's the whole Earth's Beach like someone can come here from all around the world and walk on that beach that's that's your yard you fucked up you bought this 15 million dollar house that anybody could walk 30 feet from your house like that's just how it is dude sorry isn't that weird that people don't get that they finally got in this super ultra rich category that the like the rules don't apply anymore well they're just trying now that I'm district is my yeah they're trying to scare people off of it so they've hired a lot of security guards see if you can find the article how miserable are those people imagine being that person who's like yelling at kids because they're in front on the beach yeah that guy's living in his own personal hell I don't care how rich it is yeah it's just it's just stupid like if you live on the beach you have to kind of accept that your house is next to this public park yeah you're essentially living in a public park you have this dope view you get to look at the ocean but why that what's yeah but what's in front of your house is everybody's now it just is everybody's you don't you can't own it it's never not gonna be yeah and it moves because that's one of the weird things that happened apparently they did something in Santa Barbara they did something to the to the ocean they did something like they put up some sort of a barrier some sort of break in Santa Barbara and an affected Broad Beach mm-hmm in a crazy way like it pushed the water way closer because one of the good things about Broad Beach these I think they called billionaire Beach was that these people these crazy fucking houses they had this long stretch of sand before the water and then the water came way up like to almost to where the houses are now yeah so it's all gone but now the people that utilize the beach are literally writing for these people's houses so they're fucking freaking out go crazy we see is there any articles about yeah so these people have hired security guards to kick people off and then people are getting together in these lawsuits against these people that are in these houses and you can't keep us off these pages and I never want to be those people it's dark can we establish that and I just I just want to keep those people I just want to keep going surfing and boning and how the wealthier laying claim to the couch California's Coast complaints have been streaming about security guards hired by wealthy home home owners removing people from public beaches you can out those security guards they can't do anything like if they touched you like it would be assault like you can't tell me I can't walk on the beach you can't you can't do anything I was trying to read through this and the first case says that the security guard went and got a sheriff and the sheriff told him that they're gonna get a ticket if they didn't get off the beach sheriff's are all scared because though all those people want the influence of all these wealthy people for the wealthy people influence the politicians as sheriffs want to keep their jobs I mean the whole thing is just crazy but the the thing is now today this stuff is getting out and it's getting out on the internet and it's getting out these stories and articles that are on the Internet homeowners have imports have employed several tactics to keep their beachfront properties private recent example of a case in Malibu involved involved a property owner charging people forty dollars to walk on the beach and banning surfing unless the person was a resident or a friend of a resident what you can't you can't just decide that's crazy that's like literally going up to a state park and saying no one can go in here it's too close to my house yeah there's nothing right about that stuff and I don't get I don't I just I you got that kind of right there that mentality that gives me that gnarliest anxiety I just don't want to be anywhere near those people I just want to get far far away from them and like live in the mountains in Hawaii or I do look at this she had been on the beach for just a few minutes with a tall uniformed security guard approached he said Swart he told Schwartz she was trespassing on private property and threatened her with a fifteen hundred dollar fine and a court citation if she didn't leave she's an employee - yeah mission right and she said yeah she's a commissioned employee was asked to do some reconnaissance following stream of formal complaints at that point I pulled out the maps that I had and said you know this is a public area Swartz were called but the guard disregarded her insistence after telling her she needed to provide legal proof that she had a right to be there the guard left and returned 20 minutes later with two sheriff's deputies who slip swiftly advised Schwartz at the beach was not for public use then I got a bit unsettled she remembers as brave as I like to think I am I kind of started shaking a little bit started to get a little nervous did you read it that was um um if you go back up Jamie it'll say whose house that was I think it was David Geffen's that happened also near his house saying deliberately restricted public access you know this that yeah that same thing happy with Mark Zuckerberg I'm on quiet it's 2013 the Guardian reported how entertainment mogul David Geffen had deliberately restricted public access to the beach near his home and Carbon beach yeah that's another really except you can't do that yeah Mark Zuckerberg did that on Kauai really yeah he bought up this beautiful property on the north coast of Kauai is incredible beautiful place with incredible waves and not that many people live there and he bought this insane like thousands of acres right there one the most beautiful places on earth and then try to keep everybody out and like completely block all the access and all the Hawaiians all the local people got extremely angry with him if you just would have been I mean he he's gonna be a resident right he wouldn't think this little island on Kauai is people been live in there forever you can't just like storm in there buy all the property up and block everyone out you got to live in Kauai I don't know but is it like lanai sized or smaller a lot more than yeah a lot more yeah yeah probably be 40,000 or something like that maybe thirty thousand but you know the people on quire really territorial and protective of where they live and they live in a really beautiful place and a lot of people who aren't from there I have lots of money want to live there those people people inquire hyper sensitive to that already so you got like Mark Zuckerberg you know probably worth eighty billion dollars or something come in there and buy up all the land and try and block every one it's not a good move well he's probably a terrible move but he's probably super insulated to people right I mean everywhere that guy goes he brings security guards with him I he'd have to and he's probably like he probably has almost no interaction with regular people you would think so he's young man so young is he like 34 some shit how old is he Jamie what's he worth 80 billion Humana being in your 30s and worth eighty billion dollar but still work and how about that that's cool though I love that about these guys like um I wouldn't do it but like Elon Musk and yeah and and Zuckerberg it's it's cool those guys believe so much that they can actually make a difference that they're still that's the only reason that's keeping them what it's not the money he paid a hundred million dollars to purchase 700 acres of land Wow 3434 that's crazy straight-up ballin ballin out that's ballin there's a big difference in him in Elon Musk oh he's got a weird reputation of fucking over the people that he made made Facebook with I don't know I don't know if that's correct or not but that movie man I'd sue the fuck how those people made that movie if that's not true right in the movie that kind of set it up like he stole the idea well he had to settle he settled out of court paid a lot of millions to like the Winklevoss brothers I think to too cuz they said it was their idea yeah they made him look like a dick in that movie though yeah they sure did yeah it's kind of heavy that that movie actually got made you would think that they would have got paid off to not make it well it's weird to make a movie about a person it's it's even if they got accurate reports from other people it's so weird to make a movie about a person who's still alive right now put words in his mouth a lot of it's speculation too no matter what for sure yeah what he got off flight it says that the settlement was 20 million in cash and 45 million in face book stock price they're worth billions yeah yeah if he did dick them over but who knows if they're telling true yeah I don't know whose version is always there's always two sides every story but a movie about you like if somebody made a movie about you and you know had you on the beach saying some shit you never really said like hey I didn't say those words you can't have me say those words with an actor's inflection and his decisions to make whatever creative choices he makes with the way he talks and 99% of the people watching that movie aren't having this conversation right people they just automatically think that's Zuckerberg that's what happened yeah he's a dick he does that he did those that the perception it's like if you uh if like Jamie was like hey you know what I just got fired by Jill fuck that guy Jose Jojo tried to touch me this one day when I was shooting the techno for the target he tried to touch me everyone maybe believe Jamie especially if he was like a really pretty girl yeah well Jamie could be a pretty girl free shaves hair goes he did try to stop it being made Shin you would though I just stopped the movie a social network for being made I was from those leaked Sony emails that came out and that hacking thing uh more as he did but I think he has a right to it honestly yeah here's the thing pretty heavy that someone can make a movie about you without right your consent and put words in your mouth that's the thing may be one thing if you were convicted in a court of law right for that stuff but if this is just like yeah I swear this happened see here's the thing though it's one thing there's a documentary and in the documentary they're showing footage where Zuckerberg doing certain things they're saying certain things it's a total different situation if you decide to put words in that guy's mouth and you have fuckin Justin Timberlake plam in a movie who played him in the movie I think it was Justin Timberlake was it Justin he's in a Newark Oh Jesse Eisenberg so you have a famous actor the famous actor plays you in a movie and makes you out to be a cunt that sucks it's his choice he knocks and then the directors like make it a little more kunti can you do a little more kunti like a little more of a dick I'll be a little more removed here I'll try a little more remove this next take yeah it's like you can't do that like you should you should be able to sue the fuck out of those people because at the end of the day it's one thing to tell a story hey I work with Zuckerberg that guy was a dick he stole my ideas it's another thing to have someone play him in a movie yeah and make up a bunch of words that he didn't really say or you don't know he really said oh you don't have any proof that he really said that's fucking strange he made it up that's like I've always felt that way about historical movies like they make a movie about Abraham Lincoln like someone was saying how the fuck they do a movie Abraham Lincoln vampire our killer you know see that's Toonami it's really ridiculous Abraham killer this is one of the dumbest movies ever take to make it he's killing vampires I think with an axe think he killed him with an axe it's really stupid but I was saying yeah it's dumb but is it any dumber than any other Abraham Lincoln movie you have a bunch of movies about Abraham Lincoln where he's just hanging out with his kids and talk you don't know what the fuck he said you don't know what kind of interaction he actually had with his wife you weren't there how do you yeah how do you pitch that movie to the studio you know what guys I got this concept I got this concept that's when you know you got way too much money is when you're making movies about Abraham Lincoln being a vampire killer yeah pull up the trailer for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer if I remember correctly though this came at a time just a guy that wrote the book that this movie was made from wrote Fred and pride for a present Pride and Prejudice and Zombies where he rewrote pride and prep excuse me pride and bowels but added a zombie-like plot throughout it so he just say he mashed up the story it was successful so he did it again with like an Amber Abraham Lincoln biography but added vampires to it is their demand and it went is there enough owner that wants to watch it movies seriously my fame is precious I want to watch something really good not really bad yeah I don't know man there's nobody walking in that movie like yes this is gonna be sick you might be operating on a higher frequency than most there's a lot of people out there they just want to be entertained by stupidity yeah give me give me full screen on this stupid piece of shit i watch this thing high as a kite too you watch this movie oh yeah yeah where you got were you were you in that Shack on the Big Island when you watch this reason Burton yeah because look at this this trailer actually looks pretty fucking cool see watching them it's fucking up all these vampires do this Wow Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter he chopped down that tree with one swing dude he's so badass very high percentage of people watching that movie were high yeah we'll see I go think I see things that are not good for my job ci whoa yeah I will go I will watch movies and television shows I will watch things hoping hoping it sucks bad enough that becomes part of my ass you didn't have to hope very hard to do that didn't make it in there I watched this after the whole thing I was like loosing like fuck looks like jokes like a like a like a like a joke factory right it does it looks like it should be a joke factor it's not well maybe someone better leave him out like two months before the the Lincoln movie with Daniel day-lewis rushed it out that guy's amazing by the way but that was another movie that bothered me I saw the Danny day-lewis Lincoln movie was kind of dull too slow yeah but it bothered me that we don't really know what the fuck this guy said it's one thing like there will be blood which was fucking amazing yeah but those are fake people man he looked good as Lincoln crazy crazy how good they made him out remember gangs in New York when he was Bob the butcher but was it bill bill the butcher yeah he's phenomenal he's great in everything yeah hi so good man he's just one of those guys it just becomes completely there's one there's a few people that a lot of people that are actors that are just weirdos they're just these really strange people that desperately want attention they figured out a way to use their mental illness to navigate the waters of Hollywood in some strange way were there virtue signaling and and and behaving exactly the way Hollywood wants them to behave to get themselves into these positions of Fame and then they become movie stars and then say a bunch of nonsense and these you hear them interviewed you like you're not even a person like you this is not a person it's not a person talking there's no sincerity there's no reality to way you just painfully aware of every word you're saying and how people are gonna perceive it and you just know there's no soap your guards never down there just weirdos yeah and then there's people like Daniel day-lewis who's just this Savage yeah just figures out how to become these people he stays that's a real deal yeah yeah I mean he fucking stays in character that was great last the Mohicans he's so good it's fucking great and everything you retired you know he does now huh makes shoes are you serious yeah he's a cobbler he makes shoes by hand that's what he does Wow he's a legend that dude are you kidding me man he's so good Hilde butcher yeah yeah I would fly to wherever the fuck he is to get a shoe made by him should do it I should what if it makes shoes for people probably to make shoes for his friends what it's like does he have a company like I know he makes shoes but what like what does he do with these goddamn shoes what's his lifestyle like you know I mean after all that like you know I was saying like all those crazy moments like a human potential like you know his human potential of his like acting craft like during like last Mohicans and and gangs and New York and stuff yeah like going from that like extreme those extreme highs and yeah you know performance levels to making shoes that's it's crazy usually people go up not not you know up in intensity not down in intensity right right yeah the intensity aspect of it is really interesting but I think for him like he's he's such an artist then I don't think he cares whether or not people are looking at his art I think he cares about the process of creating yeah so I think tie the same to him yeah I think process well maybe even it's more pure because the fact that it doesn't have any adulation there's no there's no spotlight on it there's no publicity team there's no stupid interviews he has to do yeah you know yeah that stuff must be maddening you know for him to sit down with someone from fucking Entertainment Television so mad you got another dope movie coming out tell us about it sounds like you need a Daniel day-lewis on the on the podcast here maybe even amazing but maybe he would how cool would that be to talk about shoes he probably psyching on that maybe yeah I would talk to that guy for three hours just about shoes he's awesome if he was into just tell me about your stitching process where do you choose your leather I don't think from what I just read I don't think that he does it it says that he took time off from making movies to study under this very well-known Shoom Aker for 10 months specifically and only did Dow then he came back though he made a movie like last year called the phantom thread which where he was a desire fashion designer and then he learned to in order to do that he'd reverse engineered a Balenciaga dress and to just to learn how to become a fashion what is a Balenciaga dressed you know that we pulled up at Balenciaga as a company it's like they make that shirt we made with noble shirt things so it's a high-end very high-end stuff it's hard yeah and then put it back together so he could understand the process of doing it mmm that was like his for that's how he became it got into character for the for that movie so I don't know if he's retired all the way doesn't seem like he makes believe he retired I mean he made that movie last year though this is my 17 yeah for a while he like six there's only one way to find out yeah he took some time off is it Daniel if you're out there anytime dude just just holler at me no I know you don't have a better dog I know you don't have a Twitter but I got people you got people he was amazing in the movie the boxer too in my opinion oh good he played the most believable professional boxer in a film because a lot of films like even like the movie with Marky Mark where he played Micky Ward it was like Mark Wahlberg knows how to punch he knows how to throw punches but there's a difference between throwing punches in a movie and a guy throwing punches in a fight and if you look at the way Daniel day-lewis is performing in that boxing movie he looks like a guy who's throwing punches in a fight it's way more realistic any boxing movie I've ever seen and he boxed for a full year before he did that movie you mean just lived in a boxing gym he trained all the time sparred hit the pads he got real coaching from he played a guy who was an IRA guy who got out of jail and then got back into boxing and then there's a bunch of terrorist shit involved in the film's very good movie but see if you can find footage of him from that movie so when when you see boxing movies guys are throwing punches like they know they're not gonna get hit back yeah this is a certain thing about boxing like if you watch a guy actually fighting there's a tension oh yeah there's a tension to worry about hole getting hit back and you see a movie about a box because a he-man this house it's just too much the mitts are down there just like yeah turns out it's not just that it's like the way they're moving there's no anticipation there's no it's all offense right yeah all even when they're getting hit it's bullshit it's like there's and you can tell it makes it drives me crazy yeah trees like watch him in here I mean this guy he studied and trained I forget who was training him but it was like legit professional boxers see crazy that commitment that these guys need to take their acting to the next level because it's like there's not that many people who even noticed that he fights more like a real fighter yeah I'm saying no it's not but even like see like of the ways throwing these punches like this is the way a real boxer throws punches like they're not wide yeah everything's real tight pretty fucking impressive but I mean I would expect nothing else from this guy yeah he's as legit as against a fucking madman yeah legit bet he'd be a real weirdo to talk to yeah no no it's only one way to find out yeah you want me to get him on when are we going hunting I know I think June you want to do May or June let's try to plan something yeah sure lanai does the next one you should come with us to Dudley's place in Oklahoma I love that in March we're gonna go pig hunting that'd be fun it's infested March I be the size of that gigantic pig that he shot down there yeah I did monster 450 pound pig Wow it's like a tank it's like as big as this table yeah it's huge big pork chops it's the three of us stack together it's great form and paper form it's so fun marching yeah we're gonna do it in March I said fun yeah he has a giant place that he leases in Oklahoma and it's all it's all just just beautiful wild open country Oklahoma's very underrated you ever been to Oklahoma I never been to the Midwest no I know Ohio tomorrow oh you're going white on first time ever is that the Midwest yes I don't know where the Midwest is [Laughter] yeah no Ohio yeah I'm I'm a Midwest virgin so I'm going back to Ohio that's actually where my mom is from so oh that's cool what part of Hawaii what part of Ohio rather I think this southern part I'm going I'm gonna wait oh honey right I got West what part of them is right in the middle so this imports myth Kentucky area maybe I'm hoping it's my favorite spot I'm hoping it's not too cold shit I'm a big fan of Cleveland too but goddamn Columbus is a shit Columbus is awesome I'm excited to see it now I'm just the for whatever foreign would I'm guessing his farm lands flat is that right not flat like that's the misinterpretation like it's flatter than most areas for sure but like especially down from Columbus down to the south area where the rivers go there's a specific there's Indian mounds and there's all sorts of like glacier cut out spaces you know Hocking Hills is a very cool spot there's also this old man's cave is a really cool spot too it's like a traditional I think Columbus is one of the most underrated cities in the country yeah yeah people don't think about it it's like the people are fuckin crazy cool it's a really good place to do stand-up for stand-up comedy so one of the best places in the world it's just fucking phenomenal they're smart but they're also like Midwest type people but they are but they do they're not stuck up right you know it's like it's like a almost like Chicago it's like a lot like Chicago I think well I'm not gonna see it I'm just gonna go straight to my trees down yeah trees down have you ever done it before I've done a little bit of trees down honey but it's a mindfuck I'm really bad at I'm I'm I'm impatient yeah I like to be I like to be stalking I like to be on the move I like to be finding deer I like to be you know I like that being I like to hunt you know I want to be the hunter and so for me like sitting in a tree for 4 days straight it'll be interesting to see if I have what it takes it's weird too because you're oddly aware that if you fell you're fucked like you have to wear a harness and all that jazz like I did it with Dudley the first time I ever treat I've hunted deer before on the ground and a ground blind but the first time I ever did it in a tree Stan was at Dudley's place that's what you got to go Dudley Dudley has the craziest spot I'm gonna hit up deadly then Dudley's got like 600 acres it's all bowhunting he lives all dear he lives in he literally lives in whitetail peridot Wow he lives in Iowa right in like one of the best places in the world for gonna send Eliot text sound attacks have you down yeah you got it I'm checking I for an Iowa tag though it's gonna be cold this week cool this fuck son you're hot you're Hawaiian yeah yeah does your armor have some good whitetail clothes they do yeah they sent they sent me some really really warm clothes for hunting you want to get one of those thermal fucking things have you seen the heated sleeping bags oh yeah those are dope dude you could wear one of those up there I could yeah yeah they have those things what are they calls in inferno suits or something like that what are those things called see the thing is it I I like I like hunting and cold weather I love it super cold weather even right if I can Mike's talking around I can walk around move you can move right it's not that cold right but if you the whole point of sitting in a tree stand you have to try and sit completely 100% still and loop move as little as possible and you're freezing your dick off you don't have to it doesn't even have to be that cold for you to be freeze right if you're doing certain trying not to move yeah you know it can be in the 50s and you freezing your balls off right because you're not moving so your body's not generating heat but I've hunted when it's like you know eight degrees or 10 degrees in eastern Colorado and I was okay because I could move yeah you're taking layers off yeah if you're going up hills great like that is one of the things it's really interesting to me about hunting and cold weather is the whole layering system yeah is that you have to really be aware of when you're sweating so the whole key is to get yourself to the point where you're never sweating yeah so as you're moot because if you're sweating and then you have to cool off and then you have a sweater kill yourself up yeah your clothes are wet from sweat you're fucked yeah you know that's one of the beautiful things about wool is that will allows you to retain your body heat even if it's wet you know it doesn't doesn't really fuck with you the same way that a lot of synthetics and particularly cotton Cotton's the work cons are worse you know synthetics are good because they they'll dry quickly yeah yeah yeah have you seen that rewarming drill that John Barlow from Sitka did where he jumps in a river with wet clothes and shows how to heat your body back up no but I just did a hunt with I just did a hunt with John Hart from Sitka start Janka yeah yeah he's a great guy he's a great guy he was a lot of fun hunting with and we talked about survival stuff a bit like you know stuff like that like what do you do if you fall in a river and it's cold that guy but to me is like one of the I mean because he owns the company he's one of the best representations of what you would want from a guy who owns a big company he was a CEO of a big company that's involved in hunting yeah super smart really articulate conservation minded very ethical just salt super solid I was with him in Utah yeah great guy yeah awesome company too yeah your make good stuff yeah there's some there's there's you know I mean there's a lot of good stuff out there but I just uh yeah I'm I'm hoping I stay warm on this on his haunt you guys in BC where were you guys we're in Hawaii oh that's right that's right I was thinking you were on that moose hunt that they just came back from hunting in Hawaii so you were in that crazy ranch that's somewhere on the Big Island that people never hunt right um some big area yeah we were we were hunting on the Big Island we were hunting pigs I was I was hunting in an area that was like um I explained it we yeah we were hunting these big boars on the Big Island and uh it was a lot of fun it was great but he's he's a really good dude yeah did they have like numbers that they have to keep the pigs down to do they have like a point where the pigs reach because for people don't know they just won several litters a year and if they're not because there's no predators on Hawaii so if the pigs aren't kept in check by people they'll get completely out of hand yeah they have wildlife biologists who manage the numbers and try to decide like know what to do they just try and kill as many as again so they just have people hunt constable yeah and is it not a problem because so many people hunt there I mean it just sort of depends who you ask it's it's it's crazy because I quit the pigs the pigs can thrive in really thick areas so that there's very difficult to do like a to figure out how many pigs there are like if you try and count the number of deer on Maui people count them my friend Jake does it he'll fly and they'll grid and look at a pretty darn accurate reading of how many deer on the island but trying to figure out how many pigs on the Big Island it's impossible they live in the jungle right because they're all in underbrush yeah yeah but the deer they come out in the open you know and you chase them with a helicopter and you can see them they're all running with the pigs don't do that just go right in the thick so basically there's infinite numbers of pigs on the Big Island so do that we also have sheep we have we have mouflon sheep we have like a like a hybrid sheep we have um we got goats and and those you can you can get numbers of and you can knock them down really quick if you're trying to eradicate them pigs it's really difficult how do the mouflon sheep taste move on sheep are amazing yeah that's sort of her they're great is really fantastic they're great to hunt did you see that controversy that happened pretty recently where a woman shot a she shot a wild sheep I did hear a goat yeah Europe in Europe and and people were upset at her and all these ricky gervais of course he has to jump in that's his favorite thing mm-hmm Glenn Greenwald all these people jumped in what what they don't understand is easy wild goats are invasive species they have no natural predators and they they hunt them to preserve the wildlife that's indicative that's that's native to the area yeah whether it's the plant life animal life I mean these these goats if their populations are left unchecked like they hunt them for a very specific reason like really have you talked to some wildlife biologist they should be eradicated yeah because there a lot of them were left on islands people don't realize this by Whalers they left them on these islands because this was an island enough of I believe is off of Ireland or Scotland see if you can find that story Scotland a lot of them are left there by by travellers so that they would have food there when they came back so they would drop these things off on these certain islands and in fact there was a real area a real problem where they dropped them up so this was the woman and people got all over this lady for shooting this wild goat which is really kind of crazy because they eat them they're delicious the eath of his food they're invasive I mean there's so many things going in in pointing towards the direction that this was actually a smart conservation thing to do but I guess maybe it was because of the way she talked about it you know because she said it was a really fun hunt or something like that like I get it it's a it's like a beautiful creature yeah and it would have still been alive if she wasn't there so that perspective of people of just like you know why do you gotta kill it yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a wild animal living on an island why can't you just let them live it's a natural perspective it's as simple as a normal human nature to think that but you know all the people who think that if you dig a little deeper there's a lot more information there with those you can't let those goats get out of hand they're as Hardy as hell they don't die but that's a problem I passed great Ricky Gervais or Glenn Greenwald someone like that that has a giant platform that loves animals and I appreciate that and instantly post something like this very inflammatory without looking into it deeper yeah they use their platform and they think to expose something they think it's horrific but they don't understand what's going on behind the scenes of this there's a thing called Judas goats and what they do is they'll take a goat and they'll neuter that goat and put a GPS tag on it and send it out because goats always flock together yeah and this goat will go near the other goats and then they fly over with helicopters and gun these goats down and this is just to keep goat populations in check so they kill every go but the Judas goat and then the Judas goat will find other goats and then they fly over again and gone all the goats down and this is done by wildlife biologists is that they do this just because those goats eat everything I have a friend who lives in Topanga and they bought goats to clean their property they thought oh this would be a good idea we'll bring these goats in and they'll eat all the weeds and they'll click no they eat everything they keep going and so they'll decimate local wildlife like whatever their their habitat is they'll devastate all these local plants I mean things that are supposed to be there that have been there forever when these invasive species get there they have a really hard time maintaining and then it you know it gets to a point where they have to do something about it well this this woman paid to do that so that money goes towards conservation she gets to eat the meat you know she has this enjoyable experience hunting these things in the mountains but people don't want to look at that they just want to look at it it shouldn't die it's really particularly crazy when it's a guy like ricky gervais who eats meat yeah it's like the whole thing is just it's so strange it's just so strange that people refuse to look deeper into these things and they immediately have these knee-jerk reactions where they want to complain about it and do so publicly in a way that gets all these people to attack this woman well the photo of that dead animal that's what that's what initiates that that response like emotional response animal gets right and then they'll go to the fridge and grab some like steak and cook it and think nothing of it nothing at all of that meat they don't they don't see the parallel there they just think that it's completely different and weird that someone wants to go hunt them yeah it's fucked up in this weird accepted hypocritical way I mean it's it's oddly accepted but we all have freezers full of the best meat there is and eat it every night and it's amazing I'm never going to stop we do yeah we hunt we do yeah that we actually have that connection would that meat we killed it we skinned it we got the meat we debone it we packed it out we packaged it and put in our freezers ourselves but this is the first actually and awesome if it's the first I've seen someone get attacked it's something that's a meat animal because I've seen people maybe they don't know what's a meat animal but I've seen people get attacked for obviously for anything like its its appliance and yeah the predator one is the biggest one like if you kill something that's a predator people for whatever weird reason freak out more than anything well and if there's and if there's like a like a like a like a general idea that they're endangered right you know I mean like everybody thinks that lions are endangered where elephants are ending or even bears or pairing bears you know so yeah there's a lot of misconceptions out there for sure but I don't really eat lions or elephants rating like that I deer and there's millions of deer millions yeah literally yeah yeah I mean we're we hunt in lanai has 3,000 people more they estimate somewhere over 20,000 deer and they don't even know I mean it's just bananas I'm on a text thread with with Benny O'Brien and Rennie and and I'll and all you guys and and there was a stat that they were saying yesterday I don't know if you're on that yeah text and they were saying it like in one of the Midwest states I don't know which one it was do you remember and in in one of the Midwest states like 850,000 deer died during gun season and half of them like 400,000 deer died in the first two days because because we were talking about Adam being in the tree that's crazy and that in one state alone 850,000 deer died during gun season so you think of how many deer that is imagine if no one hunted for like three years what was that stat how many deer there would be the number of car accidents nationwide with deer I think it's a million and a half I mean but the people who get angry at the photos don't think of what it would be like if you just stopped hunting ya know the Majan how many goats are be imagine yeah nature would sort itself out it wouldn't well it would eventually be enough to bring in wolves if you're comfortable with wolves eating your kids I mean that's what all that big bad wolf shit from when we were little kids like little pig little pig let me in that's because wolves were everywhere and they were bad it was dangerous like you would go through a fair game he was kids yeah that's that's that really did happen yeah we just we've got so far away from that we forgot of it as a possibility yeah so now we think of them as dogs that are living their natural that dogs just living his best life out in the woods how love it when they howl there they're trying to figure out how to eat you they want to get through your house they're trying to figure out how to eat your kids and if you reintroduce him in the Yellowstone they're never gonna leave Yellowstone they're gonna stay there they're gonna stay right in this little pocket of where they like to live they're never gonna reproduce and the lengths there you know that's what those people think but really they're gonna just start roaming and yeah and recreating thousands and thousands and thousands of wolves that are all gonna go into like neighborhoods eventually yeah well that's what's happening and that's what's happening in Montana that's what's happening I know yeah I mean these are all reintroduced wolves that are I mean and they also go on these surplus kills or they'll kill like 15 elk and just leave them there they just go nutty yeah that's what they do my friend lives in Montana and he was telling me that the wolf population is so out of hand that the elk population has been decimated it was it's down by like 80 percent or something some crazy stat crazy yeah they weren't there in 1994 I mean that's when they reintroduced him right in the 90s yeah I mean there's I mean now that the he I mean now that human population is is so established in a lot of these areas and you can't just reintroduce wolves with no plan to keep keep a lid on it well there is a plan but the problem with the plan is the established numbers that they needed to achieve and before they started managing the population there was immediate lawsuits by animal rights activists who don't want them to ever hunt wolf right so in Montana they've opened up seasons they've opened up seasons in Idaho they've opened up seasons for wolves and they would like to do the same for grizzly bears in a lot of these areas and there's a lot of pushback on that too but it's the same sort of thing the established numbers that they needed to achieve in order to make it a sustainable population they've been reached and then the wildlife biologists the ones who are objective about are saying hey we need to keep these populations in check in order to keep the deer populations healthy and the moose populations healthy because these bears and these wolves they're just destroying these calves and they just run around then and the populations these animals go way down now there's also an argument and a really good one that you need predators and this good argument is you don't ever want Lanai to be recreated in Montana right yes just these deer and just these elk yeah you want a certain Natural Balance and so there's an argument that there should be a certain amount of wolves and I agree with that argument I agree too but the balance can be really difficult to maintain yeah that's that's my point is like if there's too many elk and you want to control that number say there's a hundred thousand but there should only be 50,000 oh that's that's the perfect number right it's actually pretty easy to go from a hundred thousand at fifty thousand to draw that elk herd back pretty easy through through management and through hunting same with deer you can pull that number back pretty quick wolves are freaking hard to kill dude yeah you had to kill a wolf and you had a gun it's freaking hard real if you had to kill a deer and you had a gun not that hard right you can find deer finding a wolf is freaking hard dude well once those what my my point is is once those wolf numbers get out of hand trying to manage that population the wolf population is very very difficult well places that are used to dealing with them they know what the fuck to do like Alaska yeah and everything they trap them they fly around in planes and shoot them out of the out of the air with helicopters I mean they eradicate them and that Sarah Palin I don't think she's doing that anymore but there's a lot of people up there that do do that and you can buy wolf skin rugs that they sell those skins and turn them into rugs and do all sorts of different things with the pelts gotta do something yeah they do something with its but they do that because they have a vested interest in keeping the population of their game animals alive yeah for a couple reasons and there's criticism about that too that they may be killed too many wolves yeah because they don't they want you to be able to go there and a lot of their tourism dollars comes from people that fly in to hunt moose or flying to hunt deer and they want to make sure they keep certain populations of them there so it's it's all there's a real problem when you get emotions and you have those emotions tied in to this idea of wildlife biology and what an animal is and keeping healthy numbers of these animals in a certain area that's that's a real becomes a real issue you know and that's why when this goat thing happens and everybody freaks out over it's like you should probably educate yourself as to what you're talking about before you start complaining because you're just throwing gasoline on this fire then you don't necessarily understand all the circumstances involved those goats are gnarly too because you know because they live where I live and they on they love shorelines and they love like ridges and berms and stuff like that and they're they're they're they create so much erosion because they love those like edges on cliffs and stuff and so they they ruin all the burns originally they ruin all the cliffs and then there's all this runoff there's all this erosion and they I mean they completely decimate all the grass all the weeds all the way down they don't they don't just trim things they're not they're not selective eaters they'll just chow down all the way to the to the roots and then eat the roots also there's nothing holding that dirt in place right so when it rains just everything spills downhill because of the goats they really I see I see it and with deer you can see some some impact that they have for sure I let those numbers get out of hand they have the same effect but goats goats are radical they the populations explode and and if if someone's not managing them that you can see the impact that they have on the land and that'll have an impact on all the native species oh yeah all the ground nesting birds yeah all the animals that use that those the grass and those yeah bushes or less different things for cover and for life yeah it's and what they things that they feed off of all the stuff it gets eaten by the goats you know yeah if there's a large population of goat somewhere you'll know it yeah did they like almost nothing left I appreciate these people like Glenn Greenwald I appreciate the sentiment behind it I really who I just wish they would look into it a little bit deeper and you know this woman's not a bad person she's just that's how she gets her meat you know yep like I said especially a guy like Ricky who have met after I've actually talked about hunting with him on a radio show before I did on the Opie and Anthony show I had to explain to him that I'm a hunter then I I hunt animals and I eat him because he was talking about hunters and and he was actually very friendly with me and we were cool about and we had a good he's like as long as you eat it like that's what you're doing it for I'm like that's exactly what I do it for but he eats me too which is so it's a whole it's weird it's the the the fact that people think like that they are morally disconnected from the act of killing an animal but just because they use a credit card to buy meat is so hilarious but you hired a supermarket hitman that's what he did so market hit man took a prisoner a prisoner you know cow and fucking put a bolt through its head and you feels you feel completely detached from it yeah no karma well and when someone eats a hamburger they think nothing of eating a quarter half a mil I'm really full he can't just take that away from me yeah you'd never do that we were elk do you know no I eat it all yeah at all yeah I make sure that if I cook it I cook enough so that me and my family eat it and whatever's left over I know I'll eat in the morning or eat the next day for that's a huge difference is you have so much respect for that meat and for that animal because all the effort it took and you watch that thing live in the wild you have a completely different perspective you know of that meat than you do if you just you know order a hammer at the restaurant you know yeah yeah for sure yeah but that again that's one of those I mean you and I have developed this perspective from years of hunting and being around people who hunt and we understand it for the average person that's never going to encounter that in their entire life no it's we've developed this very weird Society we've insulated people from all of the ugly realities of eating meat and of wearing leather I mean we're sitting on leather chairs didn't think about it once this used to be a fucking cow yeah so much shot this cow and turned it into a nice chair no one Minds sitting on a cow that's dead but no one wants to see that dead cow right laying on the ground the eyes open and blood hanging from its ankle yeah drew people and I think it's important for people to see that I mean my kids have seen a lot of dead animals it's not it's not sad it's a little sad but it's not like they don't think of it as sad they think of it as just like a part of life you know that's what we eat yeah dad brings a deer home in a cooler dad brings a pig home on the front of the quad with his bow the bloody arrow it's totally normal they see me drag it off the quad and shoot down with the hose and quarter it and debone it and and they help me package it and grind the meat and it's totally normal to them it should be so normal but there's a connection between the death and what we're eating right which a lot of people just don't have and I'd love that that that my kids already have that it's a good thing I think well I I think that we have a real problem in this society where so many people somewhere in the neighborhood of 95 to 97% of the people eat meat and the number of people that have actually seen an animal die is like you know two or three yeah like what is it what's the population of people that hunt in North America let's let's guess guess the prop relation of the US that hunts I must say it's 3% that that might be high even three out of a hundred what do you think it is it's probably less than three sure let's see what it is what population of the United States of America hunts Jamie's raising his eyebrows technicality here but it says there's one hundred and 1.6 million Americans that participated 16 and older that yeah fishing fish and wildlife shows that 100 100 there's a lot of people behind ya but that much dissipated yet participated in wildlife related activities Wow that's that includes like pig fuck that includes wildlife watch yeah oh why live watching I've typed in popular lot of different that's that's a lot different does that's all they came up there's gotta be a population of actual a number of hunters mean this is back and that's the other thing too it's like there's a hierarchy like people have a problem with people fishing no no no problem or posting a photo with our fishing pole catch yeah hey you got some food what's different between that and is that maybe that's that's what's the difference between on a deer but here's our warm here's that well they're warm and they have fur there's a movie made about them they talk what about me and Disney fuck Nemo nobody cares about Nemo gets no love he doesn't get any love I was singing to this so like you know cuz I have kids and my kids eat meat right and I feel like imagine if you made a law that after the age of 16 years old in America if you wanted to eat another hamburger you had to kill two out to two animals like it's like you go to a place like if whatever it is like a ranch where they processed meat and there's a cow there and there's a rifle there and you okay if you want to be a meat eater from now on from their 16th birthday on the only way to meet in the future is if you got to do it yourself at least twice can't just do it once yeah kill a cow watch get processed and then you got to you got to wait like a month or whatever it is and go back and and take another animal's life and then you earn the right to eat meat the rest your life imagine how many people wouldn't be able to do that they're happy to eat meat but there's that disconnection with the actual death part yeah I would have a problem with forcing people to do it just like I'd have a problem with forcing people let's go some people should be forced to get rid of their garbage just a wild concept that it is an interesting concept but I think there's services like like taking your garbage and bringing it to the garbage dump I don't think you should have to go to the garbage dump go to the landfill and drop your garbage off I'm happy that there's someone that gets paid to pick up the bins and dump the garbage into the garbage truck and then drive it to the bit that I'm happy that that exists I like that yeah I like the fact that someone takes care of sewage I agree I like the fact that I can buy a stake for sure all I'm saying is like yeah if you could earn the right to eat steak you know I say you don't have to do it every time you wouldn't you wouldn't have to like kill a cow every time you wanted to eat more it's like once you finish that cow you need to kill another one I'm just saying everyone should know what it's like to take an animal's life no I agree with to eat meat I agree everyone should probably know what it's like because because if you don't it's hard to respect that animal enough like like I was saying like my my kids don't we don't waste deer meat like if it's on their plate they eat it they don't eat it I put in their eat it the next day or whatever it is you know there's there's always a lesson to be to be taught when you're eating wild game that you that you've hunted yourself I think I think there's a problem whenever there's a disconnect right it's like I think there's a problem with if money just comes for free there's a problem if if your meat just comes from a store yeah there's a weird disconnect between the the actual thing that's living and then eating it and most people the vast majority of people are completely disconnected from that me that's all that's the case with farming vegetables to most people I don't think they have an appreciation for a vegetable being a life form you're you're consuming that you know there's a growth process it's a living thing you pull it out of the ground you cook it you eat it I mean this that disconnect I think is real too because there's a real good feeling that I get when I eat vegetables that have grown in my garden yeah you know I mean I love it I really really enjoy it I get a kick out of it and there's a lot of people who look down on us for hunting who are say like you're a vegan who just eats nothing but vegetables aren't fruit whatever it is and uh you know they're looking at us like we're crazy for for you know the impact we have on the animals killing them whatever but like a lot of the vegetables that people eat now it is are grown in places that used to be rainforests like the Amazon is just getting whacked down just to grow corn stuff like that you know I mean like oh there's a lot of it is just cattle right isn't the Amazon a lot of the deforestation I think that the primary a lot of ethanol too though is it for for corn you know there's but I think hardwoods try they chopped a lot of it down for hardwoods and they chopped a lot of it down to in order to provide grazing lands for cattle they gonna future all of the vegetables and stuff we're gonna be I was talking to Kelly about this a lot there's a lot of things that are happening out with technology that I think a lot of like the vegetables and stuff that we're gonna eating are gonna be grown vertically instead of like a nice massive you know farms of like these huge like you know one hundred thousand acre ranch is full of like vegetables we're talking to super super efficient growing in smaller spaces to feed more people with less space a wonderfully crazy that's gonna be crazy yeah that would be crazy I mean there's probably some real benefits that but I wonder if they could do that with grain we're gonna have to do something with our population keeping growing and more people and more demand for food and less space to grow it you know there's gonna be an inflection point where someone else have to do something but I think technology is moving in that place where and that's a thing I get like the people who hate on me on say social media whatever all my Instagram if I post a photo of my if I did post a photo of me getting an elk or whatever it was and all these people get uppity but because a lot of people can't go hunt you don't live in a place where they can go hunting and get their own meat they live in a city that of a New York City or Shanghai or in Buenos Aires or whatever and they it's so unrelatable to them you know no I understand that I appreciate that and you know I think that social media is very strange in that regard to because people always looking for people or things to get pissed off out oh yeah they don't get mad if I post pictures of cook though no they don't mean a few there's a few like proselytize area games you're gonna get cancer man and I think cancer comes from meat imagine if all meat gave you cancer you know fucking stupid that is everyone would have cancer literally 95% of the population within cancer it's just there's there's a few epidemiological studies that have fucked people's heads up because they've correspond 'add they've related the idea of eating meat to poor health but these people that have eaten meat they don't just eat meat they've eaten meat along with sugar and alcohol consumption and cigarettes and to lifestyle they don't factor those things in their eating like a like a like a 30 ounce prime rib yeah your body is impossible for your body to process that we're likely they're eating burgers with sugary buns and ya know process me both but when I eat meat I normally meet that that's like the size of my palm or a smaller you know a wild game and it's that size I think it's easy for my body to process that eating like a prime rib that's like hanging off both sides your plate like Fred Flintstone that's difficult I think for your body to process that I just died it that's not scientific I just look at it and go there's no way I can my body's gonna deal with that where's it gonna fit its gonna stay in it for 30 years you know they always say that like it's gonna stay true to that's all nonsense - wasn't Kelly talking about like we've been here like shooting his butt out and stuff yeah he was talking about talk yeah he was talking about when you go on these extreme fasts and then all this weird stuff that comes out of the inside of your gut yeah it comes out yeah I would try that just to look at that stuff see what that stuff looks like yeah I would try but I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to look at I definitely would want like that like though you know we're like when you're having a baby and they put up like a curtain sometimes you don't see anything like that like put my legs up someone's you got a visual that ya got my legs up and some be someone out there you know doing alone stuff do you grow your own vegetables I don't know I travel like half the time I'm gone from home like literally half the time so it's really difficult - is it hard getting good vegetables on the Big Island um no there's not it's it's she was really good at farmers markets I'm lucky because my my my mom and her boyfriend have a really neat like a hydroponic killer vegetable garden oh I like will trade a lot of times I'll give them venison and I'll get really good veggies from them and that's good trade yeah that's cool yeah sure there's there's a lot of meals that we do we're like no one has touched that meal except for my family it's cool like zan has a she's got a macadamia nut farm a Big Island and she raves about it up there man she loves it I listen to part of her podcast if you haven't finished it yet but she's amazing she's funny she's you know what man they fucked up and they really did fuck up they fucked up when he blew it huh that lady is not racist she's definitely mentally ill but she's open about it she's not racist and they they just they just jumped on the opportunity to virtue signal and to cry out against racism and to take a stand but they took a stand against a woman that has mental problems who's on all sorts of medication who they knew about it I mean she's been she was put in a mental hospital for nine months when she was a kid and she's hit by a car I mean she had a severe brain injury yeah and ever since then she's had multiple personality disorder she's been on a host of different medications and they knew about this everybody knew about this yeah they should have known it's basically like taking a person who's got a broken leg and getting mad that they limp it's what they did yeah I mean they have a person who had brain problems who tweets a bunch of wacky shit she's on ambien and drinking and smoking pot and even then she wasn't being racist she wasn't she didn't know that lady was black the lady didn't even look black if you look at her you look at a picture of her she does not look black yeah she just thought she was being funny and she thought she was making a solid point that she was gonna expand upon when she woke up in the morning cuz she literally said that she's all fucked up on him being and pot and drinking I listened I was crazy yeah that was fucked up to happen to her and it sucks at her show got cancelled well the new one sucks the new one sucks okay going down the toilet so hey no I'm sort of the same subject did you see the that rad documentary about the white woman who ran the n-double-a-cp frickin act like a black lady I know who she is but that was one of Dozo best best freakin documentaries are as incredible documentary yeah insane she's out of her mind did they kept asking her if she was black and she was just straight-up like at first she said yes and then she said like it's not that important and then she was like tanning herself and like putting like all this brown facial on herself and getting like weaves and doing her nails like how she thought like black people would do their nails like it was super weird and then she ran it she ran the n-double-a-cp yeah it was just a wild documentary chick was just in outer space it's hilarious that she ran the n-double a-c-p yeah yeah did a good job and she had a huge impact she was like amazing at her job supposedly like in the documentary it was saying that she got all this stuff done at that where they were trying to do for a long time and she was really really good at doing her job it just sucked that she was actually a white lady who was like acting the whole time well what's really fucked is N double AC P stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People you cannot call african-americans Colored People that is a fucking slur they have a slur in their title we're leaving in weird times men against a people of color which is fucking bizarre yeah you can't say collared people well you can say people of color the same words just twist it around dude I had a it's messed up it's like it's you can just be like labeled a racist or less sexist or whatever for like saying like that oh yeah yeah it's wild I had a 23andme DNA test done hmm they're pretty good yeah and I was hoping I was if I was more than 10% black I was gonna start dropping in bombs one point six so one point six I'm one point six percent African pretty strong it's all dick when they did that thing about Elizabeth Warren I did find out what percentage she is Elizabeth Warren who claim to be Native American and she did a test she's like one 1/100 of what I am like it's literally like her saying she's yeah her saying she's a Native American is literally like me saying I'm african-american but I have a claim far more like more than I think some some insane number like a factor of more African in me and she has Native American and I'm not even remotely Native American motif ricchan right yeah I'm 1.6 percent I have 1.6 percent African in me and she has like some fucking really stupid number what is the no it's like I don't even know how to make sense of all that stuff she had that was how it happened was a Harvard like researcher looked into it right and gave a number that was very vague that would be like 1 and 512 to one and 1024 socks dude that's the thing like something I gives a shit but she got into Harvard because of this where she claimed she was Native American when she got in that's claiming that she was a my Norton was Harvard right correct I'm being honest about that was a Cambridge whatever the university is found in some some I'd be honest a university by claiming that she was Native Americans she got a special scholarship because of that home is literally like me going to Morehouse and saying I'm african-american except I have a far better claim you have a much higher percentage much higher that's so crazy wild meanwhile she's so nuts like cuz Trump was always calling her Pocahontas and Trump said there see how is it that you can't if you said the wrong thing on your podcast people be up in arms about some reason the president could say whatever the hell he wants to say well he's making racist offending to be a Native American yeah he was joking about her she's not really Native American and he called her Pocahontas and he said she took a DNA test and showed that she was Native American he would donate a million dollars to a charity of her choice so she - this fucking test that basically showed she has the smallest measurable possibility Native American in her was requiring him to pay how you should pay Harvard for what you have all the money back built them where at school did she go to trying to find the actual thing that seems I think she actually got a job at Harvard not didn't go there for education so she got a job there because of okay he'll figure it out but that's hilarious the idea that that is something you can lean on is so goddamn crazy listen you're a white lady I'm a white guy shut the fuck up okay you're not there's no there's not a part of you that has been discriminated against because of the fact that you're Native American it just doesn't exist it's not true that's not so fascinating to me people who love to be a victim they'd love to say you know it was my luck growing up was hard because I'm one 150,000 Native American easy crazy and where does it stop like is it is it is it you know like is it cool to say that if you're 2% or 10% or 50% like where is it where is it that's what I'm saying that 1.6 percent I really don't feel drop n bomb right yeah it's not cool 10 percent like I'm mostly Italian I'm like 3/4 Italian so I can call someone a Guinea like Annie no problem yeah but Italians don't give a fuck if you call them guineas yeah ok like there's no really there's no good slurs for Italians yeah work you know they've successfully integrated into society but when my grandfather used to tell me about he came over here when he was a boy from Italy and he would tell me about how bad it was about how much they were discriminated against yeah you know misty was it was hardcore I mean they were treated a lot of the same way racist people treat Mexicans today an Irish same thing same thing yeah yeah and that's my background is Italian and Irish mostly but someone by a black person somewhere somewhere 1.6% I know how many generations I guess the claim is that she used her claim that she's Native American to get a job yes not not to get not going to school okay get a job at Harvard at one at Harvard one at Pennsylvania so she did it twice give that money back bitch dude I love the DNA test though I love the DNA test yeah just proves that we're all like something we're all a bunch of shit like yeah
