the gyro can experience what is the state of Japanese MMA now it was gigantic for a while when Sakuraba was big when you were huge when pride was filling 90,000 Cu a really huge it was like nothing else yeah so I I experienced 60,000 at Rogers in Canada when George st. Pierre fought Jake Shields I couldn't imagine 30 more thousand people there well you but you were there for them yeah yeah it was awesome I mean if that was a ten and before it may actually came out when they only had pancreas and that was a one it's at like a four right now what happened as chuckles involvement I mean the thing that people don't realize is in Japan everything is yuckles involvement every big company every big promotion shuto just to say that they never get a physical involvement but they're there they're backed by Sumiyoshi which is the second largest group in japan you know so everyone has the opposite connection so any big coca-cola company Johnson Johnson any company has y'all because of connections Wow but it's not public so say if coca-cola goes over there and they open up a plant in Japan they must go through the Yakuza they'll have that connections yes definitely how do they negotiate that well it's it's it's really easy it's it's it's a it's a turf thing it's a if you know somebody it's it's it's a percentage you pay its it's a it's a pretty given thing it's almost like like taxes Wow yeah she's accepted yes accept it accepted that's why it's it's funny how when it became public everyone it got really bad because it's a it's a weird thing it's accepted but it's frowned upon it's something that they know they need to be a part of in society but they don't want to make it public because the Yakuza has does have a bad name that was the only place where I've ever been where they asked me to cover up my tattoos yeah yeah that was weird and so I don't have I try to keep them all for my sleeve so it comes near but after that I stopped because I don't want to walk around and you know be kicked out of places you know I just got denied to go and hotel like last week when I was in Japan really yeah because of my Cathy's with the neck is that what it is yeah for wear a hoodie it covers it up it helps with yeah I got a I got kicked out of a gym they made me go put a long-sleeve shirt yeah the gyms even big gyms at Gold's Gym one with you that's great yeah what does it represent to Japanese it represents the under wrong gangsters and you know they you gotta figure when you have a gang there's two or three top men those men are awesome people and then you got the rest of the hundreds and thousands that are punks and that's the ones that you see so basically a gangster someone with tattoos which equals Yakuza would mean trouble and they would if you go into a sports gym and you're working on next to a guy and you know you're working on say you take his weights by accident could see in the middle of a set and if you're doing it to someone that's a normal person he'll just say hey I was using those weights all sorry okay well it might be different for the Yakuza and people would rather not work out in the area if there's a how cuz they're working out there so it's a bad rap I mean it's justifiable though I can understand that the UFC when they went in and bought pride it's kind of a crazy story but they paid 65 million dollars they bought pride and they thought you know hey we're gonna run pride as well as the UFC the same way they did with Strikeforce when they bought Strikeforce they kept Strikeforce going for years they thought they were gonna do that yeah but meanwhile it turned out all the contracts were illegal they really didn't have anybody under contract they spent sixty five million dollars and all they really got was a video library and then while they had offices in Japan and they were hiring these people and paying for him they were starting up dream they were starting up their own organization you know organizing everything and yeah and then you know the UFC it took years before they could come back and do a UFC there they took it took a long time ever Dana was getting like some like underworld threats and you know was he yeah that's what I heard I said Dana email on that because if anything I have a lot of pull in that site and I told him that if you have any problems with that I can help you what do you have to do come to you and then you got I got really respected in that world so um I could I if I don't know the person directly I have guys at norm so if he had any type of problem I still it still stands still today if Dana any type of underworld problems there if he calls me I could take care of it for him it's interesting that there's such an underworld presence in Japan because it seems so safe when you're there everything is so but people are so polite and you don't see violence you don't see like you see drunk people walking to the street no one hurts them everything everyone's fine the girls walk down dark lanes and it's okay yes it's a strange sort of you know contrast yeah it's it's it's almost like you just have bad areas like in Shinjuku they have over 300 yoga's office is there Roppongi only has three Wow yeah so you got these districts that they're accumulated in they have offices the offices yeah the Mafia doesn't have office yeah see that's the thing for me I guess I grew up in America so for me the Mafia just scares me way more I mean I have this image that you screwed the Mafia you better change your name you better move and you better hide who your family is and you better get the hell out of just disappear but when you get in trouble with the Yakuza I've been in trouble with them before and it's it's it's like you can kind of pretty much deal with them the way you want to deal with them you know it depends on how much you're willing to sacrifice yeah and what was your issue with them um there was a one do it kid when when I this guy this chuckles guy wanted to open up a gym and I agreed to open up a gym with him called purebred Tokyo Killer Bee and I just told him that the only thing you have to do is you have to hire two of my fighters so they can make a living through fighting and I wanted to help them out I want more money you can use my name on my gym but you have to hire my two fighters if they hired kid and they heard Ryan bull and those are the fighters and everything was good and what happened was kids started I guess from the influence of his father he started being the loyalty issue in him was getting was wavering where he wasn't telling me stuff he was hiding stuff he's lying to me and then I put that Yakuza guy in charge of him that ran the gym so I told him I called him and say what's going on man you got to take care of me cuz I'll take care of it I take care he's told me that and it got to a point he didn't take care of it so I called him and I was pissed everybody know and I called him it's a you know call he avoided my calls for three days so three three three weeks and I'm sitting there this guy's just running from me I'm thinking this is ridiculous so I'm okay this guy's running for me I'm not gonna look for him I'm oh no he's gonna pop up these guys that try to run they're palpable all the time you know so I'm sitting there watching the uno kid fight and kid wins the fight this guys in the ring jumping in hug him and theme as a motherfucker this guy is hiding from me he's on national TV hugging me saying Hanson I'm here so I guess is it so I called my students they said to find out where the after-party is but I doubted after pardon I was literally gonna walk in there grab that guy with hair and pull a model of party but my students felt it was gonna be a problem is gonna make too much commotion cops are gonna be called so they decide to get him in they brought him up and brought him to the park and pretty much beat him for like 20 minutes which is something you shouldn't do in Japan because in the Yakuza world they work by face they work by being tough being scary to collect money and stuff and if you got all they got a black guy and bruises on their faces kind of goes against the fact that they're tough people you know so I didn't pretty bad and I did but see the thing is I never did pick on anyone I never did do anything without a reason and I I believe that I would die for my beliefs tomorrow and I believe that I was right and this guy really deserved that shit so if they didn't like it if the cop guys didn't like it then they can they know where to find me and so what happened was it was going on for 20 minutes and when I went down I let people in some people my friends know and they were all worried so they made calls and we had two other Yakuza guys come down to the scene to to try and stop me to kind of get in between not stop me physically but to to to ask for forgiveness for this guy and they're kind of like bowing in the middle of me and the guy and I'm getting around and just just giving him whacks at a time and when he if he were to fall from a hit I'd grab him and standing right back up oh yeah so it's kind of getting brutal he was all bloody and then these guys were kind of my friends too so they weren't gonna get involved with there trying to stop me from going too far mm-hmm and when we there's this old lady you know how you have the old ladies in neighborhood that they don't give a fuck who you are this lady comes in gets on the lady and say no no I don't do that man let's go so we moved it over to the next part and as you're moving with the next part like three freakin monkeys this guy's higher-ups find out what's happening and come out and they're walking up like these you know like the movies like they're walking she is funny because I come on monkeys because it you're walking through bushes like I saw walking through the trees and they came out and say oh shit these are the guys like the hothead guys and they came up to me and they're screaming in Japanese to me oh you gonna hurt you now because you hurt our brother and then some of my guys came and held him back and I'll say okay wait a minute um if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen now so I told my guys that I'm go I said let him go I said I just want to say one thing to you guys and they they came up in there up there you know they got justice stands and they're all mad at me and looking at me and I'm the can see I got one thing to do if I got one thing to say if I say you don't like it we can have it out I said I'm ready to die tonight and then this guy goes okay and so I thought okay if someone fucked you over I said you want to punish him wouldn't that be fair he goes yes but look what you did to him to get him looking he's all blood he's standing around bloody you know I said well you know what let's put it this way I ask you one question if I need to kill him with my hands how fast you think it did he said probably five minutes within five minutes I said hello within two minutes I killed that fucker and he goes yeah but what do you do what does that mean and I said well I've even hit him for twenty minutes I said dude this is this is like 10% of what I could do and I said don't you agree a few what you if you had somebody fuck you over and you decide to just do 10% out of respect to the people behind him what don't you think that's fair and the guy just changed straight up boom stop and he said you're right man thank you wow that doesn't fly in America that's interesting interesting code they don't go to then they believe in on the road side is there's two sides of the fence there's the legal side the illegal site the illegitimate side and you are never ever if you're on the ilysm insider have a legitimate problem you are never ever allowed to go to the other side to get help you if you're gonna stay you're gonna get other guys to help you on this side and retaliate that's fine but if you ever go to authorities and you lose you can never can ever work in that world again so Wow so you have to deal with things on your own it's a problem like that yeah you pretty much if if you if you're someone from the outside and you're like a regular businessman and these guys come and bother you the best thing to do is go authorities because of the the police are just waiting to grab the offices so it's like a role it's like kryptonite to the others if you go say you're going to the police they'll back off but if I I live my life in that side pretty much you know I mean a lot of my friends are part of those groups and a lot of my beliefs run really deep with their beliefs you know the I mean see the thing is is you you and you hear about the Yakuza they get a bad rap because you talk about choppin ography drugs you know extortion what is that when they when they steal money from people you know but the thing that they don't see there's all the things in the media but the things that they don't see which I feel this is really unfortunate is the the honor and the loyalty they have for each other and that's where me and them click really well you know I mean they will die for anyone in your group tomorrow they'll go to jail for 10 years for their boss tomorrow if they have to I mean you don't see that type of loyalty around all these you know not matter and I love you know that I take that loyalty you know and they and that's I think that's why they respect me so much is I all die for my values I'll die for my people that close to me it's just such a unbelievably fascinating culture how different Japan is and so many ways they could be there's big gaps in it yeah yeah it's crazy it's it's really really really fascinating stuff it's just that all these different cultures evolve independently that the Japanese culture evolved independently from the American culture independently from the European culture and it's so different yeah it is all I think all the places are different it's hard to really move into a different country and and run yourself in the way that you learned in another country because it's you know say when When in Rome what do you what do you think about the state of Japanese MMA right now because it's kind of in a transitionary period if one at one point time it was gigantic and you say Yakuza of all men is why people corporate sponsors backed out and they lost a lot of viewership but man it was just not that long ago that they were selling out these gigantic places what what's going on right now well right now like I said it's up to number four right now there's people that are real hesitant there's not many sponsors I want to put money into it on the flip side the big thing that's happening is gangster events with a lot of gangsters to fight in the ring and yeah it's crazy it's like I attend all those I'm like a guest in most of them they pay me just to be there and to judge sometimes to make a speech in the ring maybe in the beginning because I'm so respected in that world that to have me there a lot of these gangs are stone down you know when they want a riot they don't riot you know I mean you go to the event and it's not unusual to see a picture of two stick figures fighting and has a big excellent so don't fight don't fight it's like isn't that given you've never seen insider in the UFC saying please don't fight nothing it's just like it's already giving this not something you should do right but yeah so that's a big thing right now but it's good because the gangster events actually they they have head BOTS they have elbow striking that you can splits Tom you can neither groin you can do whatever pretty much no holds bar they have two on one you have two one two really it's crazy dude how often do they have these fun I'm about once a month man there's some shit yeah it's like these guys it's become it's a good trend because it's become where these guys just came off the street singing their cough gassing on in one minute from these guys actually spending time in the gym now and being off the street so it's actually a good movement lada there's about three or four gangsters already now this actually made their pro debut and deep so how these guys are actually gonna run gangs and and start selling drugs and you know doing illegal activity they're not training and having a future in fighting which is awesome as far as a legitimate side of MMA I I see it I can see it picking up again and it's all due to the UFC so the UFC has done a couple of events there now last one they did when I went to that it was huge man that's so big I mean as much as the Japanese fans are kind of losing hope in Japanese MMA because a lot of productions were falling when we went to when I went to the ERC I felt that that energy again when I was fighting and pride that energy that they had in the audience and especially when rampage came out with the pride music did it gave me goosebumps because when he came out to that I looked around the arena and I was like damn this is a psyche of pride he says that this is a pride and I it's the first time since that big incident with the Yakuza Vaman and pride that I've actually seen that again it it was surreal to me actually and I was like John this is gonna this is gonna be the the ticket back is there your see coming to Japan if the UFC did an Ultimate Fighter in Japan and the Japanese version of it would you be interested in coaching oh yeah oh definitely yeah I would love to that would be perfect you you would really be perfect for something like yeah I would love that
