hello freak bitches yeah I know somebody talked to a cop and they say that when how they started working and then 11 years later oh yeah going into those areas where these things always happen and after years and yeah it just it just wears on you for sure and I know from the air just me growing up in situations you know me yeah I wouldn't want to go back I barely go back there you know so but it do give you nerves your nerves heightened it naturally kicks in 100% you know and like yeah and some people can't handle those nerves mm-hmm you learn how to breathe quietly you don't know like somebody you could walk down the street and somebody could pull out only those things though I've been driving on the street with my ex lady and she was talking and I was like get down cuz I saw a guy draw on a corner and shoot across the street of another guy I don't you and as this gun went up we drove under that the fire right it was long it was long oh my god we went under we got a second shot off and I drove and I was like man that was crazy like I'm that guy I made it like you know he made that was crazy and she's like you can call the police and I'm like for what he'd like to tell what happened that was like and that's how crazy is the way you don't even want to be involved because you got to go to the cops and I know calling the police and things like he described a victim I was like white t-shirt blue jeans that's all I see it and it was like was he black and it was just a long pause there's a long pause and they like sir is he black and I was like you know if you can help somebody out and they can get rid of it or change the way they think ie Joe shell him when he did sign my therapy knees relationship with his dad was miles better before he passed away it wasn't that pretty powerful yeah joe talked about it on the podcast he talked about it just it completely changed his whole perception of his relationship with his dad who his dad was in his life and just he let it all go yeah just helped tremendously yeah what more can you say than that really as a coachman ian mccall it's that you know I know they didn't get his fight with Justin Scoggins and that because of the way whatever mm-hmm an even was saying that his life has changed since - inside mine therapy and doing the you know work with me not just timeline therapy and not just hypnosis with my coaching in general because he's multifaceted really I know him he said his life changed he's a different person people have noticed you know so that's for me great news I think sometimes it just takes the realization of what's been fucking with you once you realize what it is then you have it in your mind and then you can kind of look at it for what it really is instead of this like thing that's playing in the background that you can't quite identify or you or you know it exists but you ignore it and you just you don't you don't ever get over it yeah he sees he's interesting I had a client in the other week called Joyce she's 80 years of age and she was going to a wedding in Spain for her grandson and she was beside herself she was terrified you know we did it's just a few things you know a little things to make it consider different ways of looking at the anxiety she was getting cousin anxiety is basically a message fluid unconscious mind is to focus on what you want because if you're in an anxious state you focusing on what you don't want right there's different levels of it of course which she was focusing on what may go wrong self saying all this we're going to a wedding is a celebration of two people's matrimony whatever it's gonna be nice and that she wasn't focused on that she was focus on something else I changed that and like she was happy and she went to the wedding and it's a you know he's got to me she's 80 years of age he may not be going to lows or weddings let's be honest right but it for me the job itself what can you say about nice it's transforms people you know and I adore it Mark Spitz that's right he was a 76 Olympics I think is that right it has to be he looks like Burt Reynolds from deliverance 72 72 yeah man that's right I forgot about that guy okay so he was the first of the the superstar Michael Phelps type swimmer dudes I think before um I want to say before Phelps came along and I really don't know but I think that Spitz was the guy won the most gold medals up until that mo and then Phelps just fucking blew him out of the water where is he now if I had guessed by the way it looks and Burt Reynolds movie the 1970s yeah I hope that guy still rocks that look I wonder if being in water more than a more Everett the average person is better or worse for your your skin for every pipeworks close you out chlorines not good for you true it's not good for you chlorine kills everything that's in the water but it also fucks with the floor of your own skin like it's it's not the best stuff in the world for your skin it means it's sterile water what about saltwater that's probably better for you yeah what's a saltwater is better for you yeah saltwater is interesting man cuz I can't get it in my eyes I know some people can get it in their eyes they don't have a problem with that I get in my eyes it fucking stings I don't know why like when I go to the the beach if I get water in my eyes it fucking stings it's that add to your sodium levels he's not as Mark Spitz wasn't even using a swim cap when you're saying your eyes were stinging he doesn't have goggles on either yeah but I'm talking about a pool he swam in a pool and the ocean is where my eyes sting but yeah Mark Spitz was the old school is fuck he probably swam in a flannel shirt and shorts probably made from like red dye number nine they didn't do any strength conditioning back there stop stroma just men in their underwear Jamie stop it the iconic speedo indoors so this go to full body on this gentleman look at his fucking body man it's like II mean I guess he kinda looks like an athlete or he looks like your girlfriend's brother that's staying with her over the you know you get up in the morning you meet him for the first time well how you doing man nice to meet you oh hey man hey y'all got soap like that's what he looks like like some some weird fucking dude might have worked out a couple of times in his underwear like why are you just standing here in your underwear like that dude with gold chains around your neck this is a fucking strange picture it doesn't really look to swimmer body either like the difference between that body and Michael Phelps body or any swimmer nowadays it's like pretty different like his legs actually seem kind of chubby they're like a I don't know they don't really seem muscular they kind of seem sexy well you got you beat a guy like Robbie Laura you knock him out in one round you got to think the momentum coming out for that's got to be stunning I would love to see fantasy UFC like a show where they take maybe the fighters that have retired or people that aren't as good as the other fighters and have them like almost do like game shows stuff like this like you have to do a game go all right so this fight you have your shoes tied you have to hold a banana and not crush it you have to protect this banana like it's a baby you know like fun things like that I'm yeah you know what I mean like because I think even as I think as a fight it would still be fun just the hat throw into other options like almost like a video game you know where you're my doctor I've told you many times something wrong
