the girag and experience i think it would changed consciousness period i think human beings would develop a completely different sense of reality itself completely different south of our perspective in the universe I think it's terms and I didn't mind expanding I didn't probably took a small dose how much do I need to take five grams usually in darkness if you can get in an isolation tank go that way yeah don't be a pussy you're talking about mushrooms and you haven't gone the big route I haven't no let your bro you know you've dipped your toes in the water you haven't jumped into the ocean can I tell you my mushroom story yeah with some friends we went camping we were doing mushrooms and we're all standing in this lake in Idaho with some like redneck families camping all around us and we're like two gay guys and two straight GU straight couple and we're just tripping out of our mind so mushrooms that were standing it's like in these fish are nibbling are the hairs on our legs and we're all like whoa and then suddenly there's a boat going back and forth in front of us that has dared the drug resistance education logo that's like the police boat that's going back and forth in front of us and then a prop airplane comes right at us we're like standing there and this airplane is like we see it in the sky it's getting lower and lower it's pointed right at us it comes over right at us at the boat and we were all like we see are you seeing an airplane and then the airplane went right over our heads we all shit ourselves we were terrified we like how what the fuck it disappeared like right behind us on this little rise what the fuck and we ran up there thinking it was gonna be a plane crash and there is a runway because we come down to the beach sideways and along the sand and there was an airport right there but there was this moment we're like we're tripping the fish are eating us the Dare boats going like this which something is paranoid and now here comes the plane for our heads and I haven't done mushroom sense and maybe that's why yeah that's probably a bad place to do mushroom set and setting is one of the most important things like well where you were at a boat with a fucking dare boat going by and a plane fly I mean you're at a runway we had no idea we're standing at the foot of a room yeah you can smoke pot and do jujitsu with no problem whatsoever no problem smoke pot and you're very coordinated well pot and something drops you catch it like your reflexes everything they're all there unless you're not used to it if you're not used to it all you're thinking of starting getting high Joey started making fun of me because we I forget what we did we Oh I remember we went to the fucking Sunday brunch at the House of Blues remember they had that Gospel Brunch that gospel yeah we all went over there and we were toasted to the gills it was like one of the first weekend's I ever got high and Joey Diaz like look at this fucking rookie okay I was going I can't believe a high I'm right now this is ridiculous I can't I'm I have to sit here I wasn't used to it I didn't know how to deal with it but if I was the same high right now I'd be fine because I know what that is it's a it's what you're doing is when you're too high and you're paranoid and you're frozen you're frozen cuz you don't know what it is you don't know what what comes next with is this gonna get worse am I gonna get more crazy oh my god how long is it's gonna last but when you're used to being high you're like I'm just high dude relax everything's fine you know what it is you know the worst it gets you know the best it gets you felt the full the full range of the effects but you were laughing at me I'll never forget fucking rookie when you first get high you get so enjoyably hungry enjoyably like this simple like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich it's fucking filet mignon in your mouth yeah like you either with a bag of chips what is your senses right yeah it just says is it so you don't even breathe you just chew it like I have a bug giggling like I love to giggle bro a couple weeks ago I ate a cookie and I was sitting there so fucking stoned at 8 o'clock at night and I kept thinking to myself this is the same cookie Casey Kasem ate the week it was it was the week that he was busy then he went - no I felt so bad I grew up on fucking Casey Casey but then there was traffic when I was watching the news that name there was traffic on the 405 and I'm like oh my god there's traffic on the 405 Nelson they said that just cause the traffic was that the President of Israel was on the 405 so how walk after it down no I kept thinking about was the President of Israel knows about these cookies Casey Kasem a he's coming to LA to get these cookies that's how I was giggling at the thought of my thoughts that's hilarious and I was happy I love that I love still giggling that's what I miss the most about being stoned to the gills going to a diner or laughing at the waitress just kidding how you doing boy he just fucking you can't control yourself I got this all that shit the simple pleasures a week even before like I surprised myself that I became a world champion and kickboxing like I just wanted to fight to validate my coaching and I just kept on winning fights oh my god I guess I'm alright at this but at the end of the day I'm still the biggest fan like I you're gonna have to kick me out of here today I could just keep you want to look at more fights like I didn't watch it till the cows come I'm waiting man yeah it's it's my that's you know that's why I don't watch other sports because I think we're in the coolest sport there's you know what to do all the sports on the planet are wrestling no fighting and runners either run not the be food or running to get your food either fight not to be food or fight they're the two most primal things you can do yeah especially fighting yeah I mean that's what this I kind of kind of a it's a Cicero quote on my arm the best protector of the sheep is the wolf I believe that some people in their wolves and some people are sheep you know people love fighting they're the wolves they're the protector so you know and it's kind of like training day to state you're talking about it takes a wolf to catch a wolf but like fighting is dude it's the most primal thing I'm I still miss that that dude wants to kick my ass I gotta kick his ass it's it's the most nerve-wracking it's like all right so I was a little experimental when I was a child and teenager after I lost my sister I saw about 25 or 26 Grateful Dead concerts and I I'll use this analogy I'd say that um fighting your first fight if you've never done it before it's like taking acid either find yourself or lose yourself like I've seen people or the baddest ass person on the planet they're the best fighter in the gym and they go to the fight and they just melt like butter they just can't you know that's like the trip out you know and I that's what I love about fighting you gotta take who you are in that in the gym and you're a god in front of 20 people I'll do it in front of 20,000 people more on a local show do it in front of 2,200 people it's still I love that vortex that rush of the proving ground yeah real true proving ground an exposure of truth like nothing else because that's what I think it's like I've seen so many people lose themselves mhm
