the girag and experience so in your experience and all these over the countries and will when you see all these different you know regimes getting toppled you don't think there's any American influence and these things happening I don't think we're that going really you know I've actually I'm a CIA nerd I was like like I'm not a gamer but I'm a guy who about 25 years ago started reading up at the Kennedy assassination got completely obsessed with that and then it just I'm one of these guys I read footnotes and a footnote leads me to another book to another book you know I disappear down the rat hole for ten years weeding everything so I'm really did you know best evidence oh yeah my feeling is we're just if history has taught us anything and if you read all of the documents from all of the controversial periods of CIA operations we just don't seem to be very good at these things and and everybody rats and writes a book about it immediately after hahahaha so if it went well you can be sure you'd be reading about her it woulda been leaked to a magazine by now you know said just I don't think I said I don't think we're that good and I certainly don't think we have much of an appetite for controlling the universe I think we're doing it we seem to be work very working very hard to hold the damn so you think the speculation about the CIA being involved like they're probably just very very peripherally involved and there's just shit happening no matter what major CIA operations going on right now without it with that out doubt but I think this notion that there's an office somewhere where the whole fate of the world is sort of decided what countries are going to invade over the next ten years we're just not that good and we're not definitely not that secure there's always you know three people know about something there's a greatest argument about the Kennedys you know the 9/11 conspiracy theory idiots the Kennedy assassination the Looney Tunes if basically in this country of three more than three people know about a thing one of them is gonna be on the stand crying about it the other guy is gonna be writing a book about it and maybe two guys will keep their mouth shut I think today I don't think during the time of the Kennedy assassination been that difficult to hide things I think things were less much less transparent back then than were today yeah but that's what's great about history you know eventually if you will it'll wait around summer to my view to my view if you will our wait around or every boring grim detail will will eventually come out and and if you as in the Kennedy said someone I don't even said it they described the Mafia theory as the halfway house for failed conspiracy theorists it's like I've decided to CIA didn't do it a mommy I did it it's like yeah okay well it was the Mafia you know and there's of course there's all this great evidence to support that theory but but but ultimately I'm of the Osmo got a lucky shot really clearing them I read best evidence and that's one of the reasons why I first started believing there was some sort of a conspiracy I was one of the one of the first things that I saw that made me really reconsider but later in life the thing that really got me was the Northwoods document if you never heard of that at some things they drafted in the 1960s or 1960 where 61 or 62 where Kennedy actually vetoed it and all the Joint Chiefs of SAP the Joint Chiefs of Staff signed it and then we're gonna have fake American terror attacks we're gonna get a plane they were gonna have a drone plane exploded and say a bunch of people died and they were gonna attack Guantanamo Bay and they were gonna arm Cuban friendlies to attack want on ammo Bay because we wanted to go to wit this was this was this Cuban Missile Crisis era there were there were so many completely so this is what it to me what's interesting about Kennedy's assassination the conspiracy it's it it was so much it wacky shit going on around that time so much been embarrassing criminal scary funny really silly going on at that time that in fact the least interesting thing about the entire you know big picture of the Kennedy assassination is the actual assassination itself because what everybody else was up to at the time and covering up ruthlessly right out of a movie that CIA get his meeting with you know Johnny Roselli and all these think mafia guys the blackout Castro you know there was just so much other embarrassing shit going on that in many ways those stories and where they lead or a lot more entertaining and complex and and fun than then a story of a guy you know shooting a president so if you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone wouldn't you think about when you see the like the Oliver Stone movie does that drive you fired crazy it would have I would like to film a lot better if they just stuck with a historical record and he invented scenes and characters you know which I thought was as a as a as a Kennedy assassin character De Aza right and there were just certain things were just do mention that the garrisoned jury was out for like thirty seconds he's mentioned that Jim Garrison is a man of many interesting local a man with an interesting past let's put it that way not a did not not a reputation that was debatable let's put it that way which is never good the case was bad I mean he put a lot of very interesting stuff together and there was and all of it was like fascinating and a lot of ways a lot of it was there's almost more interesting than the there wasn't I don't believe in the octopus theory I think you've got a lot of really interesting very spooky characters who've been doing a lot of really sinister an interesting shit for a long time whether or not they were actually involved in the the Kennedy assassination is almost moot because they were up to some really other wacky stuff did the Magic Bullet theory bother you at all I think if you talk and I have talked to people who served in combat for a long time the story of the buddy who gets around through the front of his helmet it it travels around subcutaneously around the skull and and enters out the back without hurting the guy is if everybody's got shit happens shit happens I am willing to believe that that Bullet theory I would be willing to believe it except for the fact that they came up with it because a guy got hit with a ricochet under the bridge and so they had to attribute everything to three shots and I was like that seems like fuckin shifty I don't know what is what they call but when you've eliminated all the other suspects you know you're left with the likely truth I think and I to my satisfaction we have kind of eliminated the other suspects Woody Harrelson's dad didn't have any part of the shooters it's a you know wasn't that part of whatever Howard hunt was supposed to be yeah you know everybody's there Loch Ness monster UFOs Kennedy the whole deal it's way more fun to think that Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy but remember he was a really interesting guy if you I think the book that got it close got it most right who was a blur to fiction the Libra by Don DeLillo or it really gets inside Oswald's head I mean Oswald was a guy who who his favorite show as a teenager was I led three lives about an undercover FBI agent he was an intelligent he's a spy junkie in in today's world he would have been a gamer you know hook him in any game he wanted to be he he was a guy who kind of wanted to be to do big things and and he tried very hard he wanted a super secret KGB agent he wanted be super secret you know wanted to be a Marine he probably volunteered to the FBI a couple of times he was just a guy who wanted to do something big so I don't have a problem buying it see you no problem with the allegations of them fixing autopsy photos I have problems with all of it because I was have lost in it for ten years but the Kennedy family had very good reason to ask for you know the brain I mean he had Addison's disease and the implications of Addison's disease towards that Kennedy history were not favorable you know apparently I don't know but apparently it has been said that he had multiple bouts of syphilis this is you know you don't want the family didn't want the president right people want this part of the record it was a lots of syphilis holla at you boy Daisy took everything it was worth it and families and in large doses it that early units point oh who knows what really uh he had a doctor max Jacobson I believe I believe was the name he did have a doctor who would shoot him with the vitamin I think b12 and amphetamine according to one of them b12 makes with speed that's how that dude was not comment at certain levels it was a very you know society thing to do back then it's a five hour energy drink that's what it is 12 a lot of people didn't even know that was he was the original doctor he was known as dr. feelgood and that's where the name came from dr. I believe it was dr. max Jacobson I don't know legendary Wow sort of doctor to the Stars back in the Warhol and Kennedy's disease what did it have to it was it a motor skill thing what is it that I don't but but apparently there were uh there are in the symptoms the possible symptoms I think there can be emotional emotional content to the disease so theoretically could have affected his judgment it was it was unflattering I believe he was in a lot of this was a god a lot of pain too yeah supposedly right yeah about it back then you just want to talk about these things and and I think a lot of people ran around in circles covering things up for their own reasons and in fact most of them had really terrible things to cover up that back then thing is really fascinating when you think about it's not that long ago I was listen I was a life I remember being sent home from school when Kennedy was killed and but I you know I go for the simple explanation much of the time that's the good move myself I keep the crazy open I opened the door for crazy because I've seen some things I leave it open I but I agree with you most of the time I go with a simple door with crop circles and UFOs and the Loch Ness monster and Bigfoot most the time I go for the simple door people are full of shit and that story sucks that's how I usually go but I leave the door for crazy Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're a fucking human being
