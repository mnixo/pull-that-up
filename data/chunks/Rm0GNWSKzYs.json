all right here we go what's up man how are you Joe great to be a show it's a pleasure it's a pleasure to meet you and an honor I've been following your work for a long time man I mean I was first introduced to you and your methods by Steve Maxwell who was a you know a huge proponent of the kettlebell and then I started getting into very yeah very good and I started getting in your videos and I've read your books and so thank you that's an honor my pleasure how long have you been teaching and practicing with kettlebells since you're a little something like that medium that's it's kinda likes baseball you know it's pretty common in Russia in the storage unit yeah it is why didn't he catch on here until you came over here you know what I don't think people really tried I don't think people really understood that would catch on and I did not think it would happen either so I'm sitting with my friend Marty Gallagher having steaks years back marty is a former coach for par lifting Team USA and coach of some top lifters anywhere just trading old war stories talking talking about stuff and I told about kettlebells he says well you've got to teach Americans how to do that and I said Marty you don't understand this stuff is too hard nobody's gonna want to do this and he said you don't understand people want to do this and I wrote an article for based on Marty's suggestion for Milo so Milo was a publication niche publication for strange guys who lift rocks and bend things and break things and so on and so forth and so that was the start of it and then after that I told my publisher about it and he said well come on let's just make kettlebells and teach people I had told him the same thing you don't understand that people will not want to do this this is too hard and but he convinced me and they convinced me and the rest is history why did you think that it was popular in the Soviet Union but wouldn't be popular in America you know this is something that you just see it's very common thing to so you just see this you don't think much about this who knows yeah but it was popular over there yeah and it said at least since at least 1700s or possibly before that but this country is so performance oriented and so sports oriented and so competitive why wouldn't you think that that would be sort of a natural training modality that would immediately adopt it you got me there so you just decide in the US some years back decades before there's some some kettlebells were used by some old-time strong men like Zig Klein for example mhm and there was a company and they've Milo no relations to the magazine really what assess him with Milo why Oh Milo is the guy who carried the calf so if you go if you look okay the progressive overload is usually explained as this legend of Milo off Crotona so this guy started carrying a little calf on his shoulders and he would carry the calf every day so the calf would grow and eventually guy became very strong so that's why that name is present in in the strength game set back then today it is just one of the finest publications on strength training mostly niche things again like gripping and what if anyone's actually done that what carry a cow not to work you know it isn't amazing that something can grow physically faster then you can keep lifting it absolutely can but you know your typical training plan that people say I'm gonna add five phones to my bench press today I'm gonna do this every week and that by Christmas I'll be the world champion and it just doesn't work so the rate of adaptation is such that your body just cannot do that and it's cyclical in nature so you have to to put it in the Milo terms you have to after you carry the calf for a while it grows you have to back off to a wider calf and start you know start building up again why we do not know exactly so for some reason that unidirectional adaptation just in one you know we're getting stronger at the bench press or what have you we're carrying the calf he just cannot proceed indefinitely there some fatigue of some endocrine mechanisms some genetic mechanisms we do not know that but tactically we do have tricks of the trade to beat that to work around that and there is a number of ways of doing that the oldest way of doing that and it's very smart still very smart for a lot of people they would call this I think possibly constant weight training or something like that but the Soviets described it as step loading so let's look at your typical last look at your typical beginner somebody in the gym and so the person starts lifting whatever weight for whatever reps and the next week let's say next week he has five pounds and he does it again he does it again well the Soviets figured out that it's much better for him to stay at the same weight for several weeks and then make a bigger jump hmm so what you're doing pretty much is you are the making that updations more stable and it just happens in the cellar levels membranes become stronger and so on but all timers just they would say that you're solidifying the gains so the way that many old timers trained is they would just take the same weight and the staying with the same weight for a long time in the beginning it's challenging and that it becomes kind of comfortable that becomes almost easy and never jump up so that's just one way of doing it and today it's not unprecedented either if you look at Chris summer his gymnastics coach used that word gymnast it's very common I used that tactic with my latest addition of my kettlebell simple and sinister because it's much more reliable than just progressive overload and also because psychologically first of all the weeds out the impatient people so you're told to stay with the same load for a while some people automatic iself forget it I cannot do that well I don't want these people for my stuff and second so you're staying with this weight or these reps for some time in the beginning they challenge you and then some time goes by and suddenly they don't anymore so just very much there's a very clear clear sense of accomplishment so this is called step loading or using the old timers old timers terminology that constant weight training if you look at the other ways of making progress so another approach is called cycling and cycling so the one that I just described that would really be if we could artificially stop the growth of the calf like okay stop going mm-hmm for a while which we can but the cycling this is where I mentioned earlier this is where you go back to a lighter calf so the classic American powerlifting training template this is cycling so the history of cycling is very interesting again what cycling is cycling is in the simplest possible terms you take 12 weeks you start with lightweights you build up until you go really heavy and that was the predominant strength training system in the 70s in the 80s and that was the strength system behind the dominant American powerlifting team so lifters like Eddie Cohn Kurt kawaski lifters like Don Austin who is or Lamar Gant whose deadlift records still stand decades after they use this classic cycling so the classic cycling you start with the moderate moderately challenging load then you keep proceeding go heavier and have you have you then you compete then you start over and to give you to give you a very simple tactic that's something that your listeners can use in their training whether they follow this cycling format or they do something else is that Russian scientists discovery that your endocrine system pretty much can take two two weeks out of four of heavy loading that's just how it is there are some exceptions if you but forget exceptions generally just two weeks of heavy loading and if you look at the classic powerlifting cycles by let's say I'm at a Gallagher so for four weeks you do sets of eight four weeks of five four week sets of three and in week one you start out with the way that's comfortable in week two moderately challenging in week three you hit your repeats your previous PR for this reps and a week for use such a new PR and then you jump to the next rep count so as you see in this particular template you have two weeks two hard weeks of training out of the month and that's just one of the many ways of doing that pardon me I got distracted so I wanted to tell about the history of cycling yeah so bill Starr who was a huge name in the game he he was a former top weightlifter in the United States back in the 60s later on very successful coach strength coach and author the strongest shall survive his book on strength training for football remains one of the best strength training books and Bill Starr recalls that American lifters started getting a whiff of some Russian paradise programs so what's periodization theorization the simplest terms is planning your training according to certain principles to end it beak performance so that's just the really kind of a 50,000 level 50,000 foot definition and they did not have their full full information about how it was done so they just decided to do exactly that and that was a very successful very successful purchase strength training it does not necessarily work for everybody there are some reasons for that mostly because of your sport competition you're an athlete but it's extremely effective as was shown on the platform and finally so first we discussed step cycling step loading which is constant training second we discussed wave cycling which is just cycling right wave loading and the third one would be the variable loading and variable loading is extremely unique it's unlike something else so here's how variable loading works in variable loading you have certain load parameters like for example you will know that your average training weights will be 75% of your maximum you will know that you will perform for example 300 squats per month or whatever so these numbers are arrived at experimentally over decades and what variable loading does as opposed to the traditional methods traditional progressive overload is that the jump in volume for example from one training unit to another one day one week one month and so on it's at least twenty percent so the jumps are really high really high the variable loading was developed by Professor Arcadia para boeuf who was a Olympic weightlifting champion and he was the premier sports scientist so he argued that in nature most changes are discrete there are not gradual they're discrete so whatever whatever adapt adaptation take place in your body the same thing whatever happens with many physical process chemical processes and so on so he concluded that training has to be highly variable so you understand what I mean that it's a 20% minimal change we call that Delta xx principal it doesn't mean that's constantly going up that's just not possible it goes up and down it just keeps flashing so if we use if we go back to the traditional cycling is an example the traditional cycling so it's a linear build-up back up a little linear buildup back up a little in contrast variable overload it's it's going crazy it's comfortably insane in fact this is a little entertaining experience strength coaches and especially people with some sort of a background in mathematics they are able to dissect and analyze training plans from other coaches you can look at a plan you can take an experience powerlifting coach show him a program from another coach and the coach will be able to tell whether this will work or not who this will work for and so on and kind of figure out what figure out what's under the hood right there so there's a very clear pattern variable overload so it's like a photograph it's very clear variable overload if you start analyzing the pattern looking at the program so for example buddy's shake oh he's a he's a former coach of Russian national powerlifting to you so he took the Soviet Olympic weightlifting methodology and directly applied it to bar lifting so his plans have made their way to the west and some liquors used them very successfully but whenever he tried to read this plan and try to make any sense of that he just drives you crazy because you see like ok here was a string here's a pattern is going right here and suddenly his gun so if traditional cycling's like clear photograph the variable overload makes me think of remember in Ferris Bueller's Day Off where the kid is looking at so house painting you know we want to use there all these dots right there so when you step away you see something we start getting closer just a whole bunch of dots it just disappears so what's the story behind that so the story is this this method the Soviet Olympic weightlifting method was developed over several decades by a number of coaches by number of scientists so it's a very much collaborative effort so but IB offers one for sure in the division of channel Yakka number of others and it was a very before even that sect in this method let me tell you how how successful this method was you can look up the world weightlifting records in Olympic weightlifting you hear about all this different records set by this left her that left her and so on and so forth if you few people realize that the International weightlifting Federation has changed the weight classes at two or three times since the eighties and the reason they did that is to erase the drug the records set by the drug taking athletes back then of course you I'm very happy that as soon as they changed the weight classes lifter stop taking drugs like that so if you look at these records kilo per kilo pound per pound and if you charred them compare them to what they did then to what they do today you will find that while they did catch up in a few weight classes in about half of these classes the records from the eight is still standing so for example what you d carbanion did in 1980 at 82 kilos he totaled 400 kills in the snatch in the clean-and-jerk that's never been done before and you dick Val Bunyan was a wiry guy you wouldn't even take it for a lifter just amazing so first of all the system still remains if we would just take a very large big picture 50,000 foot look at strength there great many ways of getting strong some of them very good some Dermody ochre some very bad but historically in lifting sports the two systems that have been predominant are the Soviet weightlifting system and the American classic powerlifting system from the south and eighties okay so that was a kind of a long detour to before tell you why this stuff that they figured out back in nineteen sixty is why it matters just to say it still is the best it still rules so what they did is it was very empirical in for example when you're studying endurance going into the cell studying the biochemistry of the cell in the body taking apart figuring out how this works is very helpful very on the other hand when you're dealing with strength that approach has been not really effective so if we talk about muscle muscle training for example hypertrophy we still have no idea what the hell is going on so we can we know which buttons to push but that's just empirical knowledge that's not the understanding of the cell so we really don't understand hypertrophy and really no we do not Wow know and let's I'll be happy to talk about this but if you don't mind let me just finish on this variable overload and the Soviet weightlifting system so what they did even though they also you know they cut the muscle look at that as well just didn't learn as much but they coaches programmed particular loads for athletes and watch what happen and then they watched how the authors performed and the watch how the top athletes performed and it looked for patterns and they were very open-minded so they're not thinking like well it's got to be just the heaviest weights will do that or it's got to be the training to failure it's gonna do that it's not the case so just to give you an example of how enormous that undertaking was so typical strength training studies one six weeks for some untrained college subjects you know guys were just on their phones popular media Jeff was also world champion he studied the training loads of top weight lifters only when they were successful in competition for for Olympic cycles for so we're talking about sixteen years and then somebody else to do for another cycle and they're just an amazing patterns just emerged so for instance I'm gonna give you give you a rundown on what the patterns are there are certain optimal volumes how much exercise you do there is certain optimal intensities so if you followed the variable overload method the optimal intensity so the average intensity would be about 75 percent of your max which for most people will be probably somewhere like eight reps or something could do maybe ten maybe eight and you will see that about half of all the lifts that you do are about 75 80 percent now we're do all the rest the other lifts come in so there's a normal distribution so you'll find that 75 80 % on the top 80 85 a little bit lower you know so the lighter weights like 60% are in the bottom and they have your waist like a 90 percent and higher are in the bottom as well so the figured out you just have to do most of your work with these average weights they are not so light so you're gonna respect them but they're not so happy that you're having in question about performing lifting them correctly so and then there is another aspect of intensity is just doing some heavier lifts very a very carefully measured number of heavy lifts in addition like 90 percent or whatever occasionally then they figured out the proper volumes just to give you an idea if you're looking at let's say you know you might be doing 30 reps of given exercise per session what have you although there's variability but then there's also something else that's very interesting is the optimal number of repetitions with the given weight and this is what hurts people hurts people's heads if you look at the weights from 70 to 90% the optimal number of repetitions are one third to two thirds of your maximum so let me give an example to the reader to the listener let's say that you're lifting a 10 rep Mack wait so you go all out as hard as possible you can do ten reps in training you should be doing you should be doing three to six reps that's it that's that's the window and why is that and we have no idea but the scientists like in this case that was I think was much fear if was involved in that the father of fertilization I think it was one of the scientists they experimented with all sorts of rep ranges and they figured out that it D reps are too low really giving a weight you don't get stronger if the reps get too high either the athlete gets hurt or his technique is compromised or he's just unable to perform the optimal volume so pretty much roughly you're looking at doing about half of the reps you capable of that's it and people can argue with this all they want like what's the science behind this there's no science we don't know the science is purely empirical this particular method is purely empirical it worked for decades it still does and that's one of the ways you can get strong so in summary we have we have sorry step loading which is where you stay with the same weight for a while we're the same reps whatever and then make a sudden jump that's the best way to train for beginners usually we have wave loading or cycling which is we build up jump back and build up again and we have variable loading which is almost almost chaotic we're just constantly surprised the body with what we're throwing at it but we do that within very narrow parameters so this method was purely developed by studying winners and winners is where they finally took that but these studies were done at every level some for example coaches in the field would conduct something called agogic experiments which is which is a study that's not quite as not quite as scientifically solid but it's too good an so that first what testing is out lower level athletes and they'll finally take it to higher level athletes so the things that I'm telling you about they have been universally effective for athletes above the beginner level and of course there are some subtle changes as you progress there are some subtleties like for instance notice that I said that you have to use some heavy lifts like 90 percent 95 percent it has to be very surgical about how many so for instance beginners do none advanced lifters need to do just some but not many intermediate lifters can do the most or heavier weight lifters can do not as many lighter ones can do more so there are some differences at different levels but the principles fundamentally the same and these principles apply whether people are taking drugs or not yes they do the difference is in fact the special skill Medvedev made a very strong case very strong case of that they used the Soviet of abysm for that was restoratives and they said this is universal even with restoratives or not the difference for this for the drugs would be is just that the volumes will be higher you'll be able to train more that's pretty much the difference but the body will still work the same way now these principles have they caught on in the United States I mean they've caught on with strong first I know the UT you implement these and people teach these but is this something that's universally sort of accepted or is it still something that people are cute cautiously curious about it's definitely not universal in part because people don't know about it in part you have to implement this correctly so right now this several the several areas where you would see that is well one obviously the body circo's powerlifting programs that have been imported here by the use by power lifters mm-hmm the other is we have the program called plant-strong which is been again this is a very faithful representation of the Soviet weightlifting system but apply it to general strength exercises like you know squats deadlifts and so on and the other thing what we also do and this is what we do was with the military and so on and so forth we have some simple programs very simple programs that are designed using this Delta xx principle and using this optimal loads that they could just go out and use the nice thing is unlike progressive overload cycling if something happens you got a problem here there's some variability so in summary just say no it's not widely known it's not now in the States yeah let's fix it and it makes sense and one of the things that I really like what you're saying about is completing the adaptation with your tendons and your ligaments and all these different things that oftentimes are injured when you're ramping up your weight lifting and you're trying to increase the amount of weight you carry you so this this principle of maintaining at a similar weight for a long time allowing your body to complete that adaptation that makes a lot of sense adaptations need to be stable and it does it's not true just for strength training if you're looking at endurance as well the adaptations and the mitochondria is wealthy you can get some acute adaptation so very short-term like oh you know bigger whatever guns in six weeks or faster 400 meters or six weeks yes you can do that but these adaptations are transient so it takes time for things to really get got solidified and also if you're more patient with your progression as well you're gonna find that your gains are much more stable if you take some time off which is important for anybody you travel you get sick some other thing happens so if you've been training in a manner where you're not forcing yourself in fact this is one of the very important points in that Soviet coaches would make that do not force the temptation there David rigored riggers probably the greatest weightlifter of all times so he is over 60 World Records in several weight classes and just unbelievable athlete so he just made a point that do not force the strength development do not force mass development that's another problem you start it's possible to build muscle fast but it's not giving necessarily very quality muscle so yes take your time and and this is interesting enough Joel this is what old-timers understood I am a fan of books by old-time strongman not all of them of course but some of them are just remarkable Earl Lederman he was an American strongman an educator he wrote a book back in 1925 called the seekers of strength and it's an awesome book so you read this book and if you follow the directions in this book from 1925 you will get far superior results and for most pop fitness and strength programs because people who had some sense some common sense they were able to get observe what's going on they were not driven by some slogan oh one more rapid yeah yeah the one more rep thing is a it's very embraced here in America yeah with meatheads which are my people the the thing about it is that you think that mental toughness is going to push you past your limits or what your perceived limits are and that that's where the real strength what happens that's where the real growth takes place does have is a very valid point for for you mentally not physically mentally but periodically this is very important point you have to push the but push the body to the limit whether in competition with some other man earn but for a short period of time and not too often that's very important you know who Ronnie Coleman is right yeah yeah Ronnie Coleman who was mr. Olympia just at one point in time one of the most impressive and spectacular physiques on earth is now so injured from all of his incredible lips he was known for lifting enormous enormous amounts of weight and I mean I think when they asked him about if we do anything different I think he's had I hope I'm not wrong but I think more than 11 back surgeries over the last few years he's essentially herniated every single disc in his back and a series of back operations it's left him walked in with crutches and you know it's it's bad but this is the result of this sort of mindset of a champion you know that he was you're barred me I'm going to interrupt you for a second the champion has that mindset on the platform the champion whatever the champion is in the gym he or she is going to approach this as a as a working man pretty much this is the plan this is what I do so you will find that absolutely in in sports you have to be extremely tough and you have to model some of that in training is well but in a very very careful time matter yeah so for instance top lifters stop power lifters they max twice a year had the Nationals and at the worlds meanwhile they train hard to push themselves to do everything right but they do not try to squeeze out one extra rep he just simply will not work it does not work I remember having conversation with Andy Bolton and he is the first man to done it 2,000 pounds and just speak tiger athlete if you watch Andy pullin competition is just just unbelievable it's a thing of beauty and I just Andy was telling me how how some lifters he have seen that would just simply try to hang with others better lifters in the gym and try to repeat exactly what they do and that's what happens after that nothing good happens from that hmm you have to be tough when it's time and the gym you have to do the plan and like for example let's talk about heavy lifting just heavy singles let's say if I'm sure everybody who listens to your program has at what point of their life decided to up their benchpress by going to a maximum once a week I'm sure everybody has I have you have everybody has how how long did it last typically six weeks for beginner and an advanced lifter might tolerate two or three weeks and that's about it so for whatever reasons after that you know your nervous system starts burning out your endocrine system can keep up and that's it so for that reason before the competition you might take like a 90% single a double or something like that and if you look at the longevity of power lifters and if you look at Langella T of the weight lifters of the Soviet school it's very impressive now I'll give you one great example so well David rigored himself who was the champion around you know in the 70s so he is way he is probably pushing 70 right now you know lives in a farm works in the farm but he's Co doing great very healthy but his coach that's that's anyone more interesting story rudolf plukfelder he was probably the oldest to win the Olympics and weightlifting he was 36 and he worked in the mines in daytime and then train hard so look for that ethnically here so ethnically he's German so it one of the Germans living in the Soviet Union and eventually when the Soviet Union fell apart crooked emigrated to Germany yeah a journalist came to visit him and so here's this really spry looking guy pulling her on in the garden and the Gerald is asking pardon me sir may I speak to your dad so here's this guy who is almost 90 years old still looks about 30 years younger who still does jump squats with 90 kilos four sets of ten and this is an example so have your weights don't have the same longevity but does house more that does not have anything to do with the training system that has to do with the fact that the strain you put in your system by eating so much just not so good but these guys have longevity if you also look at the powerlifters most successful powerlifters american part lifters Eddie cone competed for if I'm not mistaken about thirty years at the highest level from a very lightweight class to much heavier one and he stayed super healthy throughout he maybe had one injury and Eddie right now yours have a after retirement is very very healthy so you will find that the mentality of saving this I have the tiger for when it matters as opposed to treating every training day as a competition that makes a big difference for performance and longevity it just battles the mindset of always do more always push harder always give your all leave everything in the gym thus this is the mindset that people have been sort of indoctrinated into sure if they think that a hard work is what really matters but hard work doesn't matter but hard work can come in a lot of different it can manifest itself differently would that approach have worked with a guy like Ronnie Coleman because he's a bodybuilder so bodybuilders obviously you're not talking about competition and sense of being able to lift a lot of weight and you're talking about just mass acquiring mass well you know the bodybuilders from the older era like Franco Columbu very sad that doctor Colombo passed recently but he was an exceptionally strong man a very healthy man he died swimming yeah was a hard issue that has nothing to do with lifting so he was very health and very strong till the end and if you look at the guys of that generation they're you know they're doing great and if you look at other bodybuilders power power lift and let's say bodybuilders who have some kind of a power bodybuilding approach these guys have been around longer as well if you look at the old-timers again Dave Draper this guy's name Oh Clarence best you know cleans bath sure okay super shredded Clarence is a friend of mine and Clarence is well let's put it this way he's not a spring chicken but he's got an absolutely spectacular physique he's still staying very strong are there reasons determined yeah what how old is no it's gotta be in the seventies right pushing 80 possibly yeah there he is yup that's Chloe's he's awesome that guy's awesome that is crazy that picture of him lifting his shirt up with this complete grandpa face and just super jacked body the guy's incredible yeah he knows how to push himself when you need to move himself yeah well he's very very intelligent that guy but old top athletes and lifters are very intelligent mmm there are some flukes but they don't last long right I see what you're saying yeah for longevity you sort of have to have that sort of intelligent approach so do you think the guy like Ronnie Coleman would have would be able to achieve the mass and the size and the the way he was built with a different strategy I can speculate I don't know but I can speculate but if you look at the muscle mass that have been achieved by heavyweight power lifters like Kirk Kowalski look up that guy Kurt Kowalski K a are W o s ki so if you see that type of development achieved by heavyweight power lifters then I don't see why not hmm and bodybuilders have their own additional techniques they still have to do their stuff for their separation and whatever it is that you do but I think there's a very good chance that you would have and if you look at the successful power like Mike O'Hearn for example that's a very strong guy he's a power bodybuilder there we go his car wash machines crossing the size of that fucking guy [Laughter] yeah he looks like a body but look at the size of his legs that has done is ridiculous yeah and that guy just would not fool around with tech whatever deck and what-have-you PEC deck yeah you say that disdainfully why don't you say it was there's a lot of people don't understand what's wrong with it you know machines are this is an interesting point of view okay there is a belief that machines are great for beginners and because you don't have to control it they say ferns isolated so on and so forth really machines have limited use for advanced lifters when they're injured or whenever they have to just really focus on something so it's possible it's possible to use a machine if you're really messed up you can find some angle but a beginner starts doing leg presses it's can totally mess up his coordination just lining up the back strengths isn't like an IVs AB strength hmm so machines are not necessarily bad so the tech deck might be okay for bodybuilders looking for more cuts or for somebody recovering from an injury knowing exactly the angle to which to push but your typical person going the gym has no business doing that none one of the things that I love about kettlebells is a it promotes functional strength it promotes the entire body moving as a unit and that seems to apply very quickly to athletics it's one of the reasons why Jitsu people have adopted kettlebell training so almost universal absolutely there are many reasons why but that's one of them yeah and non-glamorous moves like Turkish getup which is like one of the very best moves for jiu-jitsu it's just phenomenal for your stability your core and your your ability to get out from under the bottom bottom positions it's so just a phenomenal work phenomenal work out but the these principles of using the entire body and you don't with kettlebells using different parts of your body your legs your core your ab all in one one workout it's also so it's so effective timewise because you can get a spectacular work out in a very short amount of time you're correct oh maybe this is a good time to discuss the benefits of kettlebells versus let's say barbells or BOTS sure that's very good conversation that's a question ask people ask often right so I would name these as three top modalities for people yes there are some other additional things dumbbells and whatever but that usually they're secondary so what are the respective benefits of these different modalities the body weight is obviously it's accessible it's with you no matter where you go but interestingly enough the body weight requires the most coaching so you have to it's very subtle like for example if you look at developing something the gym is called the hollow position takes a lot of coaching to perform it correct even pull-up or push-up it's is a lot of work one legged squad so on and so forth so it's great in takes but it just takes more time more investment also the down side of the body weight would be you can't return your lower back effectively and you have to train your lower back to see you on you just have to and whatever you do back extensions other stuff neck bridges it's not gonna do for your back just form so body weight grade modality but with its these limitations the barbell if you just love heavy stuff it's awesome and it's just psychologically it's extremely satisfying I have a debt of let's say for some people not for all then if you're looking for it to maximize your muscle mass nobody has come up yet with anything other than the barbell so you know you start doing you know some repetition deadlifts squats so on so that's another reason but let's say you're playing football right the problem with the barbell first of all is the learning curve it takes some time to learn it correctly it's not easy to master it and it takes a lot of instruction in addition the barbel is not forgiving so let's say that one of your shoulders is jack table it's just not very forgiving because you can't you just have to adjust yourself to the bar as opposed to make the implement adjust yourself so this is where the kettle book comes in first of all the kettlebell because it moves freely it adjusts to your body to your physiology Anatomy I should say so it works it worked quite well for example mark Rifkin he is one of my top instructors he was highly successful gymnast in the past and later on he was a coach for women's part left and national team and great power lifter too so he cannot do bilateral exercise as well because of the mileage he sustained you took a very bad landing as a gymnast ruined his knee and on from there other things went bad back whatever so but he can do one arm so he cannot do two arm swings because it just messes him up hmm but he can do what I'm swing so the body compensates old differently and he can handle it so it's with the proper medical clearance it's much easier to work around problems then the offset center gravity that is tremendous thing for your back I'm sorry for your shoulder so the position is to put your shoulder in you cannot do with anything else but and you obviously you have the getup which is an amazing exercise cannot do it as well with other implements but the ballistics that's another unique benefit of the kettlebell swings and snatches exercises like that the benefits of these exercise are many so first of all ballistic loading obviously is part of sports and it's a part of life and often times it's hard to do it safely go ahead start jumping it like before somebody starts jumping correctly jumping off boxes and so on and so forth just even you know hopping across the floor it requires some coaching it requires getting some strength it requires addressing some dysfunction and so on and so forth the kettlebell swing for example it's so many hard men with high mileage who are really banged up in so many different ways their backs their knees their hips they're able to do swing safely and that's just remarkable and their ballistic contractions very important so we have to run you have to jump you have to do things like that but it goes beyond that for your health for longevity so as we grow older there's a loss of type 2 muscle muscle fibers so the strong ones the fast twitch fibers and there are several problems with that first of all they're metabolically needed for the body to be healthy to process sugar so on so on and so forth second is to deal with real-life situations you know like it's very unfortunate some old person trips and breaks a hip it's terrible and oftentimes the reasons just weakness and we need this fast fibers because whenever you trip and you have this reflexive contraction these fibers go online first so if you don't have them anymore you got massive problems right so another reason is in type ii fibers there is mitochondrial degeneration takes place is you're older much faster than others and if you don't take care of that it's also that's aging so you've got to train this type ii fibers and they're only two ways to train type ii fibers it's heavy or fast so there's no third way so whenever people try to do some sort of a super slow this or pilates that whatever it's not gonna do it so you have to train heavy we have to train fast if you want to stay young so are you completely against that kind of super slow training not at all but for totally different reasons there is well obviously one reason as possibly somebody's injured right mm-hmm another reason is to develop your type one endurance fibers hypertrophy for these fibers why would you want to do that well first of all type one fibers they downside of these fibers is they contract slower so obviously that's a downside for some sports for some activities but they're also more efficient which means it's plus for other sports right so mmm-hmm another positive here they already come pre equipped with mitochondria so mitochondria that's why aerobic metabolism takes place and by building your type one fibers you automatically get more endurance in addition to muscle mass and strength too so super slow work is good for that but it has to be done correctly the proper methods were developed by Russian professor Victor C Leonov and so he developed this method I'm gonna summarize it free right now for your free listeners that's something you can easily do yourself well easily is not the word simply so the duration of a set is 30 to 60 seconds you have to select the range of motion where there's no there is no stacking there's no there's no support from your bones at all so for example if you were to do a squat you go down below parallel but not to the point where you sitting on your calves and come up just a little above parallel and below again so just that most unpleasant the most painful area hmm if you're doing let's say push-ups for your chest for example you would almost brush the deck with your chest come up about half way and come back down and the speed is very slow so there's no momentum at all now doesn't sound like anything new but here's what's new juliana i optimize the rest periods and and that's a big dmg game-changer normally when people train in this manner bodybuilders and others they just want to get more burn possible and by the way the burnt is awful and in this particular case you want to train close to failure and in this particular case that's just a muscular training that's not strength training per se so they try to run for one set to the next so they'll do this let's say that 30 seconds said then they will just you know rest for 30 seconds duty again completely hammer themselves the problem with that is even though we do not know the exact mechanisms of muscle growth we do know that some lactic acid is needed but too much like the Cassidy's destructor so what see Leonov did is he figured out is after this kind of set you have to rest for five to ten minutes and that sounds for people it's it's very hard mental thing to do so here I am going for this massive burn and I have to wait for five to ten missed but it's very simple you introduce another exercise in between so train twice a week five to five to ten sets on the heavy day eventually once you build up to it and about one to three sets in the Y day that's it now this is incorporating super slow technique yeah and who would this be good for wrestlers mmm for wrestlers is spectacular yeah because even though there are explosive elements there as well but it's also very much there's that static element static endurance and one of my strong first - one of my strong first certified instructors Roger from the UK he I had him follow this protocol before he and his crew rode across the Atlantic and he did much better off than most people and was much happier if you can be happier rollin across the Atlantic so for rowing for wrestling for bodybuilding for some people who cannot do anything else so that's a good protocol so this is essentially a muscular endurance protocol you know what is both because because the muscles getting bigger right and it will get stronger but it won't be faster it's not something you wouldn't know great with a boxer I wouldn't know absolutely not no definitely not wrestler yes MMA you just have to use your judgement there be certain things on your style yeah now this is it's so interesting hearing this big long break in between exercises because it makes sense it makes sense you would want the muscles to be fully recovered because then they'd be able to do more work but that's so counterintuitive to what everybody promotes every you go to a coach you get a you get a you know a personal trainer or something like that they they just want to burn everybody out that's all come on let's go let's go next exercise let's go let's go let's go let's go that's about feeling yeah that's not that's about feeling and that's about time management possibly and there are other ways no and there are other ways to save time there are other ways of doing that depending on your circumstances you can definitely find ways of doing that but you can fill in the time with other things you know let's say you're doing this hypertrophy protocol and by the way that's been used extensively by Russian national judo and Sambo teams so you're doing some rows and the belt you know the guys holding you up then you walk around for a minute you do the push-ups then you walk around you do something else so you're making good use of the time you're just not revisiting the same exercise so instead of taking ten minutes in between any workout at all you would take just a couple minutes you're in between and then do like push-ups and then do something that's non related to that so think of it as a slow circuit mmm yeah okay slow circuit but then you'd go back to whatever it was that you were initially doing ten minutes later correct yeah so those muscles are recovered but physiologically you're still getting this constant state of exercise or at least fairly constant with some you with the lowest amount of break in between an exercise you recommend that would be that's the guidelines Eliana's guidelines about five minutes if they arrest is active for the same access I'm talking about so active rest means you're moving you're not just sitting jumprope maybe not necessarily this would be probably just walking around maybe could do some super easy shot of boxing or something or like footwork or some but I mean extremely extremely easy so that facilitates the circulation okay yeah just just do that and it'll pass if it's longer that's wow it's again so counterintuitive to what most people call like particularly something like CrossFit right CrossFit is all about massive reps and doing the most that you possibly can and you know switching from one thing quickly to another thing how do you feel about that so how about we take one minute I'll get myself another tee and I'll address that I'm good yeah choice it's good question man very good question excellent questions oh thank you another do you know how to do it no no idea all right Jamie will do it for you right now it's all you I have a cup here I think he's gonna get you another cup it whether you like it or not this is not in the in the shot is it it doesn't matter okay to me in the shot that this all this uh this stuff is so it's so interesting because it's so obviously I mean make sense but it's just not the method that anyone thank you look at the top coaches if you look at top athletes who don't necessarily advertise what they're doing that's not that's not the case so it's more common now is getting there yeah oh sorry this let me let me do this let me dump this in there are you a tea fanatic no I'm just a warm liquid fanatic my best my favorite my favorite worm liquidus Canetti no Italians make it it's like zest from lemon and you boil it stuff is good yeah yeah do you drink caffeine yeah yeah occasionally no no twice a day but just a very small alone don't want to be running running your own buzzing yeah that's what I like about it you like buzzing yeah I'm good man keep buzzing so tell me about CrossFit so CrossFit was it what is your question about CrossFit exactly the methods that they use this the sort of competition with Olympic style lifts doing it to maximum reps doing it for speed do you think that's a recipe for injury or do you think it's a good modality if pursued correctly I'm going to start by saying that I like the fact that CrossFit gets people out guess people training they have a great community people are very motivated I like the fact that they understand the concept of general physical preparation which means you have to train multiple different qualities I would not go about it the way they do it and let me explain to you why so let's talk about endurance so there are different aspects to endurance and so there's cardio and there is the local the peripheral endurance in the muscles muscular endurance so first two let's discuss how do we develop cardio let's discuss how we develop endurance in the muscle the best the healthiest way to develop your cardio is just steady-state exercise like running in a particular particular speed that's not too fast that's very simple that's so that's way to develop cardio for most people it is for most people it is and so here's what's happening what's happening is the heart is stretching when you increase your heart rate up to a certain point the heart starts stretching more and it stretches more and more so that increases the stroke volume so pretty much you get a bigger heart and that's good that works up to not quite 90 percent of heart rate when you start redlining your heart rate when you start getting to 90 percent and higher the heart does not have time to relax fully so it really pretty much is twitching so you're no longer really stretching that hard so you want to be training at the metabolic intensity that's much lower something we're getting pretty much sustained a conversation so like say you're running and talking to your body that's what you want to stay to develop endurance that what to develop to stretch your heart that's the basic method so that's one method hmm so the second method is interval training so and the interval training for the heart was developed by Germans decades ago and these guidelines still stand so here's what they figured out they figured out that you're well we know that this various systems and you body have inertia so for instance note is that when you're running hard and you stopped your heart still beating hard and then maybe ten seconds after there's a sudden drop right there sir is that inertia so the Germans figured out if you get your heart rate up to about eighty five ninety percent which is it's hard but it's still not maximal and then you switch to walking or jogging so the heart is still beating and so as this extra volume of blood is moving in the stretches the heart so it works really well so you can use the intro method as well but it's it was found it's used best after after a period of steady state training it's very demanding on the body and it's not it's just it's too easy to have problems with the heart if you start using it prematurely then there's also such a thing as high heart rate under heavy loads so in this particular case we're talking about dynamic exercises so as dynamic exercise running bicycling skiing even light kettlebell swings that's dynamic exercise when you start doing static exercises let's say you're trying to do squats heavy squats for you know to get your cardio so to say that's not the best idea because that interferes with the blood flow that did something called after load versus preload the heart gets thicker instead of the heart gets you know get stretched and bigger so it's not the optimal way to train the heart you can again this simple way you can use dynamic exercise in interval type training or repeat training in this case to train your heart is to do an exercise that's dynamic in nature to raise your heart rate to about let's say 8090 percent which would be 8090 percent it would be where you can say maybe a couple words you know you're not you're not dying yet you can still answer a question and then you just walk around and you do it again so that's a simple way of how much time walking around that depends that totally depends on who you are to bend some master how fast your you know heart rate drops back down and what do you wanna like is there a number you want to keep it in the 140s the 150s is dependent upon your age okay in this particular case you would do you would drop it down the original guidelines were done for young people those hundred twenty hundred thirty beats so you're talking about sixty sixty-five percent and pretty much if you are just looking at being able to pass the talk test which means you can talk you know short sentences hmm I can speak in a short something like that right so for example you do a set of ten swings really powerful with a kettle bell walk around a little bit when you feel that you can speak again you do it again do it again so that's a simple way of doing that but the heart is only a very small part of endurance so we definitely need to do some cardio for health and athletes definitely need to do for their performance but what we really need to focus on is you need mitochondria so mitochondria in the in the muscle cell so that's where energy is being converted to aerobic Li which means efficiently so if you look at the way your muscle uses energy so you will get this energy with food converted it goes down eventually the final currency so to say is something called ATP but it's only you know you only have it for a few seconds so it has to be reloaded so we have three main energy systems so have the creating a phosphate system it's very powerful but it's only can do you know go for just some seconds and it's clean burning we have high aerobic system that's not powerful at all but it's longer-lasting and we have the glycolytic system that's kind of in between that dumps a lot of acid and other fatigue metabolites in there so what we want to do as we want to develop this mitochondria in our muscles it's easy to do in slow fibers and it's a little more involved in fast fibers I'll tell you how we can do that but it can be done so what we're looking for instead of trying to trash the muscle with acid we are trying to train in a way that to produce less acid and then only before the competition right before the competition couple weeks out you do a couple of kind of a smokers like that to get yourself used to that that's thing so the way we develop mitochondria which means make your muscle oxidative make your muscle enduring and not polluting in slow fiber is it's simply moving right below anaerobic threshold so anaerobic threshold it's that intensity at which you you know acid is accumulating just up to a certain point it stays at that steady state and you can keep disposing of that for a while for quite a while as soon as you go above it very rapidly you crash so running right below that aerobic threshold is the primary training method for endurance athletes and how do you know that you ran the threshold when you fail in the TOC test that's a simple way to do that and it's very interesting that endurance athletes even though who are not necessarily well-educated they kind of tend to grab it taste or that intensity and so what happens is we are producing just small amounts of acid and the body finally is able to you know produce less and less so that's how we train our robic I'm sorry that's how we train mitochondria in slow fibers for fast fibers it's become something more interesting so the conditions the conditions for making the mitochondria be able to handle more traffic without producing as much acid is push them just to the edge of acidosis just just to the edge and do it over and over and over so professor Becker sanski back in the 80s figure out that that's a guy who invented plyometrics and so on so he figured out so here's what we do imagine that you are sprinting as he's sprinting for five seven seconds and then you are just walking and you're sprinting again and you're just walking but you're doing that you're measuring your blood lactate and it still keeps below the threshold and you sustain that for let's say 40 minutes so think of this for a second so you're sprinting very intensely but you stop before you start burning you get to the point of just light muscular fatigue and you do it over and over and over so if we talk about the coaching terminology its repeat training versus interval training so what is interval training partners you'll have to take a step to the side so the three types of rest periods between your sets while you're running lifting whatever so there's a stress period that means that you will have a harder time to do the same thing or you will not be able to repeat it right that's interval training there is the super compensation period which means if you wait extra long time you'll perform even better like for example if you do a set of pull-ups wait for 15 minutes you might be able to do more 15 minutes later and there is the ordinary period which is that you be able to repeat it over an hour so that's in coaching speakers called repeat training repeat verses interval so we're trying to sustain that same level of performance for 40 minutes let's say so that's an example of how we develop mitochondria fast which fibers and the same thing we can do with kettlebell swings the same thing you can do work in a heavy bag and so on and so forth now CrossFit let's see it's a circle back around to that what do they do that you feel you said there's a lot of good things they do they get people moving they introduce people to all these different exercise routines what do you think they do wrong Joe I don't want to pick on CrossFit this so called metabolic conditioning has been around since 1975 at least when Arthur Jones coined that term you know the guy from Nautilus mm-hmm that's when he would people go through a circuit of machines going you know going one after the next and I'm sure it's been around even before that I would just do things totally different so there is no point in there's no point in me trying to criticize criticize a different system I'm just telling you this is what the science says experience says is how you should be doing it mm-hmm and I think that there are a lot of great people in CrossFit and I just wish you know power to them you would just do it the what like what you're talking about with longer rest periods different sort of training approach and okay let's say that you're training for the CrossFit Games okay I'd say that you're going right what you would do is name some CrossFit exercise let's say wall ball okay let's have the throw the ball against the wall good exercise you do this thing with this wall ball for 40 minutes like I told you and you can incorporate a second exercise in between Dustin between stick it in there so let's say you do a wall ball you throw this a few times walk around you do a set of push-ups let's say 5 to 10 reps and you do this for 40 minutes why 40 minutes it doesn't always have to do 40 minutes but pretty much we know if you can sustain it for 40 minutes it's not gonna be overly glycolytic so we just kind of know that I'll give you another example let's say burpees right you can do a burpee but time it in a way that you can keep doing burpees for 40 minutes so you do a wrap walk around do a wrap walk around or even break it up so you do these different across fit specific competition specific exercises in this particular manner where you're able to sustain it again for 40 minutes then pardon me closer to the competition you start doing what in track is called peaking so when you're running let's say 400 meters or 800 meters athletes when they train in the offseason the Train largely aerobic ly even though their distances are shorter they're still not trying to trash themselves but we do know that even if you develop your mitochondria if you do it correctly and suddenly you throw yourself in an acid bath your body is gonna be unpleasantly surprised so what you need to do is you need to model that so what's going to happen is a couple of weeks before the competition once a week you were pretty much is like a something similar to the competition like a water whatever and this will accomplish several things one is it will up regulate your buffers so your body produces baking soda pretty much to cancel out the acid and it's a very rapid adaptation it's very easy to get just two weeks you got it and in addition you also up regulates your glycolytic enzymes which you also want for competition and again they're very quick to develop very quick to lose as well so finally there is such a thing as heart and respiration rate modelling so which pretty much means that you're gonna be sucking win and if you're not used to sucking wind it's not gonna feel good your diaphragm is gonna spasm and not so good so the purpose of peaking is to get yourself in kind of a simulated competition situation where the acid is high enough to make your body adapt to it which adapts fast and to make yourself comparable with Horry high heart rates and breathing so that's that's the summary that's pretty much how track athletes train for middle-distance what do you do now account first of all how old do you 20 you look great thank you thank you great haircut - thank you yeah I like it how old you really I'm working on being twenty Joe going back yeah I'm 52 are you older than me I'm working out we're both working good how about you stick with that I don't want to be judged based on my age I understand how often you train these days often do I train almost every day almost every day just doing something differently yeah doing something mostly kettlebells or mostly for the last several years with I suppose less several month we're kind of experimental doing something else but for the last several years pretty much has been nothing but swings and and dips just one of my protocols it's a very particular anti glycolytic protocol and i glycolytic means well the kind of thing we just discussed it just swings in dips yeah why why that combination trying to be minimalist pretty much and trying to cover as much base as possible also trying to do things that my body likes but the swings are I would argue that the swing is the most beneficial exercise anybody can do because you will again your training power your training your fast fibers you're developing mitochondria in the fast fibers you are training your connective tissues and you know you're getting your cardio as well it's not you know it's not focused on that but you have that side effect the dip is you know kind of coverage what's been missing I like the idea of very minimus general strength protocols that just have pretty much a hip hinge and and the press that's that's a preference without chin-ups or things along those lines sure is great I'll do him sometime but you will find to your surprise that if you do swings powerfully and if you do dips or push-ups powerfully chances are you're not going to lose your chance really chances are for most people so here's something to keep in mind what is general training versus specific training so in Russian sports science there is a concept of general training versus special training special means sports specific pretty much so the general straight general training can be strength can be something else gives you foundation for everything else and it's characterized by high degree of carryover so for example if you decide to do barbell squats you know for a fact that you're going to hire you gonna run fast you're gonna hit order and so on and so forth if you decide to go leg extensions you can be sure that you're gonna get better at leg extensions that's it so general exercises are the ones that are fairly simple to perform and give you to give you the greatest possible carryover so that's what you do and then after that you start editing you more specific stuff so let's say that you know you would increase the number of chin-ups you want to do what you got to do chips so that's a specific practice absolutely so Jennifer great one of the things that I noticed that I thought was really weird was when I started doing kettlebells things that I wasn't doing I got stronger at yeah like I wasn't doing dips for a long time like I didn't do them for months and months and I was just doing kettlebells I was just doing cleans and presses snatches swings a bunch of different squat protocols overhead squats my dip went through the roof but it was so strange it was like we call this the what the hell effect so that type of carryover some of it we can understand some words we can explain some which we can't but yeah we've had the kettlebell swing for example increase the performance of world champion power lifters and top marathon runners at the same time it's a very bizarre thing and again someone we talk and decipher some with second but hey we'll take it right what do you think is going on there if you had a guess cuz okay so it's a number of different things one is the type of the type of breathing patterns that we use for example for endurance that for that helps strength and endurance so we use this pressurized breathing that increases your strength on exhalation so that pretty much increases your strengths at any kind of exertion whether it's punching or lifting and at the same time we are also training our muscles that inspiration muscles inhalation muscles as well and so developing developing these muscles is really important for your performance so that's just one of the aspects in other aspects is the well this is kind of interesting mr. Haney was a coach for Danny Thompson Donnie Thompson is he broke the 3000 pound total record in in powerlifting some years back so I'd known the Donnie for some time so Donnie kept hurting his back and his deadlift was stuck so we met I showed her some kettlebell stuff he started doing that invented a couple of cool things of his own as well so nine months later he added about 70 pounds to deadlift 100 pounds to his benchpress said the total record and what's what his coach said interesting he said kettlebells work the muscles without killing them it's kind of interesting so it appears to be that the particular stimulus that you have it's there's always a positive and there's always a negative when you're training right so there's something good that's happening it's also something that's holding you back you have to recover so it seems to be that nature of whatever things that happens within the muscle is positive more than negative and I think part of it is very well those ballistic loading the body adapted extremely extremely well part of it has to do the particular training protocols we have because we produced the right amount of acid but not too much acid a lot of trainees in the kind of a puffed fitness world they're just enamored with burn like oh go for the burn yeah Fred Hatfield dr. Fred hatch will have a great line so Hadfield was the first lifter to squat a thousand pounds in competition and he was just a brilliant sports scientist brilliant coach he said do you like burn light a match yes people are just enamored with the burn so again the loading protocols we have his sights that you have the right amount of that of that stimulation not excessive because what happens you have too much like the Cassatt right is here's what happens well many many things happen we don't have the time to discuss this on the show but most of them are really rather than negative some positive Muslim red the negative but for sure they do make em work it makes you more sore for sure people like to say well soreness is just caused by eccentric loading and that's it has nothing do lactic acid well eccentric loading does contribute to that absolutely but acid does as well he doesn't literally burn holes in your muscle but it does stimulate lysosomes something kind of eats up defective components of the cell to function and you also have the spike of free radicals and so that free radicals damage cell membranes as well so with what we do we try to and plus there's other stuff happens like but it starts producing ammonia which is toxic and depletes your ATP so all this things start going there's really sideways so I think the nature of what you do with kettlebells a special fuse the correct protocol is you just optimize this metabolic metabolic environment to get exactly what you want but there are some other things too like in your case were pressing and for dips I challenge anybody to find a pressing exercise that's by mechanically more perfect for the shoulder than the kettle of millet repress it's perfect range of motions perfect great stretch great contraction great just absolutely perfect so some were to get some we don't but hey what the hell effects we'll take it right so what do you spend your time doing these days do you spend your time teaching seminars coaching people like writing books what do you what's the all of the above so I I am staying I'm working on I teach on special events for a strong first which is my company the school of strength so I teach seminars like strong endorses I can win and so on I write books and I do some consulting but what I really am trying to do is I'm trying to build strong first you know this school of strength my vision is that more people want to become stronger and strength will become cool strength will become important and I'd like to see that across the decades really doing strength school now among a small portion of the population do you think that can actually change I hope so I don't know I hope so why would it change well we're working at it maybe you'll do something about it who knows but you know a friend of mine said something interesting well friend John he said today you have this very small among young people a very small fraction of the population this is super tough guys for it is competing MMA and so on these Daredevils doing extreme sports is so on and you have the huge majority or just sitting doing this or they go and do their little Pilates thing or whatever they do their little interval session and I just think the society at large needs more just just regular tough guys you know like the old farmer or somebody like that and I think that that needs to be more broad and people need to understand that that I hate this word Fitness I just hate that because it counters up images of just all sorts of weird equipment and weird exercises and foam rollers and all that stuff you know you don't like foam rollers it's not that I don't like foam rollers it's a tool just like everything else right here's a problem a guy comes in he spends 45 minutes on some fancy he calls a movement problem the hell's movement prep and he's sitting around you know rolling his butt in the foam roller and then he does some other weird voodoo and you know if he's injured and if he got a prescription from his physical therapist or doctor power to everybody but if not and then finally is gonna spend ten minutes doing some doing some little nonsense get his heart rate up and between sets is gonna be updating his profile or whatever so the former all you've got a it's got a place I'm even gonna tell you like even doing any of the corrective work something that you need to do you should even separate it from your training like don't dishonor the lifting prop platform by throwing a foam roller on it just do somewhere else it really yeah don't dishonor don't I thought it was just a natural thing to sort of work the kinks up fine go work him out just do somewhere else just don't do it by the platform man and don't ever step over a barbell that's the most disrespectful thing you can do really absolutely you can't step over a bar bono in Russia get beaten up and thrown out of the gym JB you absolutely that seems excessive you gotta respect your van no you do and stepping over a barbells disrespect disrespect you have to go around it of course of course yes how do I not know this well now you do I'd uh I'm trying to think what I do I'm sure I've stepped over barbells it will get even nobody ever taught me that barbell get you yeah really oh okay I didn't know when you see gyms you know well we see gyms like mine that have all this equipment all these different things do you look at that as like that's excessive or unnecessary enjoy that depends the old defense in the circumstances we're talking about CrossFit generally like we talking about CrossFit CrossFit early I think CrossFit gyms I love CrossFit gyms I mean they have a few things I think are not necessary but not so many but they have a lot of great stuff hi pull-up bars and platforms and so on and so forth those are essentials but then beyond that is just whatever you add for yourself and without knowing your training needs your bag your honor I don't truly I can't evaluate your gym right but I can tell you that most people have too much stuff and that becomes a problem choices so you come any of this and this and that so what are you gonna do bra you're just confused because it's called the paradox of choice or some like that yes yes now what about injuries how often do you get injured from this kind of exercise see I've had a number injures in my life older contact injuries like you know fractures and things like that and they're not from they're not from lifting from lifting things were all tweaks all of them were tweaks mmm but you know tearing ligaments by falling and things like that no so you've never had issues with tendonitis or a pedal the some of that some of that doing training pull-ups Javian things like this happen what do you do to combat that that's exactly what I got mine from sure yeah well first of all provide it in the absence of medical restrictions you just work around things so you find things to do that work the area without aggravating it that's does you know this kind of the age-old prescription for what you want to do and but I'm telling you that a lot of things we do are allowing a lot of people to get back in the game people have been really injured before and I can tell you that the techniques we use a strong first gettable techniques and some other techniques we have supporters amongst top healthcare professionals people like Professor Stewart McGill who is uh top spine by mechanists in the world and who works with the elite of the elite of athletes and also the most broken down people Greg cook who's a top physical therapist people like that so we have a very good track record of keeping people healthy I like this old expression from George the Russian line Hackenschmidt strength cannot be divorced from health I think that's a great line that's a great line yeah that's a great line I specifically have something with my bicep tendon I think I got it from two things I got it from training doing a lot of chin-ups but also from archery because in archery you're extending as you're drawing back at the same time and this particular muscle gets overworked because well have dr. mark Chang I know you know doc check you out yeah yeah yeah I'll talk to him um what about your diet I'm an enemy of nutrition I didn't know anything about I don't like it's such a confusing thing I'm telling you in training it's really kind of funny about training in training like I do my thing you do your a thing he does here thing but we kind of it's cool right right in nutrition is like it's the only way right and there are so many different variables that it's very hard to keep track of ins so I just feel sorry for people in that field I really it's enough you have to constantly be reading papers you have to constantly be studying and it's still hopeless yes it's just really hopeless it's such a you know the body is a complex system but I think this particular this particular silo is worse than others you're just so nonlinear and it's just so difficult to figure this out biological variability is so confusing to with one person the diet would be optimal the other person it would be terrible you know I think what we should do is focus whether it's in diet or in training we should try to focus on things that are more universal so for example in terms of longevity dr. Nick Lane who is a mitochondrial researcher he made a very interesting point he said right now phalangeal t so many efforts are directed at the genetic engineering manipulation whatever fooling around trying to make this really really customized and he said you know what's really interesting why don't we try to focus on something that's been known to work not just for any individual works for practice every species which is mitochondrial health and he says that if we find a way of extending though I've spent 130 years old he's pretty sure it's gonna come from mitochondrial health and the stimuli for mitochondrial health are pretty much well known well there may be some more down the road but now we do know so for example in terms of nutrition that's that's fasting in terms of exercise it is both I robic steady-state exercise and that type of work for fast fibers that I told you about anti glycolytic training and [Music] there's cold so those are the stimuli the primary stimuli for the mitochondria so probably for nutrition the same thing they should look for more things that work for everybody and then and kind of on the margins try to fool around with customization what about you personally what kind of diet you fall back some years ago I met a very interesting gent or a half Meckler and he introduced me to his so-called warrior diet and I was not interested in any kind of a diet any kind of a body cam changes I'm just not into that kind of thing but what I tracked him is efficiency he said to eat once a day and I thought sure I'll try and this was long before the current intermittent fasting craze has begun so I don't think or he's getting quite the credit he deserves so I pretty much as he had a large dinner and don't worry about it do you snack it all during the day anything nothing it kills me bad really yeah and this has always been the case you know snack who kills you or it's good old yes no since I started this this way of eating so your body's acclimated to this one large meal it did it did and I just feel great when I do that you gotta slam a lot of calories down on one wheel though right yeah what do you eat steak mostly of course no chicken just say no to chicken say no to chickens I know why what's wrong with chicken I just lame I don't like it what do you like about the taste or what it stands for it's a weak burger so it is a weak bird yeah can't even fly just just just say no to chicken really yeah Wow what up what about fish well my wife makes me all you didn't not not out of choice but mostly meat yeah but you understand what I'm telling is just personal choices and of course not fashionable recommendations I understand totally out of my house but what about vegetables yeah vegetables just kind of a necessary evil you I do eat them what's necessary about them you know this is an interesting point same dock Nick Lane did some research and summarized some other research like why our fruit and vegetables good for you and the party line is the antioxidants and they almost convincingly concluded that's not the case because if you just try to isolate antioxidants just give it to people they don't have the same effect so the current theory is quite you know and it's very likely it's true is the plant toxins pretty much foremost hormesis hormesis pretty much resistance against stuff so it's pretty much mild doses of poison that you take to make yourself stronger so that's most likely what these things are good for but anytime you hear about antioxidants this antioxidants that it's unless are prescribed by dr. to particular patients a patient antioxidant supplementation might even cost cancer so there's no reason that yeah that's just not something to shotgun or go to the pharmacy buy all this stuff no you should know exactly what you're taking them for and should be a that should be you should gather recommendation prescription from your doctor that is correct have you ever do you know anybody that follows a carnivore diet what's the cargo died carnivore diets very recent but in the last few years people are eating only animal products okay and the great benefit that some people have had is people with autoimmune issues like skin conditions eczema things along those lines it seems to cure it up people with severe arthritis it's I mean by cutting out all plant foods completely some people with autoimmune issues have found great results some people found great results with depression but it's extremely controversial and you know it's also ideologically troubling for some people some people don't want you to eat meat at all so if you're eating only meat this is terrible you're sending a bad message okay which sounds like a fun diet man sounds awesome but I'm completely unqualified to comment on right it would you would be interested in trying it would I be interested in trying it I when I see some more research in that I might not that I'm a fan of vegetables or anything so I'm you know I would consider it you say vegetables with disdain you say vegetables like understand it's a necessary evil you understand certain things it's like your foam roller Joe but you know you just do it it's not you don't enjoy it that thing next to you the Tim Tam that's what I use instead of a phone roller that jackhammer right underneath the tripod and go that's uh that was invented by MMA coach for Asami okay cool more effective so that's better than a quick to better than vegetables I don't know a better than foam roller I think so but but that's what I'm saying like for a guy like you that talks about vegetables with such disdain I would think but it's a necessary evil this is the thing I'm based on the current not involved the docs will tell you all this stuff about fiber and this and that that's supposedly good and again that's that's not my specialty but this other point about hormesis which is again building up your resistance yes resilience to things so it's very possible vegetables are evil and the small doses of this evil make us stronger doses well well tiny like a quarter of your plate yeah well should be more probably probably it's just a funny subject with you you have an interesting right oh yeah I'm an enemy of nutrition I hate it i I just really hate it I have a sympathy deep sympathy for people who are in that line of work now do you supplement with multi vitamins or creatine or anything no I don't and you know creatine is definitely supplementation it's not my specialty either but I can tell you Korean is one of those supplements that definitely has been tested extensively and while not for everybody it does work yes it's also build a lot of people it's also been proven as a nootropic which i think it's fascinating so it's very much enhances cognitive performance again out of my I don't have cognitive performance so you don't have any I don't know not not my thing so what about vitamins you take any vitamin no there's there's there's no evidence and again if if you would get a prescription from your doctor you're shorting this mmm-hmm then you should this is essentially not your wheelhouse absolutely not what about sleep I'm a big fan how much do you get I get a lot more than most most people would I try to get nine hours oh greats that's I am convinced I'm convinced based on the research that I've seen that it's that is very important yeah I'm convinced that as well yeah I find a big difference in my performance both mental and physical when I have a lot of sleep but what disturbs me that we had this guy on dr. Matthew Walker who studies sleep extensively and you know he's a sleep expert there's a direct correlation between a bunch of diseases and people not getting sleep heart attacks you know their heart attacks jump up some number of worldwide something in the neighborhood of 20 plus when they do daylight savings time when people lose an hour that's the most idiotic idea that's it I hope it goes away - I was just in Arizona and one of the things first things I said to them on stage I was like I'm so happy that you guys don't follow this stupid shit it's so dumb like okay we jump forward we move back we do this we do oh it's very cute yeah the time is the time if it's dark out early then it's dark out early why is it so troubling for people and I think I've read somewhere that messes up the cows did they start milking the cows at an hour later earlier the cows are all unhappy and everybody's what have you well it increases heart attacks something in the neighborhood 20 plus percent and then when you gain an hour sleep there's a subsequent decrease in heart rate in heart attacks rather that's very similar as well somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% well the point I think is this that we're all very busy there's a lot of stuff going on everybody has limited bandwidth but trying to save on sleep that's not the right place yeah and I completely agree now what about do you do anything to recover like cryotherapy or any of those things ice baths right now no because it's just not logistically not very convenient but yeah I used to cut a hole in the ice and good opinion there when I lived in cold places and have done things like that Russia has a long history of a practice called tempering and that goes back I don't know centuries which is pretty much cold exposure they figured out that does promote your nonspecific resistance to a lot of things colds and so on and so forth and more recent studies they found out that pretty much increases your resistance also so free radical damage and so on a way so cold is really good definitely is really good if you have a chance to do that other things that are very good if they're used correctly is hypoxia hypercapnia I'm pretty much breathing less but doing in the correct manner but there is something that you need to keep in mind when you start getting a really fancy and all these different recovery modalities so these differ supplements and massages and whatever whatever that was also I believe professor vorobyev who made a point of that that accelerating the recovery first of all accelerating the rate of adaptation is just just not normal and again is gonna be less stable and second that just makes your body less able to handle by itself mmm spoiling yourself with it I think so again not my specialty but I think it should be used judiciously and I also think that too many people are studying to get into the fancy cars era P this or fancy supplement or machine that before they've just taken care of basics hmm so what are the basics if yours let's say that you are okay for an athlete or for a normal person so what are the basics for health for a normal person obviously we discussed earlier you want to have type 2 fibers and mitochondria and then when you're older so that means you've got to lift have you're fast there's no other way there's no third way and you just have to find the exercises that your body can tolerate the next thing is obviously have to do something for your heart it's not in that much so whatever lame government guidelines are out there usually that will suffice for that then today we know about sleep obviously and today we also know about other ways of promoting this overall resilience and again cold things like cold things like things like vegetables but strengths for that for the athlete so I guess if you get your if you get your diet all you're eating and again what is the correct eating I have no clue but I tell you what there is probably a couple things that most experts would agree on they'll probably tell you lay off the sugar and eat some green vegetables whatever probably everybody except for those carnival guys will agree on that so get your nutrition dialed in get your sleep doubt then then get strong so I named organization strong first because that's the primary quality so professor matt wave he made a point that that's the mother of all qualities upon the foundation of strengths you build endurance you build speed evil power you build resilience everything so get strong have your joint mobility in order have some amounts of endurance the minimum if you deserve it for health again those government guidelines are enough more if your sport requires that then get great coaching and then when you're almost a contender and then you can start fooling around with all the you know additional stuff on the periphery and those things are really personal they're really expensive second of all some of these modalities but second of all you know you might get some a microscopic fraction of a percent of improvement to your performance and if you're training for the Olympics it's absolutely worth it but if you're not you gotta consider the point of diminishing returns so like what are you doing with your life what are you spending your time on and the point of diminishing returns happens and everything so it's again if you just want to be healthy you don't want to hammer win just one thing like whoa I just want to build up my deadlift to its highest level or I just want to run the fastest 5k you train your deadlift you do some running you eat healthy maybe you add some cold exposure maybe you had some hypoxia maybe eat your vegetables you know so adding each successive thing you get to the point of diminishing returns but if you decide to be a specialist you still have to do this general work what about sauna great use it mmm sauna is grateful a lot of different reasons right now normally they just talk about things like micro circulation which is all good heat shock proteins which is all very good but there's also something else there is a very interesting phenomenon that it's called our mad what does it stand for something about acute react a relaxation reaction to stress I don't recall the acronym exactly how it goes but hypothermia and hyperthermia he as amongst of the stimulus hypoxia as well that allows you to develop reaction in your body that didn't response to stress you're gonna be more relaxed so this is kind of an interesting thing so it's definitely healthy thing definitely well listen man we've taken up a lot of your time and I appreciate you very much and I appreciate all the work you've done and like I said I've been a big fan for a long time but I think someone wants to find a gym that follows your protocols where's-where's the best way go too strong first calm first is spelled out and we do have a director of accredited gyms in the US and elsewhere and also our certified instructors as well and your most recent book my most recent book is the quick and the dead total training for the advanced minimalist but that is for the advanced minimalist so I presume that's not for the majority of of listeners so I also bought the same time came out with an updated edition of my kettlebells simple and sinister and that I believe firmly believe is the book for most people to most people whether it's grandma Betty or Ranger Joe that to train on to get started on all right beautiful well thank you very much thank you sir thank you all right bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
