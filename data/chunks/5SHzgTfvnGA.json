hello freak bitches you know I did my first marathon in 2002 so I've been doing this for whatever 14 years multiple marathons every year back-to-back sometimes my body is not a hundred percent so I can push I have a high pain tolerance but eventually it adds up and so it's pain for me is this joint pain knees everything is it just the whole body its waist down hips knees ankles feet and how long does it take you to recover like you were telling me that your legs were swollen twice the size of normal yeah last year last year was way worse this year I had I've put in a bunch of miles leading up I was running about a half a marathon a day so my body was is pretty fit and pretty used to it so my recovery was much shorter I mean I and again people aren't gonna understand this but the next the day after I run a hundred and two I ran 13 miles and that was just because when I run the big foot 200 I'm gonna have to be able to come back after you know multiple days of being hurt and banged up and that's the name of the game you know to cover 200 miles in a couple days like I want to I'm not gonna be a hundred percent so I thought well I can't I can't know what it feels like to run after I run a hundred miles unless one I run a hundred miles and two I run the day after so you can't simulate that there's no way to simulate that so you ran 13 miles that day after you run 102 miles and what the fuck is that like it'd be using the running term loosely it was painful slow I was hiking the up hills running would be like it would I probably looked like a nine year old man trying to run it frickin hurt and would I get it are you legs totally swollen were you doing this yeah mm-hmm yeah my my ankles are all swollen and calves don't really have an ankle so same size from my foot up and I mean it's not good for me I mean it's not in anybody who talks about doing hundreds hundreds aren't good for probably anybody so it's it's yeah I know that what I do isn't in the best interest of my body but it's just the name of the game just what I do this cock Jamie pulled up the fuckin definition is this how dare you a damask elated millennial liberal male who often speaks of white privilege and modern feminism blames white men for all of the world's problems hmm the new definition unlike me Jeff I like this though there goes chat again with the megaphone telling everyone that he's a vegan what a kook okay I like that I like that a lot but look up cock hold but cock hold is different it's a different short for cock Servet 'iv what fuckin the word cock is most commonly used on Twitter to describe anti white males while it was originally formed with the original meaning of cuck cuck hold the use of the word cock does not necessarily denote a sexual connotation wow it's morphing the language is evolving before ours cocks do not care about Islamic countries throwing gays off buildings or hanging them as much as the cake baker who is Christian and weren't served gay wedding customers oh that's interesting tux give a free pass to anyone who criticizes them for fear of looking racist or homophobic well so that lady in Germany is a cock the word originated from white nationalist vocabulary but it's still widely used by all okay but that huh so but they took puck hold and turned it into this new thing go - but what does cut the definition for cock hold so this has nothing to do with guys wives getting banged like it's still real to me damn it no dictionary from Old English Oh means a man his wife is unfaithful yeah cuckold which is yeah yeah to make a cuckold of so if you okay that's a that's how Norton I think described it to me like a man if you if your wife is out banging other dudes and you know about it but you don't say anything you become a cuckold but there's also like cuckold porn where it's like I said the guys there while like sobbing in the corner while his wife gets gorilla fucked interesting the world is evolving it's beautiful so it's still open open season then for you suck anyway you want like five definitions I still have a fucking clue at me yeah I mean bunch of kooks slice it of cooks I like that one definition though that the the vegan it gets on the megaphone usually a vegan who's been a vegan for like a month too those are my favorite fucking cocks boy how do you pull out of this now so where do we go from here Joe we always say you're either a hunter you're like Brendan mentioned a berry picker it's in our DNA if you're a hunter and to be able to test that against the toughest conditions against the hardest animals to hunt in the most remote places is to me the ultimate test of being a human being and ultimate test of being a hunter and that's what drives me and what we do and why train year-round why I'm always thinking about gear about food about weight about you know what how I could improve from what I learned on last year's hunt to this coming seasons and preparation of it is a it's fun yeah I love it I live it and breathe it and it's it's challenging it's really challenging well it unfolded for me and it still continues to do so because I've only been doing it for four years I mean Rinella got me involved and he took me out to Montana in 2012 and you know I was like oh yeah this is gonna be interesting let's see what this is all about because I had watched shows and I had read some stuff about it but one of the things that he said he's like man there's a steep learning curve to this there's a steep little goes long and I was like well I'm gonna go you fucking find Anatomy shit it you kill it need it what's hard but then as you get into it you realize and then of course bowhunting which is the most difficult of the most difficult pursuit and as you get into it you realize like oh this is like some crazy puzzle it's like some crazy challenge that you have to figure out that also involves a way to procure your food it does and it's a skill set you never quit learning on every time you go I learned something new yeah there's a there's a natural progression you go through I mean it's like you're just excited to be there right and then you're and then you you and you see it with people you take out for the first time they're just like oh what's what's going on here and you know and then they don't suddenly get a little click and it's like I want to get one you know and then you know that's usually a couple years and then and then you get a nicer one than one I got last time and I want you want to do something a little more challenging and it just keeps progressing until like you know two till you get you know wherever it ends and it's it's you you're hunting the the toughest animals the biggest animals the oldest animals and the toughest conditions and being successful and a lot of people won't get there but it's it's it's always a challenge is something that never gets old I mean it's it's you know it's comparable to any athletic event only you can do it for your whole life you know I mean there's lots of stuff you do athletic and then in growing up or whatever and it's like but it doesn't really translate you know the college wrestler that doesn't translate that well to bring the rest of your life here that dude down there at the intramural wrestling like you've missed you know so yeah hunting is a one thing that is just throughout your entire life depending on where yeah I mean you can it's you can always continue to learn and pursue it and you know sometimes you you know you don't have a ton of time you can do a short on sometimes you know things are going well you can do something that's you know on epic adventure but it's always a challenge it never gets easy at that I mean the animal you killed last time does not care the new animal you're hunting does not care what you got last time you have to go out you got to be sharp every single time
