the Joe Rogan experience well there's two Verne highlight knockout was one of the most ridiculous noise of all time when you stand there with your hands down hey step forward and it's like he was a comic book scene yeah it's like the way you knocked him out like I said about like you being a bad guy in a movie it seemed like you were a bad guy in a boxing movie it didn't make any sense you were the guy like if I was say if there's someone was I was a coach of a good guy and I was sitting ringside and I was watching you do that we'd be like shit yeah I can't I'm gonna tell you man when I stood over him like that I was outside of my body I could see me and him standing there I mean like I was a third person I can't explain it you know and then when I started throwing the punches like I went back into my body and start welding on them or whatever I can't I can't explain that that feeling there's so many different things that happen that was a big one too because I got shared so much online yeah that was not honest millions and millions of people saw that online they're like what in the fuck is just guy got in his yeah and that's when they started who waist is guy what we haven't heard about this guy's yeah yeah yeah it's like everybody's waking up to the heavy weight on a sudden oh so true and it was the perfect convert there it is I did dude play it for the beginning Jamie here it goes you know straight boxing skills you know I got boxing skills you know when when I first fought him I showed all that I stayed disciplined I didn't abandon the game plan you know and I showed people that could box yeah and he took that was probably the only time I just really just stay super discipline not this fight but that's the first well this part right this one right here I went outside of my body right here I was standing then I came back I kid you not only what the hell was going on with me that was ridiculous no he did yeah he was he was quite upset that's the strangest little concoction he's got on this dreadlocks there yeah look like tape yeah that seems like that would get in the way to keep it up you know Haitians believe in it - that was no sweet - and then the referee get got near if I don't believe now it would have been funny of the rebel to let go he rolled to the other corner movie yeah that would have been but you know that fight right there was the real start of it all you know in terms of public perception exactly exactly I knew I was really going sore with that especially when they went viral and then coming back with the Artie's maybe because people it made it that much more interesting yeah you know to see what I'm going to do now because people tune in now whether they they love me or hate me they tune in Asik and I'm not the next person now ya know at this point of time well we talk about TRT trt vitor belfort forever yeah it was when he was on t RT he was a different kind of human being he was just completely different than he is in our circumstance oh yeah looking back you can see that I mean cuz when I for him I fought him on t I'd say you fought him when he was that though the super Vitor absolutely look like fucking The Incredible Hulk he had but muscles on his fucking eyebrows yeah looking back you can see that you know but but at the time as a fuzzy you gotta be you can't think like that you know what I mean even doing just you know that doesn't do it justice that's supposed to be before and after I'm just recovering from a cold at awake I'm a little congested so I keep coughing the real the real key that's better that's way better that's much more accurate and he's a guy who was known to take things things early in his career remember when he fought Randy when he only 19 he was 240 pounds yeah yeah exactly his neck start at the top of his head yeah but yeah I remember there was a picture of his were both on the scale in Brazil and you know looking back now you the whole shit you know anyone else with you seen this guy he's kind of big ba-ba-ba-ba-ba but you don't think like that at the time you can't as a fight if you start having those thoughts those doubts Scheldt looking at fights his physique and thinking oh he looks good you've already lost right now but in hindsight you can look back and say holy fuck what was a thinking you know this guy's fucking bored he's out of his mind I remember on there I was trying to get a rise out of him and he kept putting his hand in my face I'm not a religious guy and you know God bless anyone that is you know I I mean that I respect everyone's opinions but I'm not as we know Vito is heavily religious and he kept sticking his thing in my face he was pissing me off so Vito come here come here and he leans you I said there is no Jesus maybe there is maybe there is you know me getting dropped with a head kick in the second round maybe that was God Thor watching me who knows what did he say some fucking Portuguese bullshit so the drug actually prolongs or intensifies the depression you know maybe okay for very short term use of very severe depression but these are not things you want to go on and stay on for length of time what's fascinating to me is want to talk to people that are on them that want to talk to you like they're on some cancer medication or they're on you know something that cures polio yeah like they make it seem like you're insensitive to the possibility that there's other solutions right and there are many other solutions we have really good evidence for the antidepressant effect of physical activity yes both to prevent and treat yeah we have very good evidence for supplemental fish oil for omega-3 fatty acids to permit and CDs well oh and the microbiome looks like it's involved in our mental states as well so either there's so many different ways yes CBD for sure so again gets back to information and it gets back to in an integrative approach and not just relying on a single thing like a pharmaceutical treatment yeah I've talked to intelligent people that are on SSRIs in one form or another and even ones that have struggled we're on one for a while and it stopped working and then they tried another one and they're compounding ones and they're on this weird sort of chemical rollercoaster and they reject any possible notion that there's other alternatives especially when you bring up the exercise one right I bring up the exercise one they go all this fucking meatheads exercise we just stop I'm like I'm telling you we did this thing with my friends called sober October and what we did is we no alcohol no anything for the month of October but also we did this fitness challenge and we got real carried away and we're all competing against each other with this heartrate app so we're working out three hours four hours a day was crazy but what was interesting about it to me was not just that your body sort of adapts when you force it to work out that many hours but that your mood is phenomenal yeah I felt so good yeah and I was telling everybody if you could take what I like I don't feel that good right now okay I mean I feel great but I don't feel as good as I did during October because I was working out four hours a day it was if you could get that in pill form you would take it everyday if there was no side effects because it literally removed anxiety all the internal chatter all the negative chatter it was gone everything seemed amazing true and there are side effects of physical activity are great you know it revs up immune function improves digestion sleep all that you mentioned anxiety the the by far in a way the most effective treatment I found for anxiety is simple a simple breathing technique no regulating the breath I've seen this work for the most extreme forms of panic disorder and the drugs that we use for anxiety are the worst the benzodiazepines highly addictive mess with your mind yeah I have a good friend who has an issue with anxiety medication and he takes it all the time and when he doesn't take it apparently it has that rebound effect exactly right he gets horribly anxious well these are handed out like candy and nobody warns people how addictive they are it's a worse addiction than an opiate addiction it Zanic yeah really yeah yeah why I did not know that harder to get off of than opioids Wow because out of all those voices as long as you're not personally trying to figure it out and filter it yourself with your own which is completely impossible but if you could just look at it objectively from afar this is going to work itself out and a far better way than has ever happened before in our past there's never been this many voices yeah and our pastors Benes like you were talking about a select few voices the Walter Cronkite's the whoever it is on at the top and then everyone else sort of had to wait for the narrative to be spelled out for them right that's not the case anymore that's right and and again I think it's the best of times in the worst of times so it's the best of times because all these new voices are bringing all sorts of great perspective and insight and intelligence to the to the story that wasn't there before and that's great the problem is is if the infrastructure that used to be there to kind of bring us all Paul bring us all up to a kind of basic level so that we understood the facts disappears so we don't have anything that kind of makes it so that we all understand what's at issue and what's at stake and what the facts are so that we can act as a democracy in a sensible way then the question is how do we run a democracy you know because if we could have all these different you know I like to think about the difference between the culture channel and the democracy channel so in the culture channel this is the best of times by orders of magnitude yeah stuff on television today is a billion times better than anything from the 1970s and 1980s yeah and it's that's a product of this incredible competition and the fact that you can have anything and any niche market and as long as it's enough it makes sense to do it and that's what's great but when you turn to the democracy channel the same fragmentation the same niche market the same reality of us all living in these different universes means we can't address problems as a democracy with even the same facts and that's a real problem because if we all live in our own fact universe but we have to same face the same real problems in the same real earth then we're not going to decide them in any sensible way and how you solve that problem is really hard like we're not going back thank God we're not going back to the 1960s it's just not going to be the case that there are three channels we get to watch that's just not gonna happen um and and it's a great thing because we've got all this amazing culture but what do we do on the democracy side how do we build a democracy recognizing that everybody's not going to spend all their time geeking out about campaign finance reform legislation and and that's why I think we need to think about these other ways to bring people to some sensible understanding [Applause]
