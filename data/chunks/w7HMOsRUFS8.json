four three two one boom so I took a four and a half hour ride down to San Diego cuz my friend Brendan was filling his Showtime special yeah and it was run the jewels the entire way down and back thank you it was awesome thank you whoo I wish I could work out as hard as people work outside music I've lost 31 pounds but I'd be 90 pounds out easy now that was one of the things this is workout music yeah it is it is and Ella and I are chubby is too fast well you were saying you lost 31 pounds yeah there may be picked up three over there but I'm on my path I really am shots out to Al Claiborne who's from out here who's a hell of a trainer if I had his discipline I'd already be hundred pounds down but the gold is 100 and the next 18 months you can do it yeah I don't know something that's just just eat bad and got lazy yeah but you know what man you could turn it it's one of those things where you just if you could stick with it for 90 days it'll become a part of your life well that's the goal that's the goal you know I mean and and and I'm about it like cuz I like me so I still get to eat me and I like green stuff and I don't like salad dressing so I think it's lonely road to you easy for me yeah like olive oil and vinegar does not taste bad bro I don't even views that like when I have a salad one wife makes salad she literally I'll make the salad she may add a little goat cheese or not she'll you know mate she'll tell some chicken or some sake on there but if it's fruit in the salad I don't need any salad dressing just throw some strawberries and some apples or something something that just give me that spry of juicing and I'm good yeah if I could figure out doing that three to four times a day versus the one meal and with my wife and then eating like trash in the studio I'll be rad that's the problems from the temptation rules and you see burgers and fries yeah fuck it you see a coca-cola yeah that that really is it from me Swiss sodas the worst which is which is which brings me to cripple Cola yeah so what is cripple Cola bottles of it but I wanted to keep in the fridge yet I want to enjoy it in its perfect temperature coca-cola pepsi-cola RC Cola anything with Cola right has probably killed more Americans than anything else in the world right so anything that's Cola because Coca Cola's provided tons of jobs in my hometown I won't want to diss them they might concert am i right but we know that sugary drinks aren't good for you right yet we don't have an aversion to we don't criminalize sugar and my doctor Lily told me Michael sugars poison right I want you to work it out of your diet but these kids that are members of these little punk-ass Street fraternities essentially gangs we criminalized and villainize a bunch of teenagers who simply don't have anything to do they don't have jobs they don't have skills they don't have organization they don't have Police Athletic League like they used to they don't have people engaging them in academics or sports where they used to so they're just kind of you know mess off fuck off sometimes fuck up and violence happens right if you could take those same kids with the entrepreneurial spirit that'll sell you water on the side of a highway you add it to something the public already wants anyway Cola you create something like cripple : B pop and essentially what you're doing is creating the same sugary shit that we all go by and drinking we shouldn't and now we're giving the structure of sale Hells Angels to say yeah you can say we're a criminal organization but we still can sell your fucking t-shirt because we're now paying our taxes we're now employing people and we're now doing we're supposed to do and that's what I wanted to give the gift of my friends who are members of Street fraternities and we actually pulled it off at the show these guys actually managed to bring something it's in microcosm to the market in Atlanta it did well enough for us to keep continue doing it and I want to see how far I can go and what's in it sugar water artificial for artificial arm what is it food color and flavor and that's it and I think it's six ingredients so have you ever do you know what Sevilla is if you fuck with XIV you mean the fake sugary stuff you use it's no Sevilla is soft drinks that are made with stevia yeah but the thing is like you know what I found out with me was sugar it's either just do it or don't like for me it's easier to do things that are actually a real just sugar like a Mexican Coke or just have you know some carbonated water with lemons in it now I don't do well with the invitation it's kind of like in the handjob I want the whole thing I know what you're saying but this stuff is good it's it's different just imperious did it it's just my I am such an addict doesn't want the real thing yeah so it doesn't make sense for me sometimes to tempt myself like I jump water I just I do a lot of water now lot more water now and I do a lot of club soda with lime which I used to talk shit to LP about drinking white guy drinks and now it's ul is ordering a fucking you know he's ordering a drink drinking I'm just like I'll take a club soda in line that's good man if you could stick on that path shout out to my man bariloche who is a friend and mentor a lot of times you might see a guy with me does security bear introduced me to shaolin kung fu even basically kicking and punching and moving around and he also introduced me to a lot of the guests that on your show um including you know guests that talk about in a minute fasting nuns about getting rid of sugars and stuff and he just loves me like a big brother so he keeps me in tune but what's going on he actually introduced me to stevia always good to know garlic that got its finger in the pulse I like to know people that are smarter than me so I don't have to learn as much I can just go to them with questions yeah that's the move yeah I don't I don't like being the smartest guy no well I don't have that choice that's that options not possible you need to get another rule fuck that yeah I mean talking to Elon Musk on the show about that when he was talking about the thoughts that are bouncing around inside of his head that he can't control and then he's it's always been his whole life like he wouldn't want to be me I was like Jesus Christ I'm just thinking about it I thought I did something cool smoking with Maher and that was definitely cool but you get in he musta fucking smoked his classic stoner history and they're making right there yeah I didn't even the thing about it is if I had any idea that people would react to it that way I mean I would just do that on a normal show that's normal yeah it's like oh I smoke weed it's no big deal it's fun it's a circus camaraderie thing everybody thinks oh I think everybody's sharing space together it's absolutely one of the only things you sip off that another man's lips touched like everybody does it yeah well women too but we just don't admit to ourselves that there's another guy that's true but that's like it's been washed yeah to join the person no wash like if someone did give you a haul off of their cigar try this but get the fuck out of here actually had action Noriega did that to me Manuel nor you know that I may well know it Noriega the rapper Oh Victor Santiago yeah cigars ignore you how cigars and Don cope and I'm not a cocaine user but I would have definitely yeah my wife talked about going to Columbia and I said honey I've never said this to you she said what I said if we're going to Columbia we're gonna do cocaine I said of all the places in the world I said no to cocaine everywhere from Dubai to Denver but in Columbia I say fuck it we're here with the source yeah when you're in Hawaii you eat POI yeah I would try for sure those leaves the chewing of the companies and in Peru when you as you ascend up the mountain shots out to immortal technique my Peruvian rap friend I love that - yeah I do - I think man I've been on a couple times he's a great you have a great human being that guy brought me a plate of his grandma's food to the podcast studio that's how down-home that dude is he's one of the best movies but a plate of food he's a great human man like he's a great he that like that's more of the stuff I'm saying people need to do instead of arguing ideas and extremes you need to get with people who don't look like you are not culturally alike yeah and you need to allow them to do things like that because that means friendships empathy and builds bridges instead of burning well he's just a real dude he is he's a real dude like who he is I mean that is who he is yes got very strict ethics in his mind he's smart he's like a soldier you know in terms of how he thinks and operates and takes care of his people and moves you know he took me on my first to love rap music as what rap music before me and ela went out together I went out with him you know I mean we ran through the south together and I just he was just pro all the way and we became friends and I just love him to death now and I go to war with him any day yeah he's a great dude I've hung out with him a few times yeah liked him a lot came to my mother's funeral god bless his soul really yeah I believe that that sounds like him yeah yeah it's there's good people out there man even in show business wacky ass show business yeah yeah there are good people in show biz none of the people in offices you can trust but the talent we're okay yeah well then the office is this some good folks out there there's some good agents and good people they get a bad rap you know what it is man it's just fucking hard you imagine how hard it is and you know how hard it is to make it in in entertainment as a performer Yeah right you know your path hoe it's fucking difficult for everybody now imagine you have to rely on other people performing you have to pick the winners figure out who's gonna work for you bunch of addicts and emos like in terms of the talent like we're we're I know I get my managers headaches three four days a week god bless your soul you know I know I do I really like my friend today was with me um he's a promoter 8e right Eric Miller so when I met him we were doing a show we were booked to do a show me and another artist well the other artists contract didn't say pay regardless mine said pay regardless so after the show where's my fucking money and everyone's like what are you talking about you don't get paid I'm like no I was my fucking money or I think it may have been before like I'm not going on and he ends up snatching in another office like look I won't fucking pay you don't tell the other fucking guy oh jeez that's it and that's how we became friends I took my money acted like I didn't get paid talk shit about them in front of the other guy they call them later like man I don't know what the fuck made you hold cold but thank you and we're even princess so when he called me and said you going to Joe Rogan's experience I'm like you're coming with me that's hilarious yeah I'm those sketchy gigs we're not sure if you're gonna get paid I know it's the chitlin circuit you know it's like me and T I playing Montgomery Alabama in 2003 you know wow it's fun the chitlin circuit is fun I would advise anyone who who likes like you know you like Street RAF to get to the south and get to one of those small clubs where that everybody's accepted and just go watch those kids as they grow up you're gonna see some hell of a show now how does a manager find a rapper how does like an agent find a rapper how does that work it works a lot of the local shows yeah local shows I will say like in Atlanta Meech and key who both management their management 421 savage they've been on the Atlanta scene for years cultivating young talent whether it was grip pliers rest in peace to two to nine which was another group out of Atlanta and all these kids were dope you know some worked out some didn't on group that grip died of cancer unfortunately I'm to nine members went their separate ways we still are making dope music but then they found the kid in 21 and they managed to help get to the next Plateau and Congrats the 21 have a number one album a couple weeks but management usually it comes from a group of people who care and just just want to see someone their fan of be treated well in the industry so I really applaud music managers because like you say placing your your own fate in your own hands is one thing place it in the fate of an emotional addict which a lot of times the act can be including myself yeah oh shit you know that's a roller coaster ride that's a hard job this distress of other people performing is brutal yeah my publicist god bless her soul I thought I thought I killed her a couple of times this year you know she might have come from a my concern one of our two publicist white woman and Katherine who's done a lot of music publishing and then when I start talking about topics have a black woman and Jennifer farmer who's a great publicist but she's also publicist for like former senator of Ohio Nina Nina Turner and megachurch pastors so she oh she's helping me keep my image clean but you know she doesn't want me getting on television talking about doing cocaine and smoking joints and I don't do cocaine but it's like if I go to club yeah I do coat and she's just you could just see her face st. behind she's gonna oh my god and you know churches are calling they're like this guy supports ar-15 so I thank you Jennifer for you for tolerating but she's got to understand that that's also a part of why people like you yeah she does it you know it's just it's just something to deal like that work I guess I get it I wouldn't want to be here but you have to do what you do that's what part of what makes you fun absolutely you know cops know what they're gonna get what what it is yes no filter yeah you got it man you got somebody has to somebody has to shake the box a little bit somebody has to be the kid that's willing poke the hornet's nest just to see how many oh flower yeah you know my two of my greatest heroes when black people usually talk about heroes right we talk about Martin Malcolm Elijah Muhammad marcus garvey there but two of my biggest heroes coming up were Luther Campbell and Larry Flynt right because in my lifetime I saw Luther Campbell and Larry Flynt fight the government on behalf of the American people's right to say whatever they wanted to say so at the same time in my formative years I was learning to love the Bill of Rights the preamble and United States Constitution Constitution I got a chance to see people fighting for my right and I couldn't wait to be a rapper just like a curse and by my own titty books you know and those people have shaped my life in terms of love of freedom and liberties as much as a Thurgood Marshall you know as much as a as much as a Barbara Jordan as much as a shirley Chisholm so for me Who I am is needed you know it's an I remember one of my friends saying Mike I like the fact you talk on social issues but why do you always feel unnecessary to talk about smoking leading strip clubs I say because that's what I really do and I never want someone to be able to from the other side to say don't like this guy because he smokes marijuana go to strip clubs I want whoever they say that to to say yeah and he goes with his wife and they smoke together I don't want it to be some secret I keep I want people to understand that when I want you to be free I don't want you to be free to agree to see the world the way I do I want you to be free to live as you would like to live so long as it doesn't offend y'all me and others that's supposed to be what this is all about yeah supposed to what this country is all about that's what miss Ellison told me yeah in high school well the Luther Campbell thing was so strange because it was at one area in Florida right where they had brown strict breath blasphemy laws yeah they've tried porn stars there before yeah they tried some male porn stars doing some really fucked up videos they tried him down there for for obscenity and they had him locked up they dig you know it's very conservative yeah and they just decided that the 2 Live Crew was just too much they really they were drawing a line in the sand huge but it was it's a crazy thing to do and something's very popular you know like yeah you know you know but you know they also make examples out of the popular yeah I just found out what the what the the monkey on a stick thing meant what apparently monkeys in India while out so farmers will kill one monkey and put his head on six other monkeys and all hey this is dangerous to do right so essentially famous people me you Luther Campbell Lenny Bruce you know Rodney Dangerfield Andrew Dice Clay Richard Pryor anymore what you become is something to symbolize what will happen if you dare step out of line of social order hmm so you your head being on a stick isn't less about actually charging you for crimes and more about keeping the rest of the public in fear it's a lynching yeah a lot of times we don't want to say that but it really is you know I mean so do you think they see something like to Live Crew come up they never had a rap band like in any kind of band like to live right they're worried what's next we got this shit in the bud let's nip it in the bud put the head in the stick put the head on the stick right there in the yard and thank our Luke fought I can remember channel two or five ABC or CBS and they were they were they were getting off the plane in my town I'm a kid watching this one twelve thirteen years old and the news reporters just went TMZ style just put it in their face and I can remember brother marques just pulling up a Playboy magazine in her titties I mean right there on the screen like yes cuz it's like yeah and the report almost dropped the camera you know trying to get it out but that's what that's what made me love the United States Constitution when it matters of freedom of speech because I got a chance to see it fought for and exercised right there before me as I was learning about it these are an interesting that really what we're concerned with too is visuals not concerned with what people write down whether we're concerned with what people say but we're not like if you could write that in a book and knowing what you could write his lyrics in a book and no one would get mad at up at that book something about them singing it and people singing along to it yeah people like this is it we got it we got to stop civilizations falling apart we got to stop this yeah well I mean you know songs vibrations humming you know meditation your hump you know that rhythm changes things you know and it opens your mind it clears you you know I mean had it not you know had it not been for an artist like little Kim would you have feminism in the way you have now would you have women gladly celebrating their sexuality and bodies if it wasn't for her she never gets the credit do you know do you think people know how extravagant she was and in her time I think she doesn't get the credit she deserves I think women know that it became safe for them to be sexually a great even free because of her the women that you know we're coming of age it in our time but I don't think in retrospect cuz wraps young you know wrap it's only 45 46 years old I don't think that I just think it's getting to the point where we appreciate what we do what we've accomplished so little Kim is gonna become more celebrated as years go on her Trina you know kaya Joyce a boss like so many hip hop has been a very fair game the women a very long time you know what whether people want to know it or not you know you have you've always had to call her response records in hip hop I get on there I'm the baddest motherfucker in the world and then a girl pops up behind you now I motherfucker I'm badder you know I mean those records have been around forever so they've we've always promoted equality within because it made money it made sense and women with the audience suit it's pretty amazing that hip-hop is really only 40-something years old when you at least stop and think about that it's one of the primary sources of music in the world yeah if you think about how many songs are being published how many songs people are listening to and enjoying right now how many of those are rap that's a fucking giant number man yeah if you look at the whole country right now and just a little light goes off when it's a rap song is playing like whoo and if you listen to wheeler Walker jr. Willow Walker says the rest of country music is just biting rap and acting like they are so well I think it was a little bit of that but I think at one point in time it was a little that a lot of rappers would look at guys like Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash and old-school gangster country guys outlaw country is way different from yeah I love outlaw country you can't tell me Waylon Jennings Kris Kristofferson Willie Nelson Johnny Cash aren't kicking it like that's what the fuck is right but but that's that's not the same as you allocating the Nelly beat to your song and talking about cowboy boots and set Air Force Ones know not to say there's something about the Allman Brothers Midnight Rider yeah and you know whipping pulse that's radically different then you're just singing about your Ford and you know in rafting on Saturdays with your chick yeah I don't think people even understand tied to the whipping posts you can't fake that song when they came at me about the NRA interview last year every day I smoked a joint woke up and laughed and listened to that record like every single day I just wanted you guys to know it didn't bother me my wife just told me to shut up talking to you all we went shooting a lot more and we play Allman Brothers whipping post every morning because I had to remind myself that this is normal then your being done like this publicly because you're disagreeing with the system that people have agreed to that you don't agree to and it's okay not to agree so the Harmon brothers really got me through that segment and stopped me from punching a lot of bougie black people in the face well you're a proponent of your your right to carry a gun yeah and I'm I love of the United States Constitution as a whole of all our rights and amendments but in particular you know the first and second Amendment rights matter to me as an African American as and as an American first foremost as an African American I've only been free 55 years my parents were born in apartheid and as an American we are we are a country that broke off from what we felt like was a tyranny of monarchy and we did that because farmers and guns dare to wage guerrilla warfare against at that time one of the largest armies and navies in the world so I honor that by continuing to be in the spirit of host farmers you know indican in the continuance of Crispus Attucks the first person who died american revolution was a black man you know so for me i would dishonor those patriots who started this country and Crispus Attucks i would dishonor the lineage is an african american who's only 55 years in the freedom by giving government in our gun back it's not something I believe in um government is people part of the problem with giving government anything is that they're just people they're not something special absolutely not flawless absolutely give people power over you and there's they'll they will I mean this is not saying we should stockpile guns and point them at the government but if people have guns it's way harder to just take over sense a little absolute that shit happens all the time and other countries does happen absolutely people get occupied it's just in government's turn on them government's change the rules and put places that we're democracies are no longer so absolutely that's real and we're never far from it is it safe as you feel you're never far from it but I think what what we need more of is people like you that are that are a reasonable very educated in the matter of air articulate person who comes from a place where they don't expect that argument to come from yeah I understand you know like you think about left-wing people or democratic people progressive people you always think you know you think about democratic people overwhelmingly being appreciated by the black community and you always associate them with being anti-gun yeah that's a common thing so when a guy like you steps out and says no no I think it's a disservice to take this right away absolutely if I didn't support it and fight for it I've been I've been an african-american 40 40-something years now all right I have known Democrats primarily my entire life I'm from the south in particular southeast Alabama Georgia Florida I have never known a black male Democrat that was working class that did not own a weapon hmm not that so I'm gonna follow the examples of my grandfather I'm not gonna listen to the National Party in their rhetoric about the armed in the population I think obviously we could agree that we would all love it if we never needed guns yeah of course yeah right of course who wouldn't I rather not need it than be prepared yes did not be prepared sure right better to have it not to need it not to have it and the part of the country I'm from and what you do often like I'm from a part of the country I grew up fishing hunt and growing food my sister girls who don't get to hunters regularly now still fish occasionally shots out to Greg Street one our biggest TJ's down there it's a great fisherman right but this is this normal in my part of the country as not having straws and being able to smoke in public it in places like LA is it it's just it's not that big of a deal you know you you you know in my in my mind-state household should have five guns right you should have a revolver shove a semi-automatic for feeling your wife carrying out you know in public if you have a shotgun just because it's a great all-around going to have whether it's burglars or vermin you know you should have bolt-action rifles some course case you got to kill you meet you have a similar maker riflemen to you don't defend against here and there just to fuck off on Sundays and show your homeboys was dictator but what what you should not do is give up your right to all yeah or use them on people that's the thing about using them on people is that it's so rare but so horrific and so so common for something that's so horrific everybody's against it but I don't I don't understand how you would ever by taking guns I mean you would have to take all the guns away to stop that from happening yeah criminals are of course huh there's no way the regular people should probably not do that yeah that's that's where it gets squirrely it's like how are you gonna get those guns from the criminals you're not you're going to what we can do though and I would say as an owner you get lazy sometimes you don't train enough we should train more and that doesn't mean you know go try to be the quickest draw you practice you know but what you want to do is is make sure you know what you're doing with your weapon make sure you know how to clean your weapon make sure you're not a store your weapon and I took my son and my nephew and I'm shooting I'm about to start taking my 11 year old girl Michael shooting because I want them to know what they do if they see a gun so we've already went through what do you do if you're somewhere you see it done mm-hmm how do you what how do you get out of that situation get other kids out of that situation and I don't know all that comes with it you know and you know the strange thing to me is that my mother when she was in high school was actually taught how to shoot a rifle right because the NRA which is now vilified and hated for four reasons some deservedly so some not they used to have big programs in public schools to make sure that children knew firearm safety so my mother school and other schools benefited from that I don't care if it was just that sheet of paper that told you the unsafety before you went in a range that was just a piece of propaganda they did it was better for the overall public so I tend to say as Americans we've gotten away from stuff like trades in school we've gotten away from different options besides funneling our kids into college debt and we've also gotten away from basic training such as balancing a checkbook basic home economics so how do you make lasagna at home by yourself and stuff like gun gun you know gun shooting in archery I think that if those things return to public school you get a safer and more confident student body you get a reduction on things like bullying and bullshit you get an increase on its self repair interests of children and you start to me to grow it scholars that excel but do you do you really how is it gonna stop bullying just by knowing that more kids know how to use guns stop bullying no boxing class stops bullying it pipsy said that no one wants to fight somebody gonna fight back I think you're right I think for sure martial arts I know wrestling does it yeah one thing it can do though is make people more aggressive initially yeah a lot of people just getting into it learn how to fight like it therefore it's like blue belt mentality that's why you get what your homies though you got with your homies so you and your homies are just beating the shit out of each other you're not picking on a kid at lunch you know I mean like me Willie Spearman I remember six the thing is though man you can hurt each other here's a horrible video did you see the one that our who put it up it was a one of those fight breakdown videos Robin black yes it was Robin black to Steve's they're getting to fight one Steve Kos the other Steve it's fucked up to do two boxing gloves on their friends and one of them know how to fight a little bit and the other one didn't know how to fight at all you know come out don't do that to your house head bounces off the floor yeah I think martial arts in general is great for kids to stop bullying because you don't you don't have to worry and look at this watch this shit this kid in the blue has no idea Jim that guy leans in with a jab look at this flap oh that's so fucked up it's so obvious that he put his mommy to sleep he knows how to fight yeah like even when he threw a jab he like leaned in on that jab that was hard unless that guy is a real asshole I've really needed that punch that's a fucked up thing to do to your buddy Oh like what yeah this kid leans in look at that's that kid knows at a jab that's a real job here comes awful nextnow lights were about to go off that's bad for you kids and ba-blap right good timing there too kid drops it and yo did you see what I put up on my Instagram today not when I was a kid who looked like he was more of a boxer than a kung fu guy it looks like oh I did see it was it job was it chest it felt like he hit chest to kind of teach him to look at each right yeah but I think he got him in the a look at this I thought he got him in like the neck area BAM yeah I think it's a little bit high chest yeah but putting humbles a shit out of yeah and then he smiled have had him on his back front leg side kick yeah wow yeah did it smooth that's one of my favorite moves there's a big guy people never see a just a great kick to the gut coming and getting the fuck out of the hood let me get out of here that's how you get out of those chitlin circuit clubs when the whole club is trying to kill you how many he is those situations ever been in a good three two word of two it was our fault me and my crew and two we were just in the middle of some bullshit we know what's going on we had to get out of that Club you know what I mean but yeah that that song that's that's the only thing about the chitlin circuit fun times great groupies bags the money but you could die now how do you guys start out do you start out like a zero I like an open mic night or something if a guy wants to become a rapper how do you get going different ways like I'm from the underground rap scene in that I like the East Coast rap I like that I wrap that type stuff coming up so I was more like a open mic scene I got to hang around the older guys the cool guys in the drug dealers because I could rap about Street stuff right we're hearing you take like a TI he was always interested loved music and stuff but tip was a trap rapper from the start you know he he was entertaining for the street so even in need to go to fuck an open mic he just needed to be opened up on the mic and then allowed the greater public hearing I'm sick excuse me I talk about him and I mean big boy cuz they're two of my best friends so I know I got poetic license to talk about those guys where I don't really you know tread lightly with other rappers you never know who's feeling here but so there's no need for him to do open mics as much as just find someone who believed in him and that was KP la Reed DJ tune and gave him platform to create the genre now known as trap music me I came up more about it about a rap scene and out of thing you know go show your wares kind of like a comic you get up in front of everybody do your shit see what works go home readjust come back next week so when you do like a battle rap thing we sign up those days they just threw you in the pit I mean yeah first time yeah you show up I got my name my name my nicknames Scott right my nickname was skunk or my family called me Michael my friends were the unruly scholars and those guys were like just East Coast rap one was from Connecticut one from South Carolina boos family's from New York they can wrap your ass off they were like rocking we make daddy came in the same group they defeated a lot of guys made better records and then one day they were this thing called green lights where people play their music and then they battle each other my homies incoming man you could just everybody who you thought was the homies homies was just shitting on I'm like what the fuck my homies and my man Sharad GG McGee who I just seemed like a couple weeks ago he was the person that kind of pulled me out of knocking around in the trap trying to be a petty drug dealer into a studio and he was the first person to say yo this kid could really rap like you know fuck that shit I know he steals cars and and he drives him around to a hood rat shit with his ratchet friends but he can really rap let's get him in so he was the guy to start bringing me in so it offended me they were talking about my friend like that so I just start fucking off with their heads paddle rapping them and a man named Double Dee called me and killed her that night his kids a killer Mike's a killer and that's how I got the name killer Mike ah what a great story so the battle rap scene you would just get tossed into a pit in how much time would you get this isn't a night this isn't like former batter up now like battle rap is evolved like boxing now hmm like what I'm talking about is essentially cockfighting so but like when you would batter up there would be no no time limit no time you just went just one you just went until you won the crowd or the other guy shut the fuck up and walked away with his hand out it was a long battle rap man died that night those guys were still I literally took out four and five and six and those guys were still trying to come at me before Dee who was fucking built like you when when when we were children you know he was like I was obviously knock you the fuck out just told

fought somebody like straight to fuck up like it like they day men it's the disrespect is amazing it's not amazing it's a martial art yeah of sorts you know it's a mental martial art the ability to stay self disciplined enough not to wile out the ability to give in and take it you know what I'm saying it's an art if you ever seen grouse battle no roast battles with the doing stand-up comics with the the same principle and they go well they prepare for it like sometimes like weeks out and they tell them who they're gonna be battling against they write a bunch of jokes about each other and just shit all over each other ruthless joke writing it's on Comedy Central's worthy shit ruthless shit that's ruthless that's what comedy should be it is that in its a rare place that one spot where

zones trying to convince my wife that having threesomes and foursomes it's like circuit training it is she hasn't went for yet it's definitely a hormonal buildup yeah going in the room I'm going for it I'm trying Charlie I think next season all the trigger warning that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to start a polygamist compound based on CrossFit man that never goes right does anybody ever pulled off a compound yeah yeah few people quiet quiet people pull it off when you start to realize that your uncle and your aunt and her best friend aren't uncle Han best friend like oh shit I don't had two eyes you know yeah but but but if you're getting loud about it it's always gonna go bad right because people know about it by the time they know about it's already gone bad right so there might be a lot of them laughing at us right now yeah we know how to do it yeah exactly we just keep our shit together and don't tell everybody just stay low did you see wild wild country I did not see wow how could they bought a town they put they took over a town a whole cult they just they started just importing people they brought him in on buses shut the fuck they took over a town yeah these uh what was his name I forget the guys name I forget uh was it easy yes say it again into the mic Rajneesh yeah get another name though today what are you making like change something up there some sure I think I may have seen part of this hi three in the morning I don't remember what the fuck they were doing for jobs I was just paying attention to how they got these people in there they took homeless people and they shipped him out there on buses they could vote from the town they gave him jobs and identities and these people were extremely happy that was one who's crazy it's like I'm sure up some of them were troubled but for a lot of them they finally had a sense of purpose they'd just been taken into this place as family so they made Utah they basically made a town like Utah I've always acted and what I did see part of this movie geek at 3:00 in the morning like oh why is it that white hippy like people trust brown people with beard so much well they want to believe in enlightenment and in all the media portrayals of enlightenment and all of you know when people talk about mystical experiences yeah in India it's always that part of the world that emphasizes spirituality and the idea that the Hindu religion is a is a more ancient more complex be ritual religion as the Indian yogi figure is the white Jesus figure white people 100% so for white people who don't know white Jesus in the black community is a mythical creature that has enormous power right it's insane for anyone to believe in a deity that doesn't look like them right so but in the black community we're just in love with Renaissance paintings and Jesus is white as fuck all right so we have the same infatuation that your weird hippie aunt has with Indian men with long beards and their mysticism we have that white Jesus so that you've just helped me understand because I've always wondered like what the fuck is it white people and East Indian people like us Vikram who directed trigger warning also has a documentary where he creates a fake religion and convinces you know white middle class people to follow it that is a crazy one the white Jesus one right eye why Jesus of motherfucker bruh like man I'm gonna get me a shirt that says white people want stay woke and and what I mean by that is mm-hmm Western civilization its this is the latest phase like people have to understand there have been many empires and civilizations there was a time where modeling in Africa and Kim in Africa were the biggest civilizations and colonizers on earth later Persia biggest cut like you've had systems and right now the West has just for the last thousand years or so has been kicking and dominating ass a lot of what we see on the news between the west and what we call the Middle East now what was once a non-western perjurer at Western Asia this is thousands of years war you know you're hearing Islam versus Christianity but it's really two ideologies that have been fighting for thousand years over how the globe should be governed so with that shit man it's like there's no there's no stopping this shit but white Jesus Springs out of that and kind of goes everywhere and colonizes everything so you know the church pops up with candy for kids Bibles for you and by the way we're gonna be gone a while but we're gonna leave this guy here on the wall so you know what the ideal what godson look like so if godson looks like a doobie brother and so does God God looks like Jim Morrison Jim Morrison with a full beard yes traitor fuck Wow Wow yeah it's really Jesus was probably a tan guy with dark hair and curly curly hair and you know and brown eyes that was saying shit that the government in the church didn't like so they knocked him to fuck off why do you think that each race looks for someone of another race to be their advisor because I don't think people trust the divinity in themselves hmm you know I think I think that once you understand that as human beings we really only look different because of subtle differences and atmosphere and change and you know who you mix with win but I think that all those books that our moms paid Oprah to sell us of self-help and inward-looking Reverend Ike had told my grandmother's generation had in the 70s you know what I mean and I think that we're scared to turn off the lights and at some point see something divine within ourselves because once you do that that requires you act differently hmm and I think that people need to be told what to do not that they actually need it but they want to be instructed you know versus knowing or going on a gut feeling or experiment and getting something wrong you know my grandfather was one of the most kind moral in I've ever met he was always gentle with children he only put a belt in my but twice in my life in shit I think he crying harder than that same in at 14 years old shot a man in church for kissing his bike down you know he grew up in between 14 and 54 when I was born and he had experiences that he had learned to regret and he had dealt with that and he had become something that by the time I was a child he was raising me my grandfather was defined in my eyes almost you know I mean not because he was perfect because he was genuinely good and moral but as a 14 year old boy who had grown up fatherless who dropped out of school in the third grade and who had who understood that I must protect my mothers and sisters he refused to people they by anyone even an adult to the point of putting a bullet in them you know what I mean so I think that a lot of times we're afraid to see that divinity in ourselves also because then you have to acknowledge the darkness and you have to deal with that and it's easier to get instructed by someone else and it's easier to see the evil is outside too it's easier to see that is something I can't control it just happens versus I'm complying and I'm complicit in it you know that's a it's also a consequence of you know one of the things that bothers me the most when people talk about people that commit crimes or think about people that commit crimes so much of who a person is a consequence of things that had nothing to do with them absolutely they could have been born in a terrible neighborhood to horrible parents and then abused sexually and physically and and by the time you get to them they're broke their life is already a mess it's a shambles well and for you to try to think that they are gonna look at life and just figure it out with no assistance whatsoever there's it's crazy doesn't work like that one of the weirder things about our culture is that we haven't put more of an emphasis in finding the spots that are there the ghettos and the terrible neighborhoods in this country and figuring out a way to build them up have just make it even we know right away we know unequivocally where jobs and Commerce are present and economic opportunity and prosperity occur that's a dramatic reduction in an elimination in gang violence yeah yet we do not put resources into building institutions that will create entrepreneurs or work on a soft skill so the kids can be working at and around production housing Studios we put that money into prisons yeah and then we use prison labor to undercut things like call centers things like that that jobs I mean that factories may need and we're doing a disservice by doing it we and I always say we because we look to our quote unquote leaders and blame them when so many times we allow it you know we allow this to happen by not paying attention they're not voting we allow it to happen by not raising our voice even though we know someone in prison and saying this is wrong you know the last people I don't believe just for the record I don't believe in the big three Abrahamic religions I'm not into him but the books I've read and their amazing graphic novels I cannot read them like I can they look like a graphic novel of sorts right and when you look at the people who Christ died with right it was using he was left there were thieves the last person he saved before he got out of here was a thief was a confessed thief was dying right next to him and he was like you know we're gonna go on this together that's that's an amazing thing so as you're serving your Savior or your Messiah you need to be thinking about who he spent his time with you know he was with liars and thieves he was in the streets he was with people who alleged to be prostitutes and I think that if we start to turn our attention to those places and we put our intentions and good there we do produce on the out on the other side better but as long as we look at religion is something that makes us holy makes us clean washes us of our sins and we become pious in that I think religion will something be something that's forever kind of harmful it helped to create that and I think that that that believing that some people are good at evil doesn't allow us to say well what could we do to fix those ghettos to fix those depressed areas because for every ghetto where I'm from for every ghetto that's in a city in the south I can show you a mountainous region what a trailer-park this is bad for sure and those in those and those kids deserve a life better than oxycontin addiction in turmoil and pain to your right 100% 100% and I feel like there's money to be made doing it too I mean I feel like these jobs feel like yes it's an ignored resource yes yes my follow turbo Jesus follow kidding turbo Jesus an Alabama man tell anybody named turbo turbo Jesus kid listen he's amazing man I believe he's I don't I'm not a big Confederate flag just doesn't bother me as much all right not saying that you got a pass just it's I've lived with it so long it's just kind of like right all right do you we shock that all of a sudden it became a bad thing like with dukes of hazzard and all that not what I was a Dukes I have pictures of me what's the General Lee on a shirt right I'm not surprised because you know it my thing with the converter fag is that I lost right so you're flying to losing flex but just never really really bothered me but as I got older to drum the drama that's been placed around it he's been amazing because if I'm not gonna change robert e lee the school's name we're not gonna really be able to change faces it's gonna be here you know the southern you just count except it's gonna be there but turtle jesus is a kid I saw following so my natural assumption is you know typical redneck kid right hella talent he can fix anything with the motor on it he makes these amazing katana likes wars out of wrenches right he's just an amazing kid but I see him rallying against kids that uphold that flag and upholding you know anything that feels like racism of Nationals and it's just one of the most morally good kids I've ever seen running around and he's an ally and he doesn't look like cereal typically anything you would expect but that's the great part of this to me the great part of all this country is you know as as polar opposites as people try to make say you and I here we are together as equals you know here we are together engaging one another as equals and we don't look like one other we're not from the same places and I think that's just a whole bunch of opportunity in that you know I think that there's money to be made in promoting that versus promoting division and fear and so absolutely you should be there is money in helping children be better there is and there's in it and if we're gonna live in a capitalist system be a compassionate capitalist and be the best you possibly can because we need more of you but just seems like something like in in terms of something that we think about as a civilization we don't think about neighborhood rebuilding no it's not a primary concern even though one of the biggest problems we have is with crime and violence if you ask people what's two biggest things you're afraid of it's crime and violence next be car accidents and cancer yeah yeah and but crime and violence you could severely mitigate yeah one consumer if you had all these community programming if you think about the amount of if they I bet if they calculated out probably a wash the amount of money you'd spend to fix things versus the amount of money you would save by not having as much crime I agree Roxanne Shantae I saw her and I don't know shit so I'm just guessing South eighth anything is better than more prisons yeah yeah well that's the scariest shit we got going on the idea that someone's profiting off of putting people in cages and that they also Lobby to make sure that there's more laws in the books I told Larry King earlier today that I'd rather stop arguing over the Second Amendment with people that I should be arguing for amendment of the Thirteenth Amendment with we should stop arguing over guns and we should start to say why does our thirteenth amendment have a loophole in allows for slavery that said slavery is illegal except for yeah people people have no idea how much prisoners get paid to work when they were working on the fires yes what was they were I think it was $2.00 and some fucking insane amount of money they pay them and when they get out of prison they are not allowed to be firemen oh Jesus Christ is that real yeah it's real like because you're a felon you're every crime for everyone out there for everyone but but not any felony you can't be a fireman i I can't say any but a lot of the guys I've known that have gotten out of prison have not been allowed to still out that's right there's there's felonies were not a violent felony yeah drug selling California's paying inmates one dollar an hour holy shit not even two dollars your life is worth 99 pennies plus one just stop and think about fighting fires for 10 hours you make $10 now that's insane that is that but not only is that slavery that might be worse than slavery because what $10 an hour isn't even gonna buy you food that's less than Walmart pays its but it's less money to work all day than you could feed yourself yeah yeah this is the y-guy thing that's what I try to tell people people talk shit when I was coming on site yo man these are the guys are now I appreciate you saying that because that's true and it's not just black guys is poor white people I almost wish I could have a convention with to say we got to say masters they're saying this right here more than two thousand volunteer inmate firefighters and they've volunteered including 58 youth offenders are battling wild fire flames through California inmate firefighters serve a vital role clearing thick brush down to bare soil to stop the fire spread a wonder um do they get better service for that do they get out earlier nope they don't think nothing I don't think so I would hope they do but if we're paying them a dollar out what do we care but we're like we are though the public should be up in arms about yeah well they're obviously trusting those guys to not run to cuz when you're when you're chopping down bushes out there when there's a fire going on where you gonna go nobody knows what the fuck is happening it's chaos so where you gonna go where you gonna go yeah and then when they get your shit dollar-an-hour just how insane is that word you know something else we doing our prisoners that's cruel and brutal we put people in a box for 23 hours a day yeah lot amount for an hour to walk in the space yeah you driving them crazy yeah yes she doing yeah you're fucking with their senses to the point where they're going crazy absolutely or they get solitary I have friends have been in solitary they talk to you about solitary they're just there for themselves with you're home on day after day after day yeah I remember going to in-school suspension not being able to talk about to go fucking nuts after three hours you know so happy and being in Georgia state corrections when you're a little kid you can't shut the fuck up for anything coach dollar used to tell ya he's feeling us like shut the fuck Kameron dollar 1 1995 UCLA he played played point guard for them when they won a national championship his dad was the culture out high school his dad was the basketball coach and he's softer in school and I stayed and in school man I knew his dad like a fucking player I couldn't play any basketball I just be sitting there quiet he'd be reading the paper just like I can't wait to get the fuck out of here man coach darling I'm gonna say shit that's not I don't wanna go to prison Thank You coach darlin that's out the camp not talking to anybody for just a couple of days would be enough to drive you crazy now imagine some people that have been locked in the hole for like eight months they do that to people yeah they do the breath I mean that didn't in that what they did it Chelsea Manning yeah didn't they yes that's exactly what they did I think I forgot what her original name was as do I know what's up you might you might yeah piece of shit it's always been Chelsea but yeah she um I think they locked her in the hole for like ten months yeah no talking no nobody just by yourself fuck you by yourself that's crazy that mean you could break someone's brain easy he's hired a people's brain gets broken on a good edible I watched first 48 mmm I see you motherfuckers rang he broke in 15 minutes of cigarettes and a honey pot hey that's another reason I tell kids don't commit crime with your homies man watch first 48 you're gonna see everything go bad man for a Newport yeah just so many fucking crimes so many laws that don't don't need to exist poverty we end poverty we fix crime when it makes a fuckload of it that's yeah sure it's not still be sociopaths and greedy people you're gonna have that but far less than crimes of opportunity like robbing moms if their purses at gas station yeah car jackings you're not gonna see stolen cars you're not gonna see burglaries you're not gonna see that if you start to have an influx of you know we need to bring a lot of stuff back to America we need to start making shit again it start buying shit we make again we need to you know we need to start refocusing on what we could be doing in the house I think you know I think that would certainly help us and I don't know what we could do to just sort of promote that idea of I mean why doesn't it it's nothing that ever gets discussed in any political discussion like that whenever there's some debates going on or whenever there's an agenda yeah but nobody ever thinks of that one aspect of our culture the weakest aspect of our culture economically we don't really consider it just look at it as a source of crime it's a statistic we know there's as though as something that just is like it has to be yeah but it doesn't have to be well that's one history yeah it's in the television show it's all I'm really trying to say like there are other alternate air other ways to try this and we could you can you can try to fix homelessness without criminalizing being homeless right we know that most men that are homeless have some types of mental illness of schizophrenia so that means that we've broken down and we're not taking care of the mentally ill in a way that we should be it could be so if you start to fix that you start to fix that kind of homelessness we know that women and children we know why they're on the street and we know that if they're subsidized into these type of affordable housing apartments in the city the kids have the opportunity go to better schools to become better parts of society in terms of having the networks and resources we know the mothers are closer to work can be home but we don't do that we build cities like right now we're developing Atlanta and we've been promised a certain amount of of work space in the city for working-class people for poor people some of the developers aren't normally they say they do and because you do that you start to increase the things that are blights on us you know we just have to be really committed to it and do it that's it and once we do it is done you know but if we if we keep acting like it's not happening and complaining about poverty and crime and war and not doing anything it's just the cycle never stops and that's the understand the insanity I really don't understand yeah well everybody feels like it's somebody else's job everybody feels that work like yeah and everybody feels like well you just got to get out of that neighborhood no no no that's what this work Roxanne Shantae talked about reentrant she said you know she doesn't want to hear people come keep complaining about gentrification when the kids that are leaving these neighborhoods whether they sing dance rap or not or just go get good jobs and go be decent human beings you should be re-entering your neighborhood she should be buying houses or pieces of land there one of the most impressive things on my favorite players are John Stockton and I don't know if it's true or not but I read a story that he actually bought a house right on the street he grew up in so in the offseason he'd go back essentially home with his kids so they'd had some type of normalization to their life you we should be doing that you know Tianna have bought properties together in the same neighborhood we're developing things like restaurants and stuff I'd like to see more athletes and rappers become the merchants and business class that way and I'd like to see people who grew up in neighborhoods move back to those neighborhoods they grew up in like like the typical iconic American Dream you know you can build a you know another 8,000 square foot in the back of a flame house if you want to but you shouldn't be going to 50 for 60 minutes outside the city and then complaining about the blight of the city because you took yourself away you took the talent and the resources away do you think that everyone should feel that way though or is it I mean do you feel like you have to be committed to the city that you grew up in or couldn't you want to just get the fuck out of there and go some more difference nothing wrong with getting the fuck out but you just think you should go back and support it yeah it's like I tell kids you know accomplishment I say Mike you know what can we do you know kids are college kids when you're speaking college you say well what could we do kids want to affect the world very easy find a kid in high school to do that kid make sure they replace you at this university or another that's it you just produce replanting and seeing if you grow food you know you don't grow the same land year after year after year some you have to give that land a break retail it you know I'm saying it's kind of like the neighborhood so you don't have to stay in the same neighborhood your whole life you don't have to feel like I've never won anything or escaped anywhere but you do have to don't sell your mother's house mmm you know rent it to your cousin you know let your younger assistant but don't don't sell your mother that piece of land was worked for the blood the toil the soil it means something and it should and and for working-class people especially it keeps your neighborhood and communities more like the ones that made you be a good human being hmm so I think that there's something most people don't leave the town and grow up in and move to the other side or they moved to the suburbs most people are most people marry somebody they knew you know I'm saying my fingers make the best of it don't let it keep becoming the worst a man named mr. John my wife and I on barbershops are people don't know we own these things called the shave washing room shops we have one in State Farm arena that when the Atlanta Hawks play we have a flagship store on Edgewood Avenue Edgewood Avenue was once an Auburn Avenue once the Centers of black Atlanta in terms of Commerce and retail and money and land a life insurance company with their you guys Google some of this stuff this big-time shit you know this is a the old narrative of we've never had nothing because that's not the truth Atlanta was a very rich city for african-americans still is on this street used to be owned by African Americans the storefronts in there their children after these people died off sold the buildings off and sold it for cheap and I know this because a man named mr. John who runs a grocery store there stopped me one day he said you know Michael after we're gone in this neighborhood it's been gentrified and everything's different they're gonna come along and say that white people stole this from us and he said that's not true he say the children of the people that were here left and they never came back because they didn't think what they parents bill was good enough oh man that killed me because that's not just black people that's Americans period we have gotten to a point where we are unappreciative we are entitled and we don't think what happened before us was good enough so we don't treasure it we don't honor it we don't reinvest in it that could be a farm in Milledgeville that could be a house in Adams ile but we have to do a better job of appreciating ourselves appreciating our community and then appreciating our greater community and you have to re-enter you have to reenter Phi that you have to be a part of whatever gentrification happens to make sure that your stake is still there and that what you care about from a morals and civil perspective is represented there my uncle my uncle John Blackman who was a huge influence on me died and had a five car garage where where he did transmissions stuff and I begged my aunt to sell it please I don't want you I know they're gonna come the Beltline is coming on scoop but please sell it to me I didn't want my uncle's building you know for to go to strangers and become you know an apartment complex or something and I walked in your building and I seen your building and I said wow I know what I'm gonna do with it now I've had it for like three years now it's just I just had it but I didn't never knew what I wanted to do but you would like you know you need somewhere to go every day your building is impressive I'm like you know I'm just gonna just make my bit my uncle's building my offices right and I figure out a way to make a lot of money off of it I mean I've already made a lot of money which is what enabled me to buy it but it's important to me that as his neighborhood it turns into hipster land because it's definitely gonna be just gonna be black it's gonna be like chocolate mr. Lanson I just wanted to make sure that there's still some chocolate working class in there and sometimes they're gonna go buy coffee and there's gonna be a loud-ass muscle car and lots of marijuana smoke point out of it so they'll know that you know Michaels nephew still in town well you've got a great combination of work ethic a sense of community and you had a business perspective I don't have a business perspective I'm gonna shit my wife your wife is doing it all what she steeped talk yeah but you seem to know what the fuck you're talking about you've got a pretty good road map yeah you know I have zero with that zero business perspective plan yes discipline to go to the gym every day I do have that's what I got it but I'm crazy I'm gonna change to try to silence demon yeah mom forever I hate man Faline was the best thing that ever happened to me for I think for everybody fail not cuz some people get stuck at they failure and they become bitter and they become envious they become hateful at least how to mark yeah they can yeah but a merrier can be one of the best things that ever happens to you yeah failing and having to learn to become a business person I'm very thankful for removed from the failure now don't you think that about you rap career as well like that's what I was taught yeah Oh from business perspective from haled yeah @r at first I was a good rapper but Outkast Oklahoma now records my my first record that went gold at a time where every rail the record was going ten million it was a fit it didn't work right didn't work for me so I had to go to Texas and people like Chamillionaire and paul wall bun b0 Slim Thug traded truth right people like flipping hump these people taught me how to press up my own CDs put them in the marketplace sell them at profit reinvest himself they taught me that and selling drugs you know in the trap they taught me to rudimentary fundamentals of business and when I met my wife I remember dating two three four five little hot chicks and her just mentally being you know our wife caught like right freshman year college but just mentally she was lightyears ahead of everyone because her grandmother had raised her in that way grandmother had a shot house chitlin circuit here I go get a shot for $2 on Sundays because the south is you know a weird place we didn't used to sell alcohol on Sunday so my wife I recognize how to sharper mine and me for business what I had was good ideas for what was sale and what would be well in the marketplace and what she had was a discipline don't you have any failures in your business practice and Jim and first years I had a barber shop I wanted to kill every barber on Barbara's are like independent rappers you know everyone wants to be more famous than they need to be and they're artists barbers want to be famous yeah barbers like being famous I mean there are local famous yeah yeah they're artists yeah and they should be you know I mean but um with that say it man it frustrating you know one barber comes in one day like I want to wear glitter cape today yeah the next barbers coming like yeah I want to I want to cut here in the nude I want to use your shot to do it and you're like bro it doesn't what doesn't work like that like like this is the right but I had to learn for us that the boof rent model like you pay and boof renting us not making any more profit that doesn't it so we had to kind of say what what is Supercuts dude what does great clips do with it oh you run it by a commission and then you split that means they have to be there anyway and that's how we kind of learned business when we got an offer from the Hawks to put our place in the space of the arena and we want to be a Mourinho's we started to understand okay this is how you do business business you know this is not just how you you know make two to four thousand dollars extra months and that's just some good income for your wife to be enjoyed but this is how you start to say you know more than a brightner a barber shop this is a lifestyle and retail brand when we happen to barber but if you're a guy I don't like going to the beauty shops or beauty stores to buy my brushes or buy my combs or you know if you want to get a little gray out of your beard you know you don't want to be in a NAR X section of your local Walmart or you like hey where do I get the gray for my beer because I want to go get hot young seeds you know you want to go shopping so we develop products we have cool stuff you can just buy it right there and we've learning to be business people and hopefully I would like to become the chick-fil-a barbershops I like for people to want to want to have us in their town and pay us a lot of money to come well it's a man's hangout - I mean you can say anything you want and no one judge you can talk you can watch it Joe Rogan shit you know hey ya barbershops are uniquely masculine they are like beauty shops are for girls girls can go into a beauty shop and get their nails done and no there's not gonna be any men there they could talk all kinds of crazy shit yeah it's one of the reasons why they like it yeah and and the women that do come to barber shops are some of the best shit talkers so even they fit it right yeah that's what you know barbershop is exciting as one that has those two or three women customers that are just primed shit talkers how much if any are you paying attention to things like crypto currencies I'm DJ Vlad has taught me a lot about stocks so much to the point that I bought my wife thousands of dollars in socks for Christmas she cried she cried when I when I showed her the wedding band that I bought because I never really got her winning man and said I really want to you know show me I'm dedicating myself to you and this is this is never coming off and silver at the beginning of Christmas she cried when I saw my wedding man and at the end she cried when I said I never want you to be fully dependent upon me or feel that way so here's a lot of stock and she cried like a baby I called flat like that shit works bro but uh so I'm learning about and I just put lots of money into the S&P 500's but I don't know a lot about cryptocurrency and stuff I'm learning how to have money uh my fascinator buy them these the idea of a decentralized economy you know cuz we're always the the whole thing has always been about the the amount of money that banks control if you just stop and think about let's go what goes on with the Federal Reserve and what goes on with all the money and how much $1 worth oversees the balance of it all if there was something that we could all rely on you know that wasn't controlled by any gigantic group of people that have a vested interest in profiting off of this pile of money if it was some sort of a Bitcoin like thing I mean a really different world really really different yeah it would it would it be different if the world was moneyless it'd be different if there was a gold standard again it'd be a lot of differences but the question becomes is to banking mafia of source ever gonna let that happen and what happens how could they stop it well it's like stopping the internet at this point so you take it's coming you think we're gonna get the cryptocurrency I think it's eventually gonna be what are we gonna throw the chief up its gonna they're gonna yes be big that's it that's a that's a question correct all right you can't throw coins in clubs it's true yeah okay yeah we yeah pieces of paper that we know as bro Bitcoin will become like dollar bills that will represent Bitcoin laktaw bill with a gold like a shiny gold did you make a shit ton of money would be going no no some some of it for a hurdle fight for the Forgotten charity they build wells for the pygmies okay in the Congo my friend Justin Ren he lives in the Congo for six months out of the year building wells and so fight for the Forgotten we raised we raised a bunch of money through this thing called the cash app at that time someone's actually five dollars goes to fight for the Forgotten gotcha and we got some Bitcoin that we raised that went to them too so Wells got built because of that he's built I don't know how many well do you see like 18 wells they built for the pygmies they're constantly building new ones because the Sigma Z freshwater yeah he

they call him the big pygmy that's amazing yeah nicest guy that's ever lived those are Wow yeah I mean the guy goes there for six months a year Oh people in the picture with him look like they related to me yeah it's pretty cool man he's got some great videos on fight for the Forgotten that's beautiful where you could see the the wells being built and the water coming out I gotta check that out you send me the link yeah for sure dope for sure what were we talking about how do we get up to this Oh Rhys we raised some money for him through Bitcoin as well but I think that it's some give me some advice I don't know enough about it I'm an idiot I just want anything on anything money related cuz you have an icon cheap so I know you have more money I just work a lot you know what you're such grandfatherly it's true that's to shit my grandfather I'm not a big I'm not a big investor I'm not very smart I got I have people handling that kind of stuff which I work a lot but I don't pay attention to anything yeah I do too many things yeah I've got myself to the place where I know exactly what I have to pay attention to and what I don't ya don't have to pay attention to is just pawn shop Robert Paul a my accountant has made it pretty easy for me he it's literally a craft this is a dollar you make this is what goes in the savings this is what goes into investment this is what you and Shay want investing in real estate this is for retirement so now everything that comes in I already know so it's like when they call us and say like hey you guys you guys got a five hundred thousand dollar day I just know that I'm not going on with two fifty because as a management commissions my wife and my account already chopped that shit up I got enough money about Camero yeah I don't like to think about that I have to think about it cuz you know I'm black and you know shit ain't been too good if you ain't got money if you poor and black if you poor America's fucked up yeah if you poor and black America's fucked up with a dildora ass so you know my whole shit is let me take care of my money because my grandpa you know my grandmother her family owned land they started as sharecroppers but because they our land she could because she could become educated because they could sell the stuff they grew to stores and produce markets and stuff so she they were method and so she got to go to school my grandfather his mother owned no land so my grandfather had to work in a bread factory and cotton mills and shit so I knew the difference between ownership and you know the advantages of having something and there so it's something I kind of obsess on because I don't want my children to endure poverty mmm and I didn't I grew a working class you know my wife she jokes as she said to the lot you know she's from housing projects in Savannah and her grandmother and my work they were out of there but you know she says to me me all the time you were spoiled you know you're a little rich kid so much she's like you had a fucking RV I'm like I lived in an a-frame house she's like I don't care your grandpa your grandparents gonna for the RV you guys went on vacation you're spoiling right so I understand money means a lot and it doesn't mean everything to me but it helps to afford me to be able to take care of my children I completely understand it I don't want to give a shit not gonna daily basis I'm more like you but you think about businesses you think about starting businesses and forming businesses how do you have the time to do that and write and perform and all the other shit that you do because in able to whether the businesses enable me to enjoy writing they're performing when I had to rap when it was no choice it wasn't as fun anymore because the pressure was am I gonna chart can I make this much will director versus you know if I have a couple of streams of revenue coming in you know it makes it a little more relaxed and my art is freer that way you know oh I like that answer that's a great answer that makes sense that makes a lot of sense actually yeah to free yourself up creatively so that all you have to think about when you're doing that you're just doing what you want to do yeah yeah man that's ideal that's wise that's the go yeah if I'm a you know a lot of people talk a lot of shit about billionaires they like and they want to be and then they're there tons of billionaires from the nerdy sexy of Bill Gates to the wild dope eccentric sexy of Elon Musk to the oh geez of Warren Buffett and shit I like Ted Turner Oh Turner's well Ted was the guy who got nine got snookered out of six ended up with one or two and it's like I'm living my fucking life growing bison eating good meat fucking cowboy hat when my funky mustache like he was such a good owner of teams in our city when he owned the teams he was a great man with TBS and he did a lot of good he's if you know if a billion is the news that I want to be a billionaire early but if having a lot of money to standard I'd like to be the quirky eccentric guy like Ted yeah he always seemed free to me yeah especially once you got rid of Jane Fonda hey shouts ow listen when he marries a farm to the south where we literally thought it was well made it was like the city of Atlanta had went back to Gone with the Wind it was just amazing again it was people were strutting around that you know Jane Fonda's virtually our first lady you know people start to but I'd she was a nice lady to the city David Justice and highly Barry were interesting to you know not as interesting as handsome bastard he was hands one mother from the world was it what's the UH what's the yachting of anyone know they gotta he who's that he got in the yachting out of nowhere his cup Americans that was in America's Cup was it was that right yeah Ted Turner lived a life that Ralph Lauren puts on t-shirt yeah he looks like like a billionaire in a movie too he does the Great Gatsby typing uh he does guy who's a wise billionaire brings you in his study and you have a scotch with him on ice exactly explains shit dude and you're like what in the fuck shots out that a it man I know you don't get your love like a lot of the other guys thank you on the cut he does the fucking my Tanagra bison he's out there chilled Amman rebounded the population of bison so he could cook them and eat them get the fuck out of here that's badass man overalls respect that's how my fucking grandfather dressed with the same mustache that's what I want to be like when I think about making 21 million is escaping the game and shit this is me like maybe overalls in a Braves cap but this is it now let me ask you this how far away from him are dudes with machine guns at all times he's in fucking Montana habit so who wants to no one wants to kill Ted Turner get some money bro no one was out a man she has two snipers he probably has it yeah he probably has two snipers say east and west and he has one guy within a few feet of him but very relaxed I don't think Ted's walking around like Gaddafi you think you get to a certain work out well for Qaddafi no it didn't work on a wall for him he was hanging around the wrong dudes have all that last video of Qaddafi that is one of the most disturbing videos in all of human history to see him realize that they got his over and then that guy Steve Jobs that knife up his ass he's barely even reacting he's just he's in a state of shock like you understand people who have not of a certain age manie's with the feelings when we were young man Gorbachev Gaddafi cash throw like when you starting and I'm not saying I agree or don't agree I'm just saying they were game gets given to us as the villains yeah I never thought that he could go out the way he went out bad we saw a couple guys go out like that but I was the craziest one that was that was him getting caught by rebels executing him on the spot they didn't even wait they didn't even wait they're like fuck this fuck this trial I'm gonna kill this guy right now they threw his body on the hood of the car and they're driving around like that fucking deer yeah like a fucking deer exactly bring it on research don't beat the shit out of him it is it's a horrible van his dye job is showing you can see his gray hairs a little bit a little bit in the temple yeah that's a well but Tatar disability now one of the most disturbing videos was Hillary Clinton laughing about him dying yo bro you see that video no she's doing an interview and she they're talking about Qaddafi she goes we Came we saw he died oh ha ha ha ha I started laughing cuz I guess this game of thrones worthy that's hurt it was a circus aquino yeah that's no I don't wanna not my friend called me this year out has each a swift my wife telling me I need a husband more than wheat in the world needs a martyr that and my friend called me saying you know man really I just don't want nobody to kill my friend dad that really made me push it in perspective like maybe I should keep singing and dance maybe you should try to Braveheart this thing yeah people definitely still do get shot yeah alright now fuck what anybody says yeah there was a dude who was an Enron whistleblower Enron whistleblower who shot himself in the head twice yeah exactly exactly that kind of shit yeah like that doesn't what in the fuck are you talking about do you ever read the strange death of Vince Foster I have not it's a great book okay it's about Vince Foster who's in cahoots with the Clintons shot himself they when they found his body the gun was still in his hand which never happens guns fly out of here there was less blood at the scene of the crime than was missing from his body so the idea is that someone moved him someone put him there yeah right down of his shit Freight Donovan shit they did it for sure they did it but before there was an Internet all you had to do is grease the right amount of people and plan in place and it's done it's done they did it forever they did it through the Roman era they did it fucking great they did it beginning of time people have been whacking people I concur I concur I don't think this error a lot of people acted so those were again like I say these empires that we're under have been thousands of years yeah so it's like a corporation will change his name yeah you know and go for it something else I honestly I'm gonna at some point get a was it whatever brother's name Romulus and I forget the other brother a foot who were suckled by the wolf that was like to start the fake the fairytale started wrong I want to get that as a peasant pendant it's gonna be some right I like artsy rap shit so I have like the winged victory of some motorists is is my Islam as a piece out of another piece that's gonna that I'm getting that on the pendant Jesus yeah it was it Romulus and what's the other brothers in Remus Remus hills Remus and Romney so apparently our society that we live in under now was the the the legend did Jamie said we started by two brothers who were nursed after after being abandoned were nursed by a wolf so Western society is built on that concept and you're gonna ask me to give up my fucking guns the fuck out of you wolf to the wolf's got chainmail around its neck exactly bro yeah I'm gonna get that on a fucking pendants gonna be like this rapper big shit that's a war wolf good thing look at that that's got its vitals protected that's crazy yeah that's what that's what we're sitting in the middle up cheese Airy Geist Erica baby suckled from wolves from wolves so what do you think the mentality of people who run outside right I saw this I saw it in the loom me and my wife was stoned as fuck that's incredibly to the loom and I was just like this I made us stared at what a freaky looking wolf to tell ya hungry and shit looks like a fucking hyena actually yeah it does it doesn't look like it's got wolf hair cuz wolves are beautiful yeah like with that that's an that wolf ain't but it's weird to decide to make a bald wolf that's a bald wolf yes like shaved yeah there's no hair on it anyway exactly show any hair who knows what the fuck wolves look like that garden they're gonna shave the hair into the rock yeah that's true too yeah it would be hard to shave it but still what a freaky idea yeah so that's what you suckled off of wolves yeah think about an SS that's the mentality to rest up in the room have you ever been have not been to royalty I went a couple of years ago for the first time it's amazing stunning yeah it's stunning antiquity is that what they call it yeah when you go to the Vatican man you walk around you realize how much these motherfuckers stole there is billions of dollars worth of art there and you're like where did you get this money selling sneakers fucking Bibles and we're gonna take all of this art hits you it's crazy yeah it's crazy yeah you know it's interesting you know when you see Roman guys with little dicks the little bang they got big dicks were discussed like big dicks were they were too savage and not civilized they had little dicks in these little statues if you look at these beautiful perfect bodies all little dicks and I was because they felt like big dicks were gross oh wow how crazy is that that's what the guy at least the professor that was guiding us little dick dude you're in the wrong century yeah you Jess you were almost there the thing is though they want something that doesn't exist right because the guy was built like that's gonna have a hog on them those guys are they're fucking Adonis's right that's beautiful you see Anthony Joshua step into the ring you go that guy's gotta have a gigantic day he has to look at him he's a fucking specimen there's no way he has right with that said if you look at bodybuilding yeah but that's a different animal they're they're breaking their body's ability to perform testosterone testosterone their nuts are shrinking it fucked up yeah it looks bad I got a picture of Ronnie Coleman that I send to my friends every now and then just as like a wake-up call yeah I save it on my phone I send it I just want you to know that this is how big people can get so why you are you're lifting weights just keep everything in perspective and always know yeah but is possible kid that's one of them Ronnie let me show you the one that I got on my phone Jamie he just had back surgery again prayers up the run I heard there's a documentary about him that's on Netflix I watch it it was a sad it was a not sad but like you feel bad just like first of all it's amazing he had that type of discipline he was eating 10,000 calories a day he was training for one hour a day doing full full training top to bottom because he was a confidence aim time and he was just a bull about it here it is so with that said he oh my god see that picture yeah that's not good I can't that's insane yeah that's insane this one it's insane yeah and now and now his his back is is savagely just betraying him yeah well he he apparently would lift so much weight yeah he's much smaller now he would lift so much weight and worked out so much harder than anybody what just look I want to send this so people can get it that's the one that we're looking at because it's so fucking first that's like when you see the picture of that bull exactly yeah yeah they have something wrong with what is that myostatin and yeah myostatin inhibitors yes that mile statin is something that parently it regulates the muscle growth and when these mile statin inhibitors when they do they either happen accidentally on dogs called whippet son have you ever seen a widow with it whippets get they have an anomaly that occurs pretty pretty rarely where they growed like double the muscle they fucking look super jacked you know yeah pull up one of those myostatin whippets okay sure there's the Ronnie Coleman picture so everybody can see it that's the one we're looking at like what in the fuck Jesus those pictures were as you're a fat guy walking into a gym do more to dishearten you the fucking happening you would have to be on everything that science has ever twice did to put that kind of mass on mass and you have to have perfect genetics you have to have everything you have to get storm Jesus Christ see if you can find those whippets the myostatin whip it let's go crazy looking it doesn't even look like a real dog it looks like someone CGI like someone's fucking with it I just made this really real dog there's they just have a weird anomaly a genetic anomaly that makes them super fucking jacked like how does that work like I'm not I like people like I like there it is no no that's real wow it's real there's a bunch of them it happens in this community for some reason I've read something about what it is about breeding that somehow or another this gene this trait has is more common in whippets than most other animals that's crazy I like the traditional style people like Pete from The Little Rascals right yeah all right the new pit bull the ones that are lower and bulkier almost like the lowest as an English Bulldog women are over muscle I always wonder how useful are they well if they get ahold of you you fucked a desk this is just insane yeah a power that those things have it's insane but it's bad for it's really when you get in a like this it's supposed to have longer legs so it can move good pit bulls were bred for a couple reasons they were bred for purposes of fighting and purposes of bringing down bull dogs run alongside the bull grab the grab nose ring drop their weight flip essentially football yes I'm just thinking ourselves as we like the aesthetics of what they look like like what are we really doing these little guys where they're fucking they're buff to shit but they're short of shit it's hard to get up a pair of steps for they have such amazing qualities because the fact they're gained bread because the the ones that are that responded negatively to people that would growl at people or show aggression to people they called them yeah so the ones that are real game dogsleds a little 35 pound males yeah those are the best dogs on the planet Earth man I've been trying to convince Shay for like they're so nice you shave every dog I'm like I just don't like Shay I'm sorry I can't do like these other rappers and get a fucking a girl dog and act like this you already make me hold your fucking purse it's like I buy these things your thousands of fucking dollars I shouldn't be having to color-coordinate because you want to fucking walk around you know hold my purse yeah I have to go to Phoenix sky it's one of her favorite stores I'm going to Phoenix Sky hold my fucking purse I'm like toilet hold your purse is up you're hilarious checkmate move the girls put on her gun is in there though so I felt a little manly but it's still a fucking Louie Vuitton purse you know but if I had a if I had a pit you're a great great great pig didn't I'd be you know I'm just like I can't get a girl dog I got you could get a little pit bull and people won't even know it's a pit bull yeah and they're nice time I told her about my oldest daughters 21 they're Anaya and we had we had a we had a pit named coca Ania for some reason didn't not like sleeping in her bed or laying down in Iowa we would have to and this is when I'm working like I'm getting up going to work at the fucking Advance Auto Parts her mom is in school in beauty school it's like we're tired we're young too young to have baby we're beat the fuck up an Iowan only sleep in her little rocker this dog was sleep directly under her and if you were not near her mother you were not walking up there touching this child well and when my daughter was awake she was her best friend she's riding like a horse you could tell her to sit stand she'd do anything but to in her eyes to her purpose in life was to make sure that this child was safe that's a man that was under pit bulls I know big boy on pitfall kennels his brother he and chains that when they they have amazing dog yeah there's a lot of those out there there's a lot of great pit bulls out there the only problem with pit bulls is they have an aggression towards other dogs they do absolutely yeah you have another dog around there's likely gonna be a scrap yeah it got to be exhausting for me I understand I had well I'm Pro one or two like my thing is I only have you should only have one or two pits you should have one pit that's dedicated to you and the family we should have two pits that are part of the family and they understand you know who's the dominant and who's the alpha do Zubaydah I had one pit that I got from the pound and she had been the pound for like five months yeah she was an la animal shelter she was only 11 months old she was a prison dog basically she just most of her life have been locked up in this little cage and that dog if bori else wanted to get pet she would get up to them and go get the fuck out of here she would show her teeth and growl at him she want anybody getting pet but her see what any other dogs tried to move in she would growl at him box him out she box him out like check them like if you're trying to pet one of the other dogs like no no no she'd get right up in there you know what I found with them they're like children and that they throw tantrums yeah so if they get lonely and they get lonely without you like they miss you yeah they'll do shit like just half the fucking sofa or the house or yeah another lottery and then you'll get there you'll call them you're looking for them and they're like oh shit I fucked up and they're hiding yeah like in the room and shit like they are on their brilliant little fuckers you know my man my man CeeLo had a bunch of great pitch back in the day so I want to get a pitbull I'm declaring that today Shana can't tell me what to do Wow that's happening as long as you're a responsible owner and train it well make sure it doesn't get loose yeah and I don't believe in fighting dogs no fuck that um there are there escape artists - you got to be careful yeah thank you fuckers can climb a fence they can climb a fence they're smart enough to open a gate yeah I've seen a run up a tree my oldest daughter has a tiny little dog and it's one of the smartest dogs I've ever seen because it's uh its parts awawa and part of Australian Shepherd dog I think but it's the only dog I've ever had where its paw got caught on the leash and it lifts its leg up and put it behind the behind the leash oh wow I've never seen a dog do that dogs get that one arm and my fuck yeah oh shit my bad and I looked at them like you little motherfucker they're smart little dude my wife had an Australian Shepherd when I met her Muffy yeah dead that's all it was a fuckin dog yeah wha-wha sort of smart more a million dog oh yeah they can be mean yeah surprisingly but the weirdest thing is that all those came from wolves everything came from a wolf yeah all of them that's nuts every dog some and I say this some people in my community but and humans evolved from monkeys that was the words of killer Mike just listening yes yeah we definitely didn't pop up just like we are I don't believe that anyway what do you think happen I don't know I don't know what happened but my wife says joking you gotta know my wife she's she's very cool very down up she's my best friend she speaks in a stick creo he like accent and she'll just say things blindly I don't know whether it was fucking hilarious and she'll we're watching planet eggs and she says you know people are getting mad about it but shit when you look at him human beings do look like monkeys I mean we probably were swinging the fuck around a few thousand oh and I'm just thinking to myself you do realize in the black community that's an insult even accomplice and she's just because she's black oh crap she's just like a man she poisoned the screen I'm just like yeah we probably fall you know and and and you know it people can have whatever debates they want to fight it for it you know I think that we act a lot just like I think human beings arrogant because we think we can communicate and we can use tools to build shit but basically we're hairless apes and you know just because we can communicate doesn't mean we're communicating the right things animals live in harmony with nature in a very different way you know I mean they kill for hunger you know I mean the Apes can't kill for reasons that are not hunger related things that they do so we know that's a part of us but I'd honestly think yeah I think we evolved from something that didn't necessarily look like us yeah yeah that may have swam from tree we're the most advanced of the primates but we exhibit characteristics so we can see in the lower primates and if you pay attention to all the top scientists who have been studying human evolution they're all pretty much in agreement that there was something that we were all similar to and they all branched off in a bunch of different ways it's amazing they keep finding new forms of people - yeah I saw I just found S&O via Interstate that's the one from Russia so do you think yeah look do you think ailing is really pop down fucked a monkey and you know not much later any we go look that would be the most fun yeah I think so I think if a pit stop happened and what was the movie that was really crappy not as good as it should have been that was the aliens like precursor or something that was shelled essentially where they meet yes Prometheus right they should have been very good in theater but yeah I think I think the depth that's the possibility alien chick hanging out at the moon say yo look at the blue flies to fucking go see this and say yo pilot money looks great fuck the shit out of it got out of there and the next thing you know you have warm pestilence and violence and poverty and MMA mmm and joints but one monkey that excelled is now a he passed way past all the other ones like one invention the invent the ability to communicate and the ability that having opposable thumbs the ability to communicate and then it started advancing as soon as it started talking started figuring out ways to express itself to each other and then they start making things and they're off to the races the next thing you know a couple hundred thousand years later the world's different people it's like this thing erupts and then just covers the world with its shit yeah and that's us how do you subscribe to the theory that we just may be a virus and the earth may be getting rid of us well no one would like to think that right but the reason you call a virus something it's just an word that's been assigned to a living organism in a system yeah by by medical science I mean we all know what a virus is it's a real thing it's amazing these brilliant people have discovered it and come up with vaccines to stop and prevent them but it's a some sort of a life form really essentially yeah now if we looked at the earth as being a living organism and we should sure it's certainly you can make an argument that it's a kind of a life form yeah that it's a host of massive amounts of life yeah of all the life you would think that maybe some of those things would not be in harmony just like some of those things in a human body aren't in harmony Yeah right your gut bacteria is off or you got a cold because there's bacteria in your body that you picked up from a fucking yeah bathroom somewhere or whatever your solutely all that stuff could easily apply to how human beings interact with the earth are we the virus don't act like because when you got a look at at some point the earth is oh you or the theory is it's a living breathing organism here's what I could say for sure okay we are the virus to the ocean because we don't even it at what and think about it yeah that's life yeah before we were monkeys we were something that crawled out of the ocean right right imagine that earth the ocean was I mean I don't know what it was like we are hunting 100 really style this is where our fans wanted to go we're still in this fuck I don't know what the ocean was like a couple hundred thousand years ago before people really became what we are to tool-using you know people that figured out how to get out into the ocean and capture fish who imagine if you could see it imagine if you could see an image of how many fucking fish were out there 200,000 years ago versus how many are now it's like they live next to a vampire that just keeps sucking the life out of it I bet we've killed 50 percent of all life in the ocean that's what I'm saying we have to think of ourselves at some point you gotta say maybe the best thing human beings could do for the earth is to end humanity maybe but maybe viruses are there for a reason too maybe that it all needs to exist that means to be some sort of a balance we're always trying to eliminate bad things maybe they do serve some sort of weird fucking purpose yeah so even even in that we fire purposes healers that's the talent of humans the ability to adjust and make logic out of us being here yeah well and to keep moving and make more of us just China make it to the moon they grew cotton on the moon apparently already right yeah they grew something in the moment it died yeah it died quickly I was happy that it was that cotton because seeing is how their their being is investor in Africa and China was growing cotton that didn't go well for black people five hundred years ago so I was just like please don't let kangaroo I don't want the trans melanic slave trade to starting I have to learn Mandarin this shit so you do you think they actually set up shop before us or as America's still number one because it feels like I feel like we lost that day we went China landed on the moon yeah I feel like I feel like oh shit you know you know I've grown up being you know like I'm black I'm American but I like I like America yeah exactly I feel like we're bad like Frederick Douglass when actually leave was out and I answered you know what the fuck am I leave for when I saw something like the moon landing the China with the growing the plants and landing there there what what what exactly was it was it a what what was the kind of ship that they landed on the moon I'm gonna put one on the zone apparently some type of role on the dark side though right on the side that we didn't make it to or just went and tell me you love it was a drone right you know what it was some sort of a drone I think of that I honestly think about that as a win for science and for innovation I don't think about in terms of like nations because I feel like that is done by scientist that's done by the Wizards and the job so are you saying we're gonna steal the scientists because when Kennedy gave the fucking speech Kennedy made it seem like the moon landing was gonna make us the preeminent nation and I think that's the propaganda China's gonna rolling you don't think well I think they have some fucking amazing technology to deny that would be ridiculous but I also think that it's important that everybody everybody be competitive in this like if you really want to make things better you're not gonna you you're not gonna do that in a vacuum god what helps the technological innovation in one of the reasons why it's so accelerated is there's so many people working on it it's not just a few people trying to make cell phones better I gotta fucking so many geniuses out there so when I see something like this like they landed on the moon I go genius is one you just hope yeah they're Chinese people but they're just people we're all just people absolutely you know and the idea that they're gonna all get those people on that side to think the same way is what we're worried about right that we're it'd be us versus them and their technology's gonna impact our life the way we frame it at the country yeah we always worry about that you know you have to admit that that's what that's the way we frame it but if you look at the history the world that's been that happened so many times I think it makes sense to be worried about the rest of the world I get it you know I'm on and I'm on this side of the fence so you know and no problem with that but you know know if if radar October's gonna happen tomorrow fuck man I think Russians don't hate us I don't think anybody has a quarrel with anybody over there it's the government's it's what the Hustle is that the real interaction is between a very small amount of people that involves all these are the people that are with them for some strange reason I think they should just be thrown essentially in a stadium to fight to their death Putin would be the king of the world fuck everybody of him in that other dude that runs the other little country next door that was on recession yeah yeah yeah yes that guy is a huge supporter of MMA be a fuckin badass yeah yeah there's some beefs over there truce okay you know bad Putin would fuck up Trump oh Christ you can't a fight to the death with Putin I would actually probably bet Putin vs. Obama - yeah for sure look Obama is probably better in a debate yeah exactly that's what I'm saying he's like Alan I think you'd have to go all the way first one I think was badass maybe as a younger man I mean you two leave the CIA you got to have some killer yes you know what tough guy but I probably have to get all the way back to Kennedy in terms of physical prowess and his back was bad I think he got to go to Abraham Lincoln Lincoln he was wiring we had that farmer farmer strength he did why are you so old dudes back then we had to carry everything trail they didn't you know farm work was real work it's his favorite carry their own thing everywhere all those dudes are just wiry as fuck he was a wrestler too yeah all right yeah so he's beloved in my community we like him a lot no I get it gross little thing called Emancipation Proclamation did you see that stupid fucking movie where they had him as a vampire slayer' did you ever see that no I saw the trailer and decided maybe that's not the war for me you know it was wonder what you have for your kids don't actually to go see ya did Jamie didn't you say it was based on a graphic novel yeah yeah so it was like a fun comic book that somebody made and then they turned into a movie as a movie it was like so weird as a graphic novel probably worked better yeah there's some things that work that stay in their way yeah right like there's some ring like that movie though who says question that's it there's a fun movie I mean it was dumb and fun man but I'm just saying though that's it I liked it yeah but who gets it like who gets that movie who wears what like the pitch me Yeah right so Abraham Lee he's gonna kill vampires from the fire with an axe what what yeah they probably said another president first and they said who and then they say a rally what's up chased by Tim Burton so oh I love that dude he's wacky though he back east of yeah Beetlejuice - yeah yeah yeah yeah he's so yellow can we get a John Woo film soon can we get another hard-boiled or the killer that we get when was the last May it's been a long time and as American movies although good were nothing like well nothing like the foreign films yeah hyper violent stylistically beautiful slow motion was used crazy him or Tarantino I just love to drop a movie this year yeah I think his style heavily influenced John wick oh yes 181 right oh yes BAM sorry yes I was fuck I love John we move desperate hyper violence hyper violence beautiful old school cars too yeah well the soap that me on the guns the magic of the slow-moving suit in the lead characters yeah no reasons bad asthma dress is impeccably to go assassinate people perfect perfect attire it dissolves yes I mean come on man driving around a 70 Chevelle SS male Mach 1 come on come on trail that's a that movies amazing that is really the second one I liked I loved the first second I think I'm want a lot love the third I'm hoping please I didn't see any cars though I saw the previews I didn't see cars I saw motor so I just gotta give him a car you gotta give him a car people to understand men want to go to see that car motorcycles bring out the teenage boys oh yeah that's true I remember ordering cycle world I even have a motorcycle my mom like you you're gonna get a magazine issues I Cora that's true right muscle concert for old men young age boys want ninja bikes oh let me tell you something I want to share the secret with the world I people notice all white guys and young black men has the same interest they both like young black women they both like muscle cars they both like slightly gaudy jewelry you know not working and money you know I'm saying but muscle car the crowd if you go to meet them auction you're gonna see like you know young black guys who and and all white guys talking you know talking to one another it's one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen that's Larry that's out to Mike and Oh God metal me come coming from Amica marks there's a bunch of those auctions right these barrett-jackson because you need cover so is the working man's barrett-jackson oh what's the difference meet you can actually afford the cars that you know bear Jackson is beautiful cars but you know you're going you don't spend more money they got cars you can get four but Barrett Barrett but with that said they say the inspection process is better and Myka meet them as the guy was a blue-collar guy might have retired but he wants to go there ox and he goes here's a great car he's probably gonna know something about cars and look it over itself mmm-hmm yeah man there's something about the camaraderie of a fellow muscle car enthusiast yes you know when you could find a dude who's also just as stupid as you yeah about the poor money and something that's never gonna fully make you happy is you want to be there's some guys that I'm friends with it's like this I there's an extra bond because they're just as stupid about cars as I am man shouts out to my man Ron Paul you've given more shouts out than anyone in this is what you're supposed to do shouts out to Ron Paul and Mike Musto Michael yep Mike has my 96 Impala which I got from Shawna Donald's hope you chefs after Shawn got it from him got the 96 Impala with under with under 1,100 miles on it at the time Ron did some slight adjustment works over at for Giotto just make the car even beautiful just tweaked it lowered it a little bit there's some cool stuff and Mike featuring itself that's nice yeah yeah I have different people that are pockets in my life that love you so as I'm shouting people out I appreciate you letting me do a bit you know I know they'll appreciate it you know that's awesome Joe fucking Rogen thank you your killer fucking money yes it's a big deal I'm here that Mike my station was here I know it was I'm alright back to Mike Musto talking about how weird it was to meet Mike Tyson here just so it's so strange to hang out and talk to him party he's so iconic that whenever you're around impart there's like 10% of you that has to go holy shit it's Mike Tyson's no matter what else you're sayings 10% of your brain is going holy shit that's Mike Tyson well you showed the clip of the 51 year old Mike Tyson hitting the bag I remember it as a child he was the first person I see I have two dads I have a non bio on a bio dad and I he was the first person I had seen in my life I say this guy could probably beat my dad you know like everybody else you know Mike because my dad's a pretty tough guy had been a policeman pretty good his hands my bio dad I mean my novel father six-foot-seven you know he played offensive tackle on same high school teams Richard day so I got some pretty you know badass dad's not they're acting tough they just you feel protected as a child right I already see him Mike Tyson it's like he hit with such vicious and evil intent it was amazing yeah he could still do it yeah that's what I saw he was in the bag like he's still terrified yeah if he was a young contender coming up you would look at him and go wow this guy can punch yeah he doesn't have nearly the hand speed that he had when he was young look at that yeah that was the peak he's an amazing story though man listening to him describe his childhood and how custom Otto had hypnotized him yeah that was amazing cuz I had never heard him talk about that before and that's what people need to understand like who he was he people want to say oh he was he was hyper aggressive and he did terrible things and he was violent in this think of how this kid grew up how's it orphaned yes he was literally or taken in by this one guy the first time in his life where anything is positive and it's all about fighting and being a destroyer and he gets hypnotized by this guy to be a destroyer and he's a physical specimen he really is you put your hand grab it's just his hand like his whole body's like carved out of a a large block of rock he's a tank of a man Wow you know still to this day he's a tank and when he was young they saw that right away Teddy Atlas said on this podcast that when Mike was 13 he weighed a hundred and ninety pounds they didn't believe he was 13 they thought it were sandbagging they put him in a 16 he said yeah okay say 16 nobody would believe he's 13 they would come on who's showing his fucking kids too they didn't want to believe it and he just let him have it okay okay you don't because he said people were always lying about how many fights people had they would always say he's only had 10 fights and you see the guy move immediately I'm like oh my god this guy's had 50 fights yeah but watching him and Teddy was saying that that was always the hustle that everybody always lied a little bit about someone's record and when they saw Mike Tyson at 13 weighing 190 pounds some people that had just built perfect for certain things he was built to be that he's built perfect from bobbin and Weavin and getting tight and he was so fucking fast his hooks and uppercuts oldness I which fighter has that uppercut like the legs loose had a tremendous uppercut yeah yeah there's there some fighters today Joshua as a tremendous upper uppercut yeah there's some different you know amazing talent today but it's like what Mike had done was revitalize the entire country's image of the heavyweight division yeah he's having for a while and no disrespect but there was guys that just like Pinklon Thomas was a champion and Tony Tubbs they weren't the kind of guy that you like look forward to seeing as being the champion the world you didn't believe it like I don't believe that's the toughest car yeah well it might be a tough guy I'm sure he's a tough guys a professional boxer but I don't think that's the best guy and then Tyson came along there he is yeah my perfect name had the perfect look he had the perfect body of the perfect image and he came at the perfect time yep might when you look at hip-hop and where it was and where Mike was at the time it was a perfect synergy for him to become a hero Mike Tyson Mike Jordan like these people became icons at a time where the United States like in the 80s after getting up a kicking ass in the debt crisis fucking up the 70s Iran shit at the end of seventies early eighties I steal I remember my grandfather works at Hall still remember steal mother grandfather still leaving America I remember like it's just kind of being like it wasn't his proud yeah and he was one of those things that made you feel badass and the times feel dangerous and he was black and those little boxes he didn't wear the boots wasn't flashy like he was a perfect villain at a time where villainy NWA you know I'm saying yeah it was was celebrated danger oh yeah I think he was perfect for the times and I think he's perfectly now like what Mike is when I hear him interview and I really talking people make fun of his list but whatever and I think that gets in the way of you hearing the real wisdom he's saying a lot of times yes like mike has repeatedly talked about change and about growth and about how he doesn't see things the same thinking we actually listened to that it kind of challenged us to do the same shit that we really don't want to do he's one of the rare guys that you'll talk to that accomplished an insane amount literally became one of the most famous boxers in the history of the sport and you talk about him now and all he wants to do is dismiss that past life yeah he wants a it's you like I was a I was silly look out look at me I'm a silly person yeah like he's a real warrior like he's he is like in a classic kung fu film he's the reluctant teacher almost mm-hmm you know he's you know you do you do you you know you do a you do a movie Mike is the guy who you as a student go to beg to teach you to fight and you want one that you want to know why he won't teach you and it's because you found out later your teacher killed someone you know in the ring or some shit like he is he is really that character he is a he's you could tell even with the pigeons back in the days that there's kindness and love in there somewhere yeah and now he gets to express it to human beings you just see he's a happier person you know until you bring up dark Kings ain't yeah don't do that yeah and then then you get scared like he's gonna fucking beat me up and my dad he the crazy thing about him selling weed now is that he they chart what did he charge him three hundred thousand dollars I think free tested positive for the Andrew Golota fight for weed so they find him three hundred thousand dollars they just stole money from him cuz he had weed in the system now he sells weed they should let everybody smoke it it's good for your brain if you're if you're especially if you're doing something like slamming into each other running 30 miles an hour yeah it's probably good to give them something to calm them down or release some of the inflammation yeah I mean grown adults telling you you can or can't do it it's just what's ridiculous about a grown adult telling you they can't the ones who say you shouldn't smoke weed they don't do it they don't they don't know what they're talking the ones who do or don't or the ones who have and like I don't do it anymore I don't like to get high anymore those guys you're like okay I get it used to you don't like to do it fucks with your productivity whatever I get it but if you never done it and you're talking shit about it you don't even know the benefits you really there's benefits too there's definitely some people get fucked up by everything whether it's weed or alcohol or speed people get fucked up some people get fucked up by benadryl yes but I can honestly tell you that I read an article in Huff Post or something years ago that talked about parents who smoked and stoners actually being more engaged with their Tunes though that doesn't mean you get up and you get fried the first thing in the morning take your kid to school but it does mean that we're drinkers or smokers would come home and almost avoid the child to smoke or drink or do something else we're had other things going on stoner would literally pop up may take a hit or two of the joint and the focus would be more on just being the child parenting kind of kicking it cooling it yeah you're way more curious when you're high so if you're just a little bit high and you're around kids your your would be thinking more the way they're thinking or trying to be a little calmer with them and a little bit more a little bit more patient it makes you a more relaxed person absolutely because the anxiety is given to you mm-hmm shouts out the Shaolin writing to God shit was talked about and he talked very openly about anxiety in that he's one yeah these are the people I'd like to see you bring up - is it grateful I got that on tape - I got that one in audio it's nice I was listening - I was running yeah like man there's because he reads it yeah we don't acknowledge that like in the african-american community kidney disease is something that places and they're not just diet carrying around stress and and all that anxiety is bad for your kidneys that's where you're feeling stress beats up the most yeah I think it's very important for all of us to be honest about how we feel it doesn't make you weak it just makes it makes you brave enough to be able to express honestly what everybody is probably feeling but it scared to bring up because they don't want to be thought of as weak yeah they don't want to be a whiny bitch yeah so I don't want to tell you what's going on it's wrong but especially something like anxiety meant the delicate balance of chemicals that exist in the human mind and how much it can be affected by stress and relationships and life in general and your diet and all these other factors and then there's genetic issues and some some people just have problems yeah a while tired and you can get help you can get help and get help through cognitive therapy you can get help through the medication there's a lot of people that believe that ecstasy should help people but they should be able to do MDMA therapy for a lot of people with stress it's a lot of talk of that now and now that thing your body you making the decision on what to put in it yes it's more in line with right than wrong well especially if there's science behind it yeah like if they if they allowed it to be legal then you would you would allow it to be regulated which means you would allow it to be like you would know exactly how many milligrams of this is in this and how much you should take if you weigh a hundred and twelve pounds versus you weigh 212 pounds that all those things should be taken in consideration by scientists absolutely and if we had that if we just had freedom I could see that yeah I think there huh but they're having a lot of studies or a lot of success rather with veterans and treating veterans with MDMA and maps you know Maps the psychedelic organization know rid of them there are an organization that is working to try to make psychedelics legal and one of the things they're pushing initially is this MDMA study that they've done with veterans and they're showing a significant benefit in reduction of PTSD and stress from veterans who come home and they've seen a lot of shit over there and they're just you know fucked up from it and it seems to be one of the best things I've ever found and discovered for alleviate the other thing that they've used it on is I think John Hopkins had one they did with psilocybin same sort of result give people psychedelics under controlled situations and they have a big alleviation of stress from the past they can let things go I got introduced to mushrooms Oh Cass DJ and that was a beautiful experience I'd reduced my wife to one because of that hmm yeah so I can I can definitely see that yeah there's something to them yeah for sure there is me and I'll do me and I'll enjoy mushrooms while we make music do you really yeah mushrooms wheat and whisky under a whiskey drink some tequila or what I call the others tequila mezcal is it yeah yeah he drinks mezcal I drink whiskey and Dom shrooms and we usually we had drunk ants in here from yesterday apparently Richard Rawlings brought this cinnamon tequila and some of it spilled on the table and the ants had found it pop up everywhere they were everywhere they were drunk there was a just old giant line of them like they found the fucking bar in the middle of space and got at it yeah they found it and when we got here was covered in ants drunk aunts my wife made me hang out at a bar all night last night with her and her friend they got shit-faced drunk threw up in the uber nice running through the hallway in their underwear back at the hotel that sounds like good night yeah growing up in the uber like how many times does that happened to those poor bastards yeah I took the goddamn $200 I'm sorry bro you know how much puke a large amount not but enough to be aggravated so she had a bag so you know you think that the bag catches but it wasn't plastic you know I thought it gave a little leak it's hard to get that smell out that puke smell yeah cost about 150 bucks to get a Pew smell out really that shit is in your body like imagine if you turn yourself inside out I smell the penis first part of the morning but puke smelled is something that's why I don't like yoga hot yoga rather regular yoga I can endure why don't you like it because hot yogurt no fart like yo man moms are farting you know straight up um you gonna hide yo you ever do hot yoga you ever had a hot chick convince you to do that shit it's like my wife's hot so she could talk to me in the most dumb shit right so yeah we're gonna fuckin hot yoga yeah hot moms tits asses yo this shit you got a block for me to sit in this fight whoo bitch - too far up second yeah like I know my wife far that's not my wife fart and then you say fuck it you start farting oh no man you know that shit laughs yeah yes I don't I don't fuck with hot yogurt I'd rather just do regular yoga and then to just sauna that shit out like you yeah um I like hot yo girl I like it you know fart tell truth I don't I do it acid okay but I know first thing in the morning respect you know one farts though Oh people for Forsch people fart if you go to the early classes okay all right rolls yeah yeah there's a couple different places that I go to but I like going to the early class the same day sometimes most the time no all the time no Dumbledore I have if I have an injury if I have something that's fucking with me but if I do that I almost consider it like a sauna because you get so goddamn hot like the room might only be 104 degrees but when you're working out hard doing yoga your body is poor and sweat you must be heated up as warm as you get in a sauna it feels the same way to me it feels like almost like I'm trying to work out in the sauna not sure there's doing some study now on you know at Harvard about it about heat shock proteins and and hot yoga and you know how much inflammation it reduces and how beneficial is to you I forget what scientists were involved in it but a bunch of people were talking about it the other day I know it definitely gets gas out your ass it definitely does well if you have something that you shouldn't be like you eat a hotdog with sauerkraut and a coke and then two hours later try to go to yoga class you're a criminal you're a terrible person and there's nowhere for that fart to go either it's stuck in the day yeah that's the thing it stays there but if you get the real earthy chicks they burn sage and then they suffocate you and you got a leader the real earthy chicks yeah you do you know sage someone told me this check and see if this is right we might have talked about this before salvia is sage salvia divinorum someone said is like the same shit as sage really yeah I know a lot Shaye burn sage use a sage burner first I couldn't really really like the way it smelled and now it's almost addictive like it's a beautiful smell it's a weird smell it is weird someone said it's like related to to salvia divinorum like there's so closely related they think that that might have been why they call it sage that's so did you get those sound off stage you get a little buzz or something I don't know I've never really I've never caught a sage buzz yeah I mean but it does calm you like the vibe like I walk in the room and I smell it now I instantly feel just like yeah the sages the common sages official name is salvia offense and novice or some so it's like a cousin the salvia Jane or I'm sort of like genius mmm believe it solid I never know if I could say genus or genis I always panic on that one I believe its genus so that's uh I wonder if that's where the name sage came from because the sage is a wide / a wise person it came from the use of some trippy plants could be it might be or might just have some other strange what find out like what's the origin of the word sage oh and it's in the mint family so that makes it why is it called sage sage was once considered a medical additional cure-all sage is an herb that has a sweet yet savory flavor sage but technically known as salvia officinalis is native to the Mediterranean region sage sages botanical name comes from the Latin word salver which means to be saved huh interesting so why do they call it sage then so someone calls it salvia and salvia whatever the fuck it is and then we call it sage why do we change the name that still doesn't doesn't say why we change the name I thought botanical name makes sense it comes from the word salver meaning to be saved that makes sense but why sage do you mean like we like in English yeah why do you say so they stopped at it from however they were using it back in the Mediterranean region whatever word they use very close but they always like treat you like you're stupid like you have to have a botanical name like bitch just tell me the name what's the name why does it have two names what is it what is it sage or is it Fosca Midas I have a toast to sama mean yes he's sage definitely yeah it's crazy ask names you guys want to give them absolutely scientists they're all like look I will tell you let you have let you make your own little name for yeah you go what do you want little people there you go people that don't understand science let's just call it sage that's right sage you can't pronounce that salvat salvia norm can't do it have you ever experienced that stuff salvia no that's what that was one of the ones that slipped through the 1970s psychedelic tack they had a sweeping act that made a bunch of things illegal including apparently some of the things they made illegal aren't even psychoactive they just try to make everything illegal but they miss salvia so you used to be able to buy it used to be able to go to a gas station and buy salvia and trip your fucking balls off what's it what's the salvia trip like it's I only did it once and it was really weird it was like I don't think I did enough because I Ari Shaffir had a entire life he lived for three months in one salvia trip that took ten minutes we talked to him about his the craziest fucking story he had relationships and breakups and jobs and and he lived a different life and then woke up on the couch in ten minutes underwater yeah he lived underwater right yeah yeah dude just trapping balls on this stuff that you could buy from the gas station SSI it was crazy I try I try to stay in very dense indicas so there are times where I yeah very distant again the mushrooms kind of take me on a trip E riot yeah but I don't I don't know how far I want to go that's the skiers re right there that's him tripping they got it all on video oh yeah him and this is some stuff that you I don't know if it's legal anymore I think they've made it illegal but used to be able to buy it virtually anyway head shops they also they all carried it and it's so much more potent than weed but yet legal and has a long history of people using it to it straight tripping so what I did it I didn't get any of that but I did get a third I wouldn't want you to be that tripping you're a strong guy you know your your stocks yeah you don't want it you don't want to have to be the homie to save the homie from itself and the homies to physically fit Herschel Walker's trippin bad Herschel Walker's kicking his own ass you know Sam Ronnie Coleman you would literally have to have Costas eyes of Ronnie Coleman and then he'd still be fucked they would still be fuck you'd be fucked yeah I saw myself from like outside my body like like but pulsate in my body and outside my body in my body now it's on my body from like over here yeah looking down on myself yeah my mom but she had she died on the table for a few seconds Jesus and she said she saw herself I wonder what that is because that's the same thing that everybody says I mean regardless of your religious beliefs just stop for a second and try to figure out why so many people see themselves from above their body see themselves outside their body like what is that well we know what I mean I mean all all people at any of in science kind of agree at this point the body is just a vehicle of sorts yeah machine of sorts that whatever energy or Salwa sphere wonder if you trying to identify this it's within it but it does disconnect out imagine I'm hoping that they figure out how to put my soul in a computer before I die I'd like to live a couple hundred more years fuck off what if it sucks though yeah what if trying to be alive dude if you're if you're in a computer you can't die no I'm saying if you're 89 you're about to get the fuck out of here you got the opportunity to upload right and 229 again for the next 29 years like he'll fuck that I might try that before I decide to click on either you know I think they're gonna be able to reverse aging and I think they're gonna be able to do that before they're gonna figure out a way to get you into a machine we'll see I think the real problem would be a guy like Trump putting himself in like a million machines just not one not one like someone has like a Ted Turner bankroll says yeah I like about a million kids in this town starts breeding Ted's yeah but but robots what Trump ain't got Ted money no he might not happen but he's got money for a few robots yeah yeah yeah those robots will go out and make more money our robots gonna destroy us that's a very good question yeah and that's something that Elon Musk is actually scared of really yeah that's something a little Duvall says it's gonna happen if they roll he's a very intelligent got to just besides making a good record he talks about us essentially replacing each other with robots soon it's entirely possible well the way Elon Musk looks at it is he was trying to warn people but they weren't listening and that there's no telling how powerful they could get once they become sentient once they start taking control their own destiny and creating new robots and and just deciding whether or not we live or die and how they're gonna run things they're essentially they're gonna become a life-form an artificial life-form yes way fucking smarter than us yeah and he's saying do you think it's smart to arm these things you see it's smart to make this like he's look at it in terms of he's the tip of the spear right and it comes to technology and an implementation of it I mean think about who this guy is right if he's the one who's telling you everybody's kind of slow the fuck down this is dangerous you literally might be making a Terminator movie yeah you literally might be making a Terminator movie yeah we have to worry because we when were you're saying that you think we evolved from monkeys we evolved from some lower thing well the idea is that we get to keep going well if we might hit a biological bottleneck and that might be the whole convergence of humans and technology that might be what it's all about like biologically this system doesn't move fast enough but if we can transcend this and move into some sort of a digital life that life we can accelerate all of the innovation all of the the improvements in insane numbers lightyears so travel through time yes change the fucking nature of life itself that's gonna probably be one of the stages of our future whether it's a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand years from now it seems to me like with this adoption of science and into our daily lives in terms of like the technologies that we're all addicted to phones and tablets and all these different things often say he says that we're a cyborgs already extension easer this is just a rudimentary way yeah he's right for sure right you're already living people already living through this oh yeah yeah yeah and he's also coming out with something called neural link I don't exactly know what it was he was very vague about it who's saying it was gonna change the bandwidth to change your your like your ability to access information and people are gonna wear it you know wear this thing on your head it's gonna literally charge up your fucking brain some strange like strange days but he couldn't he couldn't explain too much about it but he was saying it was gonna come out in a few months what enough fuck man we're we were you know 30 or 40 years away from being unrecognized that's what I think I think we're thirty or forty years away from being living in what's at the time living in a virtual world half the time live in an augmented world I think people gonna exist in these weird worlds where it feels real and isn't I think they're gonna come out with programs that are fun at first but then become life consuming or you put on these fucking goggles and this suit and you go into this world and you live with these people interact we touch each other but no one's there physically but you feel like you are and it's magically like you're living in an avatar you're on Pandora you're hanging out with the blue people got you with the Navi that shit could happen don't you literally get to a point where you believe you're there or we could be there now we could be there yeah that's a sneaky sneaky argument right yeah but that that that's the truth of it it is a truth right could be that we could be there we could be a part of a simulation here that's nothing that you on my side oh my god dammit you're supposed to say no you're supposed to say no it's impossible deja vu could be just a glitch yeah sure so I just try to live like my grandpa said just enjoy the regular shit as much as you can you know maybe I won't upload maybe I just don't want to go early and then the fun stops but I think that there's a beauty and now that I'm getting older I guess I see a beauty in in the life death cycle mmm I want to die now I don't wanna die tomorrow you know that's what I'm telling self the fucking treadmill goddammit you know what my grandparents were always adamant about not going an old folks home and I used to think it was about they didn't want to be treated bad they thought we forget about him something they never wanted to stop living so my grandmother died in my arms walking up a hill to my granddaughter Tim to her great granddaughters my daughters on pre-k graduation and my grandfather died fishing which was his greatest love next to my grandmother you know I mean and they I realized that their life never stops they literally died living so I guess that's that's that's maybe ultimately what the real thing you should think about is whether we're in the machining outside of it you know live the best possible life you shouldn't be trying to escape your life with goggles or even a phone you know this shit is to be lived I agree unless this is the goggles yeah putting goggles on inside the goggles like mirrors looking at mirrors movie and then we figure out who we really are could be me that would be the ultimate mind fuck if you put on the goggles one day and you realized you got to get out of here man no I do not I'm just you make me think of something I'm just stoned and I think that I forgot the fucking name wheels ìbut there's an exhibit at the High Museum I'm on the board of the High Museum right and there's an exhibit there about Japanese artists and it involves debt it is the infinity mirrors ticket so is um Yayoi he's got it Osama it's a bum you got it yeah so anyway kusang yeah yeah I'm not I'm not good I'm not good at that but in federa I'm taking my daughter I'm taking my key when I invent my keys in 11 girl exactly and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna probably hit a joint a couple times I mean we're Ober down and I'm gonna walk through this museum and she usually doesn't like going with me because people kind of sometimes they'll recognize me and it bothers her if she's really trying to hang out with dad you know I mean but I'm gonna get a chance to walk through there was just me and her kicking solo dolo and just experience that with her just that you see the cobbles and off to the mirrors on mirrors so I'm looking forward to having like that's dope that looks amazing yeah yeah fuck that's incredible yeah I'm on the board I mean I got asked I'm a rapper when was this Museum this is the High Museum in Atlanta we have one of the most premium beautiful modernist museums in the country we it's greatly supported I'm on the board our the greater issue how do you have the time to do all this shit you making me feel lazy but man I just I stopped doing as much dumb shit just decided to be a responsible husband and dad and go stripclub couple times a week said everyday I'm sleepy shots out too sleepy I miss you bro but they axe men for harmoo for how long dr. humble picot and I know I'm saying his last name wrong is an artist who my wife owns his piece he did the rap music cover my wife has a piece on loan to the Carlos Museum at Emory University he's wondering he's just he's going to be a Basquiat like artist intern of how he's talked about and more he's an amazing human being an artist we're lucky enough to own some of his works he's on the board and he suggested that me and a guy named Kenyon it worked over at Interscope beyond be brought to and they met us and they accept it and I'm like you out understand I grew up about four or five miles from this place and for most kids this place was an impossibility to go to because their imagination wouldn't let them do it right so you're in these cities a lot of times you have very poor or working class areas that are right next to things that are inspiring but kids are not brave enough to break the filtering goal because they're never encouraged to Ted Turner and the High Museum and things like that have always made it very accessible so when Ted Turner are on the praising Hawks if you got bees an age you got tickets to the game alright so you can see baseball part of reason baseball down in the cities is because the stadiums moved out and you couldn't see it right the High Museum and the Woodridge found that Woodruff foundation so which is a cope charity gave me and two other kids a scholarship to go train on Saturdays to draw and paint stuff like that so this museum has been in my life since I was a kid so being actually getting on the board was just a huge honor and especially having an eleven year old now they're probably gonna want to be an artist man it makes me the coolest dad in our life so yeah plus like what a thing on the resume yeah just looks so sophisticated I know right I get to go buy a jacket and slippers one of them jackets with the leather patches on the head one of those scholarly gentlemen perhaps even I have a pipe into some tobacco yeah I got class man yeah man for sure that's cool that's cool you're involved in all those different things yeah it's very inspiring you know you're doing a lot of shit you honestly have a mind for it yeah you know it's like have you always been entrepreneurial like that have you always been I never I just didn't want to be poor hmm I just repeat the world treats poor people pay it you know I didn't grow up poor I grew up working class so you're taught to work that's what you do yeah and I didn't like working I knew I was I know I was lazy by nature so you got to figure out but it's cool you applied that as well as you're still artistic yeah oh you're still very creative you know your raps are good your fucking flow is great I get your rap great yeah I got I got a thousand if I was a fighter I probably a multi style fighter I have I have the ability to get on attraction rap next to TI and Big Boi you know next to bumpy and you know project pad and next to LP and be something totally different every time I've been blessed with some talent you know I mean and um I'm glad that I got with L because L is L is like the Freddie Roach of producing and rapping right he's a great fight coach for me when I first heard his beats I was like no one in the world rats vinarov his be sent me I'm supposed to be rapping over his beats so he was always supposed to do three beats on my first album on rap music but I went into a fucking campaign to make him do the album so I start calling them like this how he became friends like yo so you know man when records are dough you know we got to finish them up yeah yeah man I'm working on my album yeah man I'm still right remember I gotta get yourself a yeah you gotta make sure but so what's up don't mean you need to do the whole album bro I can't do it alright call back a couple days so you thought about it thought about what well we talked about we talked about about you doing my whole album you know I told you know now you didn't mean that bro Italy finally just a cover I think you got a copy probably compensate here some more money he was just like fuck it and we became friends in man I truly believed that like you know he is he's my Gus tomorrow in terms of being able to put me in focus and training like Freddie Roach how you see Freddie Roach bring things out of Fighters that you know are in them but no one knows how to bring out and yeah L does L does that so the discipline you know I've gotten with him it's great that's the great thing about partnering you know your weaknesses are kind of you can identify and fix them you know because you have someone training there with you right there right you feel inspired by your partner absolutely yeah and I love them for it yeah when two people really enjoy each other's company and and benefit from each other's presence and get inspired by each other the two become bigger than just one plus one absolutely absolutely that's why I you know I make sure when I when I'm introduced you know another sudden you know Joe Rogan's people know I'm Michael render killer Mike but another place I always say you know first and foremost on Michael render because my mom named me killer Mike's a character that I enjoy playing you know and I'm Shay's husband and one half run Jools these things are more than just who I am they make significant you know change in my life if I live up to the honor in those titles and you know I'm a better person so eldest my relationship is a very important one second maybe only to my life yeah and your way of discussing this too it's since you're a fun guy and you're an inspirational guy in terms of your work ethic and all the things even chief when you say things like that you talk about your word and you talk about who you are that's very powerful to young people coming up because they'll hear that they'll hear how smart you are and how well-read you are and how much you understand about the business and and in life it's in general and then they hear how your thought process works and it'll help them you know mature their own thought process gravitate towards positive things it's very beneficial hey Thank You Man I mean I learn a lot like I listening to you check checking out the guest you bring on just pick it up from area I just believe it picking up whatever yeah well that's all I'm doing man I'm just picking up with an antenna that spreads it out yeah it's a hell of a job thank you do I have a weird gig yeah I know but you do it like your main job is making people laugh and your fucking side hustle is making keep making people think that's that's an amazing style house over honey it's overwhelming though sometimes so sometimes I do so many of them and I do some of them on subjects where I'm not even well-read yeah I don't exactly know if his guess is being honest or if they're you know but you're learning right that's how your filter that's not you like that's how you count out you fall in the shit you don't you know like you don't you don't wake up and no yeah you wicked wake up curious and you can search and you're honest you have an honest and an integrity with your audience where you say I was wrong about this or I've learned to picked up more of this I think that's what it's really about you know I mean I don't think it's about being right or knowing all the time you your forum is very dope because it's conversational and not contrived it really is me having the ability to as we're talking you know Google research had these notes you I don't know if you know well of course you don't dick rectory sure an amazing comic what an amazing reason why we know about the Zapruder film it's exactly get ready brought it to her although Rivera I knew this man his last three years of life first of all first meeting him he cursed me in t-i-is though he'd stolen the tires off his car right why would he say well me and T I just kind of got on like two hokey rappers that kind of saw them you know it's you know we're we've embraced the fact that our community looks at us as leaders right we're not trying to be dr. King or Macklin but we're businessmen we're rappers we have accountability and responsibility in our community so we accept some of what comes with that and we are willing to do things so in considering protesting considering you know talking to politicians on the behalf tweet and you have to consult with elders so we get on the phone with them like you know so what do we do like kids are getting shot how should we be engaged should we wait should we march in March March nigga what the fuck you go March fuck we marched 50 years ago you know pedals don't open the street up let you mind tell you close itself and then shoot your hands if you gonna you just like oh shit like I never actually I never thought of that and this is more serious than we're showing up and we're angry this is confronting government and once government has shown you do something a few times you have to practice guerrilla warfare or you're just doing what the British did that lost them America you're stepping up in the formation shooting you're shot falling back stepping up for you're just playing a fucking game where they're dancing first is doing things that really disrupt the system and things that really progress to move and I was like oh shit you know this is radically this guy's is more than just a funny man he's more to say he's really sacrificing lady that shit down so yeah we got cursed out by Dick Gregory tip hung up why and then called me back later like man you know like ate my phone messed up dog you know til talked cool it's my father I said nigga you hung up he said for what he say you know but but around that you know tip and I have have been able to be of better benefit to our community you know and then when I say our community I don't mean someone imaginary mythical rapper place I mean the five ten mile radius we grew up in you know we've made some some some change you know what I mean and for the better we're gonna bring some jobs and shit like that and I think that that's cool that's very cool it sounds cool - sounds like you're you you think in a very positive and a progressive way of helping community in a real sense yeah that's nice to hear man yeah I hope I hope I help some people for I get out of here I also young people say you know and your music is fun as fuck yeah straight up kick your dick punch you in your face music it's fun yeah it's really good shit like you I got a great job yeah I mean the secretary job of doing the TV show it's no but I got a great job you're a great stand-up man thank you you I mean in the line of like Carlin and Hicks like you really push buttons and make you know you make motherfuckers twist like oh shit and think and go home and that's that's rare it's easy to do you know kind of shucky shit but you I like your shit thanks for I appreciate you like on my music thanks man yeah I love your music yeah no I appreciate it it's uh I think we both are in tricky businesses yeah I I get a lot out of music man I get a lot of fun and energy out of listening to music I don't have any musical talent at all but when I hear good music I get excited man it fires me up like I mean it's I think it's one of the most important things in our culture in terms of like our ability to generate energy and motivation it's a vibration yeah really is it really I what with me man I think you guys are I think right now stand-up comedy is the last vestige of freedom of speech in this country and you guys are to be protected at all cost and I think if people don't protect you at all costs it's gonna be at the arm for though for the worst of us all I definitely think there's something to that that it's there's very few people that are as free with what they're allowed to say like stand-up comedians because we're saying this crazy shit under the guise of it being funny yeah so you can get away with saying a lot of things that won't be criticized as long as people laugh at them and you have a good point if you're just making the points without the joke people wouldn't they wouldn't want to hear it they get mad at ya but something about delivering a point with a joke that's why trigger warning works yeah for sure yeah it's one of the last ways you can deliver a message that maybe people don't agree with but if you can make them laugh at some shit they don't even really agree and they're laughing hard they'll see a little bit of your point yeah absolutely absolutely I know when you set out to do trigger warning what did what was the was the initial premise and how much of it did it change until once you got to production and what you started filming you're one of the only people who've asked that question you can you come in the business bro yes originally we shot it with FX and we over we overdid it it looked really good but it looked really TV and it could have been dope but it would have been a parody of a very real thing I was tempted to do and right now I'm talking about coca-cola what it turned out turned into a Netflix was a real in-your-face simple and plainly shot documentation of the possibilities of barbershop arguments right so I'm in a barbershop argument you get to say you know the only thing that separates Al Capone from Joe Kennedy is Al Capone got caught and eventually died in prison and Joe Kennedy went on to produce presidents but they both have been bootleggers you know people say shit like these barbershops are and you need you have to go home and be accident yourself like well damn if Papa Joe did was a bootlegger like technically it couldn't went fucked up for me and we never would have had an American dynasty versus Al catching siblings and shit and they're not going so well but him being the preeminent marketing campaign and face of any Capone like thing you want to sell cigars to a restaurant right yeah so it got it I got a chance to say you know well shit what if I could do this for my guys and again giving it a shot and giving it a try I thought of that shit at 15 years old I started trying to figure out how to do it 10 years ago Daniel and I got it done eight nine years later and and now you have this and I say that just to say that I read Brian Koppelman the creator of billions um is a brilliant writer to me and he's a freezer friend also but Brian has been putting up lately these just encouraging things telling writers to write even if your self is getting bought even if you don't think it's good to write to push yourself to push the idea if bored and I've been taking a lot of inspiration for that because Daniel Daniel wine fell and I wanted to Co writers and co-creators Daniel and I have been talking in developing this over 10 years now I know how to do it how to go in a room how to get it you know it won't take me 10 years for the next one but it was worth the struggle you know it was worth doing that it was worth tweaking my idea was worth critiquing my idea to be like the first time around like 9 it's not it's not what it should be because I was nervous as shit the night before it came out about everything and you know what scenes were shot how did it look the production value and now seeing people get it and unlike a lot of other artists not have to call yourself a genius let me tell you people every artist thinks there's a genius every comedian thinks they're fuckin Richard Pryor in some part of your mind you have to think you're great or why do it you have to believe there's greatness in you right but I never wanted to be the guy I'm a fucking genius you know I mean I just never won but to see it because I always thought the idea was genius like fuck that shit you remember real people that used to come on ladies I remember watching that show as a kid looking at motherfuckers like wow these muffins existing in these off far places like Iowa and Kansas and I wanted to approach it I wanted to approach people in a very I'm here right in front of you kind of way not above you not celebrity Michael Morris but people normal rapper and it gave me an opportunity and people can say it's genius and I'm gonna say I'm humbled and honored but you're fucking right and it's genius because I'm engaging people at a regular human level not at the level of celebrity or power there used to be an engaged but when that allows them to fully open up I'm I haven't seen it on TV since some shit like real people hmm I know I haven't seen revolutionary TV like The Jeffersons or you know all in the family or Maude and I think that the world is getting scary and pussy to be honest you know not to not to disrespect pussies because pussies are tough but I think that something needs to be dangerous the best compliment I got on this press run has been like ambrosia ambrosia forehead said how's it feel to has a most dangerous show on TV and it's dangerous because of unites people doesn't separate people he gives you alternative than the ones you thought you had an unfortunate you to think it doesn't solve all the problems to wrap it up pretty at the end gives you some options to doing some shit to think about ins and it's funny as fuck and so first if in dark and I like it I got it imagine Netflix gave you plenty of room yeah they weren't trippin man nitro they don't trip no they don't risk oh good you know what you doing go ahead yeah exactly hey may you walk on the role of fuck I'm doing but there's smart enough to let people create their own shit for stand-up comedy there's no one better in terms of like interacting with them about especially you don't have to give many notes on the material they they know that you're gonna do your best estelle yeah they also they can't help you like no one can help you as a comic there's not another person like an executive is gonna help you do your best you got a you got to be looking at it yourself ruthlessly and you'll figure it out so they trust you yeah so I would assume they did the same thing with you yeah yeah perfect beautiful what a world yeah forever that was the opposite there was 50 fucking cooks in the kitchen ever he's pulling you this way yeah you were to shit fucking theme song you need a thing you say every week we should talk about Willis oh my god how's different strokes yeah what we're change in that short amount of time from different strokes today in the world that's the weird thing I'm older than you but uh not so much older we grew up in similar times I'm 51 yeah you know when we were children for both of us the world was a way different place than it is for children today yeah these kids are being forced to turbocharge their evolution and their education they're getting every kid over the age of like 13 has a phone basically the parents hang in there as long as they can and when the kids 13 here's the whole world you little fuck yeah good luck and and and in the whole world at a push of a button where my grandmother we get encyclopedias every four years and I couldn't wait to get the new set cuz you got to read and learn new information hmm and now that information is right there but if they aren't genuinely curious interested it'll die right well there's also a lot of things other than that information it's not just an information device these fucking apps so these kids are using back and forth with each other and games and all right so addictive well you have this place called outside - that was amazing outdoor yeah I just man I'd go and I just I'd be gone for hours and I returned dirty as fuck having went on an adventure that was that was amazing now he now even outdoors is regulated to some also you worry about child molesters you do creeps and you do worry about shit we've almost like heard too much about what's possible and then the fact that they're there are really still child molesters out there they do exist and we also send them to church with them mm-hmm so know some of our worries are exasperated yes yeah for sure for sure yeah that's one of the weirdest things ever yeah more than likely to charmless said she was gonna happen definitely the place that's roomy we should be getting outside again you know I started I started in hand I said my man told my wife you know get Michael a leaf blower just start going back outside so I started looking for leaf blowers but to Jess and I started taking instead of having my nephew do it because I'm running around on Twitter she just when I'm home taking my own trash up and down it spending some time fucking around in my yard watching her on and stuff I just I realized being a rapper and living on a tour bus how much I had stopped going outside and you know meanwhile my cousins are fucking Hager and he's Georgia you know making hey guy and I'm just like if it went down tomorrow like I'd be fucked like I've you know I'm rusty as a nail in the rain right now so I just I definitely think there's something to be said for introducing your kids to maybe a little more of what it was like 20 30 years or 30 40 years ago well just imagine that human beings lived before houses yeah there was humans and then they figured out shelter you know there or it's some kind of rather some kind of primate and then that primate figured out shelter and eventually became a human it's a better way to describe it but that we live something like us lived and it hadn't even figured out roofs yet yeah yeah I mean I love the watch those videos of youtubes where it's used and these people are dark in their agent so it has to be the India of Southeast Asia or somewhere but they that you'll see two dudes they'll just make a fucking a Hut or something out of mud they'll make a pool they're just but you get to see the ingenuity and you understand if they're there quote-unquote primitive culture never does that we never get to skyscrapers yeah like Jacque fresco talks about that like there's no nothing new everything you see is isn't it is an improvement or some variation of something they've seen before yeah so that those you know just a curiosity to do that or the necessity to build that shelter you know now now it gives you Trump Tower well that's where the dark side of it comes from the dark side for me is that with with this innovation that it happens almost unchecked in terms of our ability our ability to think about what are the consequences like what are the consequences if we keep making things better and better computers and artificial life and artificial intelligence what are the consequences the consequences are there's no more this thing there's no more weird pink monkey thing yeah that thing goes away because we don't need it anymore now we got a new life form the new life form is digital life yeah I mean that's the real real concern is that just like we are an evolution of those lower primates it's going to be an evolution yeah I think that's what I have I don't think you know there may not be any avoiding it but like again we're the virus you know and this is just one of my thoughts and me saying unequivocally that but we are it's just yeah the thing is I like people this is the other side of it people are cool Brown way that aliens go ahead and attack this motherfucker so white people are black people who cut the bullshit and finally have to unite like one great movie of red ox over dude I think we're gonna get our asses kicked I'm not saying we're not at least at least for one time humanity are there pirates would have to unite like that's what I'm saying remember that Reagan speech no you never heard it Reagan actually said that in he was I forget whose address you may be the first person besides him put in the civil right that I mean the King day you might give me the only other thing I like about Ronald Reagan it was very Street Jimmy said and one of the things that was really strange about it was that it's it shot off this gigantic wave of conspiracy theorists who were thinking that they're gonna tell us something alien contact check this out listen to this outside universal threat I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world dude yes I ask you it's not an alien force already among us what could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of we'll tell you what - Ronald Reagan knocked it out of the fucking park right there that's the way straight up I have a song called Reagan many of you know wasn't the biggest fan of him or many US presidents because I rapped about more than him in there but that definitely is gonna make it on a killer Mike song really that fast you got it you got this kill Mike and LP we definitely have anybody think aliens are gonna come kill us all when they so I'm gonna maybe suggest to hell hopefully you use it but if not fucking I'm gonna do it well that shit is amazing yeah yeah but do you think that it is possible that aliens came down and manipulated the genetics of lower primates and created people I'm willing bit based on all the theology I'm willing to accept it that's a possibility because I don't think that we're alone right I just don't there's nothing even if there's some divine thing that woke up and decided to make us and we were special children and we honorable plant there there had to have been some other things made of play with right I don't think that I think it's very arrogant as a human being to think that it's just us right and I think that the possibility that something made it here and something happened exists absolutely because if we're experimenting on animals and things we got like with my daughter's army the temperament is mean their curiosity isn't me like I see I'm looking at Michael and I'm looking at an eye and I'm like arguing with an eye is like arguing with myself she doesn't know why she acts like that I don't know now if I can look at my pit bull and say well her mother acted like this and this is why I know she's coated this way I know her father was it then I have to look at my daughter and save on a genetic base 23 of my chromosomes I know our temperaments like that I know why Michael is not gonna argue she's a smart kid she's an art student but the minute you put her in danger she's going to punch you you know I mean that's what that's what is gonna be and it's not gonna be anything else because she is going to protect her so it's like I have to think that my curiosity if nothing else my drive to do this so if you take the primate side you say well you know you know that I have to live in one since I got to survive as wolves as lions tigers bears out here I have to go higher that's great show there's something else which was a very small input kind of dropped here landed here and what's crazy you if you look into Nation of Islam philosophy of sorts they have a UFO type philosophy something here in and by their - scientists created you know all of us went went went ashore and kind of created two different races but something could have come here and it gets here and it says but if I do this and this and I create this and then we set upon evolution we end up here or that just could be you know me stone haven't watched too many sci-fi movies but it's possible it is it's it is possible there's zero evidence for it but it's certainly possible that if we could go to another planet we knew had life that it's possible if we found some lower primates that we would manipulate them it's very possible we do a full survey of another planet we got there and like okay here's the good news good news a lot of life bad news is the most intelligent thing is basically a chimp but we got some ideas and we're gonna do is we're gonna plant some seeds of our genetics in some of these chimps they're gonna be smarter than the other chimps and then we're gonna believe mushrooms everywhere leave the mushrooms everywhere let the chimp see mushrooms maybe we're in a fishbowl maybe yeah cuz again we're at we very arrogantly think of ourselves as as top choice but maybe maybe we're just a virus on this living thing maybe something maybe you know we say but you think about we could go extinct yeah a virus a mass virus could kill us all yep sure that's what we're constantly fighting the earth wouldn't stop but the other thing about viruses like viruses wholly negative in our eyes I don't think we're wholly negative to each other I don't think a virus thinks is holding this off what I'm saying is they eating you up you're having a good party when you have the flu like dude it's wrong if this thing is really a living thing in the nerf is really a living thing yeah we are possibly the worst things for it oh for sure why shouldn't it get rid of us other than meteors yeah yeah we're the worst thing for not just the biological life but the particulate in the atmosphere and now we're creating technology that's gonna eventually kill us and get rid of us that may be able to live in harmony with biology maybe so yeah maybe yeah maybe it's over for us in a few thousand years it could be but you know the thing that makes us fun is the thing that's totally unnecessary it's the thing that got us to the dance it's the thing that made us want to breed and there's the animal song I gotta piss so bad I get it the animal side you have to embrace your primal there's it's there it's a part of you yeah it's you've existed in this state for a long time fucking and the people that came before that were savage are still yeah you know yeah I always think that to myself when I hear people say why did he throw it all away bitch was hot nature's a crazy gene crazy yeah and that's the reason why there's seven billion of us this it's insane drive this computer code that's in the backyard is constantly running yeah the species must survive it must that's really all we put here to do is reproduce well we're doing that where I've been the way I've been describing is that I feel like we're some sort of electronic caterpillar that's making the cocoon we don't even know what the fuck we're doing and we're about to become a butterfly we're just making this cocoon and we're just completely engulfed in it we're not thinking about it but everyone does it they all do it that's how I felt like when I when I when I see all this stuff getting better and better and more invasive in your life in the technology becoming more and more advanced and everybody obsessed with it that's the thing I think is like this is eventually going to be everything it's gonna be way better than this physical life they're gonna offer you a life that exists just like the matrix the matrix sounded like such horseshit fun fun movie great movie and shit but like that could never happen now I think for sure it could happen a hundred percent it could happen I see that there's no question if they could make a world that's better than this and all you have to do is plug the back your head to it let's see I think that's the end um and again if I'm 89 I might say fucking to plug in for another 80 89 yeah and maybe if they keep your flesh alive they'll figure out some way to reverse everything maybe you know maybe you think I mean but then then you got to decide who gets a little get sad I'm not going to Italy different classes so he thinks go see and then you got it you got it catechol to kill your masters mode and that's what I think happens ultimately the other thing they say is that as people get more affluent they have less children and the population decreases as the world's economy evens out and so that we reach like a point where we can maintain a sustainable population how does that still happen without mass genocide or mass sterilization that's a good question I don't think they're saying that I think what they're saying is that as people become more educated and more affluent and more successful as more urbanization takes place people work more and have less children and when they have less children the population actually slightly decreases this is argument but I don't mind fuck more people who fuck more have more children not like that just like that's one of those stats where I'll be like they might do they might just be talking about a particular class of people there's still seven billion people yeah there's still some people who live mostly for under twenty two thousand a year yeah and usually every time development comes it exploits them yes so like where does the balance out of influence coming like I know there's one country now that's doing a universal pay for people so are we going to talk about point because when you go to like is does that happen is that is that it we've gone the universal pay well Universal pay would be fine for was universal effort if everybody to put out the same amount of effort I would agree with everyone getting say no I'm not saying on four against that I'm just saying how do you maintain how does it how does it happen at everybody all of a sudden it's that fluent without mass genocide or sterilization but I think the idea is that as urban and this is not my theory for sure but I've read it the ideas as the world becomes more urbanized and more educated and more wealthy as a city spread out what happens is less those people have kids and they have less kids this is just a that doesn't work I don't know if it works or not but I know that this is an actual study right see if you can find that people are vain as fuck some people are yeah most people are but but the overall humans once people have serious careers like the man and the woman have a serious career they both of them are like really invested in their career they generally tend to have less kids and when this is the idea is that as this people I don't know it's a solution I think it's a good solution I'm obsessed with work that's one of the things what did the rest of the world's just not that sounds like I'm still talking about America like like poor people are fucking man you know again I just goes back to me like I hear those studies show but you got to say to yourself how do you handle the other four billion people I think the argument is and this is not my argument or do they go they keep they keep expanding is that these cities in these urban areas that as the society sort of evens out globally whether it takes a thousand years or a hundred years as things start to even out people will be more like Los Angeles and less less less like poor places Calcutta yeah but that's like but what I'm saying it's like poor places in Calcutta you got a bunch of people walking that's pumped in it's noise it could be Los Angeles you got small you got traffic you got stretching that mic there's - those are two different extremes that that just seem weird like I'm just saying you know sometimes I just feel like maybe we're at the point it ain't no turning around we might be ya just cuz we got 7 billion people we might be but we also might not be and I think it's not a bad time to be optimistic because as people look for better and better solutions yeah but but like Jacque fresco in The Venus Project songs about moneyless society is a rather radical change of what our political states and things of that nature Chomsky talks about you know essentially all all countries essentially now no matter when or Eastern and all the darkies and shit mhm so like what's the radical departure from this thing that saves at all your mind like what's the Joe Rogan United Nations speech well I think people are more aware of the flaws of the system than they ever have been any generation previous okay I think when you look at kids from the 70s and the 80s I don't think they were nearly as educated as to how truly fucked up this country is and but also yet truly amazing in terms of like the history of the world but has plenty to pretty to improve on probably will I think people are getting better at life they're getting better at all all the things and government will come along with it I think we're gonna get better at things we understand each other better we communicate better is I'm optimistic and I think with all these incredibly intelligent people that are looking at the problems in the world in terms of carbon in the atmosphere or pollution in the ocean people are already starting to work on solutions I got I'm really optimistic that that it's there's at least the potential for someone to figure out some solutions to some of these problems overpopulation is always going to be a weird one because you don't have the right to tell people how many kids they can have yeah cuz who like if you meet somebody he's got ten kids and the most fuckin amazing family ever what what what are you gonna say yeah it's bad they have 10 amazing kids everybody's great you go over the house it's all love yeah what the fuck why is that bad you tell so so people are good but only a certain amount yeah yeah that's where it gets weird but but it's not a cut and dry issue it's not a 1 or a 0 it's like yeah there are too many people and yeah you probably shouldn't have ten kids but you got a fucking awesome family so hey have a good night man yeah what the fuck to do yeah yeah yeah you know you know Jess it just speaking as you know just that's a lot of the brown people it's just scenario Justin's everywhere well for us so I'm always always check it out you can't tell you just always watching you've got up saying this this that scenario usually doesn't go good telling people how many kids they can have kids oh fuck it happens like it happens when you think about you think about countries where refugees are pouring into analogous just put up illegal sterilizations and yep you start to see you start to see where countries with sterilized and refugees that are coming in it's crazy and it's scary it's terrifying and and and I don't want my country to become that like I remember countries have sterilized people as they've come in I've read a story about it once that they did that to some refugee somewhere but I can't remember where it was I can't remember you should probably know so yeah well I am country accused of sterilizing refugees maybe that was just a rumor maybe it's what the snow is is not a problem I could imagine that happening here not saying I'd say what some people if they had their way yeah like and that's scared to think about that these are the people we put in power like you know what was cool to me about well miss Ellison taught me she was like she was a teacher she had one leg right she and she wore like a curly malaria mold Three Stooges she wore the like the little mushroom hairstyle crows and she was mean a shit man like goddamn she was mean but this lady talked the fucking she taught civics and when she taught about how even if your parents weren't naturalized they weren't citizens if you were just born on US soil you got a shot you know you were a citizen now just like damn that's amazing because when you think about at that time we had learned about I think in history the Irish and their plight to be here and things of that nature just like man this country gives you a fucking shot and this is like when America was rather this is in the middle of Public Enemy errant shit but there was something to be admired in it like James Baldwin had an adoration for America that many people didn't even know he ended up dying you know as he's living in France I think the expectation the dream that American tells you mentorship is amazing it can be and to know that that was the possibility then and now my kids don't think like that my kids are dead in the middle of keeping people out that shit is fucking weird so in my lifetime I'm scared too that's something I might see happen in this country that's how afraid I am right now with shit going fucked up that's what I mean when I say when you say well we'll have a government or a world one day where people will be a more affluent well in capitalism even though I'm a capitalist you know I try to practice compassion capitalism and capitalism capitalism requires someone gets snookered does it really the way we practice it absolutely ideally you shouldn't be more like Milton Friedman in the free market right what Thomas all talk about but not we as in you and I yeah but we you and I engage in capitalism yeah you and I engagement of capitalism was a lot more fair than what countries are doing okay with one another large gifts it's tough yeah okay which that's why I say the current system of capitalist there's nothing wrong with you being able to buy that beautiful Jeep outside based on the work you've done your work ethic will determine your worth is written in a window of my barber shop I really mean it right your work ethic so determine with you were even if there's no such thing as money if you plow your fields you're gonna be more battle for so long as the rain gives you something may I ask you this you think it's the system of capitalism itself that has the flaws in it or is it human nature I think I desire to exploit things I think it's human nature unchecked in that system mmm okay you know I think that allowing marijuana to become legal should not have allowed the type of Taxation that's been allowed in California well Colorado was at one point in time was 39% yeah what is it in California I don't know but it's high enough that I've seen the house a week go from about $150 to 320 bucks I think that's terrible but I would like it if all that money went to a good purpose but we know it's not yeah that's it you know that's there in every land where it should it never does what it's supposed to do that's what I'm that's that's what I'm getting - that's why I say it when I say you know I want to be that guy with usually go good for probably just because we just like god fucking damn yeah like why isn't good happening in the immediate because so much money is pushed into the immediate well if we does become legal worldwide its entire mean countrywide it's entirely possible that it's gonna stimulate economies in a lot of very poor places it's gonna have some real positive benefit I agree but but but it what what I'm saying about capitalism is why are we not ensuring that the people who have suffered since 1937 have a fair shot right we've allowed so many laws to come in with marijuana legalization that it does not allow for the small businessman to have the type of ingenuity is set up that a small liquor store had at in the Prohibition right or bar you know Jamie was telling me that in Ohio they were setting it up so they were trying to make it legal but only two guys can grow it to enormous corporations that was the bill right is that word to me I believe it might have been for it wasn't a lot some small amount of people they were the only ones who could say no we know that's fucked up that's so crazy they didn't even ask for that we know this fucked up when it should just be you are allowed to grow it with a with that a hundred-dollar state federal tax yes a state tax down you have a state tax have 100 bucks you can grow up to 3 acres of marijuana BAM love it love it perfect love it do your shit grow it then the growers have to buy from you so if a farmer wants to make a collective before the farmers they're making a collective but we shouldn't be able to allow that type of domination because essentially then you're just giving people you know monopolies of sorts you know yeah so it's it's like I just I don't trust us to be on our shit enough with the people we leave in charge right well it also it wouldn't make sense in any other relationship and any of the relationship we're all someone is saying is if I let you sell something you give me a certain percentage because you're basically saying that all of this the frameworks of our government and the cities roads that you drive on all that stuff takes money to maintain yeah we're just gonna take a little piece no they take a 39 percent yeah that's so much you should but if that 39 percent went all to public schools and paying teachers more money and paying cops and paying firemen and community centers but beyond just pain kids son of a former cop cousin of current cops policemen should be from areas that they're policing or areas like those they should be offered no interest loans to live at and around those communities teachers should be also and the fire department they should almost hold a special place because of the nobility of those jobs and how important they are we also should do stuff like tax freezes once you retire whatever your taxes are once you retire at 65 years old we should knock maybe 10 20 percent off and that's what you pay until you die you know I mean we should do everything we can to make the class of people you're saying about affluence possible and we're not doing it like that's I guess that's the only button I'm pushing when I seem cuz I'm a very optimistic person but my pessimism my pessimism comes more from the lack of what I've seen us be willing to do to make sure that one another treated fairly then I have seen for right you know I'm saying like I refuse to disavow you know what I mean two things estrus an attitude doing that people will evolve that attitude so we realize how important cooperation really is a do we though without being attacked by some of us some of us do some of us do you do absolutely and I do if there's people that do and it takes a heart it's a hard knock into your head to really let it sink in yeah but once you do let it sink in and you live your life that way reciprocity and friendship for all and camaraderie I'm so rich your life it's a better life absolutely the problem is people aren't taught it they're not taught it enough they're not taught it in men are taught to face each other to hate each other and hate on each other and look at each other in a with a famine mentality or just lie mentality that's like the lamest shit alive that is why the opposite is beautiful the obstacle your uplifting people and like you you've give out thirty five shout outs yeah dude that's what it's all about man that makes me feel better than these people like you out there love makes people feel better when they listen to your music and they enjoy it that you're this guy behind it that's not taking any of this for granted and you're running with this shit absolutely I appreciate it it's beautiful man love it dude we just did three hours it felt like three good three to thirty 20 minutes it was incredible yeah I was hanging in there tight but listen man I'm a big fan I'm honored beautiful for me I enjoyed it very much and I love your shit I'll tell you tell people how to get you online I'm just killing Mike online ki ll er hey he Instagram Twitter all that shit yeah I don't go to my facebook that's one of my kids running that shit okay so don't send titty pics thank you brother appreciated mouthpiece
