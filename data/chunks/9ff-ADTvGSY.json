guess what I became I became a stand-up comic I learned how to do stand-up in prisoners life they used to have moving I didn't even know that dog they used to have moving that on Thursday night so the projector would always fucked up like Ustream it would always fuck up generally talking the microphone it would always fucked up so hunters days the people just jokingly I would always go what the fuck is wrong with the projector now everybody would say Cuba get up there and talk so I would go up there if there's a next episode you know you want your people and like a hundred more blacks like Oh Cuba go up there and talk and I would make fun of the black guys like what would be what would you say you know we make fun of the kitchen you know we should make for the ice that's how the movie strokes I fucking the first day in prison they made me a baker you know you know you don't tell people what you want it's like Cuba like yeah on the outside I was a mechanic really well in here you're a baker here's a book learn how to make bagels it almost blew up the kitchen right these motherfuckers are big so that afternoon they fired me has a baker and they made me a fucking dishwasher right so I was a dishwasher in the stockroom clerk and whatever they had shitty meals the guys I knew when they were going through the line I would deal with the meals bad three times a week but it didn't matter because at lunchtime I was allowed to go to the store for 15 minutes I worked it out where I had a drive to take garbage out so I would go to the store for 15 minutes not only that I would call in my owner to Chinese restaurant so it would be ready by the time I got there so I would go back to the prison with Chinese food and groceries that's how strong I wasn't there what fuck around and call us they were doing steroids and selling drugs in prison please like a motherfucker how is in the stockroom clerk so they had a pain me rent so I guess they never said you stalked you stalked you gotta give me some cigarettes so I had roids cigarettes I had pills in their lap they weren't mine they just belong to other people but you put them on the pallets so I would give him a key whenever they needed to go taste shit so they knew with a connection I was the ours to know I was the holder fuck how did they get the steroids in so many how to put it up there a steroid in here how do they smuggle it in again up there and then again then they put it where that contact visits right you do is you take your fucking kid and you fill his pockets with the young guns and while you're making out with your husband you say you want to see the kid you pass the kid to the husband and he takes the drugs out do it same shit it's no you can produce more drugs on the inside you have a Mexican my nose I was like this they would play basketball or fucking movie security prison where everyone's party this is just the greatest time ever man it's like a public when you get when you when you you know you get released it's like which was even you gotta talk in the mic people keep complaining I was hours hours I was when I go into the halfway house it was even better cuz I started loaning money out for the index as a loan shark FX yeah because they want to go out but if your rents not paid on Thursday and I allow for the weekend so the rent would be $65 I give him 65 492 you know I'm saying like I'm gonna give you 65 hours we gotta give me 92 tomorrow and I had 10 guys on that row but I was a fucking machine in there the biggest game I had it at the camp the biggest game I had was wood there was an old Italian dude Brooklyn he was like a half a mobster and he had coupons and he could only do one card a week he would make like 30 bucks and I went up to him I go bro you have a problem with these cards I go you given him to white guys you're not getting the black populations not getting the fucking specs and he goes I don't know they won't talk to me I said give me the fucking cards we're gonna go partners he went from selling one card every Monday they're doing tag with me the Puerto Ricans I had the whites at everybody and it was amazing that's why I really learned that I could really fucking do this so on Thursday nights they would say Cuba fuck the movie just go up then talk about the kitchen and they were all all the Youngs were talking about and then I had this one crazy like this guy was Anton Spencer his name was Spencer antoine from new orleans and he was crazy and he told me he told me he was in there for eight years for involuntary manslaughter and he was my mentor that was my dog Jack he was fucking nuts and he would come he by like one day some guy nail him two dollars and he comes to the kitchen he goes did you see that guy and I go no I think he's packing and leaving this motherfucker wasn't got a knife he got him at the gate I see the guy was getting out of Jays like I'm a fucking you better give my two dollars I was blown away I'm like this guy was all his parents and family had money there that like the best attorney from broke this guy killed somebody with his hands and he got eight years a black guy in LA downtown that way cuz I was in the federal place he beat him with his fucking hands and gots eight years before for the voluntary manslaughter yeah like $50,000 attorneys he's got but he had a knife he had a gold tooth on his mouth he was one of those brothers and shit there's eyes would go crazy I went in there every Thursday I get on stage and then one day this is fucked up joe rogan this is why I really dig you because one day the guy in the library was like a nerdy dude the guy that ran the library and I was friends with him we did acid he was very into Nostradamus and you know he was intelligent but he had just so he had some problem or some II went to prison and the funny thing was that one day he came up to me in the jail and a notebook was a big thing and I was getting ready to get out and I've never even thought about it he came up to me it was a brown-eyed notebook I know what's the note before you was so when you get out you could write some jokes he goes he was every week you write jokes I never seen a notebook look them they go I don't even write and this motherfucker went nuts he goes you don't write and you go up there we can do that he goes when you get out of here you it was like an angel it was like an angel I've never seen the guy again I never heard from them again he just goes what I watch you do you really need to write and get it together well because you have a gift just pursue this and that guy never even talked to me like you never used to talk to me just set it out on the blue the black guy right no a white guy white guy I was like a really nerdy guy I would always roll his own cigarette so some random guy came up don't see that talent yeah I said no I think do you think that if you didn't go to prison if you didn't have that experience of talking in front of those people that you probably never would have done stand-up or were stand-up something that was in the back your head anyway it was in the back of my head the prison really woke the animal up because thought about it before I had thought bro if any because you had to be funny before prison right heard ya niggas crazy by Richard Pryor you had a thinking he pushed it so hard and that but before prison I were only the life of the party like I thought I was always good at the deli I was loved telling stories yeah I was always good with that shit and then the thing that really got me was when you go to prison they do a diagnostic on you and I think of an attorney another really that's the only thing that irks me about my life like a lot of times people say I slept with this guy with me as I always wanted to know was on that paperwork because it was an intense psychological evaluation it just wasn't a guy with a piece of paper saying what do you think when you see a star they put shit in my head electrodes and all this shit it was three days of mental testing that it was eating me alive and I wanted to know I kept asking the counselor who was from Mississippi he hated black we hated specs he told me to my face my counselor told me because I hate he goes I hate all you bug fuckers spics and nigga I mean that's how it all mark and he said to me he goes I go bro what do you his name is mr. blue I go what are you gonna fucking tell me what's on there and one day he's like you really want me the table time here bug fucker actually would call me till my face bug fucker he goes I tell you what I'm here mr. bug fucker it said that if you really wanted something I had it that you would take it from me he goes now you do what the fuck you want with that he threw me out of his office and I felt like a thief for three days that's what I read of that but what he was trying to tell me was that anything I wanted in my life that's what that said so I could do anything you want or you could do do it that's what he was saying that's what he was trying to beat around and like I calling you a bug fucker no by saying what he said Brian baby came up to me he goes hey did you understand where I was going with that because you're a smart guy you're not one of these guys you tell us about the first stand-up gig do you remember it yeah I remember what made you go up that night do you consider the ones in prison your first stand-up gigs I'm talking my first official at a club like your first time you went up like him but I miss I'm thinking that if you did it how many times you doing in prison you really were doing like open mic night I was doing every Thursday for sure and I did if that's not a movie I don't watch of times so he real did you have material planned out did you have stuff that you repeated no what was the first office for you imagine repeat the joke crazy I really knew about the whole heritage they would sneak in fucking green chilli burritos tremendous really brought what who had the best tattoo artist who was it the Mexican Mexicans Mexicans always have wild I was at one time I was in jail with the grandfather di Ellis the father and the son whoa that's really did you start seeing that thing you like and he's a been a movie right now blade this is fucking crazy and I always wanted to shoot somebody and be a criminal at that point I didn't you know I always thought about that my life deserved more than to spend it in here that's what prison did for me bro it wasn't if people come up to me go how bad was Prison Prison is how bad
