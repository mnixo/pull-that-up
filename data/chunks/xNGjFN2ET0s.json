five-four-three-two-one gee ha Britany job what's up yeah they're texting people no I'm repost in your post man people who it's all about that bro that social media account bro I'm trying man what's up brother I'm good man this is a big weekend big UFC we huge weekend that just engag and Eddie Alvarez fight first email violence if that's like that's the one I'm thinking about maybe more than even the title fight ah yes there's a few more than the title fight that's why it's exciting to me though is it yes I know it's not that much to you I like it it's not that I don't like it I like it but I love Francis and over him and I love gay Chi Alvarez yeah yeah I agree you know Alvarez is an underdog I like his shot as an underdog Wow because I think incredible as much as I love gay teen I should root for more I do root for him because we're from the you know from dem reserve my old team stuff like that I've trained a ton with them back in the day I just feel like at a certain level that standing bang Leonard Garcia type of style at the upper echelon can get you in trouble and if Eddie Alvarez wants to play that game he's gonna lose but he has the skill set to you know to win by decision outsmart him not play that meathead game see this is where I disagree I don't think that just in cage he really plays a meathead game I think he plays a will game I think he's skillful but when when there's an opportunity to get someone to do a battle of wills he's more confident in his will and I think at the upper echelon you can't play that game just think about the other guys at 55 play that game with Tony Ferguson Kabira goes play that game with Edie Barbosa mmm yeah but I want to see that no don't get me wrong no no he's a fan favorite for sure I love Goethe absolutely love him I think at a certain level you can't play that chin down throw you know throw those bows or you can name a guy who's done it successfully well it's all yes Tina No so it's only him and he hasn't faced the top guys yet so right we're gonna see what he's capable of doing or whether or not he's capable of switching it up if he has to but he's been able to survive 18 professional fist fights in world first of all 17 of those on world series of fighting strip well first the cow little you cannot compare to UFC no the Michael Johnson fight was the first big that one counted and he got tagged in that fight got tagged yet lit up a little bit he got tagged and Michael Johnson eventually succumbed to the violence cuz he played his game yeah yeah well at some point we're talking so much shit to each other before that fight it was so like eh he just dragged him into a war what what gate she and I don't think a lot of people realize this he's an all-american wrestler yeah North Northern Colorado like that dude can wrestle he's athletic too yeah we just he's as calm good man he was a starting animal he refused to go backwards that's the thing it's an ego thing he doesn't want to take a step back yeah which can get you in trouble I think that only at a certain level Zig engage in trouble it's made him this gun I'm this far and he's a fan favorite but I think at the upper echelon it's gonna be tough but we're gonna see how he adjusts say if he's in there with the Nansen barboza by the way they did Barboza and habib bet your ass they did hold is that the Vegas fight that December 30th the hope cards yet Holly side boy down there cards nasty it's a nasty car but that barboza fight is so fascinating to me because Barboza is so goddamn fast he's so fast he fucks people up with that stand-up his stand-up is so crisp there when Barbosa fought Anthony Pettis and you Mike yes you realize like wow there's some next-level striking but you know he's vulnerable to cowboy cracked him with a jab member and then cowboy choked him out he's lost some kind of key fight so he hasn't really had you know if dad habib shows up though looking like that you know he's just got to keep his weight down that's that's really the main thing like I hope what Daniel Cormier said it's true Daniel Cormier said that he's got a new nutritionist and he's got him on point he's in the 170s now let's hold his way lighter than he's ever been before you know this many weeks out of a fight swear to God for tiramisu ruins up five I'm gonna bast I'm gonna freak the fuck well what you really have to be concerned with and take this with a grain of salt because clearly I'm not a doctor but I would imagine that if you've had not one but two instances where your body shuts down from cutting weight - he had it with the michael johnson fight and then he had it again in the fight with Tony Ferguson where he had to pull out but they said it was similar to what happened in the Michael Johnson weight cut even worse yeah but even worse the last one yeah well he came in too heavy he's trying to drain too much water it's as simple as that I think how bad it was if you're from Russia you're from Russia the hero fought with one leg and he got so bad he to check in with the doctor they brought him to the hospital yeah I mean he was in his liver shut down yeah he was kidneys sorry yeah it's not good whatever it is I thought it was his liver too maybe maybe it was his kidneys but I dread liver but I think I dread it from like a teammate talking about it so might not have been like that it has to do with weight cutting it's the kid right and that's what fails people right when they have like real issues okay so I'm on a meal meet that is this weekend see this is a fight that people aren't fucking talking about now no the huge ones on the centre 30th meal meek it can't make it right because their visa Oh easy out um first of all Emil Meeks first-team all body out this AB the snitch needs to snoop around Norway yeah man bread it's all straight Viking notes get Viking DNA men yes good like that your honor yeah no he's just a natural freak yeah this come on that's why it's oh he's a scary guy terrifying no one wants to fight him nobody and no one's talking about him till does dare until does yeah I know I feel I feel like this card though has been kind of under the radar a little bit a little bit yeah a little bit like I think John when they went bro yeah you know Francis and over in fight this Saturday this weekend I totally forgot did you see Francis break the world record for the hardest punch I've skeptical hip eyes on that how many guys have punched that thing have you punched it they said thousands have punched it oh that's all that company shows twit tweeter it's actually a code it'd you question the game okay good we were like how many people have done it then we found out that Tyrone Spong came in second and then it has more cutting hitter with left hook did croak on kick it it's a hearts punch okay I don't think CRO cops kicked it okay let see the hardest kick right yeah but I'd like to see if Mark Hunt hit that bitch with the left hook right right right need to see some of that stuff like what other heavyweights hit it because of course Francis is huge but he might be the hardest hitting heavyweight alive that's possible too and I'd like to get Carwyn on that thing Oh Carwin in his prime even Carlin Alf straight yeah Mitrione call out Carwin for steroids no see Jones talking crazy shit of course yeah is cuz for the belt or heavyweight tournament you know mats fighting Roy yeah and then they go you know shut Carwin asked coca to be a alternate on there so it's hurt and then they ask mad about and he's like I mean they need to test that for that frickin guy there's no way he's clean and just went about this whole business like anyone who I fight us be clean I doubt Carlin is so now Carmen's calling out Matt now careful what you ask for Maddy yeah because even if he's clean good luck those are bones mmm let's get some just caveman bone structure a lot of anger built up you don't look back the france break that record I need to see who what other heavyweights hit that thing before I celebrate right yeah yeah man how many fucking great guys have backs given out on in their prime that's a big one I mean Cannes yeah that's a big one chains a big one those two guys alone so the rumor was Cain fighting at UFC 2 20 in Boston against you know Cain and steep a yeah that's not happening not happening not happening how do you know what do you know close sources it's not King won't be ready not happening Steve Steve a a fight the winner if it depending if you know if the good win of France over him so what is this sort what's what's the issue that's holding them back I'm not sure I just know you won't be ready so some sort of recovery issue some injury thing something guess just not ready to say no bullshit Wow do they have a fight for that January 20th not yet that's really soon yeah January 20th yeah who's not seeing soon pretty soon yeah definitely suiting up for a few months yes especially if it's a heavyweight title fight you got something on there it's less than two months that's soon yeah and I'm hoping for a big fight announcement because I'm at the Wilbur the night before sir what else is on that card already wow it's really uh well well they're getting around to Abby no Boston this Dana's hometown so he's not gonna disappoint glassing t bow back in the house after passing hot what is he gonna look like not like that what do things gonna look like cuz he's the freakiest of the freaks at 155 pounds he was Jeff those days are over giant dude he would come into the Octagon oh my god on Fight Night and you know how the fuck are you 155 in the world how the fuck are you not a middleweight he's a middleweight I mean I'm not exaggerating he looked like a fucking middleweight he looked like Paul Harris when Paul Harris was a middleweight he looked like glassing T bout looks when he's awesome yeah so jacked and skillful hell yeah you know he's a monster he's a fuckin animal so he's got everything goin but I was disappointed that steeping cane wasn't gonna go down because I think if steep a beats cane then there's argument force T pays the best heavyweight of all time if we were to be cane well if he beats cane a healthy cane that's see the thing is what we really need is Time Machine we need to fucking take prime time cane and stick them in pride with prime time phaidor let's find out and you got to do it in pride too cuz look with no no no commissions I don't know what the fuck they were doing over there but I know the result if I'm just looking at the result as a person who's an analyst I got a look at prime time phaidor as number one primetime phaidor throwing bombs on Nogueira when he's pinned against the fucking ring apron no gears in the corner and Fae doors on top of them just dropping those casting punches know those crazy Russian punches to come like this I am just oh that's why it's it's difficult when they when the who's the best of all time it's like all right well we dawn off pre snitch right or we goin snitch here yes we go go and snitcher you got steep a yet but even we don't know who the Golden Snitch is it's Jeff Novitzky he's coming on the podcast now and I'm a fan I like he's doing yeah I might when I say go and snitch I'm just playing around before used to be who had the best cheater who had the best chemists who had the best doctors at the best doctor who had the best guy that could make you test positive or test clean rather after the weigh-in that's all you had to do except for looking over him he's a guy you know find this weekend where the off seats he's done some stuffs I'm Garen his life he's been he's tested hot and just paid the price and then the going stitch comes in and his team goes I dude you can't just rely on power you'll start using a technique with you half so it's focus on it he's doing pretty damn well pretty damn I'll get that one lost before it's that lost eBay he was smoking dudes yeah his loss too steep a wasn't that bad cuz he hits deep in a lot of trouble definitely did he actually thought you know in the post fight yeah I kicked by us they choked on a tap that yeah that old thing those guys were stunned that was a close fight though very close honey goes on you know beats veux doom his last fight and now he's fighting Francis where you know that's not obviously Francis tough fight Francis the favorite but dude Overeem's the best striker most decorated strike of all time in the heavyweight division yeah like over and can win that fight you know I broke down on my podcast how many times over hims been stopped on the last podcast last MMA pokken 18 it's crazy 19 I don't mind I think it's like 13 in MMA or somewhere between 11 and 13 and MMA and an additional three or four in kickboxing there's a lot of stoppage losses it's a lot but I think he's been fighting it more than anyone - yeah but if you look at the last few years there's an exorbitant amount of losses by stoppage for over it yeah yeah it's like it's quite a few what the number things right it's it's the all the all the wind tear in the ring and also not being able to do guerre see look Ben Rothwell Travis Browne the Bigfoot Silva one that all those have go back those all those happen inside of a couple of years man it's one year but I'm one year from February of 2013 literally two September of 2014 that's not much time and he's been brutally knocked out three times in that time well at least two of them are really brutal the Ben Rothwell fight was like he got cracked with a big shot and dropped and then they stopped the fight I think it a good time it could happen to anybody that could happen anybody but the Bigfoot fight that wasn't a regular ko that was goddamn ruthless Travis brown gotten pretty bad too yeah that front kick to the grill big foot fight was so interesting though because it was so obviously post snitch yep it was just he went figuring out yet who Berean when he beat Brock Lesnar that was the uber aim scarce man never inter ever not fight when you look across the Octagon 265 maybe 10% body fat jacked to the tits check please I'm out and best kickboxer to ever fight now how about oh Jesus what it does I'm out what are you gonna do but then he figures it out though you have that and then he figures out in judo Santos fight yeah and you know now before back oh uber him up when his uber aim before they going snitch good luck back in that dude did you're paying the price now I'm awful to turn his back in Ron out of the way hey just gets the fuck out of there by any means necessary seeya I wonder if he would ever be you know that was one of the things that Mitrione brought up about Joe Silva he said that Joe Silva told him that he got a small ring or that it was gonna be a large ring when he fought Roy big country and it wasn't it was a small ring so he said that he was upset about that I've had that happen before too though but again and I'm not defending Joe Silva here I've worked the ton with Joe Silva all over the years it doesn't really work like that it really doesn't work you make demands on the cage and and ask for this and ask for that it is what it is and you might prefer something like you have maybe but Joseph was dealing with so many different dynamics the cage goes hey what's the Kate so am I go it's a 24-foot I cool yeah I guess the bigger cage won't fight or not man but no like there's so much going on I don't think he purposely lied to Matt was like it's a big cage take the fight but I wonder like what fights would be like if the cage is much smaller less technique you're gonna get a bunch of gay Chi fights which is in a bad thing right but if you're a technical guy like Mitrione with as who's crazy athletic with a footwork or a barbozza or Conor McGregor you don't want that small cage it limits your resources and your abilities you get smothered and it cuts all your angles short everything off the off the exchange like if you're too close to a cage anything off to exchange your cut and short like you're gonna run into the cage so now you can't go back that way because you won't get out of the way of the shot and you can't go back that way so you have like limited amount of movements that you can make it was paradise yeah well it's also a brawlers paradise right so those two things could be good if if the fight was done in a smaller outgunned khabib would never lose yeah I think yeah for sure but I think also one thing that it would favor is like real high-level Muay Thai guys because the real engineer yeah they're always clinching and and going after each other you know and I think that that style like the Muay thai-style is not like Wonder Boy style with her slide not the way they're standing right in front of you and checking things and attacking clinch I don't think it'd be better for the sport maybe not better for the sport but it would be interesting to see how it favors certain styles and I think that it would favor a good wrestler with some real good more time I think whatever hell yeah be a real good environment for them you think if let's say Frances were to just starch over in which listen over here music watches p's and q's her 15 minutes you have to use this technique run when you have to even even if people don't like it win by decision great man but if he doesn't watch his P's and Q's and get starts by Frances you think Frances deserves a shot right away if Frances starches them Frances is the hottest commodity in the heavyweight division so he deserve that's not a shot yeah I think Overeem is ranked he's no one know he's number one Cain's not number one no okay so he's number one is which is crazy for him to take this fight and her dooms number two so no one knows why and that's really that's really nuts cuz that fight like that those two had boy that was it as close a fight as you can get and most people thought that for Doom one yeah I think for Doom did well no one got robbed though no one got robbed but but there's a shame fight for Doom heard him yeah and over him never really heard for Doom not not the same way at least I'm sure he hit him hard I thought we're doing win the fight I thought we didn't win the fight - I thought that one brown where he rocked him and hurt him that shit a bit that was the most significant moment of the fight for sure so how do you not make Francis go through for Doom to get the steep a that's interesting it's a very good question cuz that's a tougher matchup for Francis than over him it's very doing sup mother well I don't know what's going on with steep eh why don't they have a challenger for steep a like why is the heavyweight division it's a bunch of dinosaurs right but is that what it is I mean because I had heard that there was some contract negotiation shit going on there's there's that yeah I've heard that I don't know where that pens been you sucking on that panel should I just put it here I don't suck on it and I was sucked on my left I won't suck on it talk naw man just the tip I know I know Steve Bay's ready to go for February yes yeah so they just don't have a car they don't have an opponent for him maybe they'll try to do it for January for Boston they're there their hope in that you know Francis and this Overeem thing work out yeah cuz listen it's too soon a rematch with Steve pay for over him is a very interesting fight it's very interesting Kinsella supposed to be beats Francis who ruined so high and mighty on yeah you were to get by him how can you deny it yeah that's true Francis is just have you seen if I live no oh no I have not should be have you seen a me fucking Mark Hunt into the Brock Lesnar fight was probably the scariest one because I was like this guy is the greatest heavyweight of all time but he smashed Brock alleged only that I'm like oh my god what if he could do that to Kane well yeah but you watching a superhero where it's like fuck I don't have the resources to get on the same shit but now that he's off the shit and he flatlined Mark Hunt the how scary to me I know right what if they had no testing though none zero like able to make like the the testing requirements is minimal as they were back then he able he pulled it off he tested clean imagine if there was god bless no fucking tactically he had a cycle off yeah like what if he's look like that cyclist like that but think about this Francis is as natural as fucking coconut water that motherfucker is all natural now imagine if he could take something Oh God then what do we do everybody's problem we got a real problem he shreds city hits harder than anyone now and eating frickin plantain there's over him in the herbarium days Francis is no Punk though bring up Francis that fine mote the skin prime marine versus prime tank Abbott who takes it I get the fuck out of here yeah he doesn't look the same but he doesn't look bad like if he was just a heavyweight fighter and he was built the way he's built now you would say he's a powerful guy I mean if you see him in his last fight pull up the last fight with him versus Mark Hunt I mean he definitely doesn't look like a small guy he's still somewhere around the 250 something range it was literally everyone's bodies look different yeah everybody's looked different Erick Silva was a big one that people kept bringing up like he was like this dimepiece yeah and then there's changed you ever see like you look at Alistar they're like he's just got more body fat more stomach fat less muscle here's a little bit of a guy like he has almost a dad bod that works out on the weekend I wouldn't say that you said that not me well dad bod though you know I'm saying like an active dad yeah I mean he's just but what's interesting is that he's such a fighter the gear or no gear I mean he comes to fucking fight he comes to kill you because he is the best technique in the little that that fucking ko oh my god flatland mark cunt you better you know markup flew to Vegas to get all this stuff checked out yeah the brain scan all that and what did they say about it I'm not sure but I but he at least made the effort to fly from Australia to there so he can clear this up to get back in the cage because again I think for Francis unless he there's an argument you know if he just goes out then starches over him intense it's like right well we got to figure out what he's worth let's give him steep a right but if he doesn't man you could give him Mark Hunt that's a great fight you give him for doom yeah because you gotta walk through some fire cuz look at the fire steep a walk through to be the heavyweight it's a good point and you know he really has only beaten Orlovsky it's just we're looking at him at the the magnitude of his performances against guys at Rouen in his League you know it's like you just see the magnitude of his impact like he's he's a guy that you go woo who the fuck's gonna stop that but they're all favorable matchups yep you know I'm saying it's like it your favorite baseball player he's only hitting off the pitcher who we know he can hit home run off of when you give him a guy who actually can throw some junk and he's not as good you know or if he hits that guy alright then here's what he's worth well prime time came when it showed us what was up you know a prime time came versus him where he can get him down hold him down be tomorrow night I'm Cain you know I you know I I also think steep a right now he might you know he's in his prime might be at the end of his prime but he's in his prime yeah things I don't think steep A's at the end of his prime at all I think steep is right in there he's in he's right there where he could get Frances and he's I was he Frances Russell that's all I see mm-hmm but again from sources they say that he's a nightmare to take down I believe it me look so goddamn strong and the way he hits I mean he hits your window of opening is so little and your mistakes are so costly anytime you make a mistake with him you just get bombed on so hard no look but when you got a guy like Kane or ste paper they go I know I got power I'm put my chest in your African chest for 25 minutes yep put my head straight in your chest good luck firing off man and when you do fire off I'm gonna take you down yeah at least keep you busy as you can't just fire off and now deal with the dick ulis combinations on you with constant barrage stop strikes keep having you over and over again hammer fist elbows punches punches punches never get tired Frances is similar to me as a JDS we're similar similar we're you know decent footwork I don't think he's athletic is JDS but good footwork power puncher but when you get a guy like Steve beer cane who don't play that game on the outside with you just want to get dirty you're in some trouble man it's gonna be interesting to see if he's in some trouble because you know if he could stuff the takedown if he can keep those guys standing up with him then you're gonna see some nightmares he's getting better all the time the thing about Francis he hasn't even really been fighting that long he doesn't have this long crazy record no not at all in the US he was like you might be something special let's come to Vegas and you just worked out in this sport let me inject this Bane supplement into whatever the fuck it is you know you won't even use protein powder he's worried about testing hunt Wow he takes nothing good perfect we need to see what the fuck's possible I agree what kind of genetics oh they're out there I agree he's like you know we were talking yesterday about Bo Jackson Kallen and I were going up about bo Jackson but there's certain athletes that in their prime they just like we're just not above everything else like just out of the womb there's a different animal they don't all start at the same starting well Herschel Walker another good example a freak what's that now see my problem is we can't put Francis in that discussion yeah yeah not even close no not uniting close there you get some work to do not in this as far as greatness and accomplishments freakish but as far as like physical freak yeah yeah I don't know either but Francis scares the shit out of me when you watch him hit people it's boom oh Jesus he's just so big and so powerful and so undeniable when he comes moving in for the kill is undeniable yeah a very scary guy but you're totally right he's got to be tested we've seen many many guys like him go bust over him is uh he's a test but over him the guy where for 15 minutes if Francis lands that frickin bomb of his you know over he's probably going out cuz his chins not the same he's been in so many up-and-down Wars you know and he's uh Francis is a naturally bigger man I mean you gotta remember Alistair fought a 205 before we fought Chuck at 205 he was real skinny that's right Francis is a big motherfucker he's big I mean he is he's a natural 265 pound man thick dude yeah that's a dangerous guy because in the beginning of the fight especially he pushed pressure and he moves for it and puts pressure and he's like real blow civ and fast something gets in there something gets in there here here's the x-factor is over him in the clinch there's no one better than heavyweight division stern we haven't seen Francis in the clinch with a world-class guy like over him because again over and we forget because the demolition man's been around so long he gets you in that clinch those elbows those knees knees best knees into the fucking division yeah yeah I mean yeah that's Fujita yeah yeah that was horrifying yeah just killed a guy who's that other guy the kickboxer to share I think the kickboxer that he fought over in k1 where they decided to make it so he could only hold one hand behind the head Alistar would get two hands behind your head and that was nice work yeah demolition just dropped those knees on your chin it's not the fun is fighting the card to me Francis over him just where they go their career path stuff like that the gage Alvarez one is but they're both right up there did either one um look there's three giant fights in this card the Aldo Holloway fight is a giant fight for me I want that fight I want to see it I like to fight just if we're going off all those words saying he did have issues with his legs that's why I wasn't kicking before yeah I don't buy it I really don't buy anything that if that wasn't true I don't but because in his previous fights and fights after that he hasn't been using all of his tools well I think there's a strategy for that though the Frankie Edgar fight I really believed that he didn't use his kicks because I think he felt like Frankie was training for those kicks and he was training to kick take him down off the leg kicks everyone kicks though you know all the but he still got damn good he did it right he just amazed to me he's become very fundamental in just boxing plant his feet he's gotten away from what got him to the dance maybe maybe he was hurt if we yeah if we're basing it on those two fights and if you have to believe him and I'm just gonna believe him just for the sake of believing him if he says his leg was hurt it makes sense it also makes sense how he's getting tired quick he got tired pretty quick in that fight yeah they did which if he had a leg injury would make sense he wouldn't be able to push as hard and camp and he was he was winning those early rounds yeah that there was a huge speed advantage for all Don early in those rounds and then max Hollywood took over yeah well max Holloway measures you you doesn't burn himself out early he's got tremendous endurance he measures you and he starts to put it on you put it on you what max is really good at is distance control really good at movement and distance control and just not being there as all fighting seeking long yep and the kill doesn't in the cut doesn't kill him for 145 he's very tall very physically she's like a Mack truck yep hits like a truck and he's just got that thing here that one savage champion you're gonna have to kill him to get him out of there yeah man he's just it's he's a fascinating guy cuz he's like Hawaiian to the bone yes and you go over to Hawaii man and he has the next shot at being like the new BJ the BJ Penn me BJ Penn has a legend and he's a legend from the early days and he's a legend when he went up to heavyweight fought lyoto machida I mean he said Vijay was a fucking monster and my favorite people yeah monster so it's gonna be a while before max gets into those lofty grounds but he's on his way he's on his way and what since both BJ and Max are two of the nicest guys in the world super nice they both have that in common the both from Hawaii both monsters yeah no Matt max could especially at 145 because the Connors never going back there for max he could he could be a BJ Penn type yeah I wonder if he challenges Connor know if Charlie if Connor comes back who knows what if Connor dude you just get in a brawl in a bar so real oh so you know in Dana White scrum he goes listen it's if it was that big there'd be more video of it Dan goes I I'm Dana's basically saying I'm skeptical HIPPA lies that happened people that I know and Dublin and that are blowing me up or saying dude it's real Connors a bit of trouble because he has a friend from one area of Ireland that's in this mafia and that got beat up by these guys Connor finds out the guys who beat up his friend or in this bar so Connor comes in there beats the hell out of that guy well that guy's associated with this you know pretty intense Mafia family over there so now there's a hit out on Connors what they're saying what yes for 900 grand what mm-hmm now how much is that's true how much of his speculation I'm not sure holy shit because on my podcast I was like you know I don't it sounds like a bunch of hoopla people won't be associated and I've so many people in there going bro here's the background the guys that he's messing with and they've done some gnarly shit like there was a boxing promotion that they just came in dressed as like masked men and shot up the whole thing like did he's dealing with gnarly dudes Wow but then again I guess in Dublin especially Connor being who he is you can have these associations with this underground world stuff like that we trying to say about Dublin bro it's awesome man that is terrible that's a terrible scene yeah I don't believe I don't know the ins and outs of it I don't you know in Dana against a distance scrum it's always fascinating doing those those scrubs cuz it's all hearsay stuff like that but then they go you know what's next for Conor you got a fight for me goes listen man guys I heard million dollars in the bank fighting Sox yeah I don't know if he's ever gonna get punched in the face again here's a hundred million dollars so legit point it's a totally legit point but a hundred million dollars can go a lot faster than you think if you like the ball because here's the thing you don't really get a hundred million dollars you get a hundred million dollars but then you got a baby taxes you got to pay your trainer fee you got to pay whatever you pay your managers we're saying this Andy you won't have seventeen taxes yep nope nope hundred America in America if you make one hundred I mean like realistically I think it's everything over two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year as taxed right now with thirty five percent eight percent or something like that and then you know you got to think he's got managers and trainers and agents and when you make here's a question that I should know the answer to but I do not when you make money if you're from Ireland you make money in America do you have to pay taxes in America because I know you have to do that if you make money in Canada to make money in Canada like you do gigs in Canada you have to pay taxes to pay taxes in Dublin and and England and Australia and then you also have to pay those taxes when you get home you have to pay your own tax correct yeah so I don't know if you'd double tax but there's ways around it so let's say so let's say make city let's get to six I didn't say 40 I'll be cool let's be cool forty million that's just based off of the fight now think about is endorsed we can go through forty million dollars in three years if you're complete who'sa mania fucking moron know if you know if you the same type of guy that is Conor McGregor I don't know about that because we're basing off his Instagram which is a persona of him right so you so you see the Royals Royces that these watches a lot of stuff remember a lot of those Royals Royces people give to him right they donated on this because he was standing on one of them yeah yeah they're like bro day you're shitting on my Rolex but rolls-royce yeah so I think I don't know if he's that stupid with his money hmm that's interesting well if that's the case if he's not really completely balling out of control and all those Bentley photos and everything like that is all just for show and it's part of the persona and part of the act that makes sense well if that's the case and he just wants to live like a fairly large don't get me wrong but he's not Mike Tyson stupid James Jones but he's a private jet stupid right and he's like any law that can be borrowed yeah it could be I mean they're not even saying private jet stupid you got a hundred million dollars do whatever the fuck you want soar what I'm saying is if you want it to last for the rest of your days well if you just invest it right you're straight the thing is that the amount of possibility for him to make money it's so staggering right now that I don't see that this is gonna be the end of his career I just do not agree with anybody that thinks he's not gonna fight again I think you're crazy I think he's gonna get bored I think he's gonna want a challenge I think he's gonna realize there's a tremendous amount of money out there to be made I'm not crazy dinner White's crazy cuz I think he's gonna fight it yeah Dana said he doesn't thing he's gonna fight it's the fighting sucks no those aren't my words I actually think he's gonna fight again for because I think he's more than just about money the things more about his legacy and what is you know kind of footmark in the sport is and I think he knows he has to defend that 155-pound title but he also knows Manny Pacquiao called him out and he can go make a quick whatever 5060 million fighting Pacquiao yeah so there's a lot of opportunities there but I also know for a fact he has a shitload of opportunities in Hollywood as well non-stop damn so he for he's gonna be fine either way so he doesn't get shot by a Dublin gangster he should be fine yeah fuck the other thing is is GSP is not fighting Whitaker Jesus peace the rumor mill from what I hear is he he might want to see if he can cut 250 to cut 270 see if he can still get the 70 and do a super fight with Connor there Connor see that's what I had said I'd said that God's GSP would be like the biggest financial boom if I was WME I'd be like that's what they want to do that's that you know in a dream situation that's what all sides would want to have happened in GSP is taking time off now but I know he's gonna see if he can cut 270 to possibly make that happen they should be able to do it I mean thank where is he getting he is too thicker than a three musketeers right now he was thick city and that Bisbing fight he was pretty jacked it's a lot of we must be doing a lot of strength and conditioning yeah fucking I mean he's a muscular dude he's getting older too so the weight comes on no but I wonder what he's doing fuck his weightlifting routine you just have to get super strict also I bet I bet he could do it specially at 70 if you know he realized the possibilities on a super fight like Conor because I've seen the numbers on his fight with bismi no I think it came in at about 865 that's not bad not great though it's not as good as he could do what it's not as good as the the pay-per-view blockbuster stars no but it's not helping for four years see the thing is in you and I were talking about this is that we both agreed like there's a lot of fans that are fans down the dental have a fucking clue who he is except I at least didn't before that fight no they came in with Ronda yeah yeah post Ronda and post Conor I think Rhonda brought a gigantic group in and then Conor brought another even more gigantic group in especially the kids today that are like 18 19 20 21 to have no fucking idea no clue you have to be hardcore to know who GSP is correct but now they know now they know he's the middleweight champ holy shit he came back people will talk and it'll build it up and then the next one will be bigger I think he CI even if he fought Whitaker I don't think it breaks a million even now I think you're you're probably in the ballpark I think I'm done to be close to a million I think around 850 to 900 again it might be a little better maybe it's an Australian pay-per-view I think she has to have a partner a dance partner like Connor to break a million hmm well the Connor fight would be a million of Connor for my let me guess straight up yeah yeah I know if Connor and Jamie fucking two million two million specially now anything he does after that Floyd Mayweather there's so much you know just hide me one sees next movie and a it's gonna be biggest UFC of all time yeah just for that boy yeah there's not a lot of like giant matchups right now that are looming that make me excited more than that one does Connor versus GSP is like whoa that's like a like I want to sit down think about that one for a while oh well see I half thought then thought about it and it's it's not a great fight for Connor say seventy is not where Connor belongs especially with the greatest welterweight of all time who can grapple his balls rattle his balls off he gets you to the ground he's gonna fuck you up fuck you up he's so much stronger George is so big now when I put my arm around him when I was doing the interviews with him in two weigh-ins I was like what in the fuck this and this is like weighed in rehydrated all day and then I get to it like 6 o'clock which is what they're doing now she's kind of interesting but I was like wow he's like 200 pounds plus he's a big boy yeah he's way bigger than he used to be and like everybody thought that Bisping was gonna have this big advantage over him size-wise but when you see George George also has a very long style keeps his weight legs wide the ounces around a lot in and out and so he accomplishes a lot with his like his distance his ability to close the distance it's although the size strength and reach advantage that Bisping Hatton just didn't playing at all that being said though Bisbing I mean not Bisby GSP has no business being a middleweight that's not the land for him um Robert Whittaker is a dangerous fight for him at 185 it but it's really the only fighting grant down he's the champ that's the size isn't that big of a deal the problem is he's in his prime he's young hits like a Mack truck and he won't he's good at everything's good at everything and he fires fucking bombs at your face like yes he's technical striking just to the opening is there it's very interesting with Whitaker because he's the smaller guy at 85 in the land of the dinosaurs right now land of the giants with the Brock hold you got ul Jacare all these monsters Weidman's a big boy you have all those monsters then you have a guy like GSP who's your interim champion and then you got Calvin that people are talking about we're kelvins undersized guy to work with GSP is on the interim champion he's a legit champion Whitaker is the interim champ that's true which is such bullshit it's kind of crazy right yeah so you so you have two champions right but I'm going such bullshit is it though yeah it's bullshit what's posted about it take four years off you jump the queue you fight a guy that's perfect matchup run you and you win we got whittled walk through fucking right but he on sterling but in his defense he couldn't fight then he's injured I know I'm just saying right but if they could not have made the Whitaker versus Bisping fight any earlier because Whitaker's knee was fucked up I mean true he had a serious so there was no fight to be made other than this in the middleweight division unless you want to have Yoel just fought for the title and lost fight Bisping for the real title after he lost for the interim title that doesn't necessarily make sense forbid we should wait well I forbid let's rush it did you enjoy the GSP fight yeah I did so I'm not a hater what's the what's the objecting there's no objective I'm just saying as far as to me or real the real champion 85 would be Whitaker I don't I don't give just be that title I do because he knocked out Bisping Rock knocked out Rock Holt it's really simple Rockhold was absolutely the world champion this ranked base being absolutely knocked him out correct and then he beat Dan Henderson which is which is an argument there we like it as guys who worked and there's fans got to be real it's been the number one guy in the world at that time to fight from now it was exciting to give Bisping what he wanted which is a shot at redemption yeah but he great right he won the fight although Dan thought he won you know I could see Dan definitely hurt or more oh my god this means chin yeah incredible and what Dan said after the fight I wish they judge fights on how the other guy looks after that's later that's layers cuz he didn't have a scratch on his business should go down as the top three middle weights of all time just based off doing this with one fucking eye if you don't guess one eye man what he's doing is insane yeah he's got oil in his right eye right to keep his resume Yacktman he's one of the best of all time to me retinas are scary shit man shit shit when that stuff starts I'm just saying if you look at what Whitaker has done to become champion it's it's a little more impressive well it's a little more impressive because he beat ul Romero and he beat you well Romero in a fucking tough fight any beat him after you well we're Merrill hyperextends his leg and blew his knee out in the first round and before that he starched Jacare starched starched dark easily yeah so it's like you know he's walked through the fire the same thing with Francis you know you know we like you gotta walk through that fire man to me to get there I agree so but that's not the world we live in but you gotta make the piss pink fight if I was the UFC I woulda made that fight GSP says he wants to come back and fight Bisping this thing says I want to get that big payday too I could listen make this me too I'm with you I'm with you I make the fight too I make the fight too and what's interesting is you have the smart you know the of the smaller guy being the champ right Mountain for Kelvin he doesn't match up great with anyone freakin six through one but he does match up great with the champ so you have decide what you want to do with them cuz Kelvin can be world champion at 70 not at 85 unless he fights hold on hold on you don't think that Kelvin could beat GSP just he's not fighting a teef okay but he's the champ it doesn't matter yes Pete though if you can beat Matt Hughes we should have that conversation because Jimmy's gonna fight it but we didn't know but GSP is the 185-pound champ Mike that is competing at 185 but that's what it is what do you got here oh the orders they were where's Kelvin nine down at number nine yeah I think you should be a little higher he just knocked out the former champ Michael Bisping who's number two that doesn't make any sense I don't care if Bisping was coming off of a tough fight with GSP it's me definitely probably hampered his performance he should be at seven there's no way Kelvin should be at nine and Bisping is it - that doesn't make any sense maybe they didn't update it I'll hold up but you're saying Kelvin should be at - that's crazy that's someone I'm saying no what I'm saying is there's no way that Bisping should be too Kelvin just knocked him out and kelvins nine that doesn't make sense what's the point Evan ranking Kelvin shouldn't be nine but he shouldn't be too he should be past Bisping ooh that's tough what's the body of war know you just knocked him out doesn't matter the ranking is where are you at right now if a guy beats you in basketball tournament right isn't he doesn't he move forward in a wrestling tournament doesn't he move forward yeah we don't look at someone's past and say this is who you are forever we look at your present performance the last performance that Michael Bisping had was against Kelvin Gastelum Kelvin beat him in a decisive very clear and dominating way he moves ahead was that doesn't matter oh you don't care about he's ranked higher we all we can go on is the contest itself the contest itself was very obviously won by Kelvin in a spectacular way but bang he drops that right jab in that straight left hand a ste amazing performance monster he's ahead of Bisbing fact okay anybody says differently that's fine oh that's fine you can create that you can put them ahead of Bisbing however you can't put it at number two mentally in the world no I wouldn't because I think Weidman's in the mix yeah well Romero's ideal yes chakra is a bad matchup Luke Rockhold is a monster of that division Luke Rockhold didn't put money on somebody Luke Rockhold zoomy the chamber that division he could be very cut well could be or David branch almost took him out remember that branch hurt him Luke Rockhold not that bad I think he had a murder I think he had him hurt but Brock holds showed what a fucking animal he is and came through it but what happens if someone like you all Romero catches him like that what happens if someone like Robert Whittaker catches him like that with robbing I think my thing is Rockhold is a beast but anything can happen in that division when these guys are that good even David branch what I'm saying who's not if it was a very good fighter and hadn't lost like five years world series again though yeah again but gave until he got tired gave Rockhold a very tough experience he came in Rock yes he came Adam it was like rock hold dominant remember Raquel had a long ass layoff he's doing a modeling thing you know if he wanted this sort of natural b12 sort of money and that long ass laughs then you fight this what the middleweight champion light heavyweight champion world series and he that it's his biggest fight of all time yeah he brings it towards Rockhold rock hoard weathered the storm then just took over when the storm took took him down smash smash smash them depends okay see black my point is that that he both salutely did he definitely broke he warmed down to he was like he was exhausted by this basically after for how long about 14 months off mhm which you know now he's one of the most underrated guys especially at getting you down and holding you down look what he did lyoto machida look what he did to Weidman what he did to David branch those guys are all very good at the ground and he smashes and he go back to Strikeforce days is his chakra fights like Tim can you know he's not the best of the best he's definitely been a savage his entire career but you still have to realize Bisping did knock him out and you know what man you're in a division where you're talking about a ton of psychos like you got Robert Whittaker Yoel Romero Chris Weidman you got GSP if you decide to stay in the division but you don't think you will better okay he's a champ but you gotta curse the champ you get you got these killers and then Luke Rockhold might be the best out of all of them yes but he might not be we really don't know I mean I'm excited about that I'm excited about them I'm excited about you look at him on paper yeah Rockhold might be the best a bunch but god damn it's hard to root against Whitaker it's hard to bet against that guy yeah all I'm done better gets Witek especially after he stuffed all those fucking takedowns from Yolo Romero with one knee I'm on that Whitaker train just like I'm in the deer until train yeah 80 85 70 and 55 in the UFC is so goddamn good right so compare it's the best it's ever been light heavyweight the worst it's ever been heavyweight land of the dinosaurs but 55 70 85 pull up that mundane meek Camaro Uman fight we should find out that fights actually been canceled it hasn't been canceled he's trying to get his visa yeah he hasn't fucking Donnell try let him in I know man what you gotta do is things crises a Viking I'm gonna meet Chris your people I'm gonna meet ran yeah I'm a meek fan dude at 70 good luck at 70 yeah good luck it's 70 Camaro Oman is fucking terrifying and no one's even talking about him because there's so many killers in that here we go Emil meek explains status of 219 fight with Camaro Oman Vee issues so he's just hoping so hoping they could sort it out but that must be tough going through training camp either a ten day thing or take six months or anything in between that's all the OSI office just told me to have patience the question is not about if I'm going to get it or not it's just when I get it and if I get it in time I hope it can you know that's uh I mean feel like fuckin POW that's what I'm saying my boy meet into the goddamn States what is this we have tried to get this car when retired oh wow this seems like their nose and no interesting fights and I'm not getting younger let me explain let me just lay my gloves down right here on I did it on reddit Wow hour ago wait why is he done though thank you to each and every one of you it's odd to be healthy and unable to compete yet able to compete when so unhealthy I guess we end I don't know what that thing Q made a mistake there with never know I guess we end with never knowing what could have been somber would be the best Bay to describe the emotion thank you all for the love the insults and the great time I will sink back into the mode of being a redditor and my quest to become a mod here was he really sort of making a little joke there I am also on the hunt for a large fedora I'm like eight and a half that's my ass Shane seriously thank you often bottom my heart for being a maid and for being amazing and for making the sport amazing I thought he was retired and then I thought he was coming back out to him if I did belt or just tell him though or something yeah I think he just put his name and I just called out Mitrione he gently like two days ago just said he wanted to fight here's what it's weird he says it's odd to be healthy and unable to compete yet able to compete when so unhealthy I mean it's odd that he's healthy now and he can't get a fight today that means the Commissioner maybe someone told him he can't fight or maybe Bellator was like nah we're good son well I wouldn't never say couldn't fight in terms of like the punishment he's taken I mean he's like the Junior dos Santos fight was tough to watch those the tough that was a tough one to watch he's had some tough fights but I mean a lot of guys have if you're gonna let Oberyn fight how could you not Shane Carwin fight unless it's like the spinal surgery stuff yeah I'm not sure what's going on that but but also he could fight in Rison I would imagine that they would talk clear why he need but by you know that they had an issue with him where he was getting divorced and he had some personal issues apparently they were saying yeah and he had a pullout of their tournament remember yeah in the fight they were very upset they they're very upset at all that he backed down yeah and they said they said some things about him you know not having warrior spirit or some crazy shit like that sure relax rides and shit happens yeah I mean not only that you'd only have so many fucking heavyweights yeah you're also rising so it's relaxed yeah Shane Carwin back but half Shane Carwin over there and just full-on max yes see what happens let the party roll mix it up especially mean chains in his 40s right hold the shame hell yeah he's in his forties yeah yeah let it roll let it roll rise ins the spot I mean look we should have a steroid league we should have a league where some people are not Daniel Cormier says faces volcon O's Damir at UFC 220 in Boston ooh Wow breaking news folks breaking news hosed Amir scary but there's it there's the guys get the quickest rise to the top ever this is my face for that fight you don't care I care I'm lukewarm on it with those I love DC I love DC and I wish he was a bigger star and he should be a bigger star but I you know he's gonna be phenomenal as a commentator and I think he flies through those men do you really yes easily I think oohs knew me as dangerous for anybody man anybody good luck dealing with DC when he gets you in the clinch it's true that's true he's a master light heavyweight of all time not named John Jones strong who's better nobody he was the heavyweight champion twice in Rumble twice beat Gustafson he's a champion Grand Prix than that think about the people in that Grand Prix yeah man we did to Josh Barnett we just Brenda had a broken hand but up in there no he did to port Dan Henderson how by the way DC how dare you treat our legend like that how dare you take an old weathered anise and spike him on his head you son of AB don't make a rag doll I love DC men I like that fight for DC I'm hosed of her fan I think be hilarious to his champions is 700 Twitter followers but I think that DC is gonna mop the floor though interesting unless it's a barn Florida that's dimmer story I'm just interested in seeing what happens if if he gets hit cuz O's Damir is very fast and it's very hard and has a shocking reaction DC's been hit hard oh for sure rumble Rumble rocked him rock the Broxson and overhand right in the first fight and head kicked him in the second yeah buddy sat him down yes he popped up yeah don't be DC's a monster no doubt I'm just interested because I think always do me really does have special power you you you see him hit people you like cheese's and according to everybody that watched him and Rumble train like he was the guy to train with Rumble all the time it's one of the few guys that want to spar and what they say about it so they went to war really I'd watch that watch that I would watch food that's was my OS to me are so good so that was the rebels like train with Rome he was like everybody scared around ball how do you happy scared rather they not just knock each other out every day I think they're smart they hit each other just hard enough do you like let each other know they're hitting each other and look you want a valuable sparring partner I mean don't break your toys yeah look it's benefiting the both of them obviously here's one for you how about Rumble once come back heavyweight Rumble steep a for the curveball here's the thing you can't really do that because you just fought as a light heavyweight and then quit and said I don't want to do this anymore we come back your fights at heavyweights back bro said he doesn't like fighting what do you say I don't like playing but I'm back I mean what happened was like retirement life ain't fun is it it's not it's boring right and I just answer your he knows he could be champion to like he really does have championship skills you know I mean he's got how he does for sure you know unquestionably has enough power to knock out any human being in 15 if DC and John Jones are out yeah he's the guy if DC got hit with that uppercut that glover got hit with he goes night-night - i think those guys are too smart for that right they don't fight that style well they didn't yeah clover was too easy to hit for him but I think he realizes that anybody in the war I mean he literally might have a 100% chance to beat anybody in the world but and I have you no no no not a hundred percent chance do you know anybody in the world but I'm saying he might have like a 60% chance like in any fight with anybody he could connect with a bomb and put your fucking lights out he's that powerful so that alone in his head means like if he fought John Jones 60% of the time he might be able to catch John Jones it might be yeah if he caught John Jones or anybody he hits so fucking hard but he definitely froze up against DC in the second fight he did not look like a guy who was there to do her die did he hit that path that they keep jacking off to if he hit the path I would like to see that I'd like to see that it gets harder didn't got him gone was a lot bigger than him man yeah but Anthony Johnson does feel a lot more he's more explosive especially when you put Anthony Johnson on that healthy diet and he's the 240 empty Johnson yeah he's gonna hit like a Mack truck very interesting seems in heavy rancis Rumble Johnson black on black Kaepernick could show up for that bitch you get would be rumbles gonna have take you I'll fight in heavyweight it's just awesome oh my god he's ready to go no no no you get him that Russian dude it likes to choke people so the Russian has no idea I fight black men and just fucking get starched yeah that would be interesting I want to see what happened it was that guy give him somebody who's you know keeping the gonna encourages mount so you can get a choke the guy's gonna come after him he's gonna come after him Alexei Holiness yes and powerful Lexi yeah deep in his 40s same hairline his bride Dallas 52 and 11 he's been through the fucking the ringer you think he gives a fuck about how hard rumble hits now here take that fine you know I got dick foot all day it took stricter fucking right the ball he's yeah that would be a fun fight you might be my head fuck knows what if he gets rumbled down what if he gets rumbled down we see him inside mount we're going on a rear naked choke from the side yeah everyone's in trouble that motherfucker I think it's all your neck rumbles in trouble if you get mount on him man he that guy's a monster he's a monster from the bottom I'm sure each other that dude out from his back at my did he gave it to him crazy crazy yeah he's a he's a squeezer there's certain dudes it just can squeeze your neck and I went out Rumble in the first round might be the most dangerous man in the world yeah wonder maybe look I mean I don't know how much you weighed he was cut to make 205 but if he's really walking around to 30 to 35 and that doesn't have to cut anything he might be better at heavyweight so I'm saying skim on that punch meter she's got Francis just give him a good fight over doom duper duper Dilma kill your dreams man dudes a motherfucker who's a motherfucking strike yes on the world on the ground huge yeah I don't give a fuck about the Golden Snitch cuz he's never been caught doesn't take anything yeah get some issues for doom comes on for you in that jiu-jitsu is just on another planet dude how about how about and what when what fight was that that backed out oh the black beast was huge Derrick Lewis man we're talking about dear glue social media is there the best might be the best he's fuckin hilarious hilarious hilarious shout-out to Duke Lewis shout-out to the black beetle in some hilarious shit I wanna fight soon but remember dick useless fight for Doom than that like ours for the fight that guy can't do it so this filled in random homeboy yeah and he was just business god yeah just fucking it's a beautiful transition when took his back and then took the arm off the bed I was like he's teaching his students and things about the army show you out it was so easy for there's a payday then fights that rush and goes five rounds yeah that's why he won't be ready to fight steep a in Boston I wonder if he would he yes you say five rounds I don't know Tabora caught him a few times but it never got rocked - throws out class yeah I never got hurt no and you know for Doom one if he didn't get injured Boston is January mm who knows talk to him in a couple of weeks how you feeling bro especially for a title shot yeah I feel doing sprite down no he won't face deep effort I don't wait for this monster Francis that we're not sure about yeah it all depends on how much damage he took in that fight he did get leg kicked a few times down though man yeah you know he is but did he get hurt like is there anything fucked up in his wrist is his elbow okay you know little shit that happens in a fight that nobody even knows about training camps yeah and during a fight as well right so what else is going on this weekend there's those those fights this Holloway Edgar which is very interesting there's gage E versus Eddie Alvarez that's a that's that's the one that I'm most excited to see who dope ettus so who dope edits that's the one I wanted to talk about that's another one and Paul Felder and Charles Oliveira for the fs1 prelims that's another very interesting one because Oliveira just got done he was he's fighting in 45 to drain at 45 and just choked out will Brooks remember that yes well Brooks having a tough time no time in UFC I thought he's gonna do really well too with his bottom yeah Lance caught him any kids is that a tough go over in the UFC yeah look man this is the highest level of the game for sure when a lot of you it's weird cuz Brooks I'm tough time you see a lot of UFC guys having a tough time in Bellator the different divisions still is probably the strongest over there in Bellator 70 right now especially with Rory MacDonald there I think is as strong as it gets I think you got Douglas Lima you got Rory MacDonald you like like the lorenz larkin you got Michael venom page you got Paul Daley who just knocked out lorenz larkin you got a gang of fucking assassins Paul's the most limited because of his ground game yes you know what a guy like Rory gets you down like he showed how to beat Paul you know that's just but if you stand with Paul he's got a chance idea he's got a chance against anybody no one other doing daily vs Michael venom page yeah that's a great fight that's crazy fine great fight and you know Roy McDonald wants to be an alternate in the heavyweight tournament he's out as fucking crazy I've got him verse you know fucking matryona fucking mine yeah those guys are huge huge he's more technical alone but a point doesn't matter how much does he weigh Roy's maybe one ninety ninety five babies a lot of fucking cream yeah yeah it's just a bad idea yeah you know what is so gangster yeah he is but there's some gorillas in that division well think if they let Shane in the thing about Shane was Chael Sonnen who's gonna sanction that fight yeah he's fine rampage he's a page that seems kind of crazy to it does it that makes more sense me at least rampage spot at light heavyweight and chase you're similar that's true but you know I don't know I don't know why they made Matt and Roy on the same the first round I would I would put him on opposite sides around cuz we've seen that you'll see I'll put him on opposite sides well I think they wanted that fight to happen they wanted that rematch to happen you know and I think Mitrione right like if I was if I was in the fade or camp whose fate are fighting first frag me hell yeah that's a dangerous fight dangerous fight son that's dangerous fight then you got King mo Ryan Bader especially under non snitch like testing well that that hold that hold tournament yeah it's non snitch like oh hold up son well okay so you got Quinton Rampage Jackson Chael Sonnen that's at the Forum Seth's the LA that's the California Commission there strictest fuck but the Mohegan Sun Arena Mitrione Roy Nelson suspect and then Allstate Arena what city is that in there's Allstate but if I was if I was fader I'd only want to do it in the middle of the Indian Reservation yeah we're going to be as far from the outskirts no possible we fight an inclusive casino yeah we're gonna move to the virtual Center yeah put up but a juiced-up Frankfurt so juiced up fatal that's a dream match where's that Allstate Arena of Chicago Rose cago got a good athletic commission might be fucked mmm they gotta get those doctors that they brought in for that Icarus movie kind of all out of all the goddamn fights how does Mitrione Roy the two guys who have never tested hot end up in Mohegan Sun hey because they knew they didn't have to worry about them testing yeah I know but you put phaidor in franken mohegan but what they don't want them to be able to go fucking hardcore alright then you don't have fun that's fine alright Scott do you think man do you think Scott I love you do you think man I'd had that inclusive casino juice to the gills all day pride the old days and how's Bobby latching on that tournament that's good I get why check congas on it a little boring Bobby last night someone they go yeah um we just can't Bobby come on just come on nobody thinks you're clean but nobody's never mama dude what do you think am i clean boy you know your ink I would watch Bobby fader Bobby Roy Nelson be sick he decided that down mmm I don't I know I know he's got great genetics I know he worked hard he's skilled as a mother skilled as a mother fucker strike - that was a grappling beast but one of the best wrestlers I've ever seen but that is the body of a man who's been to the mexican pharmacy how dare you or had someone go for him how dare you or bought it from a dude who went that he got it at the gym I mean that's just that's just steroids cuz he's never failed oh my god that's not even that looks chuckles a guy prometheus those dues from Prometheus ridiculous bodies that brought the DNA to earth yes people those John it did pull up one of them dudes for Prometheus and put it right by I love a side by the way I love that movie put right beside him the Prometheus Jack dude where he looks like the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles act in that image he like literally had the body of one of those Prometheus guys like right there with the shirt off by the ocean bang make that larger let's go Jesus Christ look at the size of him come on he's bigger he's bigger I would say bobby lashley steamrolls that dude from promy huge steam roll like 90 difference if he's the same size as that guy go one more bobby lashley fucked hog he's that's but that's a real human but i'll bobby lashley college pick he's always been jacked I believe it I mean he's definitely got phenomenal genetics but the idea that there ain't nothing going on but the rent yeah I don't know talk to Jimmy Smith about where they have him fight yeah no I know where they have them fight yeah I just I'm giving the guy a break I think he's awesome but I think there's a reality to pride that made it exciting and made it fun correct you know and where I would like to see one of those things today whether it's rise in or took the size.i dude I mean again phenomenal genetics maybe he really has taken gamma labs but it's part of me I want to go back to the old Arsenio Hall days things that make you go I don't care go go large in that picture okay timber Bob Sapp oh my god pops out in his prime Bob Sapp in his prime was not even a human being he was a science project a full-on science he's paid Bob some resources Nogueira go to Bob Sapp versus Nogueira there's a time where the beginning of fight Nogueira is standing there ready to find Bob Sapp a stand-in there and Bob saps gloves look like miniature because his body is this wide he's like cartoon moves and cumbersome my only thing with bobby lashley is I've seen guys than NFL who aren't hot that looked like him oh yeah it's possible it's totally possible bobby lashley is also 40 right isn't he yeah yeah yeah wrestle in the milk just let it happen for the first round like watch it comes out look at the fucking size of them despite no guarantees neck yeah he was so big he was at one point time I think he was 300 plus pound thought was 400 oh I don't know about that wasn't it was 300 plus pounds with apps like 350 or 375 with oh my god they don't teach that in any gym in the world huge that's so bad for your neck I'll do that Nogueira almost had to retire because of that really yeah his the worse injuries ever sustained so what happened to his neck D bulging discs it def surgery like that so that's one of the things that really fucked him gear up it's amazing that he's still fought and won and won amazing God Nogueira man will the fucking Savage he almost got taken out because of a fucking head spike you know fader was not willing to fight him fader was like no thanks like yah to throw those crazy kicks to from when you're on your back then you could kick to the face lookee I forgot he got reversed remember that think of that monster on top of you jeez think out that much of a badass Nogueira skills you know what I'll fight freakin Bob Sapp even though he's juiced to the gills look at this Bob stats on top foam he has his back and I am rocking them smashing them smash city yeah crazy of a struggle city for big knives right there about this you forget about this fight you forget how big of them oh my God look at that that's a grizzly bear oh Jesus Christ but if you hit them when you hit the bully in the face they go away look at this remember he almost had him in a triangle and got slammed yeah that's a bad idea do that yeah the triangle slam the Ricardo Arona Rampage Jackson triangle slam should be shown to every kid who wants to hold on to a triangle ever they need to watch this because this is real two bombs that beats the best ever burnt the leg locks and everything look at this I forgot he went to leg loss they fought some the best ever not beat this was a nutty fight and again this is a fight that phaidor wouldn't take but fader was like no no no rush I understand what he's taking yeah even and even though when there wasn't the one no gear do the rematch he's like dude was spiking my can't with my neck man it's too much him said in my life my career look at him yeah he's battered but how entertaining is amazing like well it's amazing but now Noah and he I love with this when he hit him with the Granby roll whoop-whoop on your back son and when Rex I won what'd he want I remember watching and we were going crazy look at me and Eddie were fucking screaming at this fuckin armbar beautiful God when he straightens it out and Bob taps it's like no fucking way but this is not just jujitsu this is Lee that tighter tighter it's not just jiu-jitsu with Nogueira it's just toughness and just animal spirit well the topic is Purdue is his warrior heart that allowed him to get through getting spiked on his head like that and battered and that's just 350 pound juggernaut on top you dropping bombs let's just still get rushmore Mount Rushmore fuck man what a crazy time those Pride dates were yeah what a great hockey bone oh yeah do you know whose high speed Akebono with an armbar how badass is hoist fucking Gracie oh my god hoist Gracie fought Akebono with pants on he fought like with G pants I can ride he did got Aki Bonin grabbed some bar look at this size of my component Jesus Christ he's bono said fuck your key though ooh that dude is thick this is a Bob Sapp though that has started to lose his physique like this is uh into his career where he had been fighting you know like you'd only like the levels of juice that he was on during those days of glory like when he fought Nogueira those are just not sustainable no he also hated fighting I have a friend that that shows I'm a little bit fighter with him and he used to train with Bob and said towards the end of his career he wouldn't barely train at all he's just do it for the payday he just walked in there yeah and he would tap whenever he got hurt and yes he was smart about it like he knew he could make money he would go places they'd want to see people beat Bob Sapp and see he would go and he would not take much of a beating did in Tokyo he was like on the fucking Wheaties box and stuff you sound like all sorts of merchandise he by his use shitstain undies and stuff but do you know what happened do you know the whole story no something happened with Kay one where he had a contract that he was supposed to go out and fight but they hadn't given the contract daddy said I'm not signing I mean I'm not fighting without a fucking contract I need my money legit point and wound up leaving there's some sort of a contract dispute and wound up leaving before the main event just dip down he's dipped out said fuck this I'm out I'm not fighting and you know they're like Oh what that's the year who's like you're done you're dumb I didn't know that yeah yeah and I guess you know whether or not I don't know whose stories correct and all I know is the story that I've read in the story that I'd read was that you know he was upset they hadn't given him the contract yet and they wanted him to just fight and deal with it later yeah come on bro listen if they can get you to do something it's specially right before god damnit all right boom yeah well when I talk to people that are Japanese about the way they would do business over there it says really interesting he's like one of the things that like when the UFC was talking to pride it was really interesting because they would have these like meetings and they would talk about selling it you know but they really didn't want to sell it they just wanted you to say that you wanted to buy it like okay good and see you later they stopped but then it also pumped up pride like everybody in the UFC tard talking about Vandelay was gonna fight Chuck and they were bringing them together but these Japanese business when were they were playing like super high-level sophisticated reasonable chess very tight move and then here's the tightest of type move I'm not happy that they did this but they essentially sold the UFC 60 million dollars worth of nothing they got a they got a fucking video library of fights and they got pride to be out of business that's what they got yeah 460 whatever million dollars they paid because a lot of the contracts were no good you know that's why Fedora was never in the UFC mean in the mark hunt think they were willing to pay mark hunt out there like willing to give you your money he's gonna not fuck that I want to fight yeah UFC didn't want mark to fight yeah remember when Mark first got the F seat it wasn't pretty days he almost got submitted by Krista sure sure yeah he had some rough days it some rough days yeah by somebody like in his first Sean OH corkle yes Sean McCorkle Sean McCorkle caught him with the Kimora his first fight in the UFC submitted them yeah submitted them huge upset and then he had the Sean McCorkle is a funny fucking guy you say some ridiculous shit online no he's still alive there's a funny guy funny get the time him and Matt used to train together I think they had a show but yeah mark struggled for a little bit there and then he had the walk-off home run knockout of Chris does assure ya that horrible fight in Denver fuck did Rafa Rafa because they both got so tired cuz now yeah and now I was asking Joe Silva dude let me fight my hometown music will never do heavyweights in Denver again because of that meanwhile they have can fight for Doom or they have Mexican city can fight for Doom in Mexico City which is 2,000 feet higher that idea the ridiculous so what else going on in this card is that it should we just wrap this up I think it got kind of get fluent yeah you can get it covered we kind of got the card covered oh the Paul Felder Charles Oliveira fight Felder is a fucking beast man you know Phil there's another guy who I mean and I'm I'm interesting I'm not hating I mean I'm not saying they can't do it I missed you see you know obviously DC DC's been able do it Dominick Cruz obviously got injured but he was supposed to fight he's out the fight now but guys who were working as analysts and fighters at a certain level are you gonna be able to continue at the highest level and compete you know analysis enough for I think it's gonna find hurt him I think in fact it's enough so it like probably takes his mind off the training a little bit lets him relax and let some analyze fights I don't think it's that big of a deal and when he did do the commentary he was really good at it that's my thing here really good really good I'm really good at it so he has a future in it for sure once he decides to retire Paul could be an amazing commentator I still think he's in his prime I think it's potentials in commentating I think it's a higher potential accounting that he does being the world champion the UFC I'm not willing to sign him off yet I'm not signing him off he's a phenomenal fighter he's a phenomenal fighter I don't know if he's world champion but he's phenomenal fight how crazy would he be worse is gauging that's a fun fight that's a fun fucking fight he's an animal Felisa versus gage he would be maybe like a perfect style matchup never mad when Cooper fights no I'm excited about this fight I'm because Oliveira is very technical on his feet although he's super technical and he you know he's sneaky on the ground but he just can't get over that hump you had so much promise he just couldn't over that hump he can't beat Erik Silva yeah where there's so much promise and we thought there gonna be this and just has in the line for him the pseudo Pettis fights are very important fight two very important when you look at Sahu toe when he came off of that fight with Wilson Hayes he looked amazing sensation but also what's screwed not screwed I mean it was the good experience but when he fought tamesha's Johnson had no but you know seven fight mixed martial arts fight seven fight he should not been in there Dimitri's jobs just not ready now we see he's a little more well-rounded he's a phenomenal power puncher obviously a ridiculous wrestler for Pettis it's a tough one for him to take on here very tough and he's a young kid you know Pettis is only 24 I think he's very young he's very young he's he's out of his brother's shadow now for sure he's on his brother's shadow well with a few wins his brother still a former world champion both in Strikeforce and in the UFC brother just lost again they lost a bunch still he's fighting in a way higher level up until this fight at least this fight is uh this is like world-class level for for Pettis this is like the most difficult fight I think under fish center yeah yeah it's a little too much too soon I think for Pettis in that David tamer dude he's fighting against her car close that fucking you see tamer fight he was the one who fought land overnight yes oh he's nasty his monster he's a fucking savage savage kickboxer man that's gonna be a whole year fucking go Khan's out of the fight battery I'm not sure you got hurt that's a bummer that is a bummer how about Holly I'm sure will Holly cyborg da-da-da-dah it's interesting I'll tell you what nobody has more compose or composure nobody has more composure in their Instagram videos then Holly she's the most composure she's like when she says profound cyborgs been saying that I haven't been tested she's a politician but actually I've been tested nine times yeah she's been tested eight times so some of us are out here training worrying about who's being tested it's so like thank you thank you have a good thank you and ready to head kick a bitch that's in direct contrast to her fucking back flips she's a politician and head kicks like a politician very smart man very calm and smooth and she's like a real all-american girl like you look at Holly Holm and she got freckles and shit she's pretty she looks like an all-american gray head kicker and a beat cyber in the tough if it's tough if she beats cyber to me she's number one of all time she beat Ronda in her prime right I should beat cyborg in her prime what are we doing I know she had those rough loss reports on we should take I know listen Miesha Tate strangled her and she was still punching in the air while she was going unconscious yeah that's how savage Holly Holm is I know and such a great matchup we should take did get her and Misha got her in the fifth round of a fight she was losing her back and put her to sleep we should tape fans oh yeah fan but she's retired yep she wanted doing Holly cyborg you know but it's it's that Holly cyborg yeah I'm wonder what kind of numbers that does cuz that's your headliner on there right now cuz you know Tom Cruise is off well it's gonna show you the power of like top-flight women's and the main fights and then there's the you know there's the cyborg aspect like people tune in she's like a cultural icon sort of a thing like people tune in to see like oh that cyborg chick she's scared yeah either and scary being me not physically scared I'm scary but the way she destroys violence very violent violent and very technical her last fight wasn't that violent but she wanted to show most was being a crazy I mean zombie traumas and Tonya avenger' zombie mom she didn't give a fuck she was throwing a mom oh my gosh I'm a mom she's tough as fuck that mom bought and also would not go away like I said that if you were watching like a youtube or a lot I wouldn't be on YouTube it pull it from YouTube like a live leak outside of a bar in Kentucky she some chick gets up puts her fucking cigarette down and rolls up the sleeve the flail shirt probably wearing your shirt at the very shirt you're wearing and just throws haymakers on some chick and she's got her by yeah and she's fucking drop in Muay Thai elbows on her but she's getting she'd be like the Kimbo Slice of soccer moms in the backyard brawls she's a tough tough woman he's a tough animal I enjoyed that fight because of her I agree she made the fair she made the fine cheese she fucking had some whistling shots swinging by cyborgs chin she for it hook it she took it she took it had she was going for it yeah that's off took a fight a lot of people didn't want nobody what's that fight yeah I mean look at fucking and Jermaine Duran to me said yeah I'm good you can keep your title just fighting her she's done yeah but she testicle Ino I don't care man not not recently enough no no you got to get a tester again in like ten years yester every day for 10 years no drawing me said fuck yes I love that side work fight though I do too but I wanted to see what numbers it does see Jermaine to random he's a very technical striker that's why I thought her vs. cyborg would be interesting I mean German German der enemy fought a man that's how crazy scary cyborg is Jermaine fought a man and K owed him this video of if you've watched it she's like I'll fight a man I just I'm off the Koran Demetrius you just when you give up the balance eat not fuck it she's just she's too much well I'm a I'm a fan of her talent she's a very talented fighter but she should've been champ in the first place I agree Holly beater and I think she should have been penalized for sure gifts for at least one of those after the bell shot 100% she landed two after the bell shots one of them was devastating like she really rocked Holly beater yeah I think Holly beater I think you got to take into consideration what scoring system they were using back then because I do not think that they were using the new MMA's also in New York in its early day New York when I say early daily ago I think the refereeing I mean I think the refereeing could have been better because I do think she should have been penalized for those shots after the bell and when Holly had kicked her that was one of the most significant moments in the fight the other most significant moment of the fighters in Holly dropped with a straight left hand yeah so those are two giant moments in the fight and they're both on Holly side and then there was the two shots after the bell which you could conceivably penalize her for at least one you have to yeah I do for one that's why I thought hole in the fight yeah I would agree with you I would agree with you because other than that Holly did the most damage in the fight for sure but Doreen de mandarine Germaine de random II was controlling the action the beginning of the fight until Holly landed that question mark kick and funk remain the question why kick is a beautiful kick it's just a beautiful kick you know if you're good at if you get that over the top like rock holds beautiful at that he's really gonna no one does better than Donald but yeah Donald kind of he doesn't beautiful yeah I feel like Donald when he kind of made that his thing in the UFC yes yeah forehead get Kos question mark kicks there's been some other ones in the past I'm trying to remember you see that one that video I think Justin ran posted but ESPN blasted that the wheel kick that land and knocked that dude out the heel landed right on the dude's chin it's so gnarly oh the one with the dude ducks down and throws an up wheel kick the guy's throwing a head kick there's a black guy and a white guy yes I throw yes and the dude ducks down like almost like a cartwheel kick and throws like this yeah he'll kick up and that she'll goes perfect shot my god like the way through it do you know what the video is yes well it's almost like that but what it's like is like he just knew where the dude's chin was gonna be and ducked himself so you know you bend your body but it's just very rare that you see someone landed at that angle especially with the heel yeah that was like this boom crazy it's almost like it's hard to know whether or not that was like perfectly placed or just crazy lucky timing I think good like watch this watch it yeah so you see him here he's going to give a up see but that's not the way did it so it's not a normal path it's really amazing almost like he almost adapt to do it straight up once yeah he knew he was gonna I mean really you'd have to see him fight more to see how good he is with his kicks but that shit was perfect let's see I warned ass more time cuz it's crazy look at that look at the title and what your MMA fighter starch is opponent see right here I got I cuando guy would see the shifting of the hips and then the shoulder moves towards the left yeah I see that right there you see that right there that is absolutely he's about to spend see the right leg moves the right leg slides back you're showing your cards then yeah yeah yeah so that you don't see it wonderboy he's not gonna you're not gonna see that no he's showing us he's flashing his aces yeah but he's also doing it in timing with this left high kick which is so brilliant so the left kick is coming he sees the left kick and he's like yeah check this out bro and then it goes you know what I think he did on purpose but you had a percent percent Oh I mean he either improvised in the moment or he did it exactly this on purpose like saw it coming but either way it's just a perfect shot do to dodge kick and land this he I'm psychic skillful shit amazing he's head kick and landed a perfect like crazy 90-degree angle wheel kick to the mug amateur fight okay yeah that's crazy it's crazy how he saw the left high kick to look nice mm fuckin a maybe SPN as an amateur fighting an ESPN I know right now you gotta you gotta make up for that okay that you gotta carry that with you everybody's looking for the head kick the next one can't be ground-and-pound such a thing now yeah I just get married to it thing really early on right becomes a real problem because real problem like you're known as like if gauge he just decides tomorrow to fight like tyron woodley [Laughter] there's me a riot go crazy like would have gauge you got a title shot against Tyron Woodley and they both like mirrored each other it was like like like what the fuck is going explode wait wait wait wait wait have you seen how hard your blade Kolbe commenting is getting going in the paint announcer Graham Woodley oh my god have you seen his recent one with the sandals he did a Black Friday sale with these sandals mocking Woodley did you know you gotta see it I don't see how he's mocking Woodley with sandals you'll see it like they're not real sandals he's just like a make sure you get your sandals this Friday and it's the sandals of Woodley saying one thing why he'll fight Nate Diaz but saying another thing life won't fight Colby there it is no Ariel GSP is ducking me he just wants money fights Ariel I'm not ducking Colby or anyone at 170 I want to fight Nate because it's a money fight that seems like he's saying the same thing yes yeah he just keeps wanting money fight I want to fight Nate because it's a money fight yeah I get it what do you do with Woodley good question you offer him a big fight I'm almost positive make sure I'm right on this before I get destroyed on the the underground but I think Dan goes we never offered Woodley the Diaz fight Rob so he's just trying to get it pretty sure look the real Diaz fight as the other Diaz that's the Rick was it Nick suspended though let him pay that fucking money back Tyron Woodley responds to claim Nate Diaz fight was never offered delusional Dana constantly demotes me as a fighter whoa in regards to what though Jimmy because is the claim that Nate Diaz fight was never offered to him delusional didn't Dana yeah but did Dana say it constantly demotes me as a fighter when the job is when the job is to promote his fighters especially champions Woodley said why would I get in camp why would Nate give a fifteen million dollar purse request if there was no fight it's obvious they haven't found their blockbuster headliner yet this was a reality and they know it the inability to come to financial terms with Nate killed it oh there's but there's Dana going one of our attorneys here started playing matchmaker which is weird he said he has a good rapport with the Diaz brothers and he basically said to Nate what if you could fight Woodley me and Sean show we were like how does he deserve to fly Woodleigh there's no effing list of guys that are waiting to fight time Woodley and there is a fuck oh there is there's a fucking what he talked guys there you go yeah okay so the attorney went out of his way the tourney the attorney fucked up who's this attorney kind of slap dick attorney tries playing these games that's what I would do fake attorney quitter Twitter accounts no would you be interested in that nice grin I know you say a retard with how return are you get back at me dude didn't ask it on the podcast fuck yes dude to me his career is a sad story it is a guy that never was yeah that well they for whatever reason they couldn't work it out with him you know see a Medina they had their disagreement and also his fighting style but for him never to compete there my name is Gordon man if you're a fan of fighting that style is important because Ben Askren shuts motherfuckers down and he shuts good guys like Lima and Baltar man we've shut Lima down like chorus cough shut him the fuck shot him down those are world class video ki yeah shut his ass it's such a bummer he never got in the UFC and you know what I gotta be honest I think if that same GSP showed up that fought Bisbing shows up to fight Askren Askren beats on whoa I know crazy right to me asking it's a sad story it's a sad sad story I agree he's my if I had one wish to get a guy in the UFC that's never been in the UFC he'd be the guy me too like his fate or it's like you already get in the seam in Bellator video zone just K Odom you know I get it but not at this stage at this stage I would say without doubt it was Askren I would use my golden ticket if I had one with Dana to get Baskin in yeah I would too but you know he called Dana like a fat bald steroid monkey and what does that mean but how many things has Dana said about guys no you don't say like this is style thing to the word that is styles boring I understand that they are in the business of fighting but I mean I kind of am but I'm kind of not I'm in the business of I'm a fan of fighting and I'm not just a fan of fighting like I like to watch fights I want to see what the fuck really works the best and when a guy can do what Ben Askren has been able to do time and time again in his career two world-class fighters take them down smother them beat the shit out of them that's entertaining it's not just entertaining it's important for the for the art form I agree to adapt to that style that I'm gonna know that a guy can do that to a guy like Lima oh my god like chorus correct but also been asking Kentucky speaks well yes he can hype the fighter on social media he speaks very well he's a boy Olympian yeah he's also an Olympian and how about this Floyd Mayweather does not win fights cuz this is exciting no we may want to see you and Connor fight yeah I see him lose cuz he's a good trash talker we should start our own promotion we really should I wish you would go in a football field don't you know that I don't do football field freak party fighting productions the matchmaker first you have to listen to a 45 minute seminar on the flattered latest false flags come on man if we had a sitcom no seriously like think about how crazy different we all are if we had a sitcom where there was like all these characters you would want to have the crazy conspiracy guy oh yeah so one of the best jujitsu instructors in the war correct validates it which is wizard you can see guy seems like all about operation Mockingbird and successful so you don't take what he says pretty serious yeah it's also batshit crazy that shit crazy and tell you I'm crazy no I'm crazy so you can't argue I know it's crazy I'm crazy all I'm saying is look into it fucking mind it's a weird weird group of people this is the best dynamic oh man we haven't done a fighting painting in a while I know we need to do a good one with our big giant ass screen we did one with the big giant a screen right just you me and Eddie though what um what fights are coming up that we might there's one if the New Year's show me what we got here young Jamie we have there's one right after that that's what cups wants in and Ortega Brian TCC template t
