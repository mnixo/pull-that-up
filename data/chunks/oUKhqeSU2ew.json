you know we we found this out with c2o the company those guys came to to visit us at Bram or at The Improv and they said the Thai coconuts or what you want it's like a short treat it's only like a 5 foot tree or something like that and it's not like like what we think of these giant palm trees with coconuts it's not like that there it's a shorter tree and it's like a sweeter coconut with all those cans go fucking sour anyway they all go south they all go fucking salad Zima co2 I got them at the house so time to blow that smoke up somebody else's ass that's why I finally tapped out and I got a little Mexican on violin and fuck that right - yeah they get $4 it gives me the whole fucking coconut right there for next to three if you do blood I'll trim it around like a margarita with stop

delicious fresh it tastes so much better they taste so much better when it's like right fresh and raw and open up with some ice cubes and shake it up sometimes if it's warm up well trust me I was thinking coconut water when you in Columbus for me drinking coca-cola out of a red can't suck that I was going to Bordeaux Rico in the fucking 70s when you could buy the big fucking coconuts there was no tie around and 97 there was no typhoon there was no ties around so knock it off with the tight race when is it sighs get here and fucking like 78 after kick box and after kick box or one that's when they fucking showed up I got to this country was Chinese affordable fucking Japs and a couple fucking Koreans no start that shit the tie came later later on all barking shit creepy-looking whatever the fuck I don't know fucking dark skinny I don't know what the fuck they are a Puerto Rican when the tides came along the whole porno industry got tossed on its head fuck before the ties came around but they're not even ties but there's some sort of an Asian invasion that happened because before that there was like river it was very rarely see asian porn stars that is like a Ganga mum and I loved it oh really like dirtiest ones ever yeah would you have that one on your podcast and one of them one of the podcasts was is a naughty show it's an awesome beautiful to look at the one

I'm doing that Dave Attell show today Dame's old porn I'm doing that right after I get out of here will you sit down like Mystery Science Theater style in front of an old porno film and you like mock it and make fun of it you know pick it apart but those old show it they were it's completely different you watch like an old porn it was just people that got together and then they had sex you know it was like it seems so innocent and get down to basics you've been a fucking horny cops up all your life when was the last time you watched what was the first time you watch porn I want you to explain the people and how did you watch it first time you discovered porn break it down for me right now the first time I discovered video porn like a real porn like on cassette it was my dad okay yeah VHS oh yeah well let me tell you how long I thought this government will he used to come to your house reel-to-reel oh my god so for 895 have you ordered it I knew somebody had to stay home from its plane reel to reel to reel to reel was you actually if you ordered $22 worth the point each porn reel was a dollar ninety-nine cents and this was when porn was just disgusting when it was just to the point where after that either you became a freak or you fucking said I don't want to see that again so what happened was for $19 not even guys I'm exaggerating but 12.95 you got cream and a mini projector Brian in the mail projector in the mail I remember this so you had a fucking stay home who's right next to the ad for do you get some kick sand in your face do you remember that ad when they kick saying yeah yeah you went home you said Joe we did three dollars and we sent you the whole muscle building shot yeah not the weights but he also sent you a trophy those trophies ahead don't push up I just kept ordering Joe Weider so you had a fucking put the reel-to-reel correct Brian yeah tape it to the thing like you were the fucking you had to do everything in those days you were the other you had you had a splice sir you had it likewise you had this member though yeah it was fucked it you had to put a sheet on your wall and hope that nobody came home until you got the sheet off the fucking wall for me like my buddies brought it over we put the sheet in the attic and we all got together we smoked like a joint between seven of us and we were all excited to see this porn awesome and it starts like ten nine eight and they showed this chick taking a piece of bread putting the guy's cock and this was way before I don't know what the fuck they were doing to make these chicks do this shit the seventies it wasn't heroin cuz he was awake she put the piece of bread the guy's dick on the piece of bread put Miracle Whip yeah I'll never forget that memory and it wasn't even Wonder Bread is that square fucking bread they gave me like in county jail and the bitch bullet and she bit into the gun me and my five little six great friends looked at each other and that was the end of the fucking I don't know if we came with our pants no we were just mortified we never watched another porno again that was the end for me but when the film broke everybody want to stop correct Ryan yeah you had a stop-work whacking off and put the film back yeah and it sucked because it wasn't like it you just like put the two pieces together you had to first like trim and cut like a perfect leg cut then you had to put it in the splicer and get us live in here you got a boner and you're sitting there rubbing it oh you have a fucking fight it was horrible porn was tough people work for it that's why you had a war she remember then when they would have stag films that they would show at bachelor parties bachelor parties do it sho stag films like guys would get together listen they would show films of people fuckin and they would call them stag films I was just porn was before there's nothing there but that's what they called it they called them stag films and they would they would show them at stag parties Wow yeah how gross of that I could never even then I went to a theater in Jersey like one day my friends like Sunday nights to do this shit up in Jersey dirty movies and you sit in the theater and watch it with other people that is some guy that's the lowest point but it's not even low cuz you don't know you're 16 you finger let's go have a few beers it's not gross to you go to the bathroom oh I'm gonna piss in the urinal some guy just happens to pop I don't stall number two he just stands next to you like he's looking for flowers Oh God you fucking shake your dick he's staring at your dick Oh go back to your seat you see you could tell your friends well I went to the bathroom there's some pervert in there you go back to the bathroom now later you take it that guy again boom stall number two and it's the next to you look I mean it would be so fucking creepy the whole life stop that's there's a lot of dudes that are just in it what is it about sexuality that's so creepy is it because it's so repressed but what is it about like that one desire that's so it's it's it's so like gross it's you know it's so undesirable like the idea sexuality like the idea of you sitting in a row like that's a part of sexuality you sitting in a room like beating off two videos of people fucking like a bunch of other people in the room too and you're like like looking up all together like what the fuck why is that so creepy I don't know but it is you know everyone was in there eating fulfilling that desire there's no issue there's nothing creepy about it to be in a room with a bunch of people everybody's eating a sandwich and there's no problems you know we're all feeling that desire no issues I'll go back though but you go to but a sexuality issue you know like it's very private and very creepy and even though everybody does it it's kind of mysterious so they like to sit in some room full of watch people and everyone's just openly like sort of admitting that we beat off and I'll sit in there together oh when they go to the theaters they not not like just watching the film and critiquing it Wow her ass is huge that's how pee-wee Herman got arrested remember which is hilarious man how the fuck do you get arrested for beating off at one of those fuck theaters that what you're supposed to do aren't you supposed to beat off there no I don't think you're supposed to be it off I think you have like private I mean private rooms like a whack off rooms like and it's not doors are different the whole thing is ridiculous you know what's going on what you're showing people blowing people and you're you're getting upset cuz some of the beats off the crowd look at your product that Club where people went and paid money I was retreat Devil's retreat somethings retreat Plato's retreat Plato's retreat what was that it was a sex club in the seventies and early eighties will you paid you know a thousand bucks the door you wanted then you fucked a eighty-five thousand fucking people Plato's retreat thinking you know the thing that you always got me about sex that you know I've been addicted to drugs so I understand the addiction is when I would get off the bus on 48th Street and it's you know 7:45 to go to work selling cars and I would come home roll the joint I would smoke it right down 42nd Street I would just sit there and watch that guys like you and I but guys that had families guys with suits on that's I that before they have to go on with their day they would have to go into a peep show oh and you know who I would see a lot of it about him to insult anybody I'd see a lot of Hasidic Jews really a lot of her seeds would fucking run in there with that black on in their hats where the Laugh Factory is telling where the Laugh Factory was in Manhattan that was originally a strip club on that whole corner that was strip club fucking world not even strip club beep shows when people fucking hysterical and all that stuff but I mean I would sit outside of that you know because you have to cross that Street that would just sit there and watch people and go what would make somebody jump out of a trailer that was that you could see them like I used to leave the store to have to go get a half grab a club called there's nothing else on your mind but that Coke I would see them walking off walking outside eighth Avenue fucking walking left and you could see their body language they weren't gonna stop till they got to a fuck show to see some guy fuck a big black chick in the middle of the room and you know some chick comes up to you with a tit you could suck it that has a family listen to suburbs you know from Jersey or Queens or that's what always fucked me up like that's their fucking freak right that's their freak my freak was doing two bumps I'm walking off the wall in the morning Dez was going right off the bus at 6:00 in the fucking morning to see two people fucking I remember first time I ever bought porn you had to go to an adult bookstore if you wanted to buy videos cuz like you could go to some some video stores like Blockbuster wouldn't carry them but some like mom-and-pop video stores and then you know of course you'd have to go through like saloon doors you didn't have to family or you go through like beads but I had one time I went to an actual porn store to buy it and I remember thinking like really clearly thinking like don't fucking look at anybody just get through this go go find what you need and get the fuck out of here we're not here for small talk like I'm not one of these people I just need some I don't want to be like and then I started thinking about them like who are one of these people like you think about people that visit porn shops you look you know I don't wanna hang out with any of those people people that go to visit porn shops but wait a minute but I visited a porn shop like who why is it so creepy but I don't know but the instinct like automatically is that it is you know taking care of your sexuality especially yourself it seems like such a selfish creepy rat-like thing to do just sitting there watching videos yeah oh no drama no drama no drama you're wack alone maybe some people a dissolution from the world maybe they just want to tap out for a while yeah hold putting the wig on and jerking off is fucking what they're into you know that's the beauty of not what we do that everybody's into something fucking different I understand somebody mowing tour to a point store every day because I go to the weed store everything so what's the fucking difference coral in correlation of my well the point thing to me the point thing to me is fascinating because like porn girls like there's like a huge number a huge percentage of them who have had bad things happen to them when they're kids you know a lot of traumatic like sexual type shit and it's not all of them but it's a lot of them and so you get a look at ago this is crazy like this is a whole industry that was created and in many ways because of abuse and then that industry is is something that feeds you know through these online videos all these millions and billions of people but we're all supposed to like feel bad about it it's all it's a weird sort of undercover creepy thing you know you couldn't go into business meetings and talk about your favorite porn sites you know you can't just go there like what are you guys doing you're still going you porn you fucking noobs you know hey come on you gotta check out you know XYZ up your ass videos calm or you know all Asians or whatever the fuck website it is there's like a hundred thousand like free porn websites online but you can't talk about him mmm everybody goes to work and there's gonna have you brought it up you could get in in trouble like if you shared that information with someone that you work with you know if like going what sites to go to oh you know mostly like fashion and baby sites and what's what sites you go to have you been taking have you been to II fucked I think it's called what it's e F use you see you Katie yeah it's it's just like fucked up porn videos you know it's kind of like old-style project but like kind of that kind of feel but like you know the first one is this girl who's 18 has a whole hand in her vagina and getting fucked in the ass at the same time oh my god and it's if you just look at the front page at all the crazy videos but anyways that's my new favorite porn shit it's just about the abuse porn is very strange and I was saying about watching like porn from like the 70s and the 80s they just had sex that's all they did I mean they got together and then they had sex like porn of today it's like there's some really nutty things they're doing man you know there's a lot like choking and gagging and you know it's fucking spitting on each other spitting in mouths and stuff when we were in Ohio me and Joe Diaz we're in Ohio I was over at my friend Shane's house because he had a baby and Shane was showing me like he got the Playboy of the month and year that he was born like that the issue which was like in 1974 and there was this person on there that the the centerfold was the most beautiful woman ever and I'm like obsessed with her now her name is a Marilyn Lang it's ma r i l YN lang la and GE what are you doing you stalker no no no no no yeah right but but she it was before you know implants like it was so weird seeing seeing like Playboy that was always used to be all natural women curves and boobs and stuff become like all bleached blond early eighties right big boobs was the early 80s late 70s I don't know if you really look at a playboy from 1969 you go wow even the fucking nipples go around there they will point here you know it's really weird what a woman look like we've had this discussion before about the women of the 70s you know Natalie Wood the crazy one that Steve McQueen was married to Hal him aggression call it crazy it was enough for the smack that that down the fuck will be said but it's just you see those women you see the women down it's I don't know I don't know if there's a difference I don't know well I think it's more exercise today and plastic surgery for sure no plastic surgery it's weird we're like unnatural looking tits are normal it's really amenable but she busted the scene she really Pamela Anderson really and everybody in this room says yeah she's gross but at one time you did look at this bitch and say she's hot damn she's hot as fuck in that picture no yeah she's hot as fuck but it is weird that we're looking at those aren't really her tits what those are water bags under the skin there's a big surgical incision they stuff water bags under her skin and it stretches it out to make like the nipples extend further and make the whole thing unnaturally tight and you know and swollen it's really kind of fucking crazy but you could tell humans let's see you could tell she's got good oh for sure but not with Siobhan puss how weird is it faked it's the weirdest fuck man it's a crazy thing I think that's a fake nipple our button no that's a button silly-billy that's this place - perfect oh you shut your piehole yeah she probably you know when it comes to porn I don't really when I worked in Captain video I worked for the video store in Aspen Colorado for a while and they used to have like porn in those days those sections had 12 boxes I'm saying like a video store had 26 releases one of those releases were the wind sisters and I brought him home and get coked up with my girlfriend sister Amber Lynn and Georgia Little Italy Oh ginger and ginger Lynn and then the other one was when that girl was busted on the scene the one that was 14 and they'll ever find that she was 13 like I seen her movies which are you talking about Traci Traci Lords yeah when she was 14 well there's one video that you get I think where she's 18 well she did one called Traci does Japan Traci does Tokyo dub why would he look I don't forget shit like that you know I got to find out about this she was originally tentacles yeah she was the thing so because they were all trying to live up to the Led Zeppelin thing but Seattle they shoved a shark up some chicks pussy in Seattle during an orgy dawg I will baby Sharky as that ball was the real deal though chick wanted a freakin lay so let's freak motherfucker it's in a couple books but Tracy did Tokyo there's an intro online you have to get it you get the original fucking cut the whole thing but Tracy does Tokyo was what she went on that was the last one anything about octopus upper girls it's not gonna tell you she gets in this toilet and she puts it up her Wiggles and I remember sitting in that room because I used to you know in those days you always had a movie on in the video store I was so crazy I put a fucking porno and when people would come in with kids I turn it the fuck off you know I was living in another fucking dimension then so I would've been putting an island gonna look at this guy's and I thought it was disgusting you know I wasn't into that much all that crazy this dog my experience is boogie lights this movie's online it's like the parts of it that aren't aren't sex or online yeah Doug this is a wild fucking movie you know I ain't gonna drop bullshit now when have I come here and drop fucked-up knowledge I don't know much about war but I know that Tracy Louis Traci Lords was like 60 60 look at those pictures she's doing just hard hard fucking core hardcore dog I got an idea let's buy the movie and I'll masturbate in front of each other to it on the podcast isn't it crazy that you can say that there's something wrong but what she did there's something wrong it's crazy I mean she obviously knew how to fuck she obviously looked like she should be getting fucked right all the above all the pieces were in place would you think would you think numbers are get fucked though I mean if she was just a fucking garage homages you probably wouldn't think that I don't know I think you know she obviously wears a lot of makeup in our video right that was if you saw her when she was you know wouldn't no makeup at 16 dressed like a 16 you know you probably go that's like a young kid yeah but like that little ramsey it's a weird thing where it's like what what is the right year like and no one agrees like some countries it's like 16 some parts of the world it's 13 some parts of this country i think it might be like really young you know like whatever the age of consent is I think most of them are leaning towards at least 17 what do you think as a parent and as when you had sex at your age how old were you were the first fucking pussy see were you ready were you really fucking ready I'm coming to you meant the man were you ready yeah I was okay I mean I handled it it wasn't that big a deal but I think for kids you know for kids fucking around with kids this is a different age you know like you could say the age of consent is 18 and if the age of consent is 18 that's that you know that makes sense to me because I mean 17 year-olds can still make out with each other you know like this should be like an age buffer we're like an 18 year old boyfriend who's been with a girl since you know they were 16 and 14 should still be allowed to bang her like once he turns 19 like they've been boyfriend/girlfriend for three years you know I'm saying like why can't they bang anymore just because he hit some magic number and she hasn't hit it yet that doesn't make any sense to me and there is a lot of that it's a lot of banging at 14-14 banging a 15-9 a little bit of 14 I said some titties you know were you ready for out of hand job were you fucking ready there was that you know the girl I was doing all that shit was kind of her Facebook she wasn't ready to see my Cuban I grow a fucking 14 you know I mean and then then you have to refer to yourself as a parent what age do I think my son or my daughter is ready to fuck around the real question is what age can a man fuck your daughter that's the real question that's the real question because it's not can a 16 year old boy fuck a 16 year old girl yeah of course they can can a 17 year old boy fucking 16 year old girl I guess so can an 18 year old boy fuck a 16 year old girl yeah if she's mature get a 19 year old guy fuck a 16 year old girl no can a 20 you know what I'm saying like he gets it starts getting exponentially Korean here's the judge of that like somebody in Kentucky probably thinks it's completely better like it's seven and forty yeah yeah there should be you know some sort of a standard but I mean at a certain point in time they're just gonna let it go what are you ready you know looking for your kids around you you know whenever I meet people they have kids I always ask the parents how old are the kids when they say to me he's 14 I go to I look at that person I don't look at that kid at that age I was already doing a thousand things what a shame yes I wasn't ready for that well yeah but you had a wild life doesn't matter that was positive 14 you should not be hanging out with guys robbing a tree you know yes the cycle true you should not be doing a lot of things at 14 yeah and I stopped and thinking about some shit that I didn't have some only abso-fucking-lutely have 15 I shouldn't have found somebody on the floor dead I should have done a lot here I'm saying I handled a lot of today Joe look at these kids like that's 15 Wow at that age that already mug somebody a role the drunk I did something you know saying something to look over and your fuck either I like this or I don't you know a shark like chase blood do you think he likes though he doesn't I remember hanging out on a street at night that's like a 13 13 year old bike no I remember like we just be out on the street on the summer we would be playing in the street it'd be like a midnight or something you know we just be out yeah no one does not know we can't you can't do that no that would be over we would just say like hey I might spend a night in town in my frame and say yeah we're gonna spend the night together for the parents don't want to fuck and talk they're like cool babysitter for the night we get the flood count them on the couch you know these guys around the woods mosquito bites on your dick right remember mosquitoes man yeah we don't get that in LA people don't realize how fucking kunti mosquitoes can be when you go out into the woods and they just swarm on your ass I got bit in the face when I was in Ohio from yeah and off don't work no more we talked about this off that shit they power through those mosquitoes they drink that shit from mouthwash you got ahold of some Monsanto corn barber pumped up dude my dad was telling me about this bug that came from Japan and that's then hit I think Canada and then went to Michigan and now it's coming down to Ohio and it's going what it's doing is is it's well it's nice it's like for bad for us but it goes into these trees I forget the name of the tree I like that it's attacking and it drills holes in it and lays eggs in it and then when all the babies come out they just pretty much destroy everything so it's killing this whole breeding tree bark beetle no it's something something I've never heard of in and it's just destroying all that my dad has had these trees for thirty years in his backyard he's humongous trees they're all dead he's like dude they're all the trees in the neighborhood are dead like like it's just attacking Ohio right now and when it was in Michigan before how do they stop it think they can't leave they can pretreat a tree like you could have these people come out to your tree tree and put those like shit in it and they drill these holes in the tree and put like this chemical in the tree that supposedly helps it but it's it didn't work my dad liked all that he had it retreat all those trees treated Wow and it's just destroy all these turkeys that's insane yeah that's fucked man yeah isn't it weird how like we did now because of all the cross-pollination with ships and planes and we can introduce shit to a place where there's no natural predators right and that the whole system just gets completely fucked I was on the the nada not even the highway it was on like regular streets last night at about 10 o'clock and as I'm driving down the street I saw this fucking coyote standing in the road staring at me and then he trots over to the sidewalk and then I slowed down and I look at him and he's staring at me he looks left it looks light and any ruts that runs up into someone's driveway and I'm looking at that kind of like that mother if that's reality yeah that's nature that's something that doesn't no traffic lights doesn't give a fuck about your laws doesn't give a fuck about you know oh that's your kid oh I won't fuck with your kid you know that's a crazy little monster we run around eating cats eating rabbits killing things all around people's homes and that's that's that's reality that thing's gonna be here long after these buildings away and nuclear waste makes people evacuate you know everything west of Pasadena you know I mean once that actually happens with things like that actually happened there's a gang of coyotes take over there's a gang of coyotes that live in Burbank and I have this thing where I feel weird with coyotes because I don't feel like they're gonna attack me at all even though they might sometime but I always roll down the window and fuck with coyotes I got whistle a but I hate you you know like I got do you play with the keys you think you like dogs but you see a picture of a coyote with their mouths open yeah it's scary it's fucking nuts man they look like cartoon mouse like their mouths have so like take it pull up a picture one coyote mouth open big teeth something Google asshole butthole asshole what ever you want to put in the the extra like extra teeth that they have are really fucking oh Jesus we could always fucking teeth look at that look at his fucking teeth that's so scary that's really fucked up when you think about that young girl that got killed by coyotes it's so rare that that happens yeah but it can have little kids get bitten by them all the time but usually little kids are near their parents so usually what happens is like the dad comes over a pizza fuck out of the coyote and a coyote let's go like it's happened a few times in a recent memory but fucking this chick was just walking through the woods and a whole gang of them circled her I just said we could take her I just jacked her killed by coyotes whoo that's gruesome yeah the gang in my neighborhood just hangs out around my fence like all that my dog will come out and go to the bathroom you could just hear like like it my dogs start barking and then you see all these feet scattering around my fence like oh these coyotes are gonna try to attack my my dog if - yeah dude knowing that coyotes can attack people like that I say we kill all them people because your friends do you know they killed a mountain lion in Santa Monica do you know about that yeah I heard about that we going Joe Diaz is coyote coulda eaten like can you eat a coyote cuz what if we can make it some kind of coyote burger I bet you could eat it if you had to eat I bet it would taste like shit I bet it would taste like hatred yeah a big coyote meat just tastes like rotten hatred fucking animals coyotes are so they killed this mountain lion in Santa Monica and out in like where everybody is the Santa Monica populated area and wasn't a homeless person no it's a fucking mountain lion it was a real mountain lion not a cougar not a crazy old bitch and when when they killed it there was all these Facebook posts and one of them was my favorite it was so awesome there's this woman and she said why are we it's only because of our ego that we think we are better than animals you know animals have a soul and she like you know soul in all caps I would gladly take a bullet for an animal or a dog or a cat or a bear or a deer before I would for a person exclamation point exclamation point I mean I was I was looking at this like this is amazing like this is a this is a person that's actually saying you shouldn't kill that monster that's roaming through the neighborhood the 150 pound cap now you shouldn't kill that unpredictable Beast and if you wanted to do that I would gladly take that bullet I would sacrifice my life for this monster you sacrifice your life for one of the most horrific creations of nature a big cat a mean thoughtless killing machine that you can't even roll a basketball in front of one of those things they fucking dive on and bite it that's their instinct yeah but they could have also done that as a weapon just like hey get away from your cat here to chase this ball there's money noise technology they could pull another bullet to put him to sleep and take him to a zoo yeah I figure out what's going on yeah yeah I do I do think that tell everything I understand of something made that bear come down that better little fuck with nobody we don't want to fuck with him right so we didn't building somewhere they shouldn't be fucked that building or there's no food for the fucking bed it's most likely no it's out there and it's also the problem with bears and people is that once they find out that they can go to garbage cans and get food that's it then they have to take them and put them in zoos and shit they become promises I understand you have to protect the community we can't have a bear or a fucking mountain lion does anybody know what a mountain lion or duty he'll be in and how fast but at the same time let's see if we could fucking mummify him first take him to a museum you had someone you live we have darts and lasers with lasers lasers and darts I think running on the 101 backwards they get shot darling what the fuck you got these darts for you got darts offices darling Laser room you talk about him you saw him in a Chuck Norris movie now you're on the 101 you don't want a dark nobody you follow me we're a little bit too a little bit taser in people's dangerous well a little bit we're a little bit too quick to pull a fucking trigger I love the I love the fucking you know bearing arms and everything but it's a bear anybody who knows hunting or whatever just sit still for two minutes no get the fuck out of it get

careful things gotta be real careful but I seen a lot I used to see schools or raccoons schools of them crossing the street from the big ones or a little tiny one at the end I know those motherfuckers are dangerous but you can't hit him with a car let them beat I wish I saved a picture there's a picture that I saw once I don't remember if it was online or in a book or a magazine I wish I saved this picture because I haven't been able to find it and all my google searches but it was a guy was a photographer it was killed by a bear and he was taking pictures of a female and her Cubs and the last image on his camera before he is killed by the bear is the bear with its teeth glared charging them and it's a fucking horror if ik picture they found him they found it on the dudes camera but there is never looking at of course yeah Munya business when they shot Jim Jones and the cameraman went down remember the camera kept running as there was shooting everybody as if we got on the plane from Guyana that was live footage dad on television what the fuck were you doing in Guyana you should have been taking pictures in San Francisco where you live that Jim Jones story that shit Airport was the dude's name who did who played him in the movie powers Boothe who powers Alex Alex sad motherfuck only use them for certain thing oh my god he comes out and when you need a heavy Southern gentleman throwing Heat heito his boots a bad motherfucker look at the screen here is this that for some reason the image isn't showing up but it says images captures at bears seconds before it small do its photo it's balls well I think you're thinking of a different picture though they do the one they read they're thinking of one where it's a bear comes into a guy's tent I think that's a different image okay what's up Joe baby see everything see we could find it you're very excited but there isn't one fake one though a fake one or they showed a photo with you this is a great fucking card it's gonna be sick just some great cards coming up the next few fucking weeks yeah Junior dos Santos and Frank Mir Asami nuts I was gonna ask you to remember this salvia guy that that was the the crazy MMA guy that was always talking about not salvia but stevia oh I know that whole story yeah well yeah don't give them any attention yeah that's a fuck something's wrong so what do you think about this car baby let's break it down I'm very excited for you sorry I can't go yeah we should go be fun I don't want watch one with you guys we got to go to a strike force call ranked fourth next time is a big strike force fine did you see the last one did you see Josh Barnett and what a fight both guys broke their hands in the first round - I had called me it looked very good it's a beast he's a fucking phony sticks he was like a launch Josh Barnett into the air - Josh Brener is a big boy he's a big Daniel Cormier hoisted him up and threw him for a ride controlled them on top smashed him cut him up with elbows he's a and he's only had like I think that was his fifth ever fight it's amazing ten you call me a baby-faced assassin he's been around forever he was one of the youngest UFC champs he won I don't know how old he was when he won the title but I remember he beat Randy Couture and then there was some sort of a dispute with the UFC you know management and UFC didn't get along he left and then he started fighting overseas and he fought in Pride and you know and then he came back and and became part of the Strikeforce tournament you know he's been around forever he's that guys fought everybody he's fought Minotauro he's fought cro cop twice you know he's fought a lot of fucking dudes I just thought his experience was really shine through both motherfucker man well you know though Josh Barnett broke his hand in the first round and so did Cormier they both broke their hand in the first round so uh you know who knows how a rematch would go but Cormier won that fight with his wrestling he won that fight with his striking I mean he's just a motherfucker dude and he's not been doing it that long he's badass man I'm a really pretty head kick Josh Barnett twice that's right and Josh Brown I couldn't take him down no one's to be able to take him down in a UFC match I mean he's such a high-level wrestler that it's gonna take a fucking beast to take that guy down you know so you got to stand with him and he's really quick man and he's not a tall guy but he's like compact and explosive you know and that all the years of wrestling the high-level wrestling I think the mental toughness that those guys gained from high school yeah there's amateur wrestling's and there's a different animals man those are different animals there those guys are tough on a whole different level they're like in my opinion that maybe the all like in camp you know you tell you look at the just a percentage that might be the toughest group of human beings on earth just the toughest mentally toughest is amateur wrestlers it really might be their fucking animals man those guys shit those guys go through and they do it dehydrated and malnourished and they're out there like fucking animals you know what's crazy you went to the UFC in Jersey and here's all these MMA fighters of the audience attendance but everybody kept looking at that Penn State fucking wrestling team and everybody kept looking at that coach what people went up to shape that motherfuckers hand I heard more people go smartass what's his name you think you go to Penn State that's the best wrestle in the world yeah oh okay else Anderson Hale Sanderson was at the fight right the row behind ya and he's wrestling again no yeah I think I don't know if it's the same guy we're thinking about who they say is the best white wrestler in the world yeah it's an amazing not a fucking guy even not something that you're like oh I'm not gonna mess with him very he was sitting behind us with the team and everybody who walked by had a say oh my god there's chance and the center of chaos and said oh my god like everybody was fuckin like an all this guy and that was a wee crew the guy out there the guy that was with him said to me Joey karate we got your back that's when it all went down cuz the guy was yelling but everybody was looking at that guy like he was a fucking killer that day and I mean from fitch to guida everybody was dead standing there you know so yeah he's the coach of Penn State yeah yeah yeah that's Cael Sanderson Cael Sanderson yeah he's a beast it's crazy his his the the the people that uh he was wrestling with like teaching in college they're the ones who encouraged him to compete again he still physically got it he just stopped competing I just think like at that higher level like when you're at that high level in any sport whether it's wrestling or anything you know boxing when you get to that level it's so hard to maintain that kind of pace it's so hard to just live your life like that where you're constantly competing you know when I was a kid I seen a high school wrestler by the way you were fucking voices just creeping me out what uh was that you or him when I was a kid I seen one of the best fights ever seen school decorated wrestler fight this kid that was a scrappy fighter Baloo and dog two minutes in he got his hooks in this motherfucker it was in front of a VFW you know how they always have an American flag with the pole and the little fence he picked him up and threw him over the fucking fence dog oh the striker didn't know he just went along his head just like what am I gonna do I'm not gonna get back up and fight this fucking monster just pick and that's when I was like wrestlers got something they got that core strength they've been working on since they were young and some of these guys with the banty is this shit ain't got no time to fuck around man it'll take you the fuck down but it has made a difference in my Mane that I've seen I don't know much about it I you know I watched a little bit of pride but in the UFC you've seen these wrestlers it makes a big impact judo guys and wrestlers that's those are the two toughest to deal with but the thing about you know and both of them you know especially when it comes to international competition they both have to deal with some pretty fucking stiff and crazy competition you know the judo in internationally especially it's you know really popular it's a really popular sport in a lot of different countries but wrestling there's something about wrestlers man that what they have to go through their mind becomes capable of pulling shit off that other where other people wouldn't push hard enough they would they would just they would back off before the the wrestler does you know these guys redlining man they know how to read line their brain their body you know some of the most savage fighters of all time Dan Henderson Randy Couture you know go through the lineup all the DES Matt Hughes think about all the different guys that started off Koscheck to all the different cars off Hendricks yeah we shot Rashad yeah the last of John Fitch was a caliper do the list is and it takes a while for their hands to catch up with everything else but some guys picking around Griffin what's the name for a fabulous Phil someone who just fought Rashad before I'll Phil Dave Phil Davis I'm sorry yeah fabulous whatever they call mr. wonderful mr. wonderful it's just and you know a lot of even Eddie always said that you better get ready for these wrestlers and learn how to fight off your back as these wrestlers gonna fucking take you down you know so there's so many guys that become successful have you started this Japanese cultural center and with no and as close to Eddie's it's a couple blocks from the old legends to one on Vermont well that just smooth the culture of song it's like we're the Japanese go to practice judo in town and it's real dirt cheap it's hardwood floors it's all old school some people go sign up one time and get the fuck out of that cuz it's very traditional and I didn't really do two classes a week but it's going on down there yeah all these other things like Aikido and LaBrea with the swords of shit they're gone I'm talking about down island they've been there since nineteen forty something is there son that key to school and in Hollywood no they moved to Burbank and then they moved in and I drive-by on Magnolia I seen everything is in Burbank any style that you want isn't Burbank martial arts I went to see Eddie's I went to Burbank last night yeah I gotta go out so I swung by Eddie's I counted six fucking karate schools kickboxing the kickball who's there the guy that that wheel fabulous Benny Benny the jet has in school I mean Burbank had nabbed the martial arts Hall of Fame been the Jetson Burbank now better than just some bourbon whip they got a new King King box of school they got to Gracie Bowers yeah when I used to wax it go when I first moved here man I used to go to his place in Van Nuys he would have all these gangbangers that they would give free classes to and let him work out and you know you'd be like taking kickboxing classes but this fucking gangbangers man is there was it was some parts of it they were kind of creepy and a lot of people were complaining about it because it was like a few problems but I remember this one dude came in and he had a a tattoo on his back that looked like you drew it you know and it said whatever that it was like vatos or something like that fuck the rest and he had it tattooed on his back Wow I mean it was look look like you did it like anybody did like I gave you a tattoo gun for the first time and say oh just see what you could do and I was thinking like this is not a guy you want to punch in the face this is not a guy who has a lot to lose like you know this is a Mike I might want to just keep my hands up and stick a move I was just getting a car and get the fuck yeah well there's involved there was a he had there was you know Benny the jet and he think he had family members that would also teach there to I forget I forget the whole history of it so I don't want to talk about it but they had a lot of there was a lot a lot of gangbangers go there it was a big culture shock thing coming from coming from New York and then moving here and then taking kickboxing with checkers remember that remember that bug we were talking about earlier that is coming all this trees it's called an emerald ash borer and look at that it looks like a cricket at a disco I mean it's scary looking looks high-tech looks like a robot cricket yeah it's like a Nissan GTR bug and that thing does that's the thing that just goes into trees and fucking lays a bunch of eggs and trees that destroys it the trees and then those things hatch and become more of these it's like a fucking an army of tree killers that's so fucking nutty man yeah it's so weird what do we have to do bring over like Komodo dragons eat doesn't it look like alien come on this has been going on for years we started with termites what do you expect everyone from here fuck I'm just saying this started years ago with termites they eat trees they eat the roof yeah I know do you but it is new invasive species and please bring him weeding through cut with my amulet that was troubling in those fucking bags it was just weed lice and fucking bugs and palmetto bugs it's man where's couple of those fucking shipments yeah you know big nine-foot fucking Cobra got in from some fucking Colombian jungle you think this then they got Dixon they look for ease and they are always fucking creatures 2013 Nvidia have a loose fucking creature the scary animal smoke my little vapor so get the fire I was smoking this shit on the plane oh it's dripping you know what's so funny he was smoking on the plane next to an old lady and I did we talked about this yesterday and whoo and I'm like wow that's crazy I guess you know I guess you can do probably do it's not against the law to do those things you know vapor if it was like an electronic cigarette yeah I guess but then then he did it in a car when we were driving to a Pittsburgh and he just starts hitting it and all the windows are up and immediately I smelled weed and I'm like if you everybody smelled it does smell like weed the thing about pot smoke man that when you're smoking it doesn't smell like anything it's the weirdest thing no it's a cigarette well you yeah I bet it is so you don't smell the smoke on your own body well that's a weird thing that they say about smells that all factory senses they only detect changes so you can get used to a stinky town that's how people live if they live like some places like remiel or something like that yeah yeah that could do it or I think slaughterhouses that's a real problem I'll poop yeah cow yeah if you pass like pastures and cows are shitting all over the place and just stinks horribly fucked up they shit so much just shit everywhere oh yeah drive by it's just shit you're smelling shit yeah I go to my mom's house oh I like a good half mile where the whole like air is just shit smell it smells like a thousand poops and that's nature telling you that this is dirty you don't want to eat anything anywhere near this that's like a big warning sign that's why shit smells terrible right I don't think we should smoke that thing on a plane you know I'm gonna make you promise that you're not gonna do that from now on yeah and you got caught with it at an airport and they did her bank took it out look though they couldn't even figure out those fucking geniuses so let a cop oh when they gave it right back to me and I was puffing all the way to gate number three like a doctor so what did you say it was when they asked you an electric cigarette didn't even ask how's that one asked they just looked at it they wanted to know if it was like some sort of gene Simmons bomb from one of those movies that are alive I am they put the rescue house give me the bonus fuck the bonus and they pull the dailies clink boom I think just a flat seen the movies horrible but that's seeing this fucking class listen how many movies of gene Simmons do I don't know why I know he played that and I see him I'll episode of Miami Vice one time that's it I never seen him but he's probably done a bunch of fucking movies he's not an episode of Miami Vice yeah you play like a drug dealers on Miami Vice changed the fucking game dude started wearing Blazers and no socks they start wearing loafers with no socks why because that's what they want Miami Vice wanted to pee like here in Miami do you start buying white cars fuck bought a white car

like Honda Accords or something at least saw that white Testarossa they were oh shit she was like wheels too you see Will Smith to slap that dude yeah that's crazy and then he like he's like trying to kiss me in the mouth I'm like hey we can all see the video you didn't try to kiss you in the mouth kiss his face a few times he might have been trying to kiss him you know in the mouth it might have been like some polling or yes you're right you know I don't think about that yeah I don't like that either he barely talks to I mean he just went like this in the guy's face right and everybody's saying that it was like some assault oh my god yeah it's like always that publicity that events was somebody at the longest shark thing so he said something too fucking Burt Reynolds and Burt Reynolds Bush listen he's 66 years old he was just trying to get publicity for the fucking movie he's gonna say probably not even as far as you know the guy came over and said something Burt Reynolds was like did you see the original one god knows no Burt Reynolds Mac really really smell oh that online oh you gotta see Burt Reynolds max guy rattles back to fight the Burt Reynolds is one of those guys where I looked at him and I kind of feel bad you know when I see like his face all stretched out like when I was a kid I looked at Burt right on somebody that guys this shit like I remember like Smokey and abandoned he's always smiling that's what I would always think like this guy looks like he's always having a great day have a good subject marry Loni Anderson that fucker shot him down and left her with pills and he was reeling but Dawg you watched him even as a longer shot to be any other Longest Yard he goes in he beats the bitch beats the bitch watch the movie he gets in the car what fucking

cuts off cops takes it to the ocean and dumps it until the ocean then goes to the bar and they come get him at the bar and they started fucking around he beats the one cop up then they take him to was do shit here's us here's the video I think Reynolds apparently got a little slap happy last night hitting the CBS producer at a movie premiere premiere in Chelsea we're the only ones with the video see this was Michael Pomerance here now with the blow-by-blow Michael Maurice Reynolds attending the premiere of his new film really a remake of his old film The Longest Yard when either ingest or an anger depending on who you believe Reynolds slapped the CBS employee who was asking the star about that movie and today CBS News says it is looking into the matter you judge for yourself [Music] like the guy man I can't know what's up with the audio nobody knows smack like a dude who got smacked on 20/20 by the wrestler oh that was oh yeah it's a punk with that little backhand he gave the dude that wrestler will he fucking smacked what's his name Tom slothful something John's - Thomas - yeah he smacked him that boy got up the grudge's here drum yeah he rut he fucked him up smacked him with a hand bigger than mine that was a smack will submit give him this guy I fucking love that all Will Smith did was gently touch the guy with his fingers on his face anybody who calls what Will Smith did a slap he gently did this to the guy's face it was like so it was so non aggressive yeah this guy's a fucking huge do the standard you know standard question I think it's this fake realize that dude dude cuff that's a guy not getting paid enough to do his job well you know it's also the way he said it was very arrogant like he was gonna be safe I think it's fake no it's not yeah you know saying it's fake duh fucking duh everyone knows it's fake you know it's it it's obviously planned out in advance but to say it's not a tough job you're crazy those guys are always busted up you remember those guys pain stop what dude when they did the expose on wrestling on 20/20 and they showed us all the tricks how they would take the razor blade yeah yeah yeah yeah leave that was a great expose a lot of people that all by yeah imagine they did that they used to cut their own hair and I knew about it because one of the training schools in New Jersey so when I was going to grab a school the teachers kept telling me if you're good guys will tell you the wrestling I know chief Jay Strongbow was all fake as shit well I found that wrestler was faking the for grade I was pissed for about 10 minutes I went to L Tapatio the other day and they had Mexican wrestling on those dudes have some fucking dope moves man about the outfits oh the outfits are outstanding yeah dudes with like long Conan hair no one looks like they've ever even heard of steroids it's so weird because steroids are legal in Mexico and these dudes are like regular looking dudes but they had some crazy moves I was like really impressed like jumping through the air wrapping their legs around the dudes neck and flipping the dude through the air like they did some nutty shit that was like wow that is acrobatic if you can't appreciate that I mean obviously it is theater but there's there's a physicality to it that you you know it's very disrespectful to call it fake you know it's not fake cause in that little attitude he did it yeah yeah yeah it's like he said it to a guy without any fear of his own safety being protected he thought by a camera and reality media wasn't shit yeah the media wasn't what it was today the media was this shit that was just somebody was taking up your fuckin it just didn't have to be kunti about it if he if he communicate with the guy and and asked him are there predetermined outcomes how you know I mean that's what he should have said you know instead of saying like the way you did it yeah well I'll still the standard question is it fake it looks fake to me well you know like wow you're you're D you're like you're pawing at a lion like this is the size of that guy okay you don't feel uncomfortable with that this guy's all sweaty and hyped up from a fucking wrestling match where they always get kneed in the head and fucking kicked in the head accidentally and punched in the head like you see some of this shit they do where they do flight flying side kicks and hit each other in the head they hit each other in the fucking head man there's a lot of times they're actually hitting each other it's not proof even if it's choreographed it's not precise this is fucking ready hard way to make a living what's funny when I went to Miami at the end of April that week was also WrestleMania mm-hmm so all these old-timers in Miami so every radio show I went to do that week I had an old-time wrestler I was talking about and it was very interesting to see that believe it or not these guys still have followings oh I believe it they still have followings they do all those things like they show you the wrestler where they people come and sign t-shirts and talk about 1981 I wonder what Jimmy Superfly Snuka is iced you remember the fucking The Ultimate Warrior used to live in Boulder in his heyday did he was up in Boulder she was fucking him by the end of juice man jams this motherfucker good man I remember one time seeing him at the bottle carwash he had at that time nobody had a seven BMW in the early eighties I don't even think they made them in the atom just because he had hit one and I'll never forget it was offseason or something he got out of that fucking car Joe and he had a vein that was a quart I don't have to lie to nobody go look at fucking the ultimate warrior giant dude dog with his veins his biceps was some of the biggest most that was a bicep but he had a vein out here that lifted 3/4 of an inch from his arm I seen it I looked at it stared at it and like was like let me see how far his vein in his bicep went up 3/4 of an inch off the skin yeah there's a lot of people don't realize how big those that do somebody see if you get an Ultimate Warrior shot for me I saw a Hulk Hogan the first time like when I was in Hollywood it was right outside of before I've met him I met him at the UFC and I had the honor of interviewing him once right I get to talk it was fun cuz I got to like talk like get excited about pro wrestling with him you know and like pump it up he's fucking great man that guy's got a lot of pain now he's got I mean he's gone through you ever see like all the operations holy shit that the Ultimate Warrior that's the old fan how tall is that dude he's like 6-3 or some shit I'll talk don't focus on his dick bro that's all look at his own shirt he's busting through his own shirt but no it's hard crazy though well I don't hurt I don't why does he have a heart hmm I think it's just Europe and he's got a lot of colors you know is this Richard Simmons isn't it crazy that they decide to like paint their face up yeah and the outfit with the suspenders or whatever the fuck there's arms sky was pretty yoked having the barbarian brothers I member seen when I was a kid those two guys they were in the Flamingo kid I don't know what happened to those guys is it face paint like war paint a strange thing the idea that you know you're gonna you know doll your face up to make yourself look meaner when you go to battle like that's gonna matter like the the ritual of rubbing shit on your face and put your war mask on before you go into battle like where that fuckin that ever come from like it doesn't make someone extra scary if they got black stuff all over their face what are you talking about the street like the Indian American Indians and I'm talking about you know different people that have put war paint on whatever thing you want the American Indians symbolizes number Braveheart you put like fuck something but like that if you're in the green beret you gotta go take it right your face green that's you know it's a different thing yeah but it still it must put you there yeah the ritual like you know that it's time to fucking Rock it's time again you know crazy it's gotta get you that's how you probably get fired up by putting the makeup on though were they do you guys remember this so what do you want to do I don't know what do you want to do you boys a bit bored for those that didn't watch this but rather listen to this podcast that might be one of the most retarded thing person big giant roided up dude handed out slim jim is he still alive is that guy still alive that's decade' Roblin like a motherfucker he's still alive before they figured out but yes yeah Wow I wonder what he looks like now Slim Jim huge what a strange ad what is it supposed to be sis snap into a slim jim and why are you so angry sir what's going on here you're fucking going nutty screaming and flexing the kid bites into it he flies out of his shoes like what the fuck kind of physics are we dealing with here what kind of greenlit that commercial I think the Ultimate Warrior has a blog now oh he does yeah how fun would it be justice done shooting steroids in that stop just get crazy go home start a go you know what I'm gonna start fucking eat them and I'm not even doing cycles well I think if you look at those guys who have done that like it is possible stay alive like look at the guys who were like big-time professional bodybuilders they're still like they're still out there they're you know they get off the shit and they their body shrinks down to like normal size oh no what Tom Platts his legs look like today that's when you got a fuck yeah that's what we gotta find that's a good question today I wanna know I mean we all look no it'll look

here to here yeah I'm gonna lay in brick and block all his life he's like I'd get a big blood get the fuck is your whole family tree laid fucking 12 inch block it probably built everything in fucking Italy looking a little floppy was dope he was yoked he was a strong dude isn't it funny that USU you said tom platt and we both know that that guy was associated with having giant legs it's like he's synonymous I remember his incredible though there's no other guy that has like that like they're synonymous was one body giant you know oh Campbell had big legs but Tom Platts had just ripped I'm

years it's amazing that you look go to these cities and you see these people and you said yourself what's next for these people I mean this is the real core it's so funny how I was losing I was hating doing comedy in that way and they're gonna transpire for me to like I was starting to hate to do calm and it was because I was doing too much Konami in lho I wasn't doing comedy for real people I was forgetting what I was doing comedy for when you're in LA a long time like I was and we are we don't travel like your normal headliners they go on every week when I'm in LA you're thinking about shit that you think in LA and you think there's going to be somebody in the audience or who's here with you or what you're saying when you're on the road and you're talking to people in the Midwest or in Texas they're fucking real you gotta bring it a different way I can't bring it like la way I got and that's what I like about going on the road again I really enjoy like people like do you really like going to Midwest no I went there I fucking loved it I love going to Iowa I love going all those spots like that once or twice a year just to remind you that it's not all the big city man we met some cool fucking beat amazing we seen some great property some great trees it's spread out low traffic we got too much weed yeah I had too much weed no it's hard to see these cities like they got nothing

people a bad motherfucker they just got so much I got a lot of good people yeah not on how hyo's always been when I used to worry was worth betting service they were the biggest collection of gamblers right like my back of my mind I'm like all the sharpest guys in New York and Vegas they wipe their ass that holes cut that hole Youngstown where the Hall of Famers all that shit that's big bookmaking hey you know you got I remember one thing you guys the worst the economy gets the more booked Bacon's prostitution gets bigger and keep talking tell me more drug sales go amazing you know that's why the mob and organized crime will never go away they make more money when the economy's bad you know when we had a prohibition them the Great Depression those lobsters were making money selling booze people want to forget about their fucking problems it really is the worst the economy is the more money people have to take a gamble with it it's really weird to say there's more gambling because people are desperate so people like fucking I'll gamble more I'll drink more the only fucking things that do not get affected by the economy is crime think about it what a gambling there's not gonna fact that Vegas is still booming every week we hear how oh my god we went to Vegas and there was nobody there that keep building aren't there they're getting money from somewhere somebody's putting that bets in ain't me and you but somebody's losing yeah they're just banking on the fact that it's gonna bounce back and then they stopped a lot of the building now there is double I stopped a lot of it for a while they just opened a casino in Vegas when we were there I mean in Cleveland while we were there that weekend and that's like another way for them to try to bounce back in that one Eva Longoria opened up like a spot a restaurant didn't she open up like a nightclub or some shit our restaurant it still holds it you know I don't drive by them a base oh no no no no this is in Vegas oh yes she had like a club or something listen bro I never figured out somebody coming to you Joe rollin going I'm gonna open up a club when you're Vegas come hangout will give you a kickback it's part of your club you give whatever percent they want right what's that call will you lend money and there's no guarantee you know you give her a certain amount and the club I mean why much do you make from that to be you have 19 fucking partners that's why I told you I told you specifically and I know you don't like this shit but you really gotta watch the pimp of Joe Namath it's been on again and

with a fireplace that didn't work it was one room and then you open the door there was a little kitchen and the bathroom was there so when I had a fucker the roommate was in the shadow room a phone

type of people you everything around that the code is expensive you know if you live in the Dakotas cuz you fucking beautiful oh it's beautiful don't it's the shit that's the only way to fuck and do it if you're gonna do it it's incredible I'm gonna live a Bronx or Brooklyn or Queens and drive in or take the a train fuck you I'm staying right there to the coda right Central Park isn't it weird if you think about it what what that building is it's like a safe for rich people rich people's like inside that safe you crack that safe open there's a bunch of rich people in there I mean that's what it is and it's right there on the street where all the poor people can drive by and look at all the rich like inside there well all they have to do is say well you know what though you know society is functional and there are police officers so it doesn't it's not feasible that we go in and just take all the stuff out there so we just leave it alone but they know where the stuff is the stuff is all in that room that big box that's a that's a big mousetrap of rich people it's a bank there's like little little pockets in that bank and inside that but you can get money and there's jewelry and there's expensive stuff all throughout that place well you can't get in there now but if the shit hits the fan yeah you can get in there it's one of the first things they're gonna get into you think so fuck yeah fuck yeah when the shit hits the fan why wouldn't you charge the Dakota you know the only thing that fuck you up is bodyguards you know how many dudes are rockin bodyguards probably a lot so you got a bunch of armed killers that are laying wait that's how the roof and all that shit but how long before they quit - and get the fuck out of there after a couple of weeks this place is abandoned what see well what does it cost look that Joe just what's up properly under the cover okay real estate just a mother if it's even for a sale come on I wonder if you even yeah they gotta be facility what are you talking about did you see that some guy in New York is selling this party could be code earlier than what a million a year what a million a year for a parking spot parking spot people think about it Billy well it's well it's there it's close by I don't have to pay for fucking tickets that's hilarious apartments for sale of the Dakota New York City Manhattan condos one of the most famous residence buildings in all of New York is the Dakota it was a bold building when it was first developed built so far north of the pulse the city at the time citizens snickered and nicknamed it the Dakota a reference to the states of North and South Dakota which were very far away from New York City is that funny they nicknamed the Dakota because they thought it was too far away meanwhile this crazy city has built up so much now it's actually in the heart of every single heart of it it's not weird and it's weird that New York City must have been like when a smaller back down I guess obvious yeah it has to been yeah I mean it's a crazy place man every time I go there I fantasize about living there for like short periods of time but I you know I never I don't think I can do it I'd freak out I would have panic attacks it's too much too much you kind of like realize that that is you're getting interaction you're get you're definitely getting something off of those people you know I don't know what it is but I know there's a difference between the way I feel when I'm standing on the mountain and I look out and I see fields and I see like clouds and I see you know birds flying overhead there's a different feeling that when I'm on the 405 when I'm on the 405 there's a hive of humanity and there's some residual effect that you get from all these people there's a different feeling that you get when you're in a city you're there's an awareness of humans collective stress yeah there's something it's like it's pheromonal whatever the fuck it is it's it's in the air man is it's not it's not as simple and as innocuous as if you're not touching me you're not affecting it I think it's we're affected by our environment in some strange way so that's why I don't think I couldn't do in New York City when I was at my mom's house this weekend she lives in the middle of nowhere like just farms like across the street from her is a strawberry field and like it's just in the middle of nowhere and at night when I was sitting in my car waiting to go inside her house I was just like it was so quiet and so like the Stars and oh and it was just it was like this is I would not have any stress if I got to come home to this yeah it's just it's craziness different you you're you close your door you hear cars driving by street now you might hear your neighbor you got wizards wizards are in the neighborhood you realize you know how much unnecessary shit you have to deal with how much unnecessary stuff is inside your head you know what it's all about you know life is supposed to be about enjoyment right supposed to be about having a good time it's not supposed to be about dealing with all this extracurricular nonsense and we shouldn't have to have so many fucking people around us like we shouldn't be living here this is silly why would ever this 20 million people do you see where you find that it's really when you talk to somebody like somebody who lives in New York I'm so I'm trying to figure out a comic who lives in New York that they just fucking love it they couldn't imagine living somewhere else yeah so people love it you know for me oh yeah he loves it who's that Gaffigan he's got kids too he lives there you know some people they find a good place there you know what I saw fucking crazy picture of Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper lives in a firehouse does it really yeah I think Buster's converted firehouse oh yeah how awesome is that yeah well it was a stupid fucking threat on my board where people are talking about Anderson Cooper being gay he's a fucking gay who cares unless you want to fuck I'm always trying to fuck you wait can you imagine bringing a girl home and like like I'll be right down and like coming down like on a fire pole where you know what's a bottle of champagne yeah there's images for it I guess you can you can see the actual place that would be the ultimate podcast studio fucking making it out of a fire station or someone some along those lines yeah you know would be the the ultimate would be that uh that missile silo that drug dealer have a nice documentary remember that yeah he buys a four point three million dollar New York home Anderson Cooper that's bought a firehouse the eight thousand two hundred and forty square foot home while it's a huge place in Manhattan at eighty four West Third Street between Sullivan and Thompson's which he purchased in September both the original spiral staircase brass fire brigade so beautiful it's pretty dope fire stations pretty sweet well the crazy thing is oh yeah what's crazy is it still says fire Patrol on it and it's his house now yeah I mean that's kind of dangerous isn't it like people coming up to the place and be like help my I need to drop off this don't have any babies he gets dropped off what if interested Cooper comes out of his house every morning there's like two babies in four damn it again four point three million dollars a 4.34 a fucking fire truck house see if they left the fucking fire engine that's that's a pussy bang well I think it's asshole Bank or whatever it is they its an asshole magnet it's I think it's kept been converted I mean I think inside it's pretty dope it's um it's more than eight thousand square feet that's a big fucking house in New York City fuck yeah in New York City that's enormous

a garage man how about having a garage in New York City who the fuck has a garage he bought a house with a garage now see I would live in New York City if I could live like that that's that's only one way to live in New York guys and that's with a lot of fucking gita's because you lost a lot of fuckin yeah if you're super rich you could pull off Olivia fuck I take a cab everywhere yeah freshly squeezed bagels or 20 bucks yourself well a lot of guys just have a driver so super rich dudes that have like pent houses there they just have a good driver you know look at the place that's his house yeah whose house anything oh my god that's it I think that were the people that live before or when it was on sale I'm guessing oh my god that is fucking killer man what a killer house I've been there I've been to one incredible house in New York it was a friend of Mines dad had a penthouse place I don't remember what homeboy did but he was very wealthy and we went to the the top of this building and that's where the apartment was and the fucking view was insane it was insane he was just in the middle of all these giant buildings they were all lit up and he had this enormous glass opening like his his his window he was on a corner he had a corner penthouse and it was just it was staggering like you would look out there you just go wow like you kind of get it it's like they get to live like a science-fiction movie like every day they look out their window there on the 90th floor some fucking building or whatever the hell it is you know I don't know what you want the highest building is there now but I mean if you if you're on the 50th 60th floor and you're looking out and seeing all of Manhattan you're like in the heat of it it is kind of crazy science fiction man there is if you were like really into that like man I could see I think the baddest house I've ever seen was a maroon Creek maroon bells in Aspen Colorado we were building a house I was working for an electrician in the guy next door we became friendly with him and he would show us this guy was like um we producer don't ask me who the fuck it was he built the house from scratch but I could tell then he was kind of off the chain like not a junkie or nothing he had man-made hot springs in his yard like you would walk away under this under the moonlight and he had him like 40 yards from his house he got like four different ones it was just amazing the view he had a Colorado looking down from one of the top cliffs up Aroon bells I mean it was fucking it would take your breath away it would really go like you would fucking it would take your breath away that's really weird to see that views are worth of the user work a lot yeah to me these are huge you know some people don't don't don't care then rather just being a nice neighborhood or whatever I need to I like looking out the window and seeing shit when I look out the window and see shit it's inspiring I definitely one of the best parts of Colorado one of the best parts is be able to look out the window and just see the mountains and the trees and you know if you could look over the ocean you see do if your that's like the best view where you got a little bit of mountain a little bit of ocean you can just stand there it's like you're looking at the greatest natural art ever created and one of nature's most beautiful and wondrous accomplishments is the beauty of nature itself looking at mountains looking at the water looking especially it from afar looking at the all of it together like when you're flying into Hawaii and you can't even believe how beautiful it is look at this fucking place look at it it's like it charges you up just with its own natural beauty but even Malibu has natural fall beauty Malibu staggering beauty you know Columbus I seen some shit the trees the way they were cut you ever look at Columbus or Malibu real estate have you ever looked no Christ it just no you go online and like look Google like Malibu real estate and see some of the houses for like sixty million dollars like what where is all this money coming from who are all these people how many rich people are there like Jesus Christ who some people buying up sixty million dollar houses I know we talked about this a long time ago on that podcast but I don't know if we had video back then but like remember Mike Tyson's abandoned mansion Southington Ohio and like people in Ohio would just break into it because he abandoned it and so in there it's like it was still furnished and it was like he just left it it was really creepy like as the water the inside pool had not been treated for a long time and like look at this bathroom it this is like a crazy shower Wow and they had those cages yes they just were his animals on the back and then they had it like his own basketball court King Tyson but that was like Don King got him into all that team Tyson shit and look how nice it is outside in that Ohio can you imagine that that would all be yours it's pretty busy all the way from that yeah he just walked away from home girls guys he walked away fire with him like that I heard this house in Jersey was fuckin that's probably I don't know but like the website that that's from that's called illicit Ohio is one of my favorite websites it's just a banded ship in in Ohio like look this old music school where's his logic keyboards lined up and so a lot of a band shit no hi oh yeah this is just a guy that fascinate you know he's fascinated with it and he talks about like the old penitentiary here's old amusement parks and stuff and it's the left Air Force Air Force town it's caught illicit Ohio I said oh hi ll I see I T oh hi oh calm but here's an Air Force which is vlog yeah and well what is that a broken roller coaster what do we do get we're just watching things the conversation is actually eroded us like rolling through it together but Mike Tyson's old house I wonder if you would be creeped out if you bought it and you knew that like Mike Tyson just gorilla fuck chips and everywhere no it's a lot of positive energy in it you think so oh yeah except for the Brad Pitt energy oh yeah that's dorsal area does Joey Diaz is crumpling in the background ladies and gentleman what's up what is that do you think Mike Tyson walked away from I probably a bunch Ryan for seven I mean how much do you make he must have made like half a billion dollars or something crazy right what did the guy rob them because they said everybody says that guy Don King yeah who knows who knows who knows where it all went it's isn't it crazy though when you see that story like repeated over and over again throughout history you know guys may got shit a lot of money and then it all goes away then they got not I mean it happens so idea yeah well then then they were he was living so crazy he was giving away Bentley's remember that he got an accident with his Bentley and he gave it to the cops and the cops got in trouble well you can't like just accept a Bentley from Mike Tyson while you're on the job you had no idea what they just told to me at 80 billion and go why can't he fucking just accept the Bentley that's fucked up for the cops cuz the cop could have sold that Bentley and not worked for like five years I quit I'm just gonna live off this Bentley money bitch alright and they sell that Bentley for

he's a savage that guy's a fucking Savage ideas we need to get you a one-man show he could he could just you could just would you really want to do that I could do everything you just want to do one mansion tonight in Vegas I got plans already don't worry about it but he's the type of motherfucker that you could just let him go for hours just about the trainer he had and then he has six chapters that you could go 12 hours on what's the original guy that adopted that just like Amato then he went with telly Alice and then his days with Don King then his days with that fucking skank from Saved by the Bell then his two years in fucking prison then when he came out to the guys that killed brothers what's with the bow ties is shit hmm remember they were guarding him for a while yeah yeah two years ago he's smacking some laying a fucking movie you understand different extremes not to mention he lost a little girl not to mention he's fucking Mike Tyson and people look at him sometimes and you may judge them but that guy's Jimmy is fucking deep deep deep and when you watch that we both watch that Tyson demography together then we and he said some shit in the beginning that made you fucking think about my time ever we watching the hotel room joint they said two or three things that you're like you know what the fuck you look at that guy he's as intelligent as deep as can be he'll finger you the fuck out he was beaten fucking people up I just watched him against Irish Pat Murphy or some but he's a killer he was if I was a killer well he was at his best I mean we talked about a mullet because when he was at his best it was like it was a force of nature who see just hadn't whenever someone can can summon up intensity that other people just can't match it's always fascinating to watch a guy who just races it to the next level and that's clearly what he did he came along and just took it to another place like everybody was like whoa we never seen intensity like these whole eight chapters right in front of our eyes how many boxers do you know that went to prison the bill their career oh yeah football player and now that make it move this guy didn't go to prison under like some pretty shady yes answer he went in there for fucking rape yeah I've got a girl who would already and had falsely accused someone of rape she was only 19 years old and she had already before him falsely accused somebody and they still didn't get him off and they're they're the defense was so crazy it was like what do you expect him to do look at who he is she should have known she should've known that if she's gonna be alone with him he was gonna fuck her like that was the defense we just you can't say that that guy's gonna weigh more money thrown away he's thrown away more money than a small country has that bank account oh yeah it's true more money than ten people lived through in a fucking lifetime you know how interesting that guy would be to get him stoned by mistake like just to give him a hit of fucking Soho gee cush and let that motherfucker go just let him go just tell him just about three of his boxing fights and what led up to it yeah what happened in Japan against Buster Douglas you know so I wish him all the luck in the world because that's a true motherfucker right there we watch that guy come go come go again his daughter died two years ago not many people can bounce that back from that bro you know and he's really trying you know I used to see him at the YMCA but for all the fucked up shit I hate to see him try cuz they had him to rehab up there he was always pulling over this and teaching a kid how to throw a punch right you know I'm saying dog and that's what it's all about it he would always stop and walk past the boxing thing and if he'd see somebody he'd go and he'd go like let me help you he would hold the bag fear well fucking champion hold the bag for one time he can't still talked - he doesn't have problems forming sentences or anything he doesn't have life you know speech issues see we gonna do a one-man show that's the last thing you need you know that's a saddest thing about boxers - you watch a great one and then you watch them in an interview later in his career and you hear him slurring his words like man he paid a he paid a big price for that life that wildlife that has paid a big price you know now we're sitting here watching it but some people man that must be maddening to know that you know your career has forced you to in your later years not be able to communicate right you're like but do they know it do they know that they can't communicate right yeah well they do whether what's in their mind what's in that well I think the spectrums yeah there is a spectrum rather I think there's a broad range of brain damage but I think a lot of them don't know what the fuck is going on like that was the thing about the HBO football special they were talking about concussions they showed a lot of these guys later in their life and they didn't know what was going on these poor guys were like delirious they just literally their wives just guide them all around their wives it was like they had a child you know they had a child they had to take care of you know so there's there's a broad range football trauma-related bro with football I don't blame it all on the fucking the head trauma I blame it on your body getting hit by a truck for fucking ten years you getting hit by a truck seven months over a year that's reality you know how much abuse can your spine take hmm how much abuse can your organs take fucking shots you know the shot that I'll give you if you stand like this he gets in I come from the wall the right I give you the kidney oh so I don't blame it all on the fucking head shots it's gotta be a motherfucker - put your head down and to hit somebody well he won't it doesn't your spine something's got holes bro that controls you know all the electrodes that controls all this shit your fucking your body a little spine yeah you know I've told you many times the last two years before I stopped doing blow at the end of the night my fucking spine would oh the top of my fucking neck would hurt it will give me a little voltage like so I knew it was starting to fuck shit up and you can't talk I can't a man I want to know if they know what they're going through that's I want to know if you sit them down and go how you feel and if they would say to you at times I want to express myself I can't yeah I'm sure they can't I'm sure that's exactly what they would tell you that's got to be a terrible fucking feeling man like he's already terrible I see something like Vinnie Curto who I know uh he's been punched in the head 80 fucking times you know I could talk to Vinnie for hours I talked to him last week for like 45 minutes and he'll go from sent to sent and it's amazing how he remembers certain things and I'm very impressed by it but at the same time when I hang up the phone with him I'm sure there's another thousand things that he's forgotten right for the 20 that he's remembered he's really forgotten a thousand so I might think he's sharpen that that's all he remembers is a handful that stuff you get compromised you know there's a certain amount of compromise you just you're gonna get if you were involved in kickboxing or contact sports or you know football any any time where you're getting head collisions over and over again you're gonna get you got to pay a price it's like how much the price you're gonna pay is it just gonna be like a weird little achy thing like you know I can might get like a hurt wrist is gonna be like that in your brain it's like that's kind of annoying but not that big a deal there's gonna be dad or is it gonna be something really serious well your mouth doesn't work right you can't formulate certain words where you struggle to try to put together a sentence and you forget what you were talking about right in the middle of the sentence and you're not even high Thanks it's really weird how I know from two ways I know from riding a motorcycle whoo and falling off and banging my head a few times oh I know from getting hit in the head a few times and I also know like how you feel the next day you get hit in the fucking head Sara Lee used to it yeah you feel terrible is what youth you feel you do feel a darkness and your skull it feels dark it feels like there's no Sun outside you know when you get clocked in the head for a couple days and you see things that's a good way of putting it it's fuckin crazy I know when I got clocked in the head it scared the shit out of me you know I survived I live to tell the story I mean fuck yeah but you know that it's not right for you you said this you know that what I'm doing is that fucking healthy because this isn't normal for me to feel this way yeah you know it's not what the concussions it's not only the the the words and your memory it's also your mood it controls your fuckin moods it control whether or not you ice yourself or you fucking don't know how you live you know that's all the shit that's enough every brain you know I don't know what they are but you know different like somebody was saying that the front of the brain controls your anger and that the Buddhists believe for years if you meditate through meditation you could get through that part I'm just giving an example but I think it affects a fucking lot of things your mood and your depression or you been asked them yeah it has it fucking has to man and that's why when they talk about football played hey bro it when I who kicks hard the UFC Cro Cop what do you think when Crowe clock kicks you in the fucking liver you're not gonna feel that for a couple of weeks you should I think I'd do something see you insides cuz you're kicking me over here it's got a borrow from something yeah those fucking kicks gotta do something that is a thing that people don't think about is like the damage to your organs Jesus Christ fucking Jack's from weather football or kickboxing or whatever yeah you got to think about that because you can't see it so you just assume everything's okay in there well you know like someone's shin slamming into your ribcage and fucking rattling all your shit full blast into your ribcage really Jesus Christ you know how much how many of those can you take what's going on inside there you know there was show fucked up is everything on the NFL we were in Pittsburgh I was watching that I have two little TV was I'm trying to write whatever and they were showing Earl Campbell and they were showing the best 10 power backs of Walcott and they showed their Oh Campbell planning and some team and he had a play or something Salomon and they said look at the shot that he gives him with and by mistake he hit him with a V in the solar plexus think about it right my mistake like he was he went to tackle him and I tripped over a player's foot so the momentum and coming around that he was right there banned oh my god bad but you just seen it it was like an Carbonaro Campbell and you're coming and this motherfucker you just seen his arms go like this bro like everything is space cake don't give him more what I'm doing he can't take all this nobody can take all this no you just see the whole bag of popcorn oh it's incredible when you call me crying in an hour from now Joe Rogan you should see I want to talk to you Dana Dearman we did this podcast every day and she ate a whole bad bag of that popcorn and by the end of it she was so calm she couldn't even I had to call her cuz I was so worried about her like we've stayed here for a bit until she came down but Wow yeah you got to get someone some coffee or something right yeah what do you do that's time you just gotta ride it out yeah yeah nothing else let's go ride it out it's like a piss test yeah free you fucking amateurs don't be playing with those edibles dangerous edibles are danger my friend I guess that is not regular weed folks that's not regular week you gotta understand that it's gonna affect you a lot differently when you eat it I was just hungry hey I'm gonna be talking to two fucking space cadet 40 minutes fuck that fuck that dog I mean inedible a couple days as Columbus we just ate a whole bag of popcorn and one of those you're gonna be crying in one hour dude remember those cookies that guy gave us in Columbus Ohio and you ate them right before you went onstage did you start feeling it while you're on I think I remember you saying something about it was they felt a little blond so you know whenever you eat another boy and you go onstage you little yoga you go to jujitsu or whatever the edible sits in you but once that adrenaline mixes with the edible you've got a different type of fucking savage in there how about our friend that gave us those cookies in Chicago and you had a mild heart attack from which was this was a couple years ago we did Chicago club but that's very white yeah my 40th birthday came at the Bob and it was crazy this guy gave me these fucking cookies that were a rapper he brought them and I ate two of them then life-changing cookies oh my god they were life-changing the next day I had like an offbeat my fucking heart like Maya I had like a heart murmur you know three days later I went to the doctor like yeah you had something I'm telling you they were not regular cookies I don't know I don't know one thing I heroin something he put those weren't regular cookies there's a point there's a point where I could tell what you done there were these cookies I was eating for a while I'm not gonna say from what place no I knew the cookies were doing something to me well that's all that these fuckers would do was something to me that nothing else was doing I've been around the block so I can feel it I know the difference we didn't like a cookie and so he knew that he was gonna get people hooked he was saying these are the strongest fucking digs guaranteed when I got called asshole I got a call with you let me went to the fucking Hospital oh wow what an asshole the guy was like bro you don't have THC on you you can't be this asleep like asshole wow that's you know well that's the thing about having marijuana all shady and semi-legal the way it is you know there's a lot of fucking disreputable folks I'm gonna get involved in this just to make money you know think about like pots good man yeah pots good but when people are selling it you're gonna get people that are just trying to make money they're not like pot advocates per se some of them are just in the business to make money edible business people stick around for that long because you got to put too much weed to kill crazy - well the whole thing is it's got to be a one-shot operation so it's got to be a store that buys three pounds they trim it and whatever they have leftover they make the edibles with it if you go in to buy weed to make edibles you gotta lose money it's not gonna work for you make it from the trimmings and the fucking seeds and all the fucking stems and that's how you do it that's how you do it that's to do it to be profitable because it's once doesn't have the same impact what do you mean yeah yeah it's all the same strength all the same prints the stems have the same amenities things with all the shit you put it with the butter and you still get the butter with the same high THC ratio really Gillies the same from the leaves they trim it with the leaves that's all made from leaves dog you know when they tell you oh yeah it's wait did they take a beautiful bud throw it in there they take the leaves they trim it when you buy ok let me give an example that grind that you have right that grinder you have has two pieces it has a piece for the weed and a little weed and has a piece for cush what do they call it Kiki okay see how much Keef you got in there there's a lot is there a lot okay this is what you do when you go to a weed store now before they give you that weed they beat the key fall off the weed they do that's how they sell Keef you bring weed hole from a weed store now there's no Keef on it yeah yeah you get 25 a gram for that shit dirty a gram for that shit the the place next door is one of those schools that teaches you how to grow weed and like you can have like like up to seven plants or something like that and they and that use their their lighting and you just go you know a couple days a week or whatever to check on your plants it's like kind of it's kind of cool but they just body an extraction machine mm-hmm and so now they can extract the weed into like the weed juice where you can just like this guy show oh wow they got this Obama I love you I love you Obama yeah France Brandon next door I showed me he has a syringe and it's just a syringe of like liquid and he just like just dropping on up take an intravenous ship how long before someone takes that intravenous yeah it's a syringes to drop like a little drop on your nubs oh I understand what you're saying but I think how long before someone takes that and shoves it into a vein Oh totally are you listening one year you will not smoke and reef will be obsolete one year one year smoking reefer that's like 2012 Joey you can refill will be obsolete really what's between these things because this is the first ones prediction if this is the fucking first one the next one's gonna be half the size right okay the next one's gonna be your fucking I bought them Sam you just have to ask Oh Jenna we just have to assume it if they're extracting fucking weed juice from weed how long is it gonna be so some motherfucker opens up the store and says Joe Rogan I'm gonna put the shit you drink in the morning and I'm gonna mix and I don't think we'd use with that which is all-natural they're gonna find out that we juice mixed with to shut that without G this shit we drink in the morning the shine yeah that's it's gonna be like that well you know that they say that when you juice weed or when you eat it like you eat it like raw it doesn't get you high but it's really good for your body yes yes super really super help start getting ready in a year this is gonna be obsolete yes people still gonna smoke pot but you're not gonna have to you could just go to meet joy did you bring the dripper it's gonna be like Visine it's gonna be the Visine thing and you control it look what's going on with soda now you can make soda at home on this shit you know like when you go to a grocery store and it has like the off-brand that's like 89 cents and it tastes like Coke but like flat or just not as good that's what it is and it makes no sense like is is Papa's soda and pop really that expensive where we have to make it at home since the idea is supposed to be conserving somehow because you know you're recycling using your own glasses and it tastes like shit though you know what's the what's the other thing they have the thing that you put in club soda or water you remember you could buy it it's like vitamin something you put it's like yeah yeah yeah at the gyms now anybody I tell you what I know about you motherfuckers you're oh I know you remember this member well we were kids house also used to come yes it never came like this yeah well you were a professional alcoholic that's what you had a yeah remember New York Seltzer whatever happened to that York that's going around yeah yeah yes and no but it's gotta be like Jewish delis only like they don't haven't but a lotta but it's so weird I'm when I was a kid I go to rake in Ella's house and we get grape kool-aid and put self sarena from that gun it was the best thing I ever tasted in my fucking life cool they were bubbles of that motherfucker tremendous what's up do you guys know that this is the one of the one of the craziest fucking stories ever and I think we've talked about this on the podcast I'm not sure but the cocaine you know cocaine used to be in coca-cola yeah yeah little people do Jersey take it out now yeah we talked about did we talk about on the show yeah that's how nutty is that that there's like billions of dollars in cocaine being made by a company that its tracks it from the the leaves they used to make coca-cola cocaine like I said to you it's the whole business what you tap into the whole thing and you learn how to control like oh alright the cartel in the eighties Pablo Escobar all those guys there well they were processing coke that's what they were doing they weren't selling it they were getting it and selling a kilo for 6,000 and what you did with it was what was your business okay that was how it started then they said wait a second we're gonna become partners and get some of that from New York where we're taking it from so instead of selling the key for eight from now we're gonna get 16 we're gonna get 20% of their profits okay and then they said oh that's some good money too but they were paying people to transport it so I would come to Joe Rogan Inc and go Joe Rogan every week of Tuesday you're gonna transport 2,000 kilos at 5,000 a kilo okay that's it we're gonna do that to you and then they did that then Carlos Leydig another prisoner and went to the cartel and says oh we're gonna do I'm your new fucking partner 50% you're gonna process it you're gonna do this I'm the one that's gonna take it up to the States sell it set the pricing control the routes he got the island off the coast whatever and he got the island there so now they they ran it from A to Z you follow me they controlled it from A to Z they just weren't coke dealers no more the same thing is gonna happen with this weed the same thing is happening that these guys are getting the panel they turn half of it into Keith they turn the other half into edible and they the other half they sell it 20 or fucking grand there's no loss and wheat when they take the stems out now they'll just throw that into mix in the edibles did you hear about the weed they found floating off please but it's Mexican thuis only cares about that I didn't hear about it yeah oh my god red all fucking lose it dumped from like a plane probably I guess could be right they might have been running out of gas they toss it over but listen we're only the best be right here why isn't even on the ocean so where was it coming from 180 bales oh my god 8000 pounds of weed holy fucking shit 180 bales of weed found floating in the ocean now what do they do about that did they have to burn it now get taking it they put it somewhere and when they do a big cookout burning well listen they have medical marijuana why doesn't the government sell it we could use that money well first off they found the bail so how much water got into those bales sell it cheap let me tell you something I've smoked fucking weed that's been drive from bales in the early eighties really fucking horrible it tastes like salt water really fucking horrible it does blow the seeds oh it's not weeds got season we don't want to do with that we could use that for edibles but the thing with that weed is they'll take the whole how many bales 180 by the time they burn those bales the government gets to burn though beat maybe two bales left really think please so what about the the salt water and all that shit some poor soul oh fucking some porcelain like North Dakota we can't get any more fucking brother that likes to smoke blunts and make videos at his house what's the hardest spot in the country to get weed where's the hardest part probably it might be the easiest you're gonna get no weed at the fucking White House I think you get weed everywhere I think now in this country it's wrong yeah but could you go on the streets like the old days I think if you had to yeah hey dude pull up Penn Jillette's rant on Obama and weed Penn Jillette fucking nailed it you know Penn Jillette has a podcast now on Sundays and Adam Carolla's Network and it's called Penton Sunday school and he went on this rant about how fucked up it is that that marijuana is illegal and that people are in jail for and one out of six people in jail or in jail for marijuana and he he went on this fucking brilliant rant man and it really is it's a shame like what what what's going on right now arresting people for marijuana with all the information we have about how we you know we know it's not dangerous we know the laws are ridiculous it's a real shame when you see people getting arrested for and he makes this intense point about it from finding prisoners of business we know our president has said in his own book Dreams from My Father 1995 before entering politics he admitted that he'd used marijuana and maybe a little blow maybe I did what maybe a little blow which as you know is crazy talk maybe a little blow is what someone who uses marijuana every weekend says man I use cocaine once it was crazy yeah but he used a week ago maybe a little blow casual way to say maybe a little now he is not left this to states rights as you know medical marijuana as our good friend Joe Rogan will point out to you anytime medical marijuana you can get in California and the feds are coming in to try to stop this states rights don't mean jack shit to the Obama administration on anything except sub gay marriage what troubles me about this is and there's it is not hypocrisy because as everybody knows hypocrisy doesn't bother me very like Apocrypha and so Obama and yet you feel this is I think worse I think it's beyond hypocrisy I think it's something to do with class you know and a lot of people have accused Obama of class warfare but in the wrong direction I believe this is Obama chortling with Jimmy Fallon about lower-class people do we believe even for a second anybody believe that if Obama had been busted for marijuana under the laws that he condones would his life have been better if Obama had been not with the marijuana that he says he uses and maybe a little blow blow cocaine blow felony position this casual attitude toward drugs a casual attitude or drugs that makes him really cool on on Jimmy Fallon makes him the hip president I'm the cool president happy and hapless president I say weed I say blow it's all a big deal ha ha ha huge laugh from the college students and if he had been busted under his laws he would have done hard fuckin time and if he had done time in prison time in federal prison time for his weed and a little blow he would not be President of the United States of America and he would not have gone to his fancy-ass college he would not have sold books that sold millions and millions of copies and made millions and millions of dollars he would not have a beautiful smart wife he would not have a great job he would have been in fucking prison and it's not a goddamn joke people who smoke marijuana must be set free it is insane to lock people up now people bust me all the time for carrying on about how I've never had a sip of alcohol never had a puff of marijuana never done any drugs in my life they say why do you always bring that up well maybe in this case it's okay to bring it up ok I've never had a puff of marijuana I've never had maybe a little blow I've never even had a glass of wine all right none of that shit but the people who do any of this stuff do not deserve to be in prison throw some numbers at me gizelle 750,000 people in jail for victimless crimes a great number of which are marijuana one in six one in jail are there for me not one in six people of victimless crime know what it's exactly people in prison one in six people in prison is a brilliant man sick engine listen I just love the rent and if you want to listen to Penn Jillette Sunday school it's fucking amazing IIIi want to meet him so bad we didn't figure this out ten years ago I know but come on that's a great it's a great Rancho gave me the talk to you you
