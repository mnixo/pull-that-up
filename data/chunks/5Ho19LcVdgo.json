the Joe Rogan experience joy my day Joe Rogan boy yeah man you pull it through as you push it through it's like there's no there's no banging on my wrist at all okay I don't feel anything if not my right one is on my left it's just a timing thing it's like as it's coming up like you get it to hear and then all in one motion for you should start like this rear end quote I mean you're doing swing swings is a different thing no no I know but that's not I'm talking about those should you so he started like this uh-huh yeah yeah if you want to do you're doing two hand clean left leg yeah if you're going to hand cleans you have one in each arm then you go like this like that do you recommend a juicer stuff I do the ones that this is great I think I like that's my chance I like doing two hands this it makes me work full so that's the same with the call it's called project tango and it's been out for a little while but they made some adjustments for the sake of IO and it's a tablet it looks like a regular tablet but what it actually has the ability to do is to map 3d space in real time so if you think of like VR generally you put on a VR headset and you're in whatever universe they want to put you in this one is looking at the actual thing so interacting with objects is something you can still do even though you're looking at a digital representation of it I'm saying sounds sounds weird but like a couch is still a couch so you could you could like almost stylize let's say you put like an alligator on the couch next to you for example like a completely active scenario that you can interact with physically and on top of that they have the other use case scenario that I think they're talking about is like in mapping projects mapping internal spaces and things like that but it's in a developer mode right now so you can either hold it up and do it like that normally and they also build like a actual physical headset for Toby wicked for green-screen GPS where you could actually have GPS and like oh so you're going in between but the main one of the main propositions is for robotics because right now robots don't see very well and this would essentially give robots the ability to see time and space similar is this whole thing flying everywhere oh right through that right into the back hope it is happy I'm I'm worried it's is gonna know shoot the whole thing off the whole don't know you talking about 280 per second so it's just it just kind of blow right through that fucker all right it's a small it's a tight arrow that's very small aluminum and carbon I probably like the iPhone Partridge absolute perfection Wow yeah I mean yo convicts equal the old one with this so that's that's pretty clean causal right I did a next week oh my gosh awesome background angry yeah yeah yeah that's on target I'm almost edible yeah that's on target it's just a matter of with these things warming up a little bit [Music] that's gonna cut it sharp or is it like a like a point there's a pony yeah definitely a point yeah yeah while he's setting up do we want to get this done to do it should do chef yeah yeah yeah why you arm up this week yeah yeah bring it out here bring the FSO being here I guess all right here I don't even gonna need the big bow book yeah he's it a little easier to manage Aswath know your man just W ten pounds more pulling it is right in the throat and so no it's 100% unnecessary oh and we're actually going to shoot the thing I'll explain what this is and what if those bowl and yeah it's a lot like can you review this one oh you did well like if you wanted to do this right away if you want to do this experiment this is no this is one of the most powerful if not you know the other one the other one that I happen to tiny potluck is the most powerful compound both avoid cells you have to wear it's special from the factory like you can't even buy this from Lowe's store you can buy a regular less if you count one from above summer but if you want like this order table that one is special for the 90-pound one the other one called an idol it's called a point factor 290-pound draw away it shoots 490 green arrows and 288 feet per second this is one of the most powerful pose no man it's like you could conceivably make something that's more powerful like I've heard 100 pound bubbles but very few companies make them what is hated here this is all about the distance this is all this one doesn't have a sight tape on if you look at this one you see the sight [Music] [Music] boss left yeah is that going away Oh smell the burn it's bright for barbecue if you smell it aro it's brie cheese plastic oh shit yeah yeah yeah that's Russian Ella burning plastic like aluminum and it's very small on its diameter but very heavy weight and because of that it penetrates meat into the target duplos through phones it's [Music] that's right you can get them on Amazon Prime right if you like this all right boys successfully went through my phone somebody's you really you're lying that one rolling right now is a little pricey so it's time to do the real deal now we have sapphire black for you to keep it over top of the target you bullseye bullseye Kapow this one is scared of my liquid acting the only thing I'm worried about is you guys the dog glasses on it behind okay yeah yeah exactly it finish matter here's one kicking somebody gets sick thumbnail you need pictures down right over top of us that's right that's got me the thumb right there sue me yeah you know everything okay yeah I'm going to say okay I'm at full draw and then you hit the button and then I'm going to wait three and shoot this is it boys right now I think we got having one in one shot alright here's full drug we're gonna have worn one shot at a
