gentlemen were live yeah dude Stevo ladies and gentlemen Brian we've been in the house Stevo preparing himself for his long stretch in the pokey from mocking SeaWorld openly on top of a very dangerous sign dude there's a video of you you were streaming live while you you fucked with the SeaWorld sign and would you write two different ones I had the highway sign where I changed to say SeaWorld sucks and then there's the the one where I climbed up to 150 foot tall crane okay I think both of them made me shit my pants one of them we were watching it Brian and I were watching it and my toes were curling I know you're watching it live lifting up yeah we're watching knows when we're in Sea Road when you are I mean San Diego and you were doing the sign one you're climbing up the sign yeah dude yeah how did you live fall that was like appropriate it was right there down in San Diego near SeaWorld the highway sign said SeaWorld Drive and I changed it to say SeaWorld sucks I guess it was appropriate my crane one was completely fucking idiotic there is okay let me protest SeaWorld at some random construction site no we're fucking near SeaWorld you know let me fucking bring an inflatable killer whale like a toy whale climb up 150 foot crane when you're a hundred and fifty feet up in the air nobody no one's gonna be able to see your fuckin toy whale you know what's that dot right yeah Stephen a dot I know you they know been there could even tell it's right by the time I get up there I got 80 firefighters 18 cops a helicopter and a SWAT team I'm lying the problem with that stuff is if something real was going down and they had put all the resources Oh trust me I get it yes why I'm going to jail how long you go to jail I have a 30-day sentence but I don't think my god not that I think they automatically cut it in half and then maybe even get out quicker how does that work I didn't necessarily have to go to jail at all like I asked my lawyer to get me in jail time specifically because my fucking crane snot was so idiotic I was like man I gotta go to jail that would be the only one tiny little part of it that makes any sense at all because like if you're trying to make a statement about captivity right right put yourself in kept right you know I asked for it and so you asked for jail look you couldn't now to Jim I'm sure I could I could have done like community service like you know whatever like I was like now dude because I'm a fucking attention whore so like I'm like dude like like scrubbing graffiti does not a cool story like corn of jail that's a headline you know like I'm gonna get fucking I'm gonna go to jail that's fucking that's newsworthy it's so ridiculous to the judge what not I never even had to go to court because I you know it like they oh they all worked it out so when they kept postponing my arraignment and when I went you know by the time that like the prosecutor and my lawyer finally worked out a deal then when the arraignment was back on they said hey we reached a deal and then they closed it all down in the jail before [Laughter] his criminal record ever did was the first time the first time I was like 16 or 17 like going to high school in England and there's got nailed with some weed you ever jail in another country oh I've been in jail in like five countries what's the scary five I've been to Canada England America Sweden and I'm not counting Mexico because that was more of a catch and release what would happen in Mexico ah it was like I was you know like blacking out on Special K you know like ketamine and I was like climbing on this roof and like I kind of like fell off of it and and I don't know they just grabbed me and like detained me wasn't like yeah but it was pretty scary mirrors legit when you're in when you're in Mexico like that that's fucked you can vanish yeah yeah like a lot of people vanished right I find that el chapo guy hmm they're not gonna find a ferret no apparently they were closing in on him and he fell and broke his leg and he was carried off by his guards yeah apparently later they're closed they keep closing in on right but that's a good disappear for that guy he's psyched to disappear most people disappear in Mexico yeah people vanish in Mexico like those students like the 43 students that were murdered it's this scary shit right so when you were in Mexico when you would you sober up in jail did you like realize what had happened no like I don't know I mean I guess like it all just like kind of worked out it wasn't it wasn't big deal you know they they let me go but they just kicked Joe yeah in Sweden I was in like properly in jail for fucking five days I calm for international drug smuggling did you bring in well what I did I was videotaping it and I was in Norway and I put a bunch of weed into a condom I tied it in a knot and swallowed it choked on it I was like peeking up blood trying to get it out like God so then I flew from Norway to Sweden so that it would you know you put it on video oh yeah put it on the Internet what yeah I mean later you know later but I'm so happy so I swallowed it in Norway and got in an airplane to Sweden so that so that way I'm crossing international lines you know to qualify as an international drug smuggler then when I got to Sweden you know I had my M I was promoting my tour every interview like there they say like oh yeah how you know and listen mom man I think I might die of intestinal strangulation because I swallowed this big package of drugs and it won't come out you know cuz it took days I didn't come out for like six and a half days so this says so every like like a reporter like rode through their article or whatever it was and the cops are at the newspaper and so then they like they arrested me like after I shit it out and and they took me to the jail and and you know like they brought me into the from the jail to the hospital put me in this like cat scan machine which revealed they said a foreign object in my body I still don't know what what that was and they kept me in a cell for five days shitting into plastic bags they fucking digging through my shit and then after five days in there they brought me back to the hospital for another leg scan and it showed that like the foreign object had only moved like three centimeters like my body is so like they're like oh fuck it and they they just made me pay a fine and go you don't even know what it is I don't know I don't know they said it was like a key and I don't know sharp yeah might be still in ten years did you ever get yourself looked at again not an update that's my friend is he care that much but Sweden I was wild man and again I was super psyched because I knew I was on that little scrolling fucking thing on CNN at the bottom site for that well yeah I mean I thought I mean because we came now that when they brought me to the station initially like they put my backpack on the table and I reached into it like the first pocket they reached into the first thing they pulled out was a fucking ecstasy pill like like with the fucking like they had and it had a print like an imprint of a smiley face on it it Oh God and I didn't even remember it being in there and like fuck I didn't know that was in there and then I thought man maybe I'll be in Sweden for a while but turns out the ecstasy wasn't even like that you know they weren't even that bent out of shape over ecstasy they're more pissed about weed over there really yeah I don't know why it's just like a tree things well because we'd like they think it makes you lazy I think and they're not cool that's how it is in Asia well I think I think you know they're like you know this that makes you lazy and and and we're not fucking lazy people and so they they want a really appreciate that really frustrates me that that stereotype with weed making you lazy that that drives me crazy that is the one that drives me the most nuts you're lazy you're lazy when we does not make you fucking lazy it just doesn't I'm not lazy it drives me nuts I was never lazy man when I was loaded no my longest time in jail well you know like I got I was I was in LA County jail for five days one time I got arrested for felony obscenity and principle to second-degree battery in Louisiana whoa yeah because it was like I was doing my own show what does that mean principal - it means that I raged like an assault like I was doing my old show and you know that part of it was I was chugging out of a tequila bottle like throughout the whole thing and I'd like you know whatever like yeah I had the tequila bottle at the edge of the stage and you know some kid like climbed on the stage and grabbed the bottle and I see these bouncers come over and just neutralize it you know I don't like damn these guys are good these fucking bouncers are pro so I said who wants to get on this stage and try to run from one side of the stage to the other past the bouncers you know it's a British Bulldog will play a British Bulldog and these guys are gonna fuck you up so there's like one kid is like this bony little skinny little 19 year old kid was like jumping up and down pointing at himself he was just so he wanted it so bad and I couldn't I had to pick him so I picked this kid and he ran he just ran I'm videoing it myself I said one two three go the kid like runs halfway across the stage and they just grab and it was totally anticlimactic and these three like football player the college football player bouncers like they just lifted him up like in unison like over their heads and legs just spiked the kid on his head on his own no and he was like twitching and and like you know I don't think they're the police report said he was bleeding out of an ear or something like and and and it was really fucked up you don't they do that when they knew that he was gonna run across me I don't know I never said slam him on his head you know I'd said that maybe fuck but but yeah and so like you know in my mind I'm thinking ah dude this is such a lawsuit like this is this is bad you know so that's you know honey you're not thinking oh my god this poor kids too but like whatever it was it was just all bad you know it was all bad in my head like the mantra the show must go on like pretend it's not bad and just continue so I'm like I was like fuck on the video and somebody in the crowd was was had a home video camera rolling on and this was like what was it 2002 so like I mean is is before they had cameras on cell phones and someone's got like a fucking like VHS home video camera and on the tape which they turned over they were like that's a crime so it turned it over to the cops or they escaped the newspaper in the newspaper gave it to the cops so on the thing I'm like that kids being loaded into an ambulance fucking who wants to play another round of British oh no did anybody sign up for round time I can't remember if we did or not but but the assault though honestly well your day as principal to second-degree battery sir whatever I think that's how I think I have it right and like there you know like that was a crime but but like the people like you know that watch this video they really were upset with with Stevo and so there was another point in the video where I state is an industrial staple gun to staple my ballsack to my leg no normal shit I'm covered in blood to like because like part of the other part of the show outbreak a light bulb over my head and like pick up like a piece of broken glass and like like literally slash my cuz the time I bleed so much and it heals really faster I just bleed all over myself and smeared blood everywhere and and so I'm covered in blood and I've got my dick and boss just blatantly out and I'm holding the industrial staple gun getting ready to staple my ballsack to my leg and I say this is not art this is just to be offensive and so like you know being that it was Louisiana in one of these parishes they deemed that felony obscenity hmm which was a saving grace man because like because the story on that one it was like Stevo got arrested for stapling his balls to his leg you know like the thing with the kid didn't really play that much damage I'll tell you right now you had brain damage I never so you get spiked on your head some cells died I mean like I got properly sued so did you go to did you lose or did you go to court was dead settled totally settled it you can see how much he got 50 grand that's it's not that good but you know did you talk to the member did you talk to bouncers you go why did you spike him on his head why didn't just grab him like he just grabbed him I know grabbed him would have been funny you know right just grab and take him out of there help you know to hold him over throw him into the audience like a stage divers yeah yeah they really really it was upsetting they should have done that see the problem is you give people a green light like that okay you've seen some shit the bouncers have done to people when people climb onto that stage there's a green light I mean right it's like it's sort of like the cop thing you know like when when cops like did you see that video recent video of the cop grabbing the school girl she's in her desk she won't get out of her desk and he just fucking ragdolls her and slams her in the desk on the ground it's when cops have the green light when they can do whatever they want to do then you're leaving it up to the discretion of this guy that's probably not thinking that straight right a little stressed out yeah I got beat up by a few balance there's one guy I grabbed me took me out back and just like pushed me against the wall just kept on slapping him in the face me wouldn't let me go he like sat there for like 10 I was like 18 and he's just like wailing on my face then you'll be like you gonna do that to get motherfucker and then just like punch me in like I was captured like because I was outside of the club he was just ramming against the wall and shit like they're not supposed to do that right we left that club in Louisiana that night I knew I was gonna hear about it again and I sure enough like it took a couple weeks but you know I was like sleeping off a cocaine bender and my roommate says hey man you really got to get up for this and there's like the LA the LA fugitive division they had it like they they had a fugitive warrant out of Louisiana with for you yeah yeah there's a there are two charges the felony obscenity and then the second second-degree battery thing la you should just let that felony obscenity but they should be like you keep that yourself you fucking but the thing was that like they they gave me a one hundred and twenty thousand dollar bail like warrant for for the the battery and then for the felony obscenity they gave me a million so I got this I showed up on the the like the fugitive list like in like pole position number one with 1.12 million dollar bail oh my god and so their position and Ed's and so like they they brought me in they're like what you do and I'm like I stapled my balls to my leg like that nobody could understand it and I was in LA County Jail in the protective custody where I'll be starting on December 9th they're gonna put you in protective custody what yeah I mean I got I got kind of high-profile dude anything you you would be in protective custody to you and you know they I mean at the time it was 2003 I just got my back tattoo but the movie wasn't out yeah it's nobody knew about it in the cops like we're pretty psyched to have me in there and they brought me in to like they're out there office whatever like they're giving me like boxes and boxes of cookies and taking pictures of my bag tattoo I remember there they were like ah dude you'll be fine in here man what is the back tattoo through taking a picture my self portrait oh my god be fine in here man this is Robert Downey jr. block you know like we've had they're listing up all the celebrities that have been in there you got Tommy Lee like everybody they're like and and ODB's always in here you're actually in his self dude fuck yeah this has a good one the longest I was in jail was ten days in Orlando for thousands of thousands for drunk driving now that's fucked up yeah yeah like that that was fucked up and I remember like that was in 1996 and I mean I hadn't really broken out yet you know so like I couldn't really my before I mean I barely could afford to get to Orlando like I lived in South Florida like near West Palm Beach and so I could I just scrape money together for a for a Greyhound bus to get to Orlando and I was like I can't afford I can afford to get there once for my arraignment I can't afford to like go get Rand and then set a date and then come back and then come back again and my I had a public the public defender had said yeah I saw the video we're not gonna be able to do much about this you know that was the one where my arrest report said defendant declined roadside sobriety tests stating he would prefer to take a nap that I wasn't actually drunk I was just really tired and so inside told the public defender guy was like man I can't afford to like go home and come back again so they got the arraignment can we just like plead guilty and like ask that I go to jail like right away actually did the whole ten days so what is a what's worse Mexico or Orlando as far as jail well the the Mexico was just like holding you know like Orlando was like proper like proper jail like the like process and it was pretty mellow because like in Orlando they said like you know as you get like you know process you'll get prosecuted you get like orientation you know the kind of breakdown what it's going to be like they give you a tub of like like a Tupperware tub of like your belongings where you've got like whatever like your blue a blanket like a soap like you know they won't let you have a razor but like a toothbrush and they're like this year this is your belongings okay like you're gonna have it at the foot of your bed you're gonna keep it like this and like fucking don't piss us off don't do anything wrong because if you hear pack up your belongings you know then what that means is then you're gonna pack all your shit into your tub and you're going into the fucking dungeon you know and what that means like is that like it if you're in a dungeon then down there they're like and there's just not there's a you're just not on camera down there like anything can happen to you like and like you know that was like sort of the incentive to like be on your best behavior you know because I hear like everything's on camera like you can you know it was just like they're just letting you know that if you fuck up if you fuck up you're going down and bad shits gonna happen to you because you're gonna be because only people go down to the dungeon are like like dangerous people you don't want to be like fuckin with like they're gonna be with you that's the yeah basically like basically like the the worst people who are more inclined to hurt you are in the dungeon and Okemos yeah if I remember cuz I remember like being it like always on camera no matter what happened I don't there was no cameras but they're just like we're not gonna like down there and nothing can nothing's gonna be nothing nothing gets stopped think you're gonna get fired you're gonna be fucked and then it worked it kept like everything pretty like civil you know like I I was I was very well behaved now when you're in jail for ten days is it easy like in ten days can you get drugs in 10 days or do you have to like get to know the system I don't think that you're gonna have as much luck in County Jail like like County Jail by definition means that you have a sentence of less than one year and then at the point of it being one here then it's called prison and in prison I think it's like that's where you can get whatever you want and all that like really yeah I don't think Ellie I don't think like jail is is as you know probably make hooch is probably the big thing right I mean and maybe like I don't have that much experience I don't know but like I couldn't get yeah I was doing like backflips for extra food and shit like people give you food like the people that work there I gather the other inmates the people that work there you know when they had the cart that came by and and I remembered to like there was like in Orlando the jail is a big business in Orlando because it's kind of like Mecca you know like maybe even more than make it like more families I travel from all over the world to take the biggest tech tourist thing so like the business is like they say like you come to Orlando on vacation you leave on probation and then return on violation and I'd say that all the theme parks there right they have SeaWorld they're closing SeaWorld down because you know in California they just made it illegal for them to breathe in captivity they fuckin made they banned captive breeding in the California banned captive breeding which means that it only applies to the San Diego SeaWorld but that fuckin came down whatever that decision was and it was made official like within two days of me getting my jail sentence that's amazing and I liked it they mad maybe it's such a coincidence but I like to think that I got people sort of talking about it you know like like in the you know thinking about it and then they're like you know what fuck those people well you definitely did you definitely put some attention on it but there's been some attention on it for quite a while and that were these blackfish was the big worse that was the big one that woke up a lot of people when they did just realize like whoa well what would it what is this place killed SeaWorld for me forever I used to love it going as a kid I was always telling you like you're you're going to watch prisoners you're going to watch slaves and I don't it's it's super fucked they're like water people I mean they really are like as smart as human beings well you could say that but some humans are and dolphins kill a lot of babies right now like theirs they kill baby dolphins they rape a lot they're not the best I mean there's our dicks but not with killer whales kill dolphins oh yeah yeah and whales they eat whales alive like it's a hard fucking world in the ocean the world the oceans a dog-eat-dog world or dolphin e-baby world or a whale killer whale well there has never been an instance of a killer whale you know the people that would like to come orcas that work has never attacked a human in the wild it's true well we were filming wild boys we went to Alaska and we like ran across a pod of orcas and we had Manny the crazy shark guy you know like Tarzan looking dude the ride sharks everywhere he was so jazzed he sees he's killing these fucking killer whales in the wild he's like like just dives in to go swim with them you know like and we had probably had an inflatable killer whale there too and like we towed Pontius like on it you know like try to like right through it but you can you swim towards these orcas and and they're out with you yeah but they have saved people they've saved drowning people Baba yeah you know the people who capsized boats they've actually lifted them up and helped them there they're very smart they say that they have dialects they have like I can tell they're different accents they they recognize each other they stay with the same family for a life that's why it's so fucked up when they take them away like you're stealing someone away like a child away from their mother yes so fucking dark and when you see those SeaWorld commercials they're like we haven't taken orcas from the wild in over thirty four years that's the imagine if there was a commercial for like Nabisco and the Bisco was like we haven't stolen slaves in over 34 years the slides that we have we have had them for a long time that's basically what they're saying good I grew up with a sea road in Ohio and it's really weird how you know growing up they don't teach you that like hey we captured these guys that you always kind of thought like oh they're injured and we help them and that's why they're here it was always kind of like oh I like zero because I like I want to see these dolphins do good and be better but you know watching that movie you realize you know it's the exact opposite they just kind of right now slavery yeah they say a dolphin has a cerebral cortex that's 40% larger than human beings I believe they don't mean they don't have the ability to alter their environment they can't pick things up and move them around they can't send emails but they don't have to they live in a 3d world like they can fly around in their world I mean they come up for air but in their world they can go left right up down they don't need fingers like it's not necessary so our idea like what's intelligent it's like if you can't type something of you can't build a house your fucking idiot you know that's how we look at it I just but but those things that we define as intelligent when it comes to human beings are completely unnecessary they go with the waters warm the fish are everywhere fish are stupid it's fuck they swim up to him i jáchym dolphins probably never starve to death I mean they're faster than fish I mean I guess they die of old age but you got to think like it's less they run out of fish fish are probably easy as fuck for them to catch they just swim up and Jack them it's like food is floating around the sky imagine if you ever way you went like there's sandwiches just floating around if one of you guys hang out with your homies and grab a sandwich that's dolphin world but they do do some dark shit but they usually do it in the name of breeding that's why female dolphins are like super slutty they're super slutty because they want to have because the amount they can't recognize lines of paternity so they they don't necessarily know whether or not the baby's theirs so if they go up to a check and she's got babies and they have never had sex with her the women the female dolphins won't have sex until their baby has reached like maturity until their baby can swim away it's like a few years I believe so when the male's come up to females and they have babies and they haven't had sex with the male with the female they'll sometimes kill the babies so that she'll have sex with them again ah it's pretty fucked up Lions do shit like that Bears do shit like that too yeah that's the other thing the video with you and the lion freaked yeah okay so I'm going jail for fucking good cause man I used to get arrested for fucked up shit man you know like drugs and violence like in Canada I got arrested for violence what kind of yeah it was it was assault like um and we actually ran away from cops and got away it was on New Year's Eve when 2003 I want to say it was it was 2003 turning into 2004 did this big show and some fucking asshole got on stage and like snuck up like whatever and like sucker-punched me while I was on stage you know like fucking punch me and so of course everybody that grabs him and starts beating the shit out of them and and and I'm like and I'm like you know on the microphone saying fucking kick-ass you know like you know China like it started out as an assault on me but by the time I was like nah kicks ass and and they're beating him just all blood like and Preston lacy the big guy on jackass Heather his microphone he was like creating the news for that off mic so he's kind of blood even from that and then they like they carried him you know they cared then they were carrying him away and I like hauled off and kicked the guy you know and so like you've got in trouble for that I did yeah the cops cut were called and we just I think maybe like ran off the stage and she's dipped you know I like and got away but then I was back you know I'm you know my new tour in fuckin I was in is in Calgary and and I'm on the I'm on the the Morning News promoting my shows they said have you ever been to Calgary before I said oh yeah like I was I was here and and we really beat the crap out of this guy and then we ran from cops and got away like you in Canada well I'm Canadian I became Passport yeah I'm also American Anamosa British but what yeah my mom was born in Canada my dad was born in America I was born in England so I'm all three well you so all you do is be born in a country like that and you gotta support your citizen yeah but then they allow you to be a citizen of America too correct yeah you can't it can't be you know it can't be a resident of more than one place right but you can be a citizen yeah like I did marry like Australian chick I'm stoked in New Zealand would be even better and soon then you work Quadra right quite a citizen I'm triple national the thing was though like I'm some bragging about like yeah it would beat up this guy and fucking ran from the cops and then when I left from that trip hand over the passport like to the immigration guy like you know going through the airport he's like yeah go ahead and wait in this room and sends my flag yeah said the cops came arrested me and the guys and I mean they held me for like 12 hours or 10 hours or something and what they say when they arrested you they said you have an outstanding warrant which I think it's pretty funny it's like an outstanding warrant why'd you let you go after 12 hours because I paid bail like $10,000 bail that's it you have to go back and go to court I mean it was a misdemeanor you know whatever like I got it sorted out from you know like whatever Canada doesn't play when it comes to assault though like if you can it is the fucking toughest country to get into I mean like everybody gets have you got a drunk driving arrest or not no I'm like I saw it I don't I don't know if there was that big of a deal but but whatever you know it was great because I was able to sort of you know like clear away the wreckage of my past like for all the fucked-up shit I've done like I like to think I've made it all right you know how about the dude that got spiked on his fucking head he's fine 50 grand man Special K threw that 50 grand the first day that's a it's it's a weird thing like the Canadian thing like they live right next door to us so they're gonna be real careful about like fugitives sneaking across the border so they're super strict about any weirdness like Eddie Bravo Oh a long time ago got pulled over not even arrested for having a legal he used to work for a check-cashing company so he used to take these bags of cash around with them and he had a concealed weapons permit and so he gets pulled over by the cops and he tells the cops officer I work for a check-cashing company I have a large sum of cash and I also have a concealed weapon and here's here's my permits here my paperwork and so they take him out of the car the handcuffed him check his paperwork through everything seems in order you're free to go and they let him go so every time he goes to Canada they bring up that every time still on his record on his record still I was record it wasn't even an arrest he pulled they pulled him over they checked me but when it involves a gun if it involves anything where you large amounts of cash everybody kept tight about but it was it was all legit it was he worked for a check-cashing company so he had a total 100% ironclad excuse they let him out I mean it never brought him to jail they let him go yeah but still every time he goes to Canada they check him is hasn't James had a real hard time because Kevin James got in a street fight like in like high school or college or something like that and got arrested no conviction not nothing but every time he would go to Canada when before you're famous we do the Montreal Comedy Festival together every time we'd go to Canada they'd fuck with him you know Australia is the same way man Australia is like maybe even harder to get into than Canada and like Matt and I'm not Australian so when I when I go to Australia I have to like feel like a with my visa application I have to submit my entire criminal record like my whole history and it's like so long it's hilarious like you know there's even a bunch of stuff I didn't even mention like you know like beginning arrested all over the state's this stuff nothing was really good how many times you've been arrested there's one in in Philadelphia like public urination was like I mean kind of mellows more like funny than anything and there's my first drunk driving you should have like those like four lines and a stripe for five like counting off the days in prison when I got last year you know like a year and half ago or something I did a whole Australia tour and you know I was I was like putting it all together and I made like a youtube video like actually going through my whole like official thing and like with all the paperwork yeah my criminal like my criminal past or whatever and at the same time to the the Australian tour promoter wanted need to have a name for my tour you know like Oh we'd like to have you know a name for the tour and so I'm going through my whole arrest history and so I told him yeah man it's steve-o guilty as charged the name of my tour you know and so that's been the name of my tour for like a year and a half you know like if anybody wants to know the name of it that's what it is every time and now and and I'm so excited to be here today is because in like less than three weeks in Austin Texas I'm taping my first a comedy special for Showtime and it's of course called steve-o guilty as charged what are you taping it at the Paramount Theatre in Austin Texas a good spot I've been there ha did so it's so fucking I mean I just love Texas my love I love Texas so much and it's the one place that I haven't been to with this tour so it's like another fresh fresh crowd you know and we're I'm doing on tour are you doing straight stand-up are you doing it's it's like a one-man show or like it's totally stand up it's totally stories and like on story points throughout the

you know after after that then that's like okay now I'm gonna really get into it and so it's sort of like I start off you know addressing like how people have asked me for so long like how did I get into it how to jackass shit start mm-hm and you know I give like a super condensed like super hilarious like sort of fucking Genesis story of like you know starting with like me in high school and getting caught and dealing drugs and like and you know like going into college and just fucking up royally I mean I ever fucked up royally at in college and not to do in college it was so bad well within two weeks of class starting my freshman year I was I was on final disciplinary probation which is fucking impressed two weeks yeah I got my room rate and like they found on alcohol and weed and shit and said like you know so they they relocated me into another fucking dorm you know and they're like you were on final disciplinary probation and like I climbed up like that broke out a window and climbed onto the roof and you know clay there's a radio tower on top of the roof and I climbed up that and someone spotted me from the ground and and so the cops came on the roof and they kicked me out of the dorms and I was failing the fuck out of my classes and and then I just got in a van with this dude and just took off without him withdrawing so I got I got in a van with I failed out I got kicked out and I dropped out oh my coach I call overachieving mouthful I know and things like you know people were like when I was leaving the University of Miami it's like well what are you gonna do now and I'm like I'm gonna fucking videotape fucked up shit and I'm gonna I'm gonna be one year was this 93 so you had this idea in 93 oh yeah I was in and even then I was like man like I had like special fucking skills you know like I had like I was really fucking good at drinking bong water and Kara murky it was much very much said I don't even care how murky it was if you live a whole life that never comes out of your mouth you live a good life right and like I was like I you know it was Miami so I was like super they're like blow up class and I'd be like practicing jumping on the diving boards at the at the pool and I'm like I'm never gonna be a diver but if I jump strictly off of like roofs of like apartment buildings and shit into shallow pools then it's badass so I was like I got pretty good at that oh my god like my specialty was like setting myself on fire with like hairspray and rubbing alcohol and so at the point where I'm not even like fucking five minutes into the show at this point and I had to say my specialty was setting myself on fire with hairspray and rubbing alcohol so I'm getting at that point demonstrate like it's camera do you like that at a in the theater they let you do it in comedy clubs all the time I kept getting so hurt like I just like because what I do is like I'm going to do like kind of deluxe version for this one like I'm gonna start with like a can of hairspray I'm gonna like spray my like all the hair on my head like heavily with the hairspray I'm going to climb on top of a table on the stage and douse my arm with rubbing alcohol fill my mouth with lamp oil then I'm gonna click I'm gonna click a lighter and light my arm on fire like just the rubbing I'll call my skin's and the trails all the way up to your hair well like a drop like from when I pour it like on the table there'll be a puddle and so like a drop will stand fire probably and then so the table will be on fire my arms on fire and then like so I'm gonna use my arms and torch when I do a front-flip standing on top of the table and simultaneously as I do the front flip blow a fireball like off of my arm like which is a huge lamp lamp oil goes crazy so like the lamp oil and as I'm flipping for like the front flip my head like everything just goes right through the fire so when I crash on the table on my back now my head's on fire and so then I get and get up and like kind of like like flail around the stage with my head on fire and my buddy comes around and out with a mouthful of lamp oil and he comes right out to me and he uses my head as a torch and just you know blows a fucking huge fireball off of my head and and then like we'll figure out how to put me out you know then we'll figure it out right right I mean maybe he'll have like a towel or something because I've gotten like a towel my bare hands think about it well I mean it didn't occur to me that they would freeze had that I was gonna do it until I already did it a million-plus people are gonna hear this someone's gonna tell them all right well then fucking I better figure it out I've done it in the fucking thousand places have you ever let anybody know beforehand on a podcast did I feel like a fucking flashback from Calgary coming back it's like all the times you hit yourself in the head with sodas you've knocked out a segment of your brain that's just the worries I got maybe with you would definitely have a bunch of people Authority let the fucking fire marshal know or whatever do it like this is so important man I have to do it aren't you scared that like maybe you'll get really injured and you can't finish I mean like really bad and it hurts but it's not gonna like stop me you know Wow like half the rest of your show could be you looking you know like a steam coming on face movie it's like it's part of the fun right being all fucked up yeah I mean I think it's whatever I mean the crazier the better you know like I'm in this to fucking really make an impression whatever like it's gonna it's gonna go on and there's just gonna be like so that's kind of a one-man show but the thing is like it's also like fully stand-up man I've been on tour doing stand-up for five years now yeah I remember when you first started doing I was like that's it because you first started doing it like right around the time we were getting sober right I had been sober for like two years when I really don't into it and that I wasn't sober yet when I first started oh you weren't yeah first time I tried it was 2006 oh okay so you took a break and then came back yeah I mean I just dabbled in it until I've been sober for a couple years but that's pretty much what you do now pretty much yeah now is being sober does that fuck with your ability to do a lot of these crazy stunts well obviously not you know I would say that I I mean if you're like sober like you know like deliberately hurting yourself isn't necessarily easier but it's like I never did that because you know wasted I did it because I'm an attention whore and sober not take away the drugs and alcohol I'm still an attention whore but you embrace that fuck yeah do you why do you think I haven't fuckin tattooed myself on my back you know like everybody's favorite topic of conversation is themselves I'm just like I think that's hilarious and I'm cool admitting it but it just seems like if you were fucked up on drugs and you made this career of like getting hammered and and going out and doing wild crazy stunts that got you injured and then you cut out the getting fucked up part right but you're still injuring yourself well I mean injuring myself isn't like isn't as much of it you know I mean sure I still do it I don't carry what's the most injured you've ever gotten I threw myself off of a balcony at the University of Miami after I dropped out and then I came back and just lived there even though I wasn't allowed to there's like a keg party and I was trying to like impress this fat chick and that was on the balcony like but I had taken too many pills and drank too much booze and I'm telling this girl this was in I think it was Janie I was January of 1995 and I'm telling this girl said I'm gonna be like a fucking super rad stuntman and we're on the second floor balcony I tell her like you know like okay like I'm gonna be like this fucking gnarly stuntman like picture this I command like like there's a fight on the balcony you're right and like I get punched and I'm like pretending I get punched and I just throw myself off the balcony now I used to throw myself off the balconies all the time but not when I was that fucked up and not when I was trying to pretend that I had been punched and so my whole my whole game plan were like the way I would do it I did did it different I didn't catch the bottom with my hand and then let myself go I just spun over the railing and so I spun over the railing I landed on my fucking face on the bottom huh and I broke I burn I have the cat-scans they're so gnarly like I broke my my cheekbone I broke seven teeth I had ten stitches in my chin a concussion and a broken wrist and that's actually pretty good considering you fell onto what concrete and I was landing that landed there and I was fucking face down from where I'm from where I needed the ten stitches I had like a pool of blood like growing I was facedown and I'm not even fucking twitching a finger at all I'm just like there's just blood pooling you know and and I'm not moving and everyone's like thinks I'm probably dead but my buddies were like they're like man if he's not dead he's gonna need that weed in his pocket I had like kind weed you know they like fucking proper good weed in one pocket and like swag weed in the other and and they you know pulled it off put it out and and and in the morning I knew my mom was like I didn't even remember landing I gotta remember anything you know and they called the ambulance whatever that came and and then in the morning like I woke up and I was so fucked up it was I knew my mom was on a cruise ship in like the Caribbean but I but I told him I said oh I needed to call my mom and they said of course but what I did was I called my buddies down at the University of Miami I said hey I'm gonna fucking leave out the fucking emergency room entrance right now come scoop me up and I broke out to the hospital in my in my gown okay and they came and picked me up and I went back to the spot and I stood like right over like the pool of blood and I tried to pound a beer but I couldn't because it hurts too bad and I couldn't eat or anything and I was like like my sinuses would like fill with blood and then I would like Hocking you know like you hock a loogie and I mom and then spit it out and it was just blood loogies for like two weeks I tried to eat applesauce and I couldn't even fuckin eat applesauce because I was so busted up and so the applesauce a bowl of applesauce sat next to my bed just with blood loogies in it I had broke my wrist too so I had um the cast on my wrist for like whatever you have it on for six weeks and my mom like sort of felt bad for me because my I broke seven teeth and so my fucking all my front teeth are all busted out and she knew I was a fuckup you know which teeth like it was it was like my front one of my front ones and then there was one that didn't break one on the other side of that one did break so it looked extra bad right and my mom like felt bad for me she like sort of had like you know felt bad for me you know she's sort of an enabler it's here so she said a dentist appointment for me to get my teeth fixed you know like and she's gonna pay for it and I still got the cast of my wrist and and the night before the fucking dentist appointment or I'm gonna get my teeth fixed is when I get fucking arrested for my first drunk driving you know and like and so they fucking take me into miami-dade fucking county jail and I'm in the holding cell there and and one of the fucking like correctional officers in the jail except my fucking car and says that caste is a potential weapon you know like like like if I get into a fight in the holding cell now I'm gonna have an unfair advantage because I've got this cast on my arm so they're like you can't be in this fucking holding cell you have to go in to this gnarly fucking like crazy fuckin you know insult with like all the people are in here for the longest stretch of time oh god you know and this is the first thing I had to do was go and take a forget naked and take a fucking shower in the back of this big cell with all these bunk beds and all these fucking creepy assholes and like this sucks man I called my mom and I was like mom you know like you know I'm in jail you know and she's like she's like what you know like she says I'm not bailing you out unless you go door-to-door straight to rehab and I'm like okay so I went to rehab like in 1995 and and I remember these fucking guys like that when the counselor says like yeah you know like 95% of all alcoholics like died drunk of causes related directly to alcohol is I mean I like most people like they don't get sober you know like and I'm sitting there thinking man this guy's telling me like if I had like really wanted to get sober I got a 5% chance I'm like fuck that so I stayed loaded like I just resigned myself to being loaded forever and it wasn't until like 13 years later I've silly gosh so him saying that so it's me fucking wasted but what it did really wasn't what it did was it just made me not like get sober until I was really ready you know I think it's what made you really ready well I mean fuck I got in like Knoxville called an intervention I mean like that's when you know your fucked-up interventionist uh what was going on that he had a step in well I had this like fucking massive mass email thing and I was like broadcasting my downward spiral in like fucking real-time like you know 200 the most like you know influential fucking people in the entertainment industry whose who had the misfortune of giving me their info you know and it was just like more fucked up and it's kept getting worse and worse and and and I got arrested for like you know felony cocaine possession there was another one of my fucking arrests let's felony cocaine possession you have a well there's no such thing as misdemeanor cocaine possession that's even like a little bit yeah but I got a victory I got you know arrested you know like this is when I had like my neighbor in this apartment building I lived in was always calling the cops because I deserved it like he was a lawyer and I'm like an asshole and I'm always making all this noise so the cops are always coming but typically they would get to my apartment and they bestowed they'd be like oh no way Steve oh cool man have a good night and sound like David so they would take off you know there's this guy fucking his life was misery because wasn't like because I was such a fucking you know loaded asshole I'm thought my fuckin drugs and fucking being wasted I was just became particularly mad at him for always calling the cops on me so I like I'd like fucking take like a baseball man like powdered or whatever like fuck you call the cops you know like no and and I was like I was in pound I was like you know I was like pounding on the wall that separated our apartments like all the time it's like how you like that fucker you know how do you like that and I pounded on the walls so hard that I fucking actually pounded a hole through the wall where I'm looking into his apartment Haitao see his apartment aside I punched well the thing was that I pounded enough and then I took a broomstick and fucking just pounding pounding baton til I got through you know so now he calls the cops and they actually have to arrest me for four whatever fucking vandalism you know like it was a misdemeanor but I've been I've now vandalized his property by pounding through the wall so they come to arrest me and this time it doesn't matter if they're stoked or whatever like you know and I'm so blown out on fucking ketamine and I don't know what's going on and I got fucking bag of cocaine in my pocket and like and I'm and I open up the door like I got I'm shirtless I have no shoes on and a bag of cocaine in my pocket and I'm out of my mind and they're like hey we're taking it to jail because we have to arrest you for vandalism and like it's gonna be cold and so I'd like as a courtesy like you can go in there and put on a shirt and put on some shoes I thought my fucking shirt fuck surgeries I mean well that would have been like the perfect opportunity for me to go in take the bag of cocaine out of my pocket and I put on lead out like it was a perfect opportunity but I'm like fuck that yeah so they take me to jail with no shirt no shoes and a fucking and I get reared they've go to your property you know that when they process you under jail and so they pull out the bag of cocaine and they really they really at the jail oh my god so I'm in there for like three days or something and it's on the news and apartment buildings fucking over me even though I've rented four apartments in the building because one was a skate park one was like sort of like my my buddies then when my one guy edited my videos and stuff this kind of an office had this like assistant chick oh this is such a fucking joke I mean her job was just to tell people that she couldn't find me and I constantly changed my flights because I always miss my flights you know she was like a travel agent at best but I had an apartment for her and then I had my bachelor pad so it was four and still the fucking apartments like get the fuck out were you ready for apartments and then you still get evicted like that's when you know you fucked up well especially when one of them's escaped part right I know but it was it was like it was like neck then the next to it on one side was a fucking like Russian hooker operation oh so they were complaining you know they're dudes coming in to fuck these hookers all day long where did you live I've specific right across the street from rock'n'roll arouse oh right in the midst yeah I mean right on the part of Sunset place to live and the lawyers live in there closer I don't know that I ever actually met him like man I mean yelling like through the door like whatever maybe like a summer I wouldn't recognize did you feel like you want to go back and apologize to him I tried I tried I actually had his email and you know I reached out to him and I said hey like yeah it would mean a lot to me it's like we could meet up and you know and he just declined so I had to respect that you know but yeah that's kind in an email he declined he declined to me yes so I just sort of like when you're in that situation you want to go through and make things right right you have to respect that you can't like be persistent in them so to make it right to that guy like you know it's called a living amends where I sort of I'm not gonna do that to anybody else and it's a party thing about rehab it's just like basically a thing about life you know but um that's something that they asked you to do like when you're you own to rehab their rights it would be considered step 9 of the 12 steps you know we made direct amends wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others so yeah so that's part of the deal and now I can finally get out of jail and I come back and there's a fucking eviction notice on my on my door you know like get the fuck out within three days oh actually that there was that yeah I got an end like I had all drugs in my apartment so like I get back and like there's the eviction notice but like I just go straight for like the vials of ketamine I had like two or three more vials Academy hooked him up in the microwave you know I find I went digging through cook them up no Mike how do you how do you handle ketamine well yeah I mean it's best I never just like injected shit I just never got that far but you just cook it in the microwave and it evaporates like the maybe water I don't know and you're left with like the the plate it's like crusted to the plate and then you scrape it up with like a card and then what you do with that started snort it ya know how did you how did you get started on ketamine cuz ketamine is like a like that is my favorite man first time I tried it I don't think so Neal Brennan he's the co-creator of the Chappelle show stand-up comic funny guy he's been taking ketamine treatments for depression it's one of them yeah yeah yeah it's one of the more recent treatments for depression why they've been well because it resets the way you any intense psychedelic experience and ketamine even though it's a tranquilizer is thought of as a pretty and really that's how you look at it but did you have like outta body experiences or any experiences where you felt like you went into another dimension and trip you know the K hold experience some of the experiences I had with ketamine like person I got weed depth perception like wave fucking looks like some fear and loathing shit you know like you're not like you know about it like I've been I remember like like my fucking feet are like 30 feet away in a hotel room in London there's no with just way too much of the shit and like and at one point the whole hotel room just started free-falling I mean my god well nothing is like looking up like I could actually see like a like kind of an elevator shaft type deal that it was falling through you know like it was just the hotel room started free-falling and I'm like just thinking whoa and I remember being so stoked I was thinking I'm ever thinking Jim Morrison doesn't have shit on me like I'm so good at being a drug addict like but um so yeah I've been cooking up the ketamine and whatever and I packed is it coming but it's becoming a liquid form because Michelle so that initially where you would stick need a limit on shooting to a cat usually I think horse as much yeah horse uh-huh I mean PCP started out as an anesthetic that was the idea for it but yeah within like two hours of being of walking out of jail I have my buddy videotaping me I'm jumping up and down on the roof of a parked car screaming god is the Sun and like this squad of like security guards that comes over and like you know what's going on you know like I mean it's amazing that I didn't go right back into jail for another Hey pockets full of drugs you know and so there but I mean and I did that bender lasted for I don't know like maybe 24 hours and now I've got you know my three days is like and I've got one more day I got to be out of the apartment so I send the mass email list I'm going to say hey you know Megan with all the jackass guys on it but of course 200 like high-power people in Hollywood need to know this that like hey knocks on guys you know I I got to be out of my apartment tomorrow and I'm not fucking leaving my apartment I don't want to fuckin leave here until I jump out of my bedroom window you know it should be like a 25-foot drop onto the sidewalk and I need you guys to bring something for me to land on preferably a hot tub I already like to put a hot tub like and cannonball into and out of my bedroom window and and in my sliding glass door in the living room I could pull it open and I wanted to put it like a ramp in the living room and ride a motorcycle lay off the ramp through the sliding glass door and jump onto the roof did you imagine if you own an apartment that's not some explaining me bad weather the sliding glass door then because he's like just like a 3-foot gap to the fielding next door like that part was a gimme yeah but so I said like knocks I see you guys come over bring a fucking camera this is we're gonna fucking start filming like jackass three and like you know get over here c'mon man before I leave we're gonna do my eviction party stunts and and so basically I scheduled my own intervention knocks out reached out to dr. Drew who was on the list the email list he's like hazy he was like about to die and dr. Drew said yeah you're right you know he said get over there and fucking if you got a timeout put him in the trunk like take him to the hospital oh and that the other part I said if you don't bring anything for me to land on I'm fucking jumping anyway I promise I'm ready to die so they printed that up it was like I mean threatening my own life which qualified me for the 5150 law where you can lock someone into a psychiatric ward Wow so they came over to for my intervention and and like they're like it wasn't like the kind of intervention where like where they ask if you're willing to accept help you know it's like like we're taking you to the psych ward this is what's gonna happen if you don't like it we're gonna kick your ass and take you anyway so they take me to the psych ward for the the 72-hour hold which is like you know everybody's been on that like you know the whole deal but the thing was when we got there I was like spitting on people I was just like not fucking cool and like I was trying to throw shit around and you know like I was like when I remember because what I thought I was gonna like calmly explain that it was misunderstanding and be out of there but like what happened was they had the emails printed out where I'm like saying I'm ready to die you know and so like they had me I wasn't talking my way out of it once I realized I wasn't getting out of it then I'm like fuck you know I grab go to take a chair and throw it and like I get fucking tackled by like these orderly dudes you know and they slam me on to this fuckin I stretch her like bed thing with straps on it and like someone jabs a needle in my butt cheek and then I just straight took them back like that Thorazine shit man like is gnarly man I just held you down and whacked you with that yeah they just held me down and fucking jam to my butt cheek and I was out dude and then I woke up from my nap and and I'm in it was so funny though it was at cedars-sinai Italians you know like what's that mean aliens just the mental health didn't like division or whatever so like they have they've got they had two wings of the of the psych ward they're like one like they've got the standard-issue harmful to yourself or others you know like committed for the involuntary psychiatric hold then they've got the something outs like the extraordinarily you know like the extraordinarily qualifying individuals you know and that's you there's something out swing yeah so it said they had me on to something else wing and like whoa yeah and like my roommate was like fucking like like like hiding in the closet from like fucking demons oh dude it was I mean I've been hearing voices for like a couple years you know oh dude oh you're the best I have angels and demons you know like someone would tell me like you're worthless you need to die and I would be like trying to suffocate myself to death you know really well yeah I mean not like with anything I'm just holding my breath right but that was the whole thing was I was hearing voices because I was huffing so much nitrous oxide and while while you're doing ketamine while I was doing cocaine I never smoke this joint just fucking relax you make me feel so much better about myself I used to watch you watch intervention so that I could feel better yeah and I'm worried about your health more than I'm worried about like you overdosing I'm worried you're over it's it's a slow deterioration of your fiber yeah like the stuff that keeps you together you talking to me I'm fine now I am right now I feel like I just worked out something else worried like people are like the not people one guy I remember one guy like shit on the fucking ground and was like breakdancing in it like trying to like dude he was in school with shit like spirit around this is in the room with you no no that was in the hallway it's break yeah I mean it looked like his breakdancing but he was like he took a shit means trying to smear it around as much as he could it just looked like dancing because because I was so I was so belligerent think they changed my status from fifty one fifty to fifty to fifty which meant they like like 5150 is three days 50 to 52 weeks so they had me for two weeks and like after like four days then they made me over to the regular psych ward and like I was in there and this guy who is like a fucking he says his heroin addicts and he's a patient and like he's got this book about alcoholism and it's like dude that you have you really like this book can really help you like you need this book and I'm like why is it fucking heroin addicts giving me a book about alcoholism when we're both like on suicide watch and a psych ward yeah like what's the deal and I was like at the point I was like I'm like dude I can't I can't get sober I couldn't you know I was I honestly felt like like nine of thought like I mean like just core belief you know that like if I could have ever gotten sober like I was past that point I was too far down the line I was a write-off a lost cause and like so I just you know like from when the fucking first time I was in rehab you know like there's no chance and so like one night I couldn't sleep and I like just open this fucking stupid book like not to find a solution but straight up to kill time you know that's all I'm trying to do I'm reading it it's talking about like you know like hopeless alcoholics determined to die and this and that and then like they they become like you know they get better or whatever you know they become like the finest men you could me and I'm like just remember reading and thinking like dude what it's saying is like the more hopeless the more fucked up you are the better the chances for recovery which is actually really fully well why is that because if you have like any inkling like that like you can manage it that you could get better that you could stop on your own then you're just straight-up not a candidate yeah that's the rock bottom fearing pretty much and it's it's it's true like if you feel like you got it or it's not that big because I write write write he's for me like step one we admitted we were powerless over alcohol you know her drugs or whatever the case may be like like would like and and that like that I've successfully did you know like I can't do it I'm fucking powerless and so that's like the first step that's like the prerequisite and so it's like I don't know and then these guys come in and talk about alcoholism and I wouldn't have fucked never listen to a word they said but they like you know but I was locked up in a psych ward and so I did and I'm like you know thinking there's nothing I could do about it but they told their stories and how they lived and I'm like oh these guys can do it you know and and so I was just like my life is a fucking mess I was in the sacred long enough to be like okay my life's a fucking mess it's time and I went to rehab and so you've been clean from 11 and a half years just from that moment on from the Wow and as been any moments were you tempted to go off the wagon I mean sure but like not like I went from there like door to door into like a rehab you know and I remember like because I knew from the fucking back in the day like the whole 95 out of alcoholics don't get sober like the guy who was in charge of the rehab and back then it was dr. drew I could he was he was the the chemical dependency director of this hospital in Pasadena and and I was a nice place to go Pasadena yeah and I told you I said I said hey man you know I'm like right out fresh out of the psych ward like you know and I was such a fucking character I was like an atom like dude I know that like I know that you know the odds are not in my fucking favor I know like I don't want to waste my time I'm gonna do this I want to get right so I told you however long you recommend that I stay here I want to stay significantly longer because I want to give myself like you know I want to get myself an advantage he said that's great you know but like don't stay here more than 30 days if you're really serious go into like a sober living you know like a halfway house kind of a deal and and so I did man I did everything that was fucking people don't mean I did like all the fucking recovery shit that they talked about I did it all and I wind that fucking sober living and I stayed there and so I had two two full years of sobriety I was filming where you stayed in sober living for three years while I was bouncing around treatment like for six months you know because I was having a tough time with it I just stayed in fuckin treatment when you say bouncing around treatment well I I did 30 days there then I went into like a sober living that doubled it was like it was like sort of mid-level care so like I was free to go at night as long as I'm home by curfew but all day long right we had all of our little groups and like like you know structured rehab activities how much is all the shit cost my god expensive it was stupid like the 30 days is I gotta grand oh my god what the fuck and I didn't even necessarily know that so you pay for all this I paid for with my own money oh my god so you're just burning through your savings while you're in there God so six months it's better than the fuckers $300,000 I spent on fucking suing like my these fucking people I knew I was gonna get nothing out of he spent 300 grand suing people that you knew you were gonna get nothing out my back cat like these guys that I had a distribution deal with my God my back catalogue of DVDs but whatever that's not worth anything it was just a straight resentment fuck oh I see I just wanted to fuck their lives yeah I know that I did it rehab is a better investment yeah so so while you're in there are you working hell no I no fucking burned all my bridges man you know like I'm doing anything with jackass and like anything else I had going on like I had a TV show that which was really like did well in the ratings but I was such a fucking nightmare that they cancelled it just on the grounds that they did not want to fuck with me I had the spot right after Monday Night Raw the wrestling on the USA Network Wow I came on immediately after and I kept like a fucking whopping percentage of their viewers she was name is show doctor steve-o I went around in a fucking modified ambulance with a hot chick and a fucking 365 pound black like football player driver dude just trying to deal with safai America one was he at a time how are you trying to get them to do I would accept like its submissions where people would be like dr. Steve oh I need your help like I you know I'm a wussy like this is my unique case and I would prescribe for them some kind of like outrageous like jackass bullshit to make them come out of their shell or like it was good man like I did a great job problem was as soon as the camera stopped rolling I fell off from the radar except for my like it was buna memory their production company like my army that started like openly attacking like John Murray why on my for 200 people because he wasn't like pay somebody's one of my buddies something I wanted them to get paid for which they did more than obligated to fucking pay in the first place but I'm trying to ruin his reputation with like all these you know on my fucking crazy email list and that was what kill that was what killed the show despite the fact that it was like number one is fucking timeslot oh my god so I didn't have that fuckin to get to distract me from my recovery so you are doing you're just doing I don't think recovery not so how do you spend your days like when you're doing that well I mean when you're in rehab rehab like you got like fucking structure shit all day long like what cuz I mean what do you do I mean like different kind of groups like they take out various kinds of meetings you know like you got like fucking like a little therapy bits like you know whatever it's basically like summer camp it's just everything is geared towards teaching how to stay sober all day long yeah well how much can they teach you about staying so I'm confused yeah but it means go on for two years oh no no the first 30 days it's like teaching you like coping mechanisms keep you occupied and drilling into your head that you can do this and right and like 38 slow process but like it was great for me to stay and sort of in that environment for two years because because then I'm like undisciplined motherfucker you know by the end of it I was so like used to like being up by 9:00 a.m. with my bed made like pissing into fucking plastic cups like at random you know twice a week like scrubbing the toilet when it's my turn to scrub the toilet you know like keeping everything you know and and and I did that when I'm filming jackass 3d I'm like oh yeah like I gotta go fucking get launched into the fucking sky and a porta potty full of dog shit I might be a little bit late for curfew tonight you know like or whatever you know like was curfew what time I'm the one the weekdays it was 10:00 and then on the weekends it was 11:00 or 12:00 what or maybe not I think it was 11:00 on the weekdays and 12:00 on the weekend I think it's hilarious that after a certain time of night like they think you're just gonna get whacked well I mean what happened stay up we can't go to a diner you know what do you it saved my life man if I can save my life big time and I'm so fuckin stoned about it so just the the schedule the rigid schedule the routine the structure the structure did you enjoy it in there did you have fun you meet nice people I mean I remember it pretty well my roommate it was cool and like he snored which was like the fucking greatest thing ever because I knew when it was cool to jackoff you know like the sweet sounds of snoring yeah jacking off with a guy in the room but if he's snoring it's totally cool right yeah I mean that helps a lot if he didn't have a tougher time so are you allowed to have relationships were in there are you supposed to like steer clear that thing that can sort of distract you I mean there's no like hard and fast rule about that like they say like avoid getting in a relationship in your first year I got in the first year yeah I got into a relationship I mean I had like what if you found the perfect girl yeah sorry bitch my sobriety it happens just not like you know like relationships gone sideways is like the number one fuckin thing that makes people get loaded oh right that makes sense yes so it's good that I kind of like you know just worry about your sobriety but I had seven months and I got in a relationship with a chick who had like one year it was cool lasted for like ten months so when you're in there you're in there for 30 days this is the hardcore version and then you go from the 30 days to like a living situation and now how is that is that like a house like how's that work it was like an apartment complex at that point so it's in a part you got your own apartment then yeah but I stay Park no no skatepark yeah that was think I was a man I used to have fucking for apartments in one building now I got four dudes and one apartment so you had to live with other people you know there's two bedroom apartment and two guys nature what yeah why is that the deal because they want to make sure you're not alone by yourself yeah do deviations I mean perhaps you know I guess that's kind of the deal but like now what happened they're like and we would have groups from like you know eight or nine in the morning until 2:00 in the afternoon and then you're free to go and and I would be like skateboarding or whatever like trying to film some wacky shit or whatever you know like I didn't do like much like like in a professional sense and I was working with inna I was working on all this like 12-step shit you know so like I get like you know we do like the the searching and fearless moral inventory we're like we go through like you know basically like what have we done that like that we feel like a list of resentments make a list of fears and we make a list of shit we feel guilty about it's basically how it works and like you know I started off with just the shit I felt guilty about and I'm like oh like I was basically wrote a list of like the shit that I felt like you know the most terrible about and when when I went through it like and this is like Tony ones in recovery like avoid like making this mistake I treated it like I was just like you know putting myself on trial for being a bad person and like you know the whole point is just to figure out like what I'm here and you take an inventory and like you discard what's not helpful and you can keep what is you know you just discontinue shit that doesn't serve you but I'm like no I'm a terrible person I did this and this and this and this and then I'm like ah fuck you know and like I was just kind of like went in like a gnarly depression and felt like I'd fucking I don't deserve to live you know like whatever and like I've fucking checked myself into the psych ward number two you know while you were in recovery yeah I had thought you were going over I had like three months of sobriety and I went to one of my meetings and I was like I was like why all the work I'm putting into my fucking recovery on all I feel like I'm getting out of it is self-hatred I feel like I just can't get myself to the shit I've done I fuckin hate myself you know and this all came about from just doing an inventory on your past pretty much yeah I just had sad like it says in some of the literature man it says it like you know the inventory process will like you know bring about like self loathing for a lot of people when we take an honest look at like the fucking pieces of shit that we became like that's like a not an uncommon side-effects now like what what sort of tools they give you to to look at your past but not not be angry yourself not judge yourself well I mean I don't know I'm helping guys get sober I try and tell them look man this isn't a process of putting you on trial man this is just fucking figuring out what to stop doing no and that's the best thing I can say about it but when I was in that second psych ward like you know I was like like I wrote I wrote some letters to people who have felt the most fucked up about what I'd done you know and like and it actually kind of turned around where I was like you know I was like - today I'm fucking so thankful for the shit that I did that I felt that bad about because like no longer is it like oh I don't deserve to live because I did that and like for me today it's like I'm fucking desperate to not be that fucking asshole anymore you know and so it turned into you know and like when I first went in I was like the kind of thought like man this is gonna be my new thing I'm gonna get sober and like you know I'm gonna be like you know the world's gonna kind of owe me I'm gonna revive my career a little bit but once I got through that point of like you know sort of the the fuckin you know the dust settling and me being able to me being confronted with what I had turned into then it wasn't even about what can I get out of it you know it was just about I don't want to be that fuckin guy anymore and so I came out of that second rehab or that second psych ward and I was so desperate to not be that fucking piece of shit anymore and I was like dude I'm starting over and I went into the fucking like I went into another rehab like the fucking like God the hardcore you know and I was just like I'm doing this to be and I like I had my priorities straight you know and then I was there for two days and I've been said by the time I finish that it was six months and then I went into like the regular sober living and so that there's a lot of fucking money you're spending here yeah the last rehab was seven seventy five hundred and per month so at least high but yeah it fucking it was like thirty grand that second rehab I don't really the second psych ward I spent a lot of money on it man what are the guys that you were in the apartment with what those guys do for a living that they get afford to live in this shirt I paid the rent and I paid him each like a thousand bucks a month it's nothing why'd you pay him money for what well one guy was just said that like he was on call to edit whatever footage like that you know that that I wanted edited like to help me broadcast my downward spiral basically you know like I put some really upsetting videos so the people that you were living in the assisted situation like this is post the the major rehab right you were in the major rehab for 30 days and then the apartments different levels of rehab yeah like yeah and and I wound up like back and yeah I mean it was in the hole at one point I was in the house for a while and sharing a bedroom with the guy who snored and you know and I and and you know at the end I was in the apartment but it was all the same deal what did these guys do for a living that they could afford to like take all this time off of what the the sober living situation was like you know like that was like 1,000 bucks a month and that you know covers like your meals as well oh so it's kind of more cost-effective than if you're gonna try and find an apartment or anything like that and in the sober living situation it's like these guys work during the day and then would come there and stay with you if you don't work you have to do a certain number of hours of service work so I would volunteer at a nursing home whoa yeah there was dope man like I would just go ahead go fucking hang out with old people and I'd call the bingo numbers yeah and then and then I would like go and fucking move paramount like oh yeah guys I'm not gonna be able to call bingo tomorrow because I'm gonna be like drinking a fat guy's sweat so when did it feel like you were free of the monkey you know when I was like never mind never never right now you're not free I mean whenever like I just have like a way that I love my life you know that I still stay connected it's like a fridge man you know like if you unplug the fridge and then everything and it's gonna go rotten you know like you gotta fucking stay plugged in which means that like these things that that we do to stay sober like you just fucking keep like what kind of things well like helping other people stay sober is like the biggest thing you know you know like I you help you take people through their 12-step and who are these people that you take through and do you know them I mean whatever like you meet them sort of in the community you know like they'll ask you like will you be my sponsor and so when you have a sponsor they call you up in the middle of the night hey I'm thinking about doing heroin like that kind of thing talk about that it's better to call before you do it then after right because there's no point in talking to a load of dude and how often do you do this like how often you work with people I mean it depends like most guys like aren't like that active where they actually really call a lot but like you know I I'm always starting a guy you know there's always guys I'm starting off no and and just very few of them stick with it where they get like the guys I've taken all the way through the steps there's been two two-letter how many oh my god so out of a hundred people two of them have become totally sober I mean they've been like to say totally sober I mean you're totally sober as long as you know you're not loaded right totally like you are right now like you're going through the steps but then he's drinking again so you know I got one I got one guy that's been all the way through the steps that's still in do you think are you one of those people who thinks that if you were junkie that you have to be sober forever like you can't you can't go back to like you say if you had a heroin problem you can't drink they say once you become a pickle you never go back to being a cucumber so yeah like like there's no if I pick up a drink or a drug I'm fucked if I decided I'll pick up exactly where I left off but I'm and all I want is like to make sure I'm doing enough drugs that people are walking around my fucking apartment my house who are not actually there I know people that we used to be like heroin addicts that can have beer they could smoke a little way they can get away with it man then then power to that's dangerous why is it dangerous though I mean they're if they're free of it like okay here's a perfect example Anthony Bourdain he was a heroin addict he was a junkie full-on you still like to have a beer he likes to doesn't drink at home Perry I think is like that no you can't have heroin hey man power to him but for you it's not the way that my family is structured they're my lineage like dad was like a broken mold of his fam dad comes from a line of like academics like phd's scholars theologians zoologists like and he broke the mold of his family by becoming a businessman and a super successful one at that mom's side of the family everybody is alcoholic drug addict gambler suicide how'd your mom and dad meet I'm partying she was super hot you know but yes so like everybody everybody my mom's side of the family is either dead or dying from alcoholism I would say me and my cousins I guess I don't know my one cousins a mortician yeah I went to clown con of itself I went to Clown College he went to mortician school at the same time what's Clown College Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College for real what do you do this is an exploding shoe what like when I was like you know I said I left the University of Miami I wanted to become a crazy stunt man right now and all I really accomplished like with that you know even with all my crazy skills is drinking bong water like I couldn't get a job like and in South she's like homeless for three years just getting arrested and fuckin hospital and it's almost for three years well I was couch surfer for three years I had the government test money or to try to test drugs on me for money what yeah and by me everything they do medical studies for like maybe medical studies for whatever you know like if it's gonna come in contact with the human body like if it's a toothpaste or something they gotta do a medical study but if it's a toothpaste you're not gonna get paid shit if it's fucking drugs for pigs and cows then based on how dangerous the study is the more money again and so I wouldn't sign up for to have drugs for pigs and cows testing on me with which I which I recently found out the drugs was banned jesus fucking christ he's like this was in like 19 in January of 94 you're like a house that you like you get to the back whoa this the last door hold on Jesus a whole nother house yeah it was like they they want like a you know 1994 like whatever the January of 94 and then they wanted to pass this drug through the FDA called RAC dopamine hydrochloride and the goal of that they didn't know much about it except they knew that it would make the cattle like more lean like it wouldn't like increase the muscle mass decrease the fat so in but it would work the opposite way of steroids somehow and like that was so that they could appeal to a more kind of health-conscious and market they could sell like leaner meat you know less fat but the thing is that if it's going to become legal then like by the virtue of the fact that when people eat the meat they're going to get like a minor trace of this drug and then in you know the meat now they have to not only test the drug on people but they have to test like how much can the people withstand so like they knew that it was gonna like increase our heart rates like you know and so what the target for the study was to give it to us until somebody in the study had their resting heart rate like laying down resting I'm like 150 beats a minute like and it turned out that I had like the fucking most badass heart in the study like like the only time I went over 100 was when the guy like monitoring my heart with like the ultrasound thing the you know like did they show the baby on the screen like he was like Tommy stories about like killing people in Vietnam or some shit like you know yeah it was like telling me like war stories and that got my heart like what kind of stories was he telling I can't remember it was just like he was in the war and he killed people he's telling you all he's doing all you're selling your heart the same guy when he was looking at it showed like your blood like going in your heart like red and coming out of your heart blue like on the screen it was really fucking cool and and I just had like this strong heart you know he said man what a squeeze you know I like you know what a squeeze did that in Austin Texas - oh yeah yeah that was in Austin Texas at this place called pharmaco AUTOSAR right ii told you I got in the van with that guy we drove ads in Northern California to Lake Tahoe to try and get jobs washing dishes at Squaw Valley to get free snowboard passes but it wasn't snowing so then we went to fucking Colorado and I got a job like cleaning a meet room at a supermarket and that sucked so I've got one with this other didn't drove to Austin Texas and slept on a roof until we got into the medical study and then we left with two grams and we were stoked and then like I you know wound up like getting a car and following the Grateful Dead and selling drugs and she's my gosh you know I was homeless for like three years and and like periodically I get my hands on cameras and do really fucked up shit but you know I was getting video footage but like ultimately like you know I just fucking it was really bombed it wasn't it didn't like after three years I couldn't take anymore and I reached out to my sister and she letting me move in with her in Albuquerque and I was like I would eat all their food and I wouldn't fucking work and no money and if I did have money I was loaded and I was loud you know so when my sister found out about Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College she's like dude this could be the way to get my brother the fuck out of my house like so like she told me about it like I can't home and she's like how are you getting to Denver by Monday and I I hitchhiked from Albuquerque to Denver and I got there in two rides and just fucking mine apeshit have you written a book uh-huh okay is this all in the book totally dude my book at my books like it barely made the New York Times bestseller list but that's because you didn't come on here first probably yeah yeah I can't if people had heard these fucking stories and knew that they were in the book oh my god it barely made the best New York Times bestseller list but what I'm most proud of my book is my masterpiece man like on Amazon it's got like the the key middle of average rating is a full five out of five stars fucking partial stars even people who hate me and want to hate my book give it a fucking fire did you write it yourself I worked for the writer on it but I don't think anybody has like been more involved in the collaboration like that's all so we bounce we've got Sal that shit back and forth and like to it I wouldn't never use that word I'm you know like my guy I worked my dick off on that your story's fucking insane it's like it just has layers upon layers of Tears and that's kind of like what's dope about the fuckin like the the comedy show man I'm just like really bummed like to retire like my shit you know how are you retiring it what do you mean well you know like you retire material once the fucking special company yeah we make new stuff of course yeah please it's a good opportunity for growth right you want to be a comedy factory not a comedy warehouse that's one way to look at it well your comedy should kind of represent who you are right now oh yeah 20 years ago it doesn't really represent who you're I don't fucking like I told you it's like the history is like super condensed you know like you know so that's like funny and with the story points I'd like on story points I have like when I say like about how I graduated from Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College but like I wasn't one of the clowns who got fuckin contract with the circus so I had to like borrow money to get a fucking Greyhound bus back to Albuquerque New Mexico where I hung my fancy clown costume in the fucking closet and sold shitty weed and the bags of fucking weed I saw did not weigh anywhere near what they were supposed to weigh but in my life fucking sucked really bad but after I got done ripping you off like at least I would show you like a fucking epic unbelievable cool trick like this one and then like on that point like well fucking bring like the table out and I'm gonna fucking show you the most incredible bar trick ever so when did you when did you put this book out at 2011 and did you go on the full tour do all these radio shows and I mean I did like radio tour like we'll see that must have helped right yeah I didn't do like terrible like um you need like a platform where you could just talk for hours and hours and hours right be cool if I had like a podcast here I just think that's what I'm saying right everybody's tired of amigo and dude you should have a podcast t-shirt that says dude you should have a podcast because I've seen so many people but people took you up on it not every podcast is the Joe Rogan experience you know like it's the most fucking annoying question ever like hey will you do my podcast yeah they did not it's it's one of those things we got to kind of work at it it doesn't seem like you have to work on it like standard stand-up sort of the same way of course we're doing kill Tony last night that's one of the things I wanted to tell people like it seems like it's just you talking but you figure out how people are perceiving you and and that's that's a big part of doing a podcast too but you would be really good at it you really what I think she just did like one a week you'd probably it would take you a year or two to run out of stories like who knows it's like we're gonna tell us stories about should that happen or what's going on yeah dude do you have like a guy that you could do it with we could bounce shit off them you have a good buddy that you've thought about like five well with I've thought about doing it you know there's this fucking platform this this um what you might call it it's called you now one of these streaming things like periscope or meerkat but like but fucking this is so crazy like you now and like everybody who is a user of this platform like a like it has an account that they like put money into and so the way it works is like while you're streaming like you like their questions show up and think they want you to answer their questions so they'll like they have like different denominations of like money but they like give you like a cam girl now agents like bullied means doing it I tried it right and I just sat there like just telling stories to like the fans that were fucking watching and my by the end of I was on there for like 39 minutes and then I fucking ended the stream and it's like you just made $1,000 I feel like a fucking panhandler that is very cam girl asked yeah but if you did that all the time it would probably at least pay for a studio if you set up a studio so I mean for sure but you don't want see you don't want two people to have to pay to ask you questions I did this show and the guy who promoted the show I didn't know about it something to Bryan Callen set up this guy love that guy but these this guy had set it up and brought I love Bryan to but he doesn't pay attention to shit it's not like real good with details I had to ask him a bunch of questions about the show like hey man is it I was a DJ who's saying that he's spinnin records in between us a week is there a fucking break in between us was a DJ come on I'll check I'll check it's just you and I I get there it's not just me and him it's me Hamed is a fucking MC three local comics a girl's doing 20 minutes and it was a disaster we had to clean up this giant mess his podcast no no no it's a comedy show but the guy had made people pay extra to take pictures to meet us inside exactly and I said do you can't do that never I would never do that and you can't do that you can't do that it's fun I take pictures with everybody I'll do a theater now wait four hours and I'll shake pictures with a thousand fucking people you can't charge people an extra 20 bucks take pictures of me he did it on his own as a promoter and this is all shit that kaolin just didn't pay attention to the way the way I do that I'm Brian's cool about taking pictures oh yeah I know he is totally cool he just didn't pay attention he just let this guy handle everything whoo we didn't need in the first place you know what do you need use you know we don't need a promoter this is Twitter that's the promoter you know let people know you're there they show up it's not that hard like what does this promoter in quotes doing what is he doing he's just trying to get his friends on the show and trying to charge extra to take pictures it was stupid but right but that's a gross model like the model of like people having one day for VIP you know all that gross shit agreed the one thing though is the cell phone pictures like take fucking forever yes so what I do is I have my my website no one I'd take the pictures myself and like when the fucking I'm so good at it I stole your idea we saw that Jamie comes with me to some shows and takes pictures and we better it's better just way quicker third the time it's better to if you take them yourself because that way when the flash goes off you turn the camera around he can show the people their pictures so they can see it for like quiet quality control don't let them sit oh yeah cuz then they go oh my god take that again oh my god girls who like looking at photos of themselves and everything's great look oh my god I hate that picture do it again yeah no no no this is what you look like yeah but that's the thing is that like for me like I'm my camera so fast boom I know you don't like it how does I'm I don't like it so I'll take another one whatever dude my teeth look so fucking like and I just want the people to be really like HAP I'm getting like a bunch of cheese right man like I want them to be super happy with it because I know that when they fucking go to my website and pull it they're gonna post it on their fucking all their social media and then that's that's sort of my grassroots way of letting people know what the fuck I'm doing yeah no it's smart move and I started doing it right after I heard you did I think Brian told me about it yeah and a bunch of people do that now it's a girl does that too right doesn't Gabriel go something like that somewhere that's a smart move ok now like before I do my last fucking amazing stunt I'm gonna do every time I want to thank you guys for coming out and giving me a shot at stand-up and you know I'm gonna fuckin when I walk off the stage I'm not going anywhere I'm so I take a photo with every single one of you guys and here's how you get amigo to my fuckin website and I explain it real easy and I say and one last thing if you want to get out of here a little quicker the good news is I'm a New York Times bestselling author and I've got my fucking my book and I've got my fucking like my hats my shirts and if you guys want to get any of this shit then that puts you to the front of the line so having a March line and then a photo oh there's so many merch line first to get to the photo line through the gift shop and it's like just fucking Disneyland take a picture the people by March first you know and so like a lot of people would would be like oh fuck man like I don't wanna you know I know I Stella Mac if you don't want to get anything that's great but please just let me hang out like have a drink whatever like but and just fucking stick around and get that picture so I can thank you in person and a lot of people will think like man like you know I want to get a picture you know it wasn't to buy anything but like fuck I'll just buy something to get the fuck out here so you end up selling like way more work you know and nobody feels like you're a dick you know you still stick around and take a photo with everything everyone and their fuckers the only problem with selling things is you gotta deal with people like $20 dude like those people like oh just right how many don't buy Doughboy how many people are out there by selling fucking a one fucking side one color fucking shirt for 35 40 bucks like Andrew Dice Clay so it sounds like a fucking one color screen drinks five shirts yeah he actually brings like five shirts and the auctions them off oh sure it's like 500 dollars and that's not kidding yeah 20 bucks for whatever but I sign every last fucking the sighs say it like hey you know you can have a five-star New York Times bestseller that's autographed by the author in a picture and 20 bucks I don't feel bad about no looked it's great for a book you know book for 20 bucks is a great deal you think about the amount of time it's cost you know a book amount of time that you spend being entertained by that book books you're like the greatest bargain ever yeah take days to read you know yeah man that you have like as much as you do man because I really we gotta fucking get this Paramount Theatre in Austin but compact man I'm like that Joe is gonna be like that's my Showtime well you're gonna leave here and your phone's gonna be buzzing off the hook with your manager going did you say you're gonna light the Paramount on fire a huge stage and like dude he told me he wanted to get out of the room don't worry the right white there was like 23 people that just died recently a fire on stage it just happened again where two people in the band even died where was it Sweden or something happened it's parked on the side stage and immediately the whole place pyrotechnics dude it's not worth it we used to have those in the UFC we stand these fucking giant like opening shows actually I don't think we had yeah we did have fire believe but in the joel de Oliveros like this famous fighter from brazil and he was fighting in Pride and they accidentally lit him on fire and he was on his way to the to the ring and you know they do the boom when you're walking through like this gateway they like the fight and they they fucked up the timing they lit this fucking dude on fire as he's on his way into the ring and burnt him and then they said the huh you'll be back we give you a money and so you know it took like a year off healed up his fucking 18 degree burns and came back a year later and fought again if you have anything like when you go to the doctor do you have anything that that bothers you still to this day from like a stunt I know that's my choice I have you know I'm in tours like the big teeth and shitty tattoos most of it but like my esophagus is fucked I got Barrett's esophagus it's like you know like one of the warning signs for esophageal cancer I'm just like like acid reflux and I don't know drugs and shitty living and vomiting do you take care of yourself now you know cigarettes I haven't smoked and you're a vegetarian now right you haven't smoked in seven years Wow so right when you start getting sober this yeah well I was five months sober when I gave up cigarettes I haven't smoked weed and since March 9th of 2008 so no coffee and thanks for not smoking weed for this one oh no I appreciate it no worries I wouldn't want to get you secondhand Lambay I said but although some people keep telling me that's bullshit but I know it's not a pot I just I don't really give a fuck of people drink around me but like the weeks I'm like breathing and like it's like the problem is it fucked it smells great it smells great in it I do believe secondhand smoke gets you high I don't think it gets you as high smoking pot but I think secondhand smoke still affects you so vegan there's a whole other fuckin like major other door which other door like and this this I'm gonna fucking let people see this something at in Austin or at the show time but it's like you know it's like I'm good rehab it and like it's serving the whole deal and then it's like alright well it's great that I've learned how to live without fucking drugs and alcohol but like now I'm going to address my sex addiction I got was my deal I was like you know it's a mean joke I tell but you know I said I'm like I'm fucking 41 now I'm looking like my future and you know like I don't want to be 51 and falling apart and trying to hump everything that moves I don't want to turn into Pauly Shore I'm sure there's a few other guys just fucking ride that boat right into the rock I'll go with Lemmy before I would go with Vince Motorhead's like right right I just honestly believe you're married right it's like I really leave that like to be like happy you know like it's it's important to have fuckin I have a life partner and not run around tryin to fuck everybody and screwing them over you know I'm like that's the deal like I like how can I give so much of a fuck about animals that I won't fuckin eat an animal but I have no respect for women at all you know like it doesn't add up like so like on my fucking path and once I got into the the meditation like I've been doing Transcendental Meditation for two and a half years now and like I couldn't you know once I got into that like it was just like glaring like a fucking flashing red light like stop fucking screwing over chicks you know and and fucking using them up and throwing them away and just like you know like and whatever if I'm on the road like fucking hooking up with all the chicks it's just like it just became clear like that's pretty much like a path to being fucking miserable and it's a type of addiction yeah for sure like it's like anything outside like you know I've made myself like a promise I'm like okay now I'm like I want to fucking learn how to be in a healthy relationship because I feel like that time I'm gonna be happy and so I'm gonna fuck them from here on out I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fuck random chicks on that I'm gonna stop trying to get my dick sucked everywhere you know got the fuckin stage I'm not gonna go anywhere I take a picture with everybody so the whole fucking audience basically gets in a line and it's an audition to see who gets to suck my dick fuckin the whole thing I mean I remember like that guy gets his dick sucked no fucking he's in the fuckin way there's a sex program you need somebody to oversee both of you guys I'm stoked I'm an because now I'm like fuckin yeah I'm like I got in therapy like the whole deal and which is hilarious because like you know my whole story arc you know is like it's it's pretty epic you know to go from where I was at to where I'm at now you know at the end I think at the end of the show I'm gonna have to fucking break out my old lightbulb trick and so I can slash my shit and bleed everywhere just just because like to fucking to try to fucking like about the end of my fucking show it's like okay so now I'm like a fucking vegan and you know like trying not to get my dick like clean and sober like fuck a healthy eater you know meditating like the least I can do is fucking bleed all over myself out sure you're a vegan because you love animals that's how I got into it okay but you feed your animals animals I do feed my dogs dog food that has fish in it and I just I just adopted a cat and the same thing right right it's terrible I did it for what if they don't it's not they have to be like like at the point of hunger we're like you're willing to eat your own fucking foot that kind of fucked up you know it's like you're choosing the animals that you love you're feeding these animals other animals that were captive in my movie if you want to be like super black and white like PETA PETA I mean that's the reality of animals right I mean I just I don't know I mean I hear that like the even in my fuckin canvas you know slip-on vans that there's some kind of animal products and then in the rubber right yeah a lot of like I'm not gonna not get photographed because there's animal products in the film you know like I just do the best I can and I feel better I feel better for doing it ya know it's is this the animal thing is weird when people are super self-righteous about killing animals and yet they have pets I've had a real issue with that with people I guess one spot that's why I like I'm like really fucking committed to not trying to tell other people what to do you know have your whopper man I'm here like eat all meat you want I don't give a fuck I'm just happier myself like you know trying to why vegan what about like farm-fresh eggs or things along those lines when I was with with fish and eggs like wow they went back to being fully vegan mm-hmm but you know because I'm fucking feel tired all the time I'm like man what is it I think it's my diet and I think it might fish and eggs then all of a sudden I'll have more energy but does it happen no I fucking had a sleep study it turns out I got sleep apnea is a CPAP machine no I use a mouthpiece I'll turn you on to a doctor that's please local that makes a really good one a lot of people that have it it's your tongue for I have a fat tongue yeah yeah and this physician like to get cleared for a TV show and she was trying the light in the back of my throat she said do you feel like you sleep a whole night and wake up and you're still tired I'm like yes she says well then the back year through its really narrow and I think that's gonna cause it sleep back yeah the holes narrow yeah I have that too and also like I talked to me about getting an operation when they take out your adenoids and your tonsils and it's pretty intense and it's it's it sucks for like a week but then after it's over you have a larger hole and I have larger holes better for sleeping but this serves me well do you still get up to piss as much oh yeah if I have to piss if I try not to drink before I go to bed like right Friday but if I do yeah I got a fucking big fucking water pitcher next I bet on the floor so I just picked up a piss and put it back my friend Matt Serra who is a former UFC welterweight champion when I first met him he had this gym in Long Island and he used to sleep in the basement of his gym he's just teach and then go downstairs and sleep and here this jug right next to bed cuz finders will drink like gallons and water that day they just drink water all the time to flush our system out and he would just whip his dick out he goes I didn't even get out of bed I would turn sideways put my dick in the hole piss pull it out put the jug down right back this I did so great man this one black water pitcher like I don't have a very big dick or anything but like I don't even really have to tip over man because I gets got like about things where those classic kool-aid good to go so when you got a sleep study they put all the electrodes on your chest how many times did you wake up in an hour they said that it was actually like mild to moderate mm-hmm but but still I mean I know I gotta get that fucking mouth yeah it's not well you should lose weight I need an engine wait is the big one I think that's like what Joey Diaz Joey Diaz uses the CPAP machine but he didn't used to have to have that it's like when he got really big that's when he really developed because the more fat you have its salt closes everything off you know right when you see people with giant jowls well guess what that fats everywhere it's inside your face it's inside your neck and all that fat will close off the hole and when you lay back and your tongue falls over that hole there's no errands right I had to wake a guy up man I was on a plane this fucking guy was not breathing for like minutes at a time and then then gagging and coughing and then I'm wake him up but I talk to him when he woke up and I said hey man have you ever gotten checked for sleep apnea because he was it was snoring the most ungodly snoring so funny motherfucker wake up I'm gonna get sued like you're not worried about the kids who's got spiked on his head I tried this poor guy was freaking me out because he was making these noises and then he would go back to like and then it would be nothing no sound and I'm awake because I was writing and it was on the long flight and I looked over at this guy and I'm noticing he's very overweight and it's just lying there like this no movement no breathing no no movement at all in his chest and all son like I mean he would go I mean I'm exaggerating over saying minutes but he would definitely go 40 seconds like I time did I forget what the time was but I remember being alarmed and I remember sitting up going okay I got to talk to this guy and I had my mouthpiece with me because I bring it in my dad moves your lower jaw forward no no no no mine doesn't mine actually just depresses my tongue down and it keeps my tongue from falling back over my ear hole it depends on what kind of sleep apnea hmm I don't know what's the difference I don't know Joey would know more than anyone because Joey's got it real bad Joey needs the CPAP like he has to have air blow in it I love them too it's probably smoking weed right now I'm paranoid but anyway so I the guy was like kind of stirring and moving and when he finally was like opening his eyes and looking around I talked to him and I had like a long sit-down with him I showed him the mouthpiece I'm gonna go dude you could die I go you you hold your I was gonna film it but I thought it would be rude just film you but I mean you're holding your breath for a long time if you ever talk to anyone about it it's like no you know my wife tells me I snore I go dude you don't just snore you're like choking you know and there's a lot of people you don't know what happens when you go to sleep you're out and you sleep you're out and when you're out like that you're not getting any oxygen when you sleep you don't get into heavy REM sleep you're gonna get into those deep cycles you just skirt the edges and then you wake up cuz your body's gasping in panic mode and so you'll wake up after like eight hours of sleep and still fucking exhausted every day I feel like I could go back to bed right when I wake up you really could lose weight I mean you know that's a big social Joey Joey I mean that's a big thing with Joey's way way way overweight and he got down a while just like you did I mean Joey lost like 80 fucking pounds at one point but he's he gets the energy from that CPAP like he feels way bed like he travels with one he has this machine that he travels with that he has to check I mean so he always has to check his luggage because his carry-on is his CPAP machine so he doesn't go anywhere without checking his luggage every flight he takes Joey brings that machine with him that is his fucking that's his security system you brought up earlier you brought up Greg Fitzsimmons I don't Cosby thing what do you think about because I it makes me feel out weird I don't like it it's misguided I love Greg but I think it's misguided and for folks who don't know what we're talking about Greg has decided to start stealing Bill Cosby's material and doing it openly so he does these classic Bill Cosby bits and then he lets everybody know in the middle of it that he's stealing Bill Cosby's bits to take away from him what is most precious but it doesn't really work because it doesn't you don't like if someone tries to steal some shit off of like shiny happy jihad or something like that like it's already out it's already on CD I did it and you know fucking 2006 like if you're stealing you're not taking anything away from me you're just you just you know you're just selling yourself short by stealing so like if Greg does Bill Cosby's material you don't ever take it away from him it's already recorded these are like he doesn't even do that material anymore so I don't know I don't think it's really effective it seems like you're taking something negative and being negative about it it just doesn't seem it and I also think it's just opens the door to people go well Greg stole Bill Cosby's jokes you know and but he says it on stage they're stealing it he lets people know in the middle of it that he's stealing Bill Cosby's but Greg Fitzsimmons steals Bill Cosby's bits now he does he's doing it on purpose to try to take something from Bill Cosby like this is the idea behind it I think it sounds like Bill Cosby would be super psyched on that because it's like wow I'm getting credit for being funny and it's distracting people from Vegas totally true that's completely defeating yeah I think it's a gimmick I mean III see what he's like he's genuinely thinks the guy's disgusting right it's general I mean I glorify his comedy but yeah I mean I don't get it either I don't know I just I don't know maybe if I had him on and Greg oh hell monsoon and he's gonna be on soon I guess we were talking about doing something within the next couple weeks so maybe he'll explain it better I just I wouldn't want to have anything to do with it you know you know I'd say this up fascinate there's some lady that was on who was a legal expert who was discussing it and she said he might be the most prolific serial rapist in history which is fucking insane it's insane to look at it that way that this guy mr. Huxtable you know the fucking guy from the TV show the guy who had the squeaky clean comedy the guy who did the bit about you know the football players saying hi mom to his son on TV this guy was like wholesome mr. America in a sweater but they said none of these girls like the next morning well god what the fuck happened he raped me I am going to to the police this is all you know kind of like wishy-washy like yeah I kind of felt weird that night but no one really went right to the police though did they um I don't know I don't know it seems weird it sounds like if it seemed weird to me seems like a lot of people just kind of I don't know well listen man if you're a girl okay look at it this way you're some young girl who's trying to make it in show business and you're you know you get brought into his office because you know his you know he knows your parents or something that that was a lot of the situation like he there was one of one situation was there was like a modeling company and he would contact the Milan company to get people on his show like he was looking to cast but roles that didn't even exist yeah he would bring them into his office and drugged them like would you like a cappuccino and give them a cappuccino and fuck them I mean just drugged them I don't know it seems saying if that were to happen though like four hours this girl's good I just went there for an interview I had a cappuccino and he fucked me like you'd go right to the zone this is why this is why no because I think I was gonna say is like these these are young girls that are probably completely overwhelmed that they're even in his presence like they can't even believe that they're meeting Bill Cosby so you're insanely starstruck and the fact that he's touching you puts you into a state of shock like you're fucked and then you're confused because you wake up and you're you were drugged you don't know what happened and then you're embarrassed and horrified of it I mean there's so many extremes mr. Huxtable exactly it's like he's this is before the internet man you know for girl like that if that happened today a girl could go on her Facebook page and say today I went on an audition with Bill Cosby and he drugged me and raped me and like whoa like BAM that takes off and he goes viral but back then man if you go to the fucking police they might not say shit or money they might go to Cosby and Cosby might sue you but you got to realize some women did and in 2005 he actually paid off women and he that's why this all got more serious lately is because they released the transcripts and the transcripts said that he admitted that he had drugged these girls he admitted it so this this did go to cops and it didn't go out to the public so it's like it's not kind of weird it's just the amount of power and money this got I mean Bill Cosby is like a billionaire I mean the amount of money that guy has is insane and the amount of power that kind of money has were you talking about just teams of lawyers that just try to figure on any sort of attack that they could do to try to mitigate any of the issues that are going on with people accusing him of all this crazy you know rape shit it's like he fought it for a long time he hasn't really publicly denied any of it no he hasn't denied it at all he hasn't denied it all he just doesn't talk about it you know he one of the weirdest things that he said he did this one interview and he said in all my years of show business I've never seen anything this yeah well that's called free speech this is what's going on now look you you everyone can talk now like now people can get online and talk about crimes that you committed it's you can't hide behind lawyers anymore you can't threaten them you know you can't you you and you're a girl you're barely paying your bills you know you're barely getting by and he offers you twenty thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars just shut the fuck up and you have to sign some written agreement that says you never speak about this again you take that money that's what they do and that's what they did in 2005 and I don't know how much they got paid but it's probably even more than that probably a million I mean when you when you're worth what that guy's made in his career I'm who knows what he's got left but but someone a hundred thousand here or a hundred thousand there for a guy like that there's nothing he could silence a lot of shit but just keeping people quiet with money you know and that's probably what happened when things came up me I don't know and then there's also people feet with fear of being blackballed you know being blackballed from show business when you're a struggling actress and you're barely getting by the difference between Bill Cosby talking badly about you and accusing you of being a liar like who's gonna listen to you and who's gonna listen to him they gotta think that most people gonna listen to Bill Cosby and that could wreck your career before it ever gets started just sink your ship and it seems like a lot of these girls that he preyed on were trying to make it in show business that was a big part of like what he would attack he would go after these girls that were trying to become actresses and he was like a mentor figure that was like the angle that he was presenting stark shit man get on that I take one piss Simmons and his Bill Cosby strategy yeah it's a little misguided I think I don't know I mean maybe Greg's got a better point maybe we need to let him articulate it it's the darkest thing in all of the history of stand-up comedy I think I mean or close to it you know I mean what else there was that Vince champ guy that was raping college girls and he got caught he would say like horrible shit to them like pray for me and stuff like while he's fucking them that guy's in jail for the rest of his life Cosby is just out running around I mean it doesn't seem like there's any charges that are being put up against him and as far as I know there's only one woman that the the rape happened inside the statute of limitations I don't know what the statute of limitations is but I think it's like that's it that seems fucked I think a rape I think it's seven years but that's kind of like whoa you know it's a little wishy-washy meaning like if you if you rape somebody and you have great proof eight years later I'm sure there's still gonna I don't know I don't think that's the case I think a statute of limitations is pretty rock-solid like once it yeah yeah it's not it's it's law you know I don't know it's fucked up we've talked about that so many times it's so it's a subject that's been beaten to death but if it seems like it's so significant that you kind of have to beat it to death cuz it's hard to believe magic that was like your dad or something like that imagine you know if you found out your dad was a fucking serial rapist or your mom even your mom's drug and dude that sucking their dicks I saw you do about if your son came home from school and told told you that his teachers dick knows that he called the cops my son called the police cause uh how does someone ever find out that a female teacher molested kid one of those pussies has to open his mouth okay there's a giant difference she no woman molesting a boy and a man molesting a girl I don't think it should be encouraged but it's certainly not the same right did you hear about anonymous releasing all the KKK members information supposedly there's a lot of US senators I applaud you anonymous I feel like an anonymous overall across the board does more good shit okay I know I hear very very you bad accusations on their part almost everything they do I agree with I love it like it good fuck the KKK fuck all those crazy fucking Stone Age assholes who give a shit about the origin of birth of your great-great-great grandparents you know you're not pule you're not of the pure race it's gonna be interesting though because supposedly there's some ferguson police that are involved in this and it the whole list officially gets released and i think next week or this you want Browns on it well they can just put your name on it man somebody wanted to fuck with you steve-o's in the KKK what yeah you you've you've kind of morphed it's really fascinating I mean seeing you go from being this wild crazy ketamine snortin psychopath jumping off roofs and shit and damaging buddy to being this vegan who's trying to live a kind life and trying to be nice to people and you don't want to randomly hook up with girls cuz you want to have a meaningful relationship and then taking care of animals and fuck SeaWorld it's really amazing to see these become this every once in a while I gotta do something pretty fucked up just to make sure that well I didn't meet you until you were sober right you know I missed the crazy train I've kept it pretty crazy sober to them ya know no doubt yeah I mean just explaining what you're planning on doing it to Paramount before they found out about it do you think there's gonna be a jack house jackass for K or something like that I don't think so man but old and fucking injury last one was so great how I can I'm working my dick off to get my own movie oh yeah yeah like sort of sort of like the bad grandpa format but so my thought was bad grandpa good oh yeah that was a funny funny funny I cried when he got his dick stuck in that machine oh my god it was one of the funny that was a funny fucking movie that I was really good I don't think got enough read it I really don't think you got as much credit as it deserved I think it did well it was number one but it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life and when you talk about like funny all-time movies very few people bring up bad grandpa I think they should I think it's a goddamn epic movie there's some kids shitting on the wall and when he's dancing that kids awesome I love the kid in it when he goes to the black Club and he's with all the ladies and he's dancing come on okay it's fucking epic movie yeah should you have a movie worked out or do you have a night tell you much yeah I'm gonna like keep the cards close to chest yeah dude but but I got a deal with the yeah big-time movie producer guys oh snap yes now weird and I got and taking it and like getting it written and get the director and then take it to the studios kind of deal so we were talking about this this damage it's done really the fuck on back we're talking about the damage you've done to your body before you went off to pee and you said esophagus other than that like pretty margins and joints and back that joints are all good that's crazy what about Knoxville is he okay he's gotten some back issues I think so from that bowl I wish when he went blindfold the bull particularly her Don I think that one thing one thing that did a lot of damage to him was early early on dropping in on the skateboard halfpipe I think I'm one of the big vert ramps mm-hmm and he just like I mean just fell straight to the flat bottom and like I remember like hearing that like you know he turns his like turning the car like hurts his shoulders fuck he definitely did more damage because like he didn't have like the benefit of growing up like falling off a skateboard sort of learning how to fall down you know like when he'd like a lot of us are like sort of you know I mean I'm like you know sort of circus clown combate you know lifelong fuck by trades yeah so yes I'm kind of more like like I'm better at falling down without getting hurt knocks it falls down I just meet hitting the ground in the worst way which is why his shits always the best you know oh oh yeah that makes sense because you can do flips and all that shit you know how to fall with your body yeah more like a cat when it's down do it and Knoxville is just you know I think that he's probably in worse shape but then again at the same time I think that uh you know he takes good care of him sobbing you know and I think maybe he's done some bending I get some disk issues I don't know mmm yeah I've got a gang of those I did my own stunts for this accidentally did my own stunts for this Kevin James movie I wasn't excited I suck at riding bikes I had to ride a bike and I had hit him with a flag which Kevin James is zookeeper and I was the guy that I'm telling me about is when I did that movie which guy Todd garner oh the guy who the producer I know Todd yeah dude so I had to hit the brake while I was like riding a bike and I was hitting him with this flag but I'm hitting the front brake and when you you know you hit the front brake if it locks you go flying over the top and I did it like three times ask if we wind up using that in the movie instead of the stunt man because I just want to go fucking fly but I'm pretty good at falling there's a life-long you know martial artist so although like that I knew when I hit the ground that you can't just hit the ground you gotta kind of like roll with but you really have a real strong appreciation for stunt people when you do something like that because I go well I got through this luckily without getting hurt but if I had to do this every fucking day or you know every week some new thing where you've fallen off of a building or jumping off of a fucking moving car that potential for damaging yourself is super high now you hear about those people dying it's always like some movie that no one's gonna give a fuck about some racing motorcycle seen a Steven Seagal movie and someone dies you know I mean you got a when you watch those crazy action movies think about that appreciate the fact that those people they literally put their physical health and their life on the line for your entertainment you know I didn't think about it too much until I just fucked up and fell a few times on a bike in a movie you know it's like those guys do it on purpose all the time yeah that's right ma'am it's fucking hard gig man that's a harder said the fucking paramount all right ladies and gentlemen let's wrap this bitch up steve-o steve-o on Twitter Paramount Theater
