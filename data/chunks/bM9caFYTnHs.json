we give zero fucks here at the Joe Rogan experience whenever people don't understand what you're talking about here you your your premise or a big part of it is that there is somewhere around what is it ten thousand years ago somewhere around then towards the end of the last ice age humanity was probably mostly wiped out or wiped out in a big way and we had a rebuild from there we had already built and we and I believe that we lost a civilization at that time the entire civilization which has not been recorded by history and that it went underwater with the rising sea levels and what led me to this well the reason I became interested in pursuing that line of inquiry was the Ark of the Covenant because it seemed to me it seemed to me like a piece of technology that was out of its place in history in the way that it was described I'm not wishing to put down the spiritual aspects because they are there but there were definite technological aspects to this device and then I had to ask myself well where could that knowledge have come from and through Egypt we then start to find that Egypt itself looks back to an older time the ancient Egyptians didn't regard themselves as the beginning of their story they regarded themselves as quite a late point in their story and they look back to the time of the gods which they called Zep tepi the first time when there was a golden age and they speak and there are texts the air through building texts which speak of the gods living on an island a gigantic flood coming most of the gods are killed odd thing to happen to gods and then they come and settle in Egypt the survivors come and settle in Egypt and so Egypt is the product of an even far earlier civilization but but the history of Egypt goes back way way further than people think it does that's my view that's my I I support that view and I was astonished when you had Robert Schoch in John Anthony West when they brought their findings about the erosion on the the the temple of the Sphinx they brought these findings to these academics and just the the tone of their voice the way they were approaching the information the the mocking attitude that they had of it well where is this civilization you speak up because they're talking about a civilization that was possible we what 10,000 BC or something yeah well I would put the figure out about 10,500 BC what people end of it if you don't know the the the story behind it there's water erosion on the edge of the the temple or the Sphinx is done that could only be attributed to thousands of years of rainfall that's for the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was it was a breakthrough work that John Anthony West and Robert Schoch did the initial observation came through John who is an astonishingly knowledgeable man about Ancient Egypt he's not a official Egyptologist but he spent his whole life working in ancient Egypt and through his research and his background he came to he came to realize that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx are really odd and he then went to shock Robert Schoch at the University of Boston who is a geologist and an open-minded one and he said would you come to Egypt with me and give me your geological opinion on this monument so shock went there and and it was immediately clear to him that this monument had been subjected to thousands of years of heavy rainfall at some point in its history and that's where the mystery begins because the study of ancient climates is quite well advanced and we know that five thousand years ago four-and-a-half thousand years ago when the Sphinx is supposed to have been built Egypt was as bone-dry as it is today and you have to go back some thousands of years before that at least to about 9,000 years ago to get the very heavy rainfall that would have caused the erosion of the Sphinx but that only means that the Sphinx was standing there 9,000 years ago to be rained on it may be much older than that shock is cautious and he will not he will not push the date back beyond what the hard evidence suggests he's willing to he's what he does accept that the Sphinx may well have stood there before the heavy rains began but how long before is a matter that he cannot be certain on and that's where Robert Bauval and I were able to take the matter on a little further with the astronomy of the Giza Plateau and you find there's this just this stunning thing that happens in the sky I mean this is one of one of the the great things I I have a problems with technology but I have to say one of the great things about computer technology is the way that it can speed up access to information in an incredibly efficient way and there are computer programs now which will show you exactly how the stars were positioned at any time in the last thirty thousand years over any point on the Earth's surface you can literally wind back the ancient skies and see them and the skies do change because the the earth is the viewing platform from which we observe the stars there's a wobble on the axis of the earth chorus resolution that's right and the wobble takes 20 to 26 thousand years to complete a cycle so it's a cyclic process eventually the stars will all return to starting point and begin the cycle again and because of that we can say that the Sphinx was gazing at his own celestial counterpart the constellation of Leo at dawn on the spring equinox in 10,000 BC while 90 degrees away gieux South Orion was lying on the Meridian in exactly the pattern of the pyramids on the ground and doesn't John Anthony West go even deeper he believed is like 30,000 BC John thinks it might be pushed back another processional cycle see we we take it back to to that twelve and a half thousand years ago but you would have the same alignments another 26,000 years earlier so thirty-eight thousand years ago you would have the same alignments as you had twelve and a half thousand years and doesn't he base it on actual hieroglyphs to depict you know the images of the Pharaohs and absolutely right there's again this is the area where the Egyptologists the academic Egyptologists are incredibly annoying because they will not listen to what the ancient Egyptians themselves had to say it's as though they the academics know more about ancient Egyptian history than the ancient Egyptians did themselves and the ancient Egyptians were really very clear they say they pushed their history back well plus thirty thousand years what was offensive why I wondered that myself when I first got into this I initially couldn't understand it but I think I think it's a problem with science in general I think that was it a late discovery did they have an established timeline they have the time line was set literally in stone over the last sort of last 50 50 years of the 20th century I mean really by by the beginning of the 20th century a time line had been worked out and by the 1950s it was very much sad so they are just not willing to consider any previous date that would anything rose the whole time line out and because they've been teaching it for so long they're reluctant to open up time oh yes I would say so but but but also they themselves I'm not suggesting any dishonesty on their part they themselves absolutely believe their version of the past and in all fairness you know Robert shox depiction of the erosion there have been dissenters and I've read some different people's papers but you're they're they seem very logical and me I looked at it myself I know what water erosion looks like obviously I'm not a geologist but when I look at it and you say that that's wind and sand and and then they show extreme examples of wind in Santa Rosa it doesn't look the same there's it looks like this crevices it's been created by water it's really obvious it really does yeah and and and then there's so much else that that adds to that I mean the Sphinx is not alone there there are other weathered structures out there on the Giza Plateau and were once under deep and they find ones that are underground that are these old style construction ones that were built much like this the temple the Sphinx but not like the later stuff then it looks like two different areas of construction definitely does looks like two phases of construction one very ancient one more recent and they've got muddled up in the academics mind watching dr. Schaack try to talk to the Egyptologists about that was it was a fascinating thing because the guy got super defensive and he was like where where is the civilization you're speaking of this 10,000th right it was like let's mate what a lunatic remarks was mark Lehner who's an Egyptologist at the Oriental Institute in Chicago and one of the lead Westerner kill just working in Giza you know and his remark which we caught often was you know show me the pot shirt where is the pot shirt from this from this last civilization well the argument was at that time that the Sphinx cannot possibly be of that age because there's nothing else in the world of that age how could it just be this one unique thing which is 12 and a half thousand years old or baby older this amazing the monument how can that be alone members show me the potsherds of the rest of that civilization well some years later those poachers have started to turn up and they've turned up in Turkey in the form of a looter compactly tepee a gigantic megalithic circle which dates back to precisely 12,000 years ago and even has carvings of animals that don't exist anywhere near Turkey on this thing and they're trying to attribute it to hunter-gatherers which is hilarious it's really really hilarious they're these these were people who had an organized and systematic civilization and it was somehow or another intentionally covered up buried they buried it they bury these gigantic 12-foot tall beautiful stone carvings like lizards on them and stuff by the way that the ancient Egyptians themselves decommissioned some of their temples when they knew their system was going down they knew it was going down the Romans were the end of it for Egypt the Egyptians thrived through the Greek period when the Greeks arrived in Egypt what happened was the Egyptians colonized the Greek mind and the Greeks became Egyptians but when the Romans took over it was a different story that's my people they're fat and we're still we're still yeah when the Romans made this alliance with Christianity and the the Christian Church pulled on the jackboot of Rome it was Christians who really wanted to take Egypt apart they wanted to destroy everything and the Egyptian priests themselves rather than let their temples fall into their hands in that way they went around and destroyed certain things in the temples and they did so quite quite deliberately to to remove that power from the others who were gonna come and take it in oh I've only been to a couple places I've been to Chichen Itza I've never been to Egypt but I've been to at the one of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston had an Egyptian exhibit they had all this amazing old shit and the the is so hard to wrap your head around even the established timeline of 2500 BC when you're looking at the structures it's so hard to wrap your head around like when you're looking at a beautiful gold and covered sarcophagus that you know had King Tut inside of it it's like what what was that like you know what kind of a weird alternative way to live did these guys figure out where they thousands of years ago figured how to build these almost perfect geometric structures of two million three hundred thousand stones where if you fuck up just a little bit here or there by the time you get to the top it's done and they're like well they did screw up a few of them there's a few of the lopsided yeah yeah yeah but they got him right to who knows who the hell was doing a screw up ones that could either ones were done later bye-bye-bye copiers yeah basically that's the mystery of Egypt is that that and John West makes this point that that it's perfect at the beginning and it slowly declines this is not what we expect we expect to see civilizations slowly rise we don't expect to see them perfect fully formed at the beginning and then take 3,000 years to end well even when you push back the established timeline and you know we can't even wrap our head around a thousand years I mean a thousand years is very difficult to wrap our head around why do you think it's so difficult for them to embrace the pretty obvious possibility that things get wiped out I mean there's craters all over the moon we know there's all sorts of spots all over you know you go drive by that giant crater in Nevada it's a mile wide boom something hits everybody gets fucked you know I mean that's that easily could have happened over and over again throughout history and just that seems to me to be way more likely than we made it all the way from caveman to here without a hiccup without a fig like oh that's crazy and this leads you know this this this leads to certainly led me to conclude that that academic history is part of a this sounds a bit paranoid but part of an overall system of kind of mind control that operates there are certain things that we're allowed to think and certain parameters that we are allowed to think within in ours society and when it comes to the past those parameters are set by academics and they get so territorial and so defensive when you try to break out of that and and suggest other pussy I thought naively when I got into this at first that those who were specialists in this field would welcome some new ideas they might throw them out in the end but they would want to see whether there was any merit to the ideas and so initially I was really shocked that the attitude is oh this idea doesn't agree with us we are going to destroy this idea in any way we can and not only that we're going to destroy the individuals associated with this idea we will attack the man and the idea hominem attack exactly exactly in a very dirty tricks kind of way it's only later on actually that I came to realize that academics all treat each other this way as well they're all there they're all very very territorial they're all ego-driven they have their power base in a particular view and they defend that view to the to the death now when you say the dr. Schaack is very conservative you're not joking around about that and I always wonder when I hear some of the things that he says about other ancient structures I always wonder why I wonder if he took too much heat from the Sphinx and now he like backs off on stuff like the Bosnian pyramid and even the Japanese structure do yes I went there I went there with Jacques he's crazy and Jacques would not that's crazy he shot when the shark a shark would not accept that it was a man-made structure but but I have to say that at that point Yonaguni is a very difficult dive it's a very difficult dive the seas are wild there's a huge current flows right in front of the monument and you have to be an accomplished diver to do any work Jacques was on his second open water dive at this point and on those initial dives that we did on Yonaguni he was largely fighting for his life you guys have balls I love it it's very you know but my wife Santa who's a photographer and I Santa's right here with us have done more than 200 plus dives on the Yonaguni monument we went through the process of learning to dive and really getting the skills to be able to handle kind of current which is literally gonna rip your mask off your face and take your regulator out of your mouth it's like swimming in a river against the current actually so what I would say is that I I think shocked was a little premature with that conclusion and I think he's I have huge respect for Robert Schoch I have huge respect for his openness in mind that his geological acumen but not enough time was spent on the monument to reach that decision and it's not just one monument it's a whole complex of monuments and further north settles it for me off Okinawa which is about four or five hundred miles north of Yonaguni there is a majestic stone circle 110 feet beneath the water which again something I've dived on extensively which Jacque has not seen which is there is just no way on earth that that monument could have been dear photos of us online yes we do we have photos what I look for okay you go on to WWE but just google it go to Graham Hancock calm okay and then go to gallery and then go to underwater we have underwater on the gallery yes and in the end of water section you're gonna see a stone circle somewhere there with it with somebody above it holding a video camera that's me holding the video camera oh yeah and down under down below you is a stone circle and there's probably some more shots of it I'm gonna just come around and see what you're looking at there I was looking at this right here is that okay yeah that's the stone circle this is the central up right and these are the surrounding uprights yeah that somebody made that get out this thing this thing is 12 feet high Wow and it's 110 feet beneath the sea wow that's incredible it's the most extraordinary thing and and 110 feet beneath the sea tells us that it was made at least 13,000 years ago because that's the last time that a hundred and ten foot level was above sea level so well that makes sense with Robert Schoch about these ruins the Japanese ruins because there's one of them that really freaked me out I watch the documentary on it where they showed this these two mono we talked earlier I described them as pizza boxes they have a giant stone pizza boxes they were so perfectly cut and laying right next to each other I would just think you would look at that and you'd have to throw everything else away you look at that anyway that's not a natural phenomena and somebody there's right angles everywhere that sends off it does I mean the beauty and the perfection of the thing is is part of it but but part of it which needs to be needs to be taken into account I I can understand why some geologists feel that it must be natural and this is this is the reason that the stone is a sedimentary stone it's laid down in layers and some of the layers are soft and some of them are hard and their argument is that the sea battering against these layers selectively remove the soft layers and left the hard layers producing this stepped effect the problem with that is that if that happened then you would expect to see the very large amount of rubble which was created by removing all these layers you'd expect to see it lying in a disorganized mass down at the bottom of the monument which the tug from top to bottom the monuments about 70 feet high so 70 feet down and all of its underwater because the it's at the bottom is about a hundred and ten feet below the sea so you would expect to find that rubble lying at the base of the monument actually what you do find is a beautiful path cut out of solid rock at the base of the monument and all the rubble cleared to the side pushed away forming a bank which is no way on earth that could have been done by nature it had to be done by man that's what pit that's what people do they clear away rubble tidy it up and leave a nice looking sight and that's what that's what is that's what is there so his little details like that plus the the fact that there isn't just one monument there's actually about five along a good four miles of the coast makes it impossible for me to accept that it's a natural phenomenon and I guess the question comes up when you talk about a ancient monuments or ancient civilizations for 14,000 plus years ago how much really would be left it's a long time the so long we aren't we aren't for it to put in perspective the house that we're in and 14,000 years will absolutely not be here now if we leave it's gonna be completely gone they'll be almost no evidence the earth will devour these computers it will devour the leather and the table and the chairs that roof will cave in and we'll all go into dirt dirt will fill it over lava will come earthquakes will shift things he'll be gone will be forgotten forgotten forgotten it would be very very easy for that to happen so then consider the effect of ice consider it consider the fact that during the last ice age North America and northern Europe were covered with these gigantic ice caps now you're talking ice which is 2 to 3 miles deep your websites getting crushed right now can we get on your website all these sorry it's getting smashed that's good news yeah there's a lot of people on that sucker glad to hear it you know so so sorry I lost my thread there where I'm so sorry yeah is America so the ice forms on the continental landmass of the US and of Europe it builds up to a depth of two miles and it's in motion consider what's happening to anything underneath that under two miles of ice it's being ground to a powder to a fine powder it's like a it's like just wiping out literally wiping out the past
