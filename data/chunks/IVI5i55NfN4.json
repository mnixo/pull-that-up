know tell him what I'm trying to say naive Oh naive naughty but it sounded like a Damini yes so it just didn't understand so we get them together we have these conversation about race and we did an episode about abortion and Chris was like he's really Christian and he's like I was like do you believe a woman should have a right to have an abortion he just pit-a-pat it all around it's Chris just say yes a fucking no and finally said I don't believe a woman should have an abortion I said that's fine but this is my vagina and I can do what I want to do with if I want to stick firecrackers in my vagina and turn it into the 4th of July Joe Rogan this is my vagina as long as I don't get no vagina juice on you that makes sense yeah um Atlanta's got a problem now with that right isn't that Georgia just passed a new abortion law well I don't think it's passed yet but she just canceled her shows yeah yeah she's canceled her shows in Atlanta because I think it passed I think that was the idea that's why she canceled it oh thank you fans Joe cuz all the TV people haven't pulled out yet oh you think they would if it passed I think they would money the Atlanta got them in there because of tax money yeah and I think they're leaving lose their jobs I don't think the weather should be telling us what to do with our bodies I don't think so either yeah let me that you know I've been shot in the teeth at my wanted stuff so that's like you trying to tell me I should get my teeth fixed if I don't want my teeth itch it's my prerogative I shouldn't have to have my teeny fix right Joe how do you feel about late term abortions that's where people get scared yeah yeah I don't think you should be killing on having no abortion you know six to eight months now and I don't think you should be recreationally either cuz I had an abortion wreck you're just doing it for fun right I like horses for fun oh I've had a few friends think about riding the roller coaster but fuck it I'll get an abortion I've had a few friends I had quite a few abortions now I've had one myself I mean mines in my situation I think everybody's situation is different my situation I was I already had my first baby at 14 my second child at 15 and it was by a married man well I got pregnant by this married man again and I just looked at myself I said Here I am 16 pregnant with my third child I cannot take care to - I got you know it wasn't all of this stuff like what they tell you about birth control and safe sex that wasn't going on in the 80s you know people shedding a doze and talking wouldn't even talk about it well especially when you were a little kid you are I'm 14 little kid I was a kid so when I got pregnant with my third child I became a massive Payton miner and divorced my mom and I wouldn't got an abortion because I knew he wasn't helping me with the first two that's so crazy so I told the story on the first podcast and it's still to this day sometimes I'll be doing something and I'll just think about your story in the school selling drugs as a teenager pregnant with two kids at by the time you're 16 now Fairlane crazy in jail I mean I've got a school in eighth grade you know all of this stuff and I just said I said I don't want my kids they end up like me so I was like I can't keep having these babies and after that I got on birth control and I just prayed I said oh I don't want no more kids and I never got pregnant so I got married well that's good yeah so now I have those two you know I used to tell a bit about I got a set of Medicaid kids on the set of Blue Cross Blue Shield so I waited till they got older I mean I got older and I became God I started to learn about life he taught me a lot okay so I had those last two it I taught my tunes very very good move yeah I'm for them that's a good number but you know Joe I'm black so my family smoked crack so they keep giving me the keys I had my tubes and make room for the crack baby they keep coming in and not my house I'm raising four right now really yeah I have my niece my niece um I picked up my niece like five years ago to help her out she had a baby that was two weeks old and I have this thing like all kids deserve of solid foundation because I didn't have one so I picked this my third set of kids I've raised and I'm just 47 so I picked my niece up maybe two weeks old and she got three other kids I said okay I got this big house in Indianapolis come with me I got three four extra bedroom well this bitch ran off and left me with him kid now I have a five yeah and a 10 and 11 yo and I've had these kids for six years and I literally have not seen my niece in almost four years no phone call no nothing and you know I'm trying to build a career so I have a daughter who my whole my kids who that the house they had to make a major sacrifice like my daughter couldn't go off to college because she don't want to leave my husband with these four kids so she went to college in Indianapolis but she said she went mostly from you know home my son can go out to college because they at home helping raise the four kids that I called my crack babies but they're cool raising my crack baby because she gonna leave my husband out 40 crack babies by they sales so you know we're is the mother you want to hear some crazy the bitch blocked me on Facebook joke she won't he let me be

it's a spot like once my hitting right here my titties my titties heat up like if you talk about 95 degree don't touch them cuz you mayor but I'm just saying all your fingers there goes more than two-thirds of North American women who are headed into menopause have hot flashes they also affect women who start menopause after chemotherapy or surgery to move their ovaries oh I didn't say anything on why it's North American that's what I was wondering it says what is a hot flash it's a sudden feeling of heat sometimes a red flush face and sweating we don't know exactly what causes them but they may be related to changes in circulation I guarantee if they happen to men they'd know exactly what caused them oh they'll fix that shit they figured out oh yeah they'll fix that job if they can fix the soft penis yeah yeah they'll fix the man dick but if we can't do them with our body it's not fixing soft dicks and everything else will be solved no I don't think that would work very fix that so they can't say stop fixing soft unlearn they'd have to unlearn viagra look just let the man dick do what it do when it died let it die meanness that's at the point where the lady needs notes you need to put some cocoa butter up on the hip it slide across it back when it's always oval right yeah I guess yeah yeah people like think that they would be happy when it's over like good finally women will happen when they peers don't come on them why can't men be happy when a penis don't work cuz for men like your dick not working as a sign of you know you know we anymore yeah yeah for sure mmm yeah you feel like you're not a man anymore oh really yeah so I don't feel like I'm not a woman I'm oh my p.m. Scott we'd be happy yeah but it's different if you pussies dried up and became useless like sealed up like nothing you know like maybe you meet a man maybe you and your husband get divorced you met a man he's beautiful can't read so he's got good dick and you gonna put it in a flakes just a mess down there oh yeah you know I'm black grow real thick so it's always a mess down yeah I call it nappy grip I got a Jackson five afro I mean for some women it matters but I guess cuz I started really early I don't know dig I want healthcare no you ain't gotta do that to me just figure out a trail I put four men though it's like a sign of weakness yeah it's a weakness though yeah yeah you don't feel like a man anymore what if you love that person I think you ready are you willing to to deal with the softness hmm yeah especially if you don't want any dirt yeah what if you want dick ice cream sticks around it Oh like a brace put someone a broken leg fuck you you break your leg in the forest and they have to fucking strap it to some twigs what else that day was doing before I ever came along I don't know what they were doing this reason they would do out that's what that's why they kill rhinos you know rhino horn they think rhino horn gets your dick hard really it doesn't do shit do you eat it yeah yeah I guess they make a tea out of it oh really doesn't even work but guys have been taking rhino horn forever to try to get their dick hard and so much so that it now that it's forbidden and it's expensive because it's forbidden it's like a sign of luxury like you're drinking rhino horn tea it's a big thing in apparently some Asian countries like with like guilty people

hopefully it'll make your booties and titties girl it did work the message that works there's a lot of questions on Yahoo people asking that does that make your butt bigger and then I found a product on Amazon called cream for smoother fuller and firmer skin I don't know if that's what I hate natural butt enhancement cream for women and men plump booty enhancer lotion but firming and tightening cream sexy but was it ones so a sexy butt lifter cream but larger this is horseshit most likely it's got four stars bunch of people that are assholes that work for the company they're reviewing it 364 customer reviews hold on click this one or a bad one the good ones adding to my flat booty my family and my family I inherited flat butt syndrome it's embarrassing it's embarrassing have your butt hurt because you have no padding when you sit and have no pants fall have your pants fall because there's nothing in the back to hold them up after week I def notice something extra in the back I'll keep using that's the people that you want to buy your butt cream because they're morons that's like people that give money to preachers that fly on private jets yeah I think that's crazy that don't work but I'm telling government bought a work Joe I'm telling you I flew this who would have known it works faster on your breasted on your butt but it's work more this is not real God but listen these fucking the people that are writing these reviews not only does it works that's it works not only does it works it increased my breast size they probably should change the name to breasts and butt enhancement butter I know it for the butt I know it for the butt so I figured let me see will it do anything for my breasts since it's in quotes all natural so I did so with within a week my breast was fuller last time I seen them this size was right before it was time to breastfeed my baby is now nine years old so imagine what we was doing in the ghetto I'm telling you that thick as

onstage and I was like yeah why would you you don't eat before you fight why'd you eat before you go onstage was it causes your body that your body when you eat has to break down that food so it's using up energy like some of the energy that you would have to do stand-up is now breaking down that food in your body that's why I'll be about to fall asleep on stage yes yes shit I got to stop eating just don't eat right before you go on stage just eat afterwards okay yeah I mean I listen to him and I was like that makes so much sense and also he has a playlist of music that he plays right before he goes on stage like sets it up like he's like puts him in the mood to go on stage yeah I do that too I do I do that too I like a lot of I want to say Outkast but that ain't what I'm going for who the fucking rap is Carly B oh that little nasty thing that's what I would be if I had a body like that oh my god that girl got a tongue that a dragged a flow see my is you that person in my head

John did and we both just boohoo and I we told some of the store we got out the phone and it took for me to tell his story took almost a week me and the writer cried so much cuz I had I had all of that built up in me but I'm so happy I was able to tell that story now because that was the only story I had never told public about how my mama boyfriend did me and my sister from the age of probably six or eight ty was 11 years old cuz I started my kids father was 21 and I was 12 when I made him so I started having 6 8 12 so when he started touching me my kid when I got a boyfriend my mama my mama boyfriend left us alone once you got a boyfriend yeah once I got a boy for Christ so that was the only story I'd never told but when I told I felt like I lost 20 probably 100 pound I felt like it but it didn't go anywhere but I just felt a relief yeah so I know left I just know left that does a lot for me so I know it does the same for all the people damn you got a crazy fuckin and I laugh at every inch of it too well it's that's the only way you can mean what you've done is you've done the ultimate take a negative and turn into a positive that's right that's right but you mean you really have because your your sense of humor is so fucked up because of your life that it's so funny I mean that's why it works if you had a cushy life and you were saying this shit that you say it wouldn't be funny so it wouldn't be no and that's one of the things with my husband like when I was sharing wedding like my kid's father shot me and beat me you know most your listeners kind of know who I am they know my background and one of the things when I started sharing my life my husband had that protective mo he didn't want me to you know he knew how negative the world could be when I started to share these stories so I could see what he wanted to step and protect me right you know when people would judge me you know like I dropped out of school in eighth grade when my husband went to the military went on office he had a mommy and daddy way better life to me so he would always be there to like be that protector like well sir oh they think I'm stupid or they think I'm missing and I just I just he helped me grow a backbone didn't say fuck what people think about you because it was so much screwed up stuffing money like one of the thing my mama taught me about white people like I didn't deal with white people he was be honest I'm from the head it was a police or the fucking on the caseworker my momma told me she said why people are better than you never look him in the eye and they're the fucking devil so my whole life Joe Rogan I was scared of white people and when I when I wrote the book and I told the lady this when I was seeing white people I immediately looked down well that's what the slaves used to do and that's what the book lady told me and I was like I can't look him in the eye and then she was like why and I told her the story and I told my husband stories and he said Pat he's saying we're all the same your fucking mom is stupid I used to shell a bit I said the only deal between me and you white woman is my titties is bigger than yours but I was in I was in my late 20s when I learned it because you like I when I moved to Indianapolis I couldn't talk to you I fucking my words well stump and I would immediately say I'm stupid and I would look away and when I started doing coming in Indianapolis and my fan base turned white and I was like why the fuck y'all like me get away from me shit I just say that to myself and my husband sent me down I was like Pat we all the same your fucking mom is stupid I'm like we are and I was in my late 20s ever dealt with white people like I dealt with when I moved into that community and I'm glad because it taught me a lot as a young girl out of it out of the inner city of Atlanta that we are all the same the problem with the problem with these countries we don't fucking talk yeah we know communication well there's that and then there's that these communities stay the way they are like whether it's Baltimore where they had it set up or black people literally weren't allowed to buy homes and outside of certain areas or any inner city like you know in city in Houston or New York or anywhere where the neighborhood stay the same yeah they stay the same generation crime poverty all the drugs everything stays the same and I don't you know so my kids you know I might my kids are fuckin they blessings they don't realize how blessed they are and sometimes I get so pissed off at them like they go to this really nice high school where I live it in Indiana they get their little laptops and you know they get new books every fucking year Joe when I went to school it was so many niggas named rolled in that same book where it hit and checked it out every year you had to flip a page and you just see my mom Tyrone's I got three pages of kids who had that book and it pisses me off because you know I look at it I was like what this is the old curriculum where you know these keep my kids are getting a new curriculum every year and it's still like that in certain parts of a miracle and it pisses me off though like yeah you guys don't realize how blessed you are you come into fucking this fucking thousand dollar pad on the float at this school and gave you take shift grade like my daughter would literally hold up the school bus because she wanted to walk slow because she was fat so the lady called me was like Miss pay every day I got a weight on gear Rihanna to get on the bus

my kids I see actually college ain't for everybody so I'm not gonna force college on you but what you do owe me is a high school diploma and you do owe me to prom because I didn't have an opportunity to do none of that shit so all of them go to the poor all on went to the prom I picked that outfit and every one of them graduated from high school you know out my daughter was the first one in three generation to graduated high school the first one ever go to college then she didn't finish but hey - my my youngest daughter just finished criminal justice she have associate's degree and you know every time they do it is like I'm going to the prom for you they graduated high school they gave me their high school diploma my daughter's like oh well I just graduate from college you'll hit on your degree you cool Lobby I mean she thinks she didn't go to her graduation she she she didn't want to go to graduation so she booked it she had two options so she booked it on one day I was out of town but she gret she's my first child I graduated college and I look back Here I am with the 8th grade education on the GED and I was able to keep my kids from going on the road that I went down and you know most most most kids try to make their parents proud I try to make my kids proud to let them know it's not about how you start it's about how you finish you know I had to I had to meet to my oldest daughter and I said Jones in front of school and I you know I had to wake her at one time and I said I want to apologize for being such a horrible mom in the beginning but I was fucking 14 you know she was in housing but he had shootout at she saw me sell drugs in front of her school I said I've made a lot of fucking mistakes but I'm sorry because I did what everybody else was doing in my community trying to survive and that was one of the hardest thing as a parent because a lot of parents high you know they're pants with a kid but I literally went to my daughter and I you know cuz she hated me Joe she fucking hated me she's like why do you have to sell drugs in front of my school because I was here first bitch but you know I think you know we we have we have a relationship now you know and then I went out to jail and I missed her going to kindergarten a name I grew up in a community where he was gay something was wrong with you you know my daughter she gets fucked she eat everything in Atlanta she packed man with the Blissett I had to deal with that too because she ran out for a while when she when she wouldn't you know when I she don't want to tell me she was gay because I mean I had this thing where if you were gay with some roach I fucking hated gay women and I used to say this on stage when I say white man when you when you when you hate niggers that's a good chance your white daughter gonna come home with a big big nigger it was over you fuck my daughter came home and she was gay and it opened my fucking world to the gay community and now like I don't know when my daughter came out of some I was like you must be ashamed that your daughter's guest on bitch your door there's a hole so your daughter gonna take way more dicks did my daughter do okay I love my daughter I love all of my kids and in and I told Ashley that's her name I said it's not about I had to learn it's not about your sexuality do what make you happy and I will support you to the end as long as you happen because you saw your daddy stop my face and shoot me and mistreat me so if you wanna do what makes you happy just don't do drugs bitch but do what make you happy what what made you not like gay women before that cuz I was raising black community if he was gay you know we're the biggest motherfucker black people who would throw up a gay child I tell you something wrong which we talk to hate you know especially that old-school black community that's why so you know people you know why is that I don't know Joe that's just how he was raised the black church drilling in yo hey it you know if you gay you going to hell and you know your mom so what happens with gay people in the bar community a lot of them leaving never come back making the day a lot of them wait say you know they fucking mental problems I don't know like I didn't I don't remember gay uncle anybody so but you know I know we as the black community you have to hide you had to hide back in those days so I was taught if he was gay it would you was it was something wrong with you and when my daughter came out to be gay it opened my fucking world up and I was like do I judge my daughter over sexuality or do I love my child because it's my fucking child and I remember when I seen her for three years she just running she had dropped out of college just go from state to state damn near homeys well I don't be homeless and I said look Ashley I said are you gay I just want to hear it for myself she was like yes ma'am that's well come on homey puss in around his cheek and my child came home and we built a relationship and I act you know I was wrong because she heard how I talked about gay people in house it's almost like when you hear your if you if you widen hear your parents I was nigga nigga nigga nigga in there then you want to know wise anytime I make you get curious and you go outside and like it ain't what you think it is so when she came out and you know she when she came out he opened my world and I'm happy I'm happy for my baby and I tell a about my daughter will eat the shit out you she would dick you down once grandma but she happy Joe and that's what is all about
