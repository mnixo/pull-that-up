and we're live ladies and gentlemen we're live supporting the latest round earth shell we're just coming out with it round earth shell t-shirts both Jamie and I get $3 per month from the federal government to tell you that the word the world is round and Mick West is a big part of it all he is one of the main shells that tells everybody know that he has a whole website dedicated to arguing against people to think the world is flat yeah the difference is that I get paid for it come on stop lying I know you getting 350 per month yeah I wish I did I would I have to pay for my web hosting and it's come in and I pocket and though he pays me anything sima quest serious he's not joking around us um what this has got to be one of the most bizarre trends and Jamie I think you said it first that you thought it was originally a troll you thought that they were fucking around like I still think some people are yeah for sure it's yeah but I feel like it started out with like 4chan or something like that or maybe read it these crazy kids these wacky kids they decide to start trolling saying the earth is round or the earth is flat of some of it but a lot of it is just people who they they actually believe it yes this is a lot out there people like to believe it and then there's people who see that there's people out there who believe it and then they start by kind of egging these people on yes and then it becomes really really hard to tell where the dividing line is who's actually trolling and here's actually a genuine true believer there are absolutely a lot of true believers but there's also a lot of people with like little green frogs in their avatar that think it's fucking hilarious yeah I think it's been kind of a that type of person is kind of adopted it yes yes yes you know you're talking about shitposting the oh yeah yes and that's just something that you could do is if you want to just annoys people yeah by shitposting you'll just post a bunch of Flat Earth memes because they're so infuriating to the average person that they're just going to be what the heck is this yeah person is posting and you know it's the the ship purser enjoys that type of thing I was watching a video with this guy was ranting on and on and that it's not theory that we need to stop accepting that the Flat Earth is a theory but that it's a fact we need to start accepting the fact that it's a fact he was hilarious when we find is because I saved it his I think his name was like vegan warrior or something like that which is always yes vegan warrior he's a realist it says it's no long he's not only a flat earther he's a realist yeah I think I've come across him it's actually a relatively small number of people who are really active in promoting the the flood of stuff on on YouTube what's in the works is that they keep claiming that all the photos of Earth are fake but they don't have a single photo of this fucking ice wall that's supposed to be around Antarctica yeah and they keep saying erroneously that you're not allowed to fly over Antarctica like yes you are they keep saying that there's no photographs of Earth from space that they're all composites no that's not true why do they keep saying that they keep saying that there's a fucking saddle is a bunch of satellites but there's one from Japan that takes high-resolution photos of the earth every 10 minutes the full earth from 22,000 miles away yeah that's the Japanese Himawari a satellite yeah but there's also like the u.s. satellite that was just launched last year mhm the ghost 16 satellite which is basically the same resolution pull the sucker right up to your face sorry and the Russians the Russians have a satellite everyone's got their own so like this is basically weather satellite yeah so they put them like over the equator so they can see their own their own country so Russia has one you can versus the India China has one it's not as good as the other ones but the Russian ones are like a you know same resolution 121 megapixels as the size of the image they do it's like you're 11 thousand pixels by 11 thousand pixels view of the earth and you can zoom in and you can you can see cities you can see contrails and you can actually use these images from the satellites to actually match up with the views of clouds and contrails from the ground so you can see check to see if these images are actually correct at least for where you are right then you could like phone of friends and somewhere else and ask family do you have like this type of cloud overhead so you can actually verify whether these these images are actually real or not well I brought it up to my friend Eddie and he said it's all fake he said all the photos of fake they look fake like but how would you know what a real photo of Earth from 22,000 miles looked like wouldn't it look exactly like Earth yeah I think when you get that stage of deep belief you kind of have to believe that their faith there's no way and there it's real challenge like how do you actually break through that for somebody how can you actually convince them that something isn't fake if they just automatically assume it's fake and I think it has has the person actually looked in detail at these images most people know and have they looked at the fact that you know you get one every ten minutes or one every 15 minutes and do you know every single images is 121 megapixel image and it all matches up exactly with what the weather is around the world and it matches up with all the other sized images one from the Russians run from a Chinese run from the Japanese or they all match up and I really don't think that the people who say a fake have really actually looked well you're absolutely right out there they definitely haven't nor do they have any desire to it's a belief issue and it's almost like a religious issue it's a really fascinating it's completely infected the world of professional pool players really professional pool class yeah professional pool players there's a guy named CJ Wiley's a top pool player who's 100% convinced the earth is flat Wow there's another guy named max ever leads a buddy of mine out of his mind thinks the world's flat I went if that's related to their like obsession with the table being flat no I don't think so you have to make sure this tables level but then they got these little round balls on the table as well that's concerning right yeah he got a little solar system going on with you I get footballs what's confusing is they're smart guys like if you talk to them you'd be like this a reasonable intelligent guy are they really believing in what 100% yeah they're not shitpost dangerous unusual people they go down a YouTube rabbit hole and that's part of the problem is once you believe something it's very difficult to unbeliev it it is and there's so much out there yeah if you tell people to do some research or they end up doing is just looking at more for YouTube videos to confirm what they believe they prefer the ones that confirm it of course but it's just amazing to me that people would decide that all these photos were faked so that they don't believe the world is round but yet they don't have a single photo of this fucking Flat Earth not one got one photo not only that every planet you see is round you can you could follow them you could look at them with if you have a reasonable telescope you could see the difference as they change and spin I mean you can tell that they're round it a lot of flutter Thurs have the same camera that I've got which is a Nikon P 900 flat earthers have an excellent camera they have a brawler with me they have like Nikon has a deal with the Flat Earth Society it's this this camera it's just like it's not like a SLR or anything it's just like a $600 camera but it's got this really really long assumed lens on it like it's like a 2,000 millimeter zoom lens so you can see you can zoom in on the moon you can zoom in on the stars and planets right and you can use this camera I've used it a few times to actually take pictures of Jupiter and of Venus and Rihanna's and you can actually just make out the roundest of the planet and the actual shadow of the Sun like you see you'll see Venus as being like the moving being like an arc and you'll see Jupiter and you see the bands of Jupiter and you can do that with this camera and this is a camera that a lot of them have because they're obsessed with zooming in on things that are on the horizon like ships going beyond the horizon but if they just take the same camera that they have and pointed upward they would actually see things in the in the you see the solar system basically that really can't be explained in the other way like one great thing is the moons of Jupiter if you look at a Jupiter ruler closely even with some binoculars you can see it's got these four little moons that are orbiting it then it looks like just follow the lights in the line with with Jupiter and they actually move around in a regular pattern and they move around they've got orbits of like like some of them I think 80 hours or something so they move around really fast like every day is a completely different these little dots around Jupiter and you can't just see that with this camera taking photos of it posted them on the website or even with binoculars and if you actually watch you from day to day you will see the moons of Jupiter move in exactly the same way that science predicts us that they should move when using Kepler's you know laws of planetary motion linear Newton's using this law of gravitation they will you know that they move exactly as if they are a little simulation of a planetary system so either there's some kind of weird hologram up in that little corner of the sky which moves around or there is actually a planet there with little moons orbiting it hmm probably hologram what what when did you first become aware of this but you run metal bunk for a long time and for those who don't know Mick and I met on the sci-fi show that I did your Rogen questions everything where we we discussed chemtrails or contrails and what causes a jet engine to make what looks like artificial clouds by passing through condensation the heat of the engine produces these contrails and people were absolutely convinced that these are that they're spraying the government is spraying something in the sky and you caught it you you had a really good explanation for it you said they're basically like two training wheels for conspiracy theories because yeah yes it's something you can see yeah I think he's kind of more enticing yes and I think the same thing applies to the Flat Earth now yes when I got into the Flat Earth thing it was I became aware of it a few years ago or so yeah so the government turned up was it your camera yeah yeah sitting out man Jeff McMahan spying yeah so like when I first heard about the Flat Earth theory obviously if I heard it before my actually my father going back when I was young he told me that he was a member of the Flat Earth Society your father told you yeah was he joking around kind of but what he was doing it in a kind of satirical way ironically he was doing it because like he was like saying people are too sure of themselves and so I'm going to join the Flat Earth Society he didn't believe the earth was round so it's been around for quite a while the Flat Earth Society yet the flash theory has been around yeah obviously like thousands of years ago people thought the earth was round and then slightly a few a thousand years ago people figured out that it wasn't here stick it out by the ancient Greeks like three thousand years ago that it wasn't and by the way it wasn't round it wasn't there was a platter oh you fucked it up you gave up the goose youyou said thousands of years ago people thought the earth was round and they realized it wasn't yeah you just right now you gave them fuel that's a quotas going to go yeah but I am a seal quote yeah from the last one yeah that's right that one a slight misquote yeah so so yeah what happened was science basically figured out the shape of the universe and you know in the 1800's there was like gentlemen scientist doing all sorts of all kinds of cool things with stars like measuring the orbits and checking out how far away things were in discovering that there were galaxies and things like that you know there's always science going on but then there was this kind of this guy comes along called Samuel Rowbotham who published under the name of parallax in about 1860 and he started publishing what is basically the same as Eric de Bey's book that has been published now pretty much every single thing that is in Eric de Bey's current book you will find in Samuel Roberson's book from 1860 and in fact if you read debates book which I don't recommend you will see that about 80% of the text at Varick today's book is actually quotes from these books from eighteen hundreds it's not actually this new stuff that he's discovered hmm it's all stuff like you know if somebody walks away from you you will see their feet disappear first and then he has a two-page quote of Samuel Rowbotham saying the exact same thing from the 1860s so it's basically recycling this this theory that started in the 1860s and then just adding a few little sprinkles to it like saying that astronauts must be paid and the space station is fake because that's a delay terrific as well yeah Dube he's hilarious he thinks the dinosaurs are fake nuclear bombs are fake I mean there's the idea that one person would be this mastermind that discovers all these monumental frauds yeah and he but he I don't think he's claiming to have discovered these things there's lots of people who think that nuclear the nukes are fake and dinosaurs being fake is an obvious thing for creationists and people of that that ilk but yeah he's basically recycling theories in a way that is popular to the reader and figuring out how to get them across to people so he right it is these YouTube videos that are very engaging yeah and they sound good yeah then this B sounds if you don't know what's what did they sound like they make sense that's the problem and some of them are quite technical right at least they use a lot of technical terms right but they're they delve into things like there's there's a variety of experiments the michelson-morley experiment that Eddie mentioned is one of them that keeps cropping up remembers which will never been reproduced that's the experiment that no it was actually has been reproduced because it's well the wrong way not the way that they wanted the michelson-morley Mori the michelson-morley experiment was an experiment to detect the luminiferous ether which is the supposed medium through which light travels now back in the 1800s we didn't know that light was made up out of photons because light was was waves so we thought that there was this stuff that permeated all of space called the luminous lumen lumen if Aris ether luminiferous ether it's a little hard to pronounce and that this is what light travel through as waves going through and like didn't know exactly how it works but the the figure there must be this stuff that permeates all of space and then they figure that since the earth was moving and these scientists actually knew at the time that the earth was moving so they were using this as a basis for their experiment this other if the earth is moving then they will be able to detect the ether by doing this experiment so what they did they said it was experiment with a shot like one direction and the other direction then when it came back together it combined and if they were moving through the ether or if the ether was moving through them then the light that went one way would interfere with the with the light that went the other way so that was the whole experiment was just just this thing they shot these two light beams in two directions they figured like you know we turn the table this way it will change because we're now going through the ether in different direction but what happened was nothing was detected which was kind of the start of people realizing oh there is no luminiferous ether right Oba you used that to say that it's because the earth isn't moving that was what the flatter an animal tried to get yeah they did they did but Michelson and Morley knew the earth was moving right they wanted to figure out whether the ether was moving with the earth or whether the earth was moving through the ether right they were trying to detect the ether so people who thought that the earth was the center of the universe not really so much fell flat earthers people who were geo centrists people who thought that the sun went around the earth and the whole all the stars went around the earth there's still people like that Valley where I am yeah the recent resurgence some of the thing was Gavin McInnes sent me something or some guy thinks at the earth is the center of the universe essentially he was saying that it sort of confirms everything in genesis like what yeah well I mean if you need to shoot on the whole universe into you know the descriptions in Genesis then you probably gonna have to take a few a few shortcuts yeah there's these these experiments like the the michelson-morley experiment and but people bring them up and they say that what they detected was no motion right but what it actually detected detected was no luminiferous ether right and because they're detecting no luminaries luminiferous ether they eventually led to like theories about what light actually is which is a wave particle duality you know the lightest photons which act both as a wave and as a particle and eventually to the theory of relativity well you started Medibank when when did you I think it's about five years ago but I've been doing the chemtrail stuff with cantrel science but like over ten years now I just looking at one of my old posts when the old satellite images I've got surprised at how long I've been doing it and yeah and Metta bunk been going about five years and the Flat Earth staff came but maybe two years ago I started to see things about flatter and a bit over a year ago I wrote a post on you know what what should we do about debunking the Flat Earth and basically said like all these people are basically either trolling or they're crazy so there's no point addressing either of them and I think most of them were just trolling because no one could seriously believe this you'd have to be like I don't think you're right I know I've come to realize that I'm not I always yeah and that that post now you know it's gone down the line but it's it's you know I've almost dinner like a 180 from that it's stunning it's really stunning and it's stunning how many people like this is why Jamie made these young Jamie calm you can go and get these flattered chill shirts that somehow or another we're being paid to say that the earth is round like the idea that anybody would actually believe it I've had so many people tweet at me I know where your checks are coming from bro your fucking sellout I'm a sellout like why what are you do you don't think that if I really thought the earth is flat like if someone thought the earth was flat what a revelation that would be what an amazing discovery okay every scientist would be clamoring to expose this every single scientist the idea that all these scientists who make their name off discoveries by the way especially a monumental and provable discovery like the world being flat like somehow another they would hide that and then the big question is why would the government say the world is flat I mean why would they in any way why would they rather hide the fact the world is flat like what what motivation would anybody have to show that the world was round it's been pretty fascinating if we lived on this flat disk and everybody else throughout the universe was in on a planet we'd be like woah this is a what's going on and there's a weird thing that's going on with some of these flat earth people where they're linking this to a sign that we are in some way special that we are the chosen ones and that we you know and some it's it keeps going back to Genesis and that you know that we are the children of God and that creation is true and that evolution is a lie and it gets to some weird anti-jew stuff with a lot of these guys yeah a lot of conspiracy theories though yeah basically boil down to some kind of suspicion of other people and quite often suspicions of Jewish people why'd you as people I suppose the Jews too people can't catch a break I don't know exactly why I think perhaps you know perhaps because of the the whole the Jews killed Jesus Christians don't like the Jews or some Christians don't like the Jews yeah so they're just being viewed as being another and they're often near the Jewish the broader Jewish population is often like a minority with incisors and though it's kind of an easy person to pick on when things go wrong by the way I'm sure those loads of books written on white by Jews are the subject of conspiracy theory doesn't Dube have a recent video about Jews and about Hitler don't know they all go down that road yes um what what can be done if anything other than your website what can be done if anything - like my concern is these young kids that are on the fence my thoughts are look I'm not going to reach out there's some 45 year old crazy person who is making YouTube videos three times a day about the world being flat and ranting and raving and challenging everyone to debate that he's never going to engage in that those guys don't mean anything to me you can't do anything about them but there's some 16 year old kids out there that maybe are in high school and maybe don't have a real formal education in science or astrophysics and they're getting confused and they they're maybe smoke a little too much pot that's you fucker whoever's listening this that's you and you start it's that I've been tricked before and I wrote this big Instagram post recently about rods how about those roswell rod right it god they got me when i was an event i was convinced but it was just i never looked into it i just watched a documentary and this guy had the footage i was like wow these things are flying around we can't see him that's crazy and then a show called mother if you don't if you never saw the Instagram post that I made there was a guy that made this video a documentary I think he made more than one and it showed that there was these things that look like tubes that had jellyfish like wings that were flying through the air supposedly it speeds undetectable to the human eye like they were moving so fast we couldn't see them and so I was convinced man I was and then there was a show called monster quest and what they did is they set up two cameras one camera which was a very fast high-speed camera and the other one which is a standard video camera and the standard video camera caught all these rods flying around and then the exact same images right next to each other with this high-definition high-speed camera showed actual bugs so what those rods were was just a video artifact of these bugs that were moving so close to the screen and so fast that the camera couldn't register correctly and so it created this elongating effect and made it look like through these jellyfish yeah but I think that type of thing that type of video is the type of thing that needs to be done to counteract this type of but I would work though because it is people aren't looking at the Himawari eight if they see those images like I put those images up and do you look at that my Instagram post it's Phil's people angry at me because they think it's fake they think it's fake I don't think I'm a shill because I put that up you know if you can't get people to look at things that's that you know challenge me so how do you get people to look at things but I think like if you start slowly I do it I engage with a lot of like conspiracy theorists online I know when I'm doing it I'm not actually going to reach the vast majority of the people I'm talking directly to but I know there's lots of other people reading what I'm saying who who will and you know just because people are complaining about your posts of the Himawari eight images doesn't mean that there aren't people who actually went to lugdi tough oh I'm sure because I think it got like 50,000 likes or something like that so I'm sure even beside people didn't like it many people there really oh really because because this that was one of the big things that they the flattered of people kept saying that there's no photos of the earth that aren't a composite from space like that's it's just not true and like this this rods bit here these Oh with the two cameras if that hadn't existed you might have taken a bit longer yes - I mean you might still believe in now you might be telling your friends about I reject seeing these crazy rods that are everywhere the guy who made that video showed up at a Q&A that I did once for the UFC I do these q A's where you know people yell out questions like what do you think about this guy fighting that guy that kind of thing and he waited in line to give this right on the line to tell me that I was wrong the rods are' like to like come on you're still buying it you're still he's still selling it the quilt they call him roswell rods just hilarious they're implying that somehow or another they're alien yeah they probably some guy was at Roswell taking pictures trying to get UFOs and some bugs flew by I wasn't even in Roswell that's what's funny they call Roswell Rob the best footage is from Mexico best footage was from a bunch of cave jumpers you know they have that one really enormous cave but it's a it's a hole essentially a gigantic pit and people skydive into it I've never seen that yeah I've seen things like that it's pretty wild it's pretty wild but they filmed they set up a camera to watch them jump off the edge and parachute down and you see the rods flying by that was like the best footage was from Mexico from this one place oh they did nothing to do with Roswell they just called them Roswell rods because they're dorks it probably had to yeah they were looking down the darkness of the pit below and then they had a shaft of sunlight and remember that the bugs are flying through the sunlight with a dark background which everything you don't normally see so it would have been like an unusually good an environment for rods to to show up in exactly exactly and it's in that guy mean waiting in line to get to the front of line to ask me a question and tell me that you know he has the evidence I need to see it it's that kind of thinking it's once someone commits to an idea it's very difficult to shake them off of it and they just look for confirmation bias they just look for someone else to agree with them they find communities they find these flat earth communities which is hilarious the flat one of the best one of the best fucking unintentional hilarious things I read online this dude wrote the Flat Earth Society has members all around the globe whoops did he even realize what he was selling or is that just him fucking trolling I hope it's him trolling yeah and it's the community thing I think is like a key thing yes I just I recently did a debunk of a UFO that the Chilean Navy supposedly saw what was that I'm not aware of that way it was it was like this just think that there was a Chilean Navy helicopter had this infrared camera and they saw this this black to black dots off in the distance that looked like a weird thing like like a figure-eight type things like and then it landed like spraying out this stuff and they couldn't figure what it was and they chased after it but it was too fascinating going away from them and the Chilean government has an official UFO investigation team and they they set them on it and spent two years figuring out what it was and they couldn't figure out what it was and so this area to get its a confirmed unidentified object and then they published their findings and then I and some other people on Medibank looked at it and we figured out it was actually just a plane flying away from the helicopter leaving some contrails behind and we actually figured out exactly which plane it was and so there's got there's got a bit of lay online and there was on like cuttings and posts and things like that and some UFO enthusiasts started talking to me and I joined their groups and I joined a few of the groups and then I found myself in this kind of weird corner of the internet where everybody believes in UFOs unquestioningly and they're always putting up these photographs of things and people are like are great caps dude and it's just something like street light or something but they think they had this this confirmation biases group confirmation bias yeah where they can't disagree with someone and they know they're in a safe space so they can put out whatever theory that they like and they know that people would be like they're just very supportive of them yeah one that happened a couple of days ago some woman put up a picture of a strange light that she said was in the sky and so I downloaded the picture and obviously the brightness and I saw it was actually a reflection of a something in a security light on a porch and you could see it was like those trees behind in terms of security lightness reflection so I posted that and then I started getting called like a shill for pointing this out yeah there's a couple of people at lights at oh yeah it's just it's live but other people were like why don't you believe me why you would like in validating like you know my claim right and so they want to have these kind of little walled gardens where everybody believes the same thing that's a good way to put the walled gardens it really is a good way to put it because that that is what those coming he seemed like and that's one of the things that I found when I did that television show I I still harbored a few conspiracy theory before I did that show but doing that show for several months and constantly interviewing people who believed in outlandish things I found the same thing over and over and over again illogical people with very little evidence believing things in almost a religious way and I found it with Bigfoot and I found it with UFOs and I found it with chemtrails and I found it with it was just one after the other in varying stages of ridiculousness feel like contrails and chemtrails were the most nutty people UFO people seem to be the most reasonable because it's the most reasonable theory out of all of them the idea that we have spaceships why doesn't someone else have spaceships there's hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe hundreds of billions of planets in each galaxy the odds of there being some sort of a life-form out there it's pretty high but there's nothing that's the craziest thing like the more I went into the more I talk to these people the more I went over all their evidence air quotes evidence the more I asked them why they believed things there is nothing there's not a goddamn thing you could put on a scale there's nothing you can weigh there's not a thing that you can measure there's not a thing you can look at a photo and go wow that's compelling there's not one there's just an idea and that idea is that there's something in the sky that flies around that we you know either might catch if you're there the right place the right time or not and that they're from another planet yeah I could look at what they put forward the best evidence is often like snuffing cases from the sixties where there's an eyewitness who said something I do some guy on a road who says he blacked out oh yeah like you know whose car got messed up it's always that from the sixes but that's the other thing that I know too much about psychedelic drugs and I know about endogenous psychedelic drugs the brain producing this chemical called dimethyltryptamine that happens when you're sleeping now they're proven that this stuff is produced in the liver and in the lungs and they believe it's now they've got evidence that it's produced in the pineal gland is a very potent psychedelic drug that your brain produces and your brain produces it during REM sleep so these people they all take naps and during these naps they have these crazy fucking dreams and it's entirely possible that during these dreams what happened is they got some endogenous DMT dump whether they were under stress or whether they just add just a erratic dump of this human neuro chemical that entered into their bloodstream whatever it is it caused it all these fucking UFO abductions all of them like almost exactly happen at night and they happen wise people are sleeping like wouldn't you just assume that you were dreaming why wouldn't you assume you were dreaming yeah I have these I used to have these kind of night terror hallucination things which would kind of like that yeah it was always the same type of thing it was like a giant spider coming down from the ceiling towards me and I would move I was like you know frozen for a second then I went down I would jump out of bed and turned on the light and lo look for the spider but it happened all the time right and you know I knew because there was no spider that it wasn't real but I could see if someone was having a different type of hallucination that seemed a bit more real and then you know it maybe it's a it came in between sleep cycles for them then yeah totally yeah you can see it seemed completely real yeah I had I used to have them all the time and it was always liking it was horrible it was this like giant really realistic spider and he wasn't like you know I was dreaming somewhere else I was in the room and I could see it like I was seeing something crawling across the table right here was his hallucination hmm I don't really get them anymore idea what it was brains fixed itself or whatever but well it's probably a lot has to do it being young and confused and hormones and nerves and and then also like your brain starts fill-in-the-blanks doing a very good understanding of the universe you know your brain your imagination runs wild it was very confusing to me doing that television show and it really changed me a lot and it it changed me the point that people started accusing me of being co-opted by the government the government threatened my family and told me to stop talking about conspiracies like and then the idea that I wouldn't say that if that was the case like you don't think I would fucking tell everybody if someone threatened my family because I was talking about UFOs I'd be telling everybody I'd be like hey man I would tell all my friend to be like dude a fucking threat me because I was talking about UFOs this shit is real hangar 18 carry 50 watts and those are paper a while ago published on like how many people it would take to cover up certain conspiracy theory of and the probability of none of those people ever talking yeah and it's just ridiculous like you can't have tens of millions of people in on a conspiracy well the flatter it's one it's the best one for that yeah I know it's what about those all science every single scientist yeah and everyone who is involved in shipping routes and overseas flights and the fact that you can fly west and land east I mean you you you can you can just land in one spot take off again land another spot and you can eventually get to the same spot that you're at with a bunch of different flights that you can track them on a GPS I mean that's take two GPS everything is everything sway yeah well one thing I want to try to introduce to people who believe in the Flat Earth is this concept the ground truth ground truth is a concept in satellite observations which I kind of touched on before like you take a satellite observation and you see does it match what you see on the ground or if you've got something like a weather prediction model like you predicting the weather you you see does that match what you see on the ground and this is something that you can do if you're actually really interested to looking into the Flat Earth theory is to figure out what the actual ground truth is for something now when we talk very briefly about a program called Stellarium which you might have might have seen it's just basically a solar system simulator it shows what's in the night sky you've probably seen this little these little things on your phone where you hold it up and it shows you what the stars are yeah yeah it's what like that for the pc and you can use use the one on on your phone as well so what i would encourage people to do is figure out is this program actually correct is it actually showing me what we see in the night sky and you can do it really easily you know basically you just look at what's on the screen and then you go outside and you look to see is this what I'm seeing on the screen here so this is basically you checking the ground troops of this program which seems like you know very straightforward thing but then what you can do from that is you can then use the program to look at the sky from other positions now because you verify that it's correct for where you are and you can ask someone else to verify it's correct for where they are and you can check like other photographs that have been taken to see if they match up as well you'll eventually build up near the knowledge that this program is correct this stellarium program all the little program you have in your phone that shows you the stars in the sky so you've got this computer showing you what it expects to see from any position any position anywhere on the world and you by doing ground truth observations have figured out figured out what it actually is here so that's the type of thing you see in stellarium obviously in a much less light polluted environment than you have here deep do you think that a lot of what's going on with these people that are theorized and keep that up that's pretty cool with that with a lot of what's going on with these people theorizing about Flat Earth and there seems to be some desire that people have to expose hidden truths hidden hidden discoveries or things that are somehow or another being kept from everybody and the the what's what's fascinating to me is they're looking into this nonsense they're looking into this thing that's not real when the real space but the actual like what is observable about space is so mind-blowing yeah and somehow or another that is what you absolutely can see every day would you absolutely can observe what you absolutely can read about and learn about and what scientists are discovering on a daily basis is so mind-blowing when you see like denim blue satellites are real when you see how many satellites we actually have that's what's really fucked it's not that there's no satellite a satellite isn't way too many that's not bashing into each other and then will have been well satellite there's thousands of them up there and they have the time like space flights they have the time space lights based on whether or not they're going to hit these satellites or space junk or some of the stuff that's been ejected from various rocket trips I mean it's still floating up there you see the movie gravity yes yeah yeah yeah been in that where the satellite starts bumping into each other and it's this big chain reaction you know eventually all the satellites get to get knocked out did you see that Japanese expects petition that they tried to do the try to capture plane a nice job doing yeah I don't know how well it worked it we like have like big tether they were dragging behind it yeah they were trying to like catch a bunch of space junk with a net right yeah somehow or another yeah it's amazing this stuff is way more interesting then yes yeah that's the real stuff that's really crazy earth idea so it's like this tiny little thing all the earth is glass and we're stuck in this weird prison where people are keeping us here yeah yeah that's the thing too that somehow another by being on a flat planet it gives you a different perspective they don't want you to have that perspective so they tell you the world's round like it doesn't make any sense yeah one thing I've heard is that they think that if they can convince you that the world is flat when it isn't then it's kind of like in 1984 where they get people to believe that two plus two equals five and they've actually indoctrinate people to genuinely believe that even though they know it's not true but they still believe it and it's a way of mind-control so the same thing would happen with the Flat Earth but on a far grander scale you're not just convincing someone that two plus two equals five and war equals peace etc etc you're convincing them that the earth is flat where it's actually around so by doing by twisting their minds around something that's demonstrably false I'm making the thing that it's correct then you're gaining power over their mind in the same way that they did in 1984 right well in the same way that Scientologists do or Mormons do or anybody that creates some sort of an ideology that's provably false I mean look there's not a whole lot of difference between Scientology and Flat Earth theory I mean there really isn't I mean if you really have read l ron Hubbard's work if you read what his actual theories were about the origins of mankind it's pretty fuckin loony and yet there's thousands and thousands of members of Scientology the point where you know they're making documentaries about it and writing books about it and these people are coming out and they escape the church and these harrowing stories mean I had this guy in my podcast couple weeks ago Rodimus kitch David Miscavige's dad is like one the first guys been wasted his life guy lived in the Scientology world for 50 years and it's crazy it's crazy it is it is not much difference between doubt and flatterer theory it really isn't you know Scientology works but it's like gradually sucks you in a bit at a time you know it just sounds all very reasonable at the starts really I'll tell the beginning more and more like the third that you get into it but also the reverse the first original principles of it like when you still we start you know thinking positive and doing positive things there's a lot of benefits to that people start seeing those benefits they started feeling positive and then they get into the Seaton's and you know frozen souls chucked into the volcano now it Wyatt well I think he could argue that there's some good in the Flat Earth not the Flat Earth theory of search but the Flat Earth way of thinking like questioning things hmm and I think this is something that people really like about it is that you don't you don't you don't believe scientists just because scientists say something right it's this thing they called the z-tech method which basically is a Greek word meaning questioning so you've got to question everything you can't believe that gravity exists or the finders go around the Sun just because scientists do it you actually have to observe it for yourself and if you can't observe it for yourself then it isn't real which leads people to think the earth is flat because it kind of appears flat from various positions right and they haven't been into space or they haven't done the various experiments that show that it's not flat so I think yeah you got young people who are exposed to the idea of as a Teta sysm and they think that's great you know I'm rebelling against Authority like young people do and they think like I will not believe I will not believe the scientist I'll do my own research but then they get sucked into people like dabei who feed them all this nonsense was very articulately and very smooth the way talks and makes us well and did videos and a very compelling and because he's not an authority he's not like you know part of the government he's rather the the the alt culture hmm they tend to give his arguments way more weight than mainstream science yeah yeah and then they'll find out something like that New York Times article that was out a couple months backward showed that scientists from the 1950s were paid off by sugar companies to switch the blame to saturated fat and he started attributing all these health problems that were really about sugar and about eating processed sugar sort of tribute him to saturated fat it changed a lot of people's diets and really sucked a lot of people up in terms of like they people start to eat margarine and all these things that are filled with trans fat and very unhealthy for you and they did it because they thought that they were you know following science and so questioning science and questioning scientists you know occasionally you're right occasionally you'll find something like this yeah this conspiracy by the sugar industry is the old saying like trust yet verify yes you know a Reagan popularized that with the salt talks I think yes that's a very good statement trust yep just verify and yeah yeah that's if you want to trust out dabei that's fine but let's check check the things that he says yeah I checked one of his things on the way here on the plane he has the thing that a lot of them say which is that the horizon always rises to eye level so on the plane on the way here I check to see if this is actually correct now most people when they check to see if the horizon rises to eye level they just look out the window and say oh yeah there's the horizon over there eye level the on a rounder the horizon is actually going down a little bit when you look at the window of a plane because you're thirty thousand feet up in the air it actually drops around two or three degrees mm-hmm but it's very hard to see when you're looking at out of the wing of the plane so it's very easy to get taken into believing that it's dated eye level so what I did is I took this little carpenter's level brought a carpenter's the government is level very small one it's only like there's like eight inches long as though and I've taped a small tube to the top which is like a bit of a pen and then I said it level and wedged it so it was level and then I looked through the tube on the top of this level and saw where the horizon was and the horizon was just below the end of the level so the horizon is actually dropped away which meant the debates claim about the horizon rising to a level which is something you'd expect on a flat earth was actually incorrect and it's demonstrably incorrect with this a two dollar level which actually got free from somewhere and anyone can do this you don't even need to being a plane in fact it works better if you just like it a cliff or something like a thousand stayed up well that's another claim that people keep saying that are devotees of this Flat Earth idea that that if you get on a plane and you look up and you look out the window it looks flat but I do not think that people understand perspective and they do not understand how huge the earth is when you see there's images someone did an image that showed how far you are up when you're thirty thousand feet in the air and then how how like huge the earth actually is and you get this like little image of a plane at 30,000 feet and then the dot of the plane is represented in the amount of distance between the earth is in perspective and then you see how enormous the planet is and it's just you're dealing with something that's so big it's all I mean it feels like it's flat it feels like it's flat because it's enormous in your tiny yeah that's that's a huge issue with people is that they don't really understand the scale of the planet and they don't understand how little it actually curves yeah there's there's a road if you look if you look up like the longest roads in America along a straight road in America does this road is in like Oklahoma or somewhere and it's about 80 miles long it's just perfectly straight it actually isn't perfectly straight because when you laid it out it laid it out along a line of latitude so if one of the lines that goes around around the earth so it's actually slightly curved but when you look at it it looks perfectly straight you have to actually like you know take the whole image and then draw a line from one end to the other in Google Earth and you see that it deviates by just this tiny little amount but if you were to drive along this road you're actually driving you know around you're actually turning right slightly the whole time but it looks perfectly straight because it's hardly moving at all though with this 80 miles it moves maybe like 10 feet or something and people just don't don't don't realize just how small the curve of the earth actually is it looks flat and again again I think a real big problem with this theory and with a lot of these theories a lot of these really outlandish Spira see theories is once they hook you it's very difficult to unhook yourself you you don't want to believe that you got taken you don't want to believe you've been had you don't wanna believe been fooled so you keep going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole and you keep finding more and more confirmation bias more people inside that walled garden as you put it and some people actually go out and do scientific experiments and they try reasonably hard some of them but then they make some kind of mistake and then they they say this is actual proof that the earth is flat like those the level experiment that I did someone did something similar with that they said they use like a water level where you have two tubes connected and use the level of the water cause the waters levels the same on both of them and then they hold this up and see if it was below the horizon but they did this experiment and they did it at sea level which meant is all's going to be exactly the same as the horizon you've actually got to go up a thousand feet before you can see anything but they still you know even even though they they thought that they were doing some science but they make this one key mistake and then they won't listen to anybody trying to tell them what the mistake actually was people are a ridiculous amount of people doing Flat Earth experiments on YouTube and just getting it completely wrong I think the most common one is people taking photographs or something that they think shouldn't be visible from a certain position they don't say like here's uh you know Catalina Island and it's like 60 miles away and according to the curvature of the earth that means it should be been up below five miles of curve and so it shouldn't be visible and then there's all these mistakes that they make some of them are like they do the math wrong some of them like they they don't account for the fact that you've got a you know factor in how high the viewer is or some of them will just they'll get entirely the wrong Island slides will say like oh this is his Island which is like 100 miles away and right looking something that's 40 miles away well how come you can look out in the I mean here's a simple one how can you look out across the ocean you're not seeing anything on the other side yeah like what's over there well so far away you can't see it they got an out there they're going out though because the you wouldn't go see anything away because of the atmosphere so they keep on the other seats really get further away the fainter and fainter islands they believe in the atmosphere they do and they use it a lot to to make up for reasons for certain things like like things going below the horizon that's where it gets weird red is that people use some science to try to debunk science or things that they claim a science like the lore of perspective yeah the Laura's perspective isn't doesn't exist there's no law of perspective I mean if you were to make a law of perspective you could say that the size of something decreases additionally proportional to its distance so if it gets twice as far away half the size if it gets more times as far away it's a quarter of the size and that's it that's that's all the perspective is now people talk about vanishing points well that came up during the podcast with Eddie Bravo yeah and Jamie brought it up and and then Eddie started posting pictures on his Instagram of a guy from the early 1900's who was an artist who wrote something about the law perspective in drawing just drawing he was just explaining how you how you define perspective when you're illustrating things that's that's the lower perspective on a piece of paper well on a photograph is nothing at all to do with the real world it's about it what you can what you can see visually what the image is projected onto your eyes or what comes through a camera when you take a picture you know what's the actual perspective of things things just get smaller but it says it sounds good when you say the law perspective it sounds good like you're invoking a loss yeah then they will you've got a real law like the law of universal gravitation or yeah I just again using here's of the ocean I don't have anything against Eric Dubay or any of these people I really don't my real concern is with young people out there that are listening to this that get sucked into stupid shit and there's so much that you could learn there's so much that's fascinating about the universe so it's fascinating about the natural world there's so much to learn and to waste any time the only thing that's good about it is you'll recognize the pitfalls that the human mind can slip into that I've slipped into than many people I know have slipped into again it's not a it's not a like in any way shape or form it's not something to be embarrassed about or sad about it's just it's a normal natural human inclination to try to fight and things that are hidden truths or you know that are covered up mysteries it's natural for whatever reason I think it's very much a part of growing up I think it's just it's different for different people yeah I had a whole bunch of crazy ideas when I was growing up would you know I thought I could bring about world peace by getting a whole bunch of world leaders together and I actually sent letters to a bunch of world leaders and I think it like I shouldn't send a drill to the world leaders because they'd be it will be a bit Ian they wouldn't read my letters so I started to the brothers so I sent a letter to Raul Castro there was now the you know president of Cuba Wow but back then I thought I can I can set up this organization of the relatives of world leaders and bring about world peace now I felt like I was like 13 at a time it's funny that you decided to get a hold of their brothers that's kind of hilarious yeah well I think it's like yeah sneaky backdoor mo yeah yeah and I found this address in Who's Who in the library and I did a back in the day back in the day when you'd look things up in the library hmm yeah I mean that's not even that unreasonable that's like you thinking well world peace seems to make sense that to me this idealistic child yeah and you know you want to try to do something you think you can you think you can make a difference and yes you can rebelling against things yeah I had delusions of solving great mathematical problems when I was young there's like yeah problems like how do you trisect an angle with by the geometrical methods which was proved to be impossible to do and yet I still spent months and months trying to do it when I was a kid because I thought that can't tell me what's impossible and what's not possible it seems like it's possible to me and if you did discover it what a gigantic what it would have been better in your case I would have been I was in motivation really you know it wasn't just like your alpha ISM I wanted to I believed in a bunch of stupid shit and the big one for me that I've clung to longest as Bigfoot what that one man oh it's so hard for you to let that one go because well first of all because it used to be an animal used to be Gigantopithecus but man when my friend Les Stroud actually started doing that show that Bigfoot show have you ever seen that show I think that he did that show with some fucking guy who's just a total hoaxer and the guy put on a Bigfoot mask and they got this high-resolution photo and video of this Bigfoot mask that they're claiming is Bigfoot - staring at them through the woods it is so stupid looking see if you can find Jamie and this guy this is how wacky this guy is the Bigfoot community thinks he's full of shit that's when you know you fucked up when the Bigfoot community is calling shenanigans they like this guy I'm not buying this it's funny you get these like schisms in these communities and they fracture up into sub communities yeah you know the the Scientologists there are people who have subtracted off from the Scientologists watch this this is awesome see these guys in the woods and he sees it he sees it through the trees what is it where is it you can't it's not even moving meanwhile Bigfoot has been running from people from day one right but there's one animal was just standing there and he's like I think you're seeing I think I see it so then towards the end of the video he gets really close I hit the fuck out of here it's Kellyanne a pro from the 1970s like look how clean its hair looks I mean it looks so dumb it's not moving no he gets close-up on it look at that doesn't that wink or something oh yeah right here it is look look how bad this is look how bad this is here's it here's how you know it's fake whenever something looks like a dude in a monkey suit it's a dude in a monkey suit that's all you need to know because your brain knows your brains like hey wait a minute like if you look at a gorilla a gorilla doesn't look like a person in a gorilla suit if you look at a giraffe it does not look like a person in a giraffe suit if you look at Bigfoot and it looks like a dude in a monkey suit it's a fucking dude the monkey suit like your brain starts filling in the blanks and also whether you recognize it or not your brain recognize recognizes geometry facial geometry recognizes a Fibonacci sequence I'll Drive ya and you see that's why people freak out when you see someone fake lips or fake nose upside-down and things like that when people do weird shit to their face like when someone gets plastic surge face and they like radically alter their face it's jarring to us and one of the reasons why it's jarring is because the brain recognizes geometry and human facial recognition there you facial patterns and the structure of the face and when that geometry is off it's confusing to us like why are their cheek so big why is that no so small why are they lips so big like what the fuck is going on like your your body starts you react to it yeah there's an illusion where they put two sets of eyes on people yes and you look at that and you just you brain just as constantly resetting and you don't throw my eyes across to wherever another not like yeah your brain is just so hardwired to recognize faces yes it's just automatically recognizes reason and your face in my face are different but there's a science to you or the structure of your face that's applied to the science my face and that's the golden ratio you mean if you if you look at a person's face you can actually do the math where the chin is where their eyes are it all lines up and your brain recognizes when that's not the case so if you see that and you see like oh it's a person what the fuck's going on because it is a person that's a person that's a dude in a monkey suit it's not even a good one there's so many people that trot out that Patterson footage which is so bad they believe so hard they believe so hard it was the hardest one for me to realize those people are all full of shit because when I was a kid man I don't want a Bigfoot to be real that was that was a tough one tough on let go and plus it was a real animal at one point in time there was really a thing called Gigantopithecus which was an 8 to 10 foot tall a Katanga yeah if it may have been bipedal at least occasionally yeah yeah yeah it's uh you want things to be true like UFOs I don't know if I was going to been to UFOs and all kinds of weird stuff on it when I was younger I think partly like you know me figuring out that a lot of it was just bullshit was part of my motivation for getting into like debunking stuff later but at a certain degree I think that's like no harm in people believing in things like you know little kids believe in Santa Claus etc that type of things rather Christmas Easter Bunny it's just that for some people it kind of goes a bit wrong because it bit so far they don't let it that childís beliefs drop away as they get older or they stay longer or when they you know come of age they go into that kind of a next level of disbelief yeah imaginary things that there wants to be true and a lot of that boils down to what we're talking about earlier the distrust in authority like people you know and distrust of others and the belief that there's some secret cabal of people doing things to them the Illuminati here say I think it's partly this kind of a natural childish wanting to believe in things which we all have yeah we all believed strange things when we were young and I think that aliens in a lot of ways are like a cosmic daddy the idea that there's someone who's really on the ball it's watching us and going to make sure we don't fuck everything up that's why those contact movies are so popular the idea of like aliens coming to helpers or whatever is so so enticing it'd be so amazing yeah meanwhile I think the movie alien is probably more likely what's going to happen come down here fuck us up the the weird thing about the UFO community and the Bigfoot community and all these different communities is that along the line they become people that make a living at it and they become you know air quotes experts and that that becomes a problem because then they have a vested interest in making sure that other people believe they start writing books they start doing lectures they start showing pictures and also here's what's interesting as the number of phones that have cameras have radically increased the number of usable UFO pictures is radically decreased yeah it still makes sense cameras like this one it's got you know eighty-three times zoom on it you don't take pictures of he if there was a UFO you could take a real closer picture but I take pictures of planes all the time that are flying you know five miles away or ten miles away or sometimes even like you know over 100 miles away and you can make out the plane you see the windows yeah depending on the angle that's a claim that the chemtrails put out sometimes with the planes don't have windows which is generally that generally because they using these crappy little cameras and you can't see the windows got the less than one pixel wide right if you got like a good camera and use them in far enough the windows appear kind of like you know things appearing over the horizon when you zoom in right speaking of this the camera this sunny coming up in August which is the eclipse there's going to be a total eclipse of the Sun over North America I think August 21st this year I think that would be a great opportunity for people to encourage anybody who believes in the Flat Earth to actually start looking at the what's going on don't do have an excuse for that though yeah how are you going to justify it by actually look at it I think the challenge is getting people to look at things the excuse well not the excuse the reason we're giving them is that there's an eclipse and everybody wants a look at their clothes it's an amazing thing the moon goes in front of the Sun and blocks it out yeah but I think that you're giving them too much credit I think also want us to do is make a youtube video with some wonky explanation for why an eclipse works and then it works because the earth is a disk and the Sun gets below the disk and it blocks it out from below I mean it just doesn't seem to me that it's it's enough this is a solar eclipse though they understand they can tell if the moon is going in front of the Sun well I know I know what you're saying is logical but no even the flight others believe that the moon goes in front of the Sun for a solar eclipse others yeah because they can you can track the position of the moving through the sky and they know that you know it gets closer to the Sun every every time don't you believe that like the earth sits flat and then everything spins around the earth they know well yeah they you know the earth is flat and the the Sun Sun and Moon are like orbiting above like this but you know sometimes the the moon is going to be below the Sun and it blocks out the light of the Sun and that's how an eclipse happens on the flat earth and on the rounder hmm so it would be an amazing thing to see even if you're a flat earth believer this this very rare coincidence when the the moon is in front of the Sun so usually encourage people who are flat earth believers to look at this amazing thing that's happening they still didn't give a fuck is there is there uniformity in the Flat Earth community and they like or greed or is there like dissension there's some people say you know that it's because they're the ice wall no there's no fucking ice wall just to drop off and this everybody dies there is kind of like you know this mainstream thing where you know the debate model of things it's kind of like in the chemtrail community you know you've got this one guy Dane Wigington who is really popular guy and then you've got like a bunch of other thing which one is he is he the guy that made that uh the videos now that was no Michael J Murphy was yeah dark I was he was a little loony and Whittington is the guy who lives in a big house on 200 acres up in the mountains somewhere and he got obsessed with solar panels being blocked by contrails and so became a Kentrell believer but he's like the equivalent of debate because he's the guy who's really promoting it but then there's other people in the the chemtrail community who are doing their own thing and they say this weekend guys full of crap because it believes in global warming and we don't there's Behar with us this is division between people who believe in global warming and who don't so some people think that chemtrails are trying to stop global warming and other people think that chemtrails are causing global warming and then there's other people who think that chemtrails are something completely different spreading nano robots to control people's minds and things like that so you got the same type of range of things in the Flat Earth believers as well like you some people think that the earth is kind of concave it's not actually flat at all what about the Hollow Earth people so you hadn't the earth is hollow that's that's not even that's not really a flat earth thing that's like a round earth with the hole in the track in a new world in there people live on the inside of the earth which makes apps even less sense than the Flat Earth from a physical point of view well they think there's monsters in there yeah or there's aliens the Rothschilds they think they're lizard people they live under the earth yeah this was always shown a laser a steady making tunnels you've heard that yeah yeah some sounds real yeah well I'm looking into it any any any conspiracy theories going to have a range of plausibility yeah from reasonably plausible to completely implausible like you think of some of the 9/11 conspiracy theories like at one end you've got like the the World Trade Center was destroyed by nuclear bombs that were in the basement nuclear bombs nuclear bombs people think that yeah haven't heard that one is a fringe one but it's you know there's got a few people who believe it then there's people who think a bit bit more plausible they were destroyed by energy weapons from space like there was these beams of energy like high-powered microwaves or something that blew the buildings up and then there's you know you get more and more plausible those pre planted explosives or some guys ran in there on the day with some explosives to blow building seven and then you've got just they let Building seven burn when they didn't have to and then when they got they knew it was going to happen but they did nothing about it and then they had some warnings about it and they didn't do anything about it so you've got this whole range of plausibility hmm for the conspirators with the flat earth it's pretty much all of this end because like the Flat Earth theory is either the earth is flat or it's round so with the flat of you you've only got a very extreme and then more extreme there is some of them the most extreme thing which with all conspiracy theories end up with is the everything is an illusion we are living in the matrix conspiracy theory like well that theory is very compelling that that theory is very bizarre because one day if technology continues the way it has been there will come a time where they're able to create an artificial reality that's indiscernible from this reality as long as we don't blow ourselves up and technology continues to advance innovation continues to advance the rate it is now which is exponential right it's entirely possible that 100 years from now or whatever it is there will be some way they can interface with your somehow with your brain and create some sort of an artificial experience right that's not outside the realm of biology theory is that they're doing it now and it's detectable that these things that we are seeing are kind of artifacts or that's why not living living in the matrix you might further the the Mandela effect yes that's you know that's people who believe that this kind of glitches in the matrix Berenstein bears yeah Berenstein bears are actually called the bear sign bears yeah in an altered timeline or there was this movie called Shazam done by work I remember that night guys know now people say sindbad sindbad zzzz yeah but Jack was in Kazan yeah mixed em yeah yeah exactly they completely believe that this actually happened yeah and this will the memories but that is yes but they believe it so that's right something that's at the end of all all these conspiracy theories that's not a very reasonable one but there's some really reasonable scientists that believe that there's going to come a time where the Elan musk yes just leaves it yeah yeah I not really convinced myself because it's kind of a simplistic argument saying that technology will always advance and get better there are there are fundamental limits on information theory like how much information that we can press us have you ever messed around with HTC vive or any of the more recent state-of-the-art now they're mind-blowing yeah mind-blowing and this is one of the reasons why I subscribe to it I mean not today but I mean I think one day in the future where there's a hundred years or whatever it is technology I mean just got to thank 150 years ago they were using teletypes today did digit that was the only way to get a message across you know and then what can we do today we can take a film and send it to someone in Australia they get it in real time I think it's it's very reasonable to assume that if you put on the HTC vive they have this one underwater experience it's amazing Jamie see if you could find it because I know it's in video form but I think it's really bulleted on there's going to be extremely realistic things I mean I think that you are at there yes but I don't think it's realistic that you would be able to not detect that and the scientists wouldn't be able to detect that that we are all living in a simulation it is the simulation just just you is it just your head let's see this right here listen this is you put this thing on I mean again yeah we're in 2017 and this is all and it's fairly fairly adolescent stage and man when you're when you're in this thing and you're looking around it's not necessarily high-definition it's it's it's very clear and you know that it's not real but God gives you this feeling that it's real then a whale pulls up and all these fish swim by it's it's amazing and it more than anything it gives you a window into the future it gives you a window when you sit next to this whale and it makes noises and the noises are all 3d it gives you a window when you start thinking about pong remember pong the game that you'd play was like I can't believe I'm controlling something on the television group then you compare that to like Halo and the games you can play right now on an Xbox you like my god like the improvements are radical and I think that the improvements in this sort of artificial reality this virtual reality that you're seeing in this current HTC vive a hundred years from now I would only imagine that we could get to a point where it's indiscernible that somebody I just agree next you really miss Greg that's why look at that whale them that whale is you know a living thing is made up of cells mm-hmm you could take one cell from that whale and you could put it under a microscope and you could dissect it and you can look at the cell having yesterday okay maybe we're having a different argument here I'm thinking that it's going to feel real yeah you're saying I anticipated you won't be able you will be able to I don't believe that they could make something that you could not detect not let actually say and cripple the cripple your intelligence so they put you away from it they'll be able to make something that's indiscernible like while you're experiencing it it's a you a scientist could come along and check it it's a bit of a philosophical question there because like you know what we have now is our observable universe with the laws of physics I don't think within this universe you can make something that simulates the universe that's the same right because there's just too much information in the universe to be simulated by something that is within the universe or even something like as small as like the earth I don't think you could simulate the entire earth in our physical universe you're not now Paul you don't think you could do it a thousand years from now the only things I think there are there are fundamental limits as to how much information will be required you can get something that's a imitation of that but it will be detected ly different seems like each each simulation is going to be lower fidelity than the universe that created it right so you can only create something that's less complex than the universe you are currently in is that true though I mean as time moves on five thousand years from now whatever it is I mean how could anyone possibly discern or how could you even guess an estimate how far it would advance you go back 5,000 years ago people were modern humans you know I mean the people that built the pyramids over modern humans right they looked like us maybe a little smaller they didn't get as much to eat they look just like us you went 5000 years in the future it's not it's unreasonable if we don't blow ourselves up that you would that we would have some sort of quantum computing some astronomically powerful devices that could render and create an artificial reality that felt to you entirely real I don't think that's outside the real building but could you then create within that universe the same quantum computers yeah emulating yourself so I think you could I think that would that's kind of a paradox really it has as powerful as the thing that is simulating it I don't think so I think artificial intelligence is going to lead us to well if you can create something that's artificially intelligent right which we feel like is going to happen way quicker than 5,000 years from now if you create something that's artificially intelligent it's going to improve upon its design almost instantaneously it's going to realize like if you give it autonomy yeah we don't know what's going to happen right quantum computers we don't know how well they're going to work they could break like to be a dud cause well today or it'll be fucking amazing could be fucking amazing yeah who knows yeah it's it's something to think about but when when scientists start thinking that we are currently living in some sort of a computer simulation I don't discard it I give it a pause I mean I don't I don't subscribe or not subscribe to something as ridiculous as that because it seems to me within the realm of future possibility yeah it's kind of like here's a thought experiment because like if we are in a simulation we we're not going to figure it out right when we're not going to have to do anything about it if we do figure it out right right right yeah it's odd experiment I mean the scientists are looking at the laws of physics if they keep drilling down power on far enough maybe eventually they'll discover like there's some kind of artificial substrate of the universe which is your ones and zeros and that we are actually living in some kind of simulation and but that's just basically as resolving the laws of physics more yeah if we get down that deep what can we we can't do anything about it well not only that does that actually mean that we are living in some sort of an artificial realm or does it mean that that's what the universe is made of it's not artificial but that the universe much like what we're creating like that the universe is almost fractal and much like what we're creating when we're creating these artificial environments that the universe itself is made out of ones and zeros and that this whole thing is really mathematical yeah and that just because we haven't been able to detect it up until now doesn't mean it hasn't been running on some sort of uh some sort of a uber complicated mathematical principle yeah I think it's kind of a moot point in a way because like what's important is what are the laws of physics and you know can we can we detect what's actually running the laws of physics yeah so yeah it's it's a philosophical question a little bit of metal masturbating yeah it seems to me that that's a thing that people do and I think we could bring it back to this Flat Earth thing is that people love to go down these honey holes of information and of debate and ideas and whether it's Bigfoot or UFOs we love to chase ourselves chase our own tail when it comes to these bizarre subjects that that may or may not be real and most likely aren't real we love to chase and become like engrossed me things and I wonder why we're doing I wonder if we're distracting ourselves you know I mean it doesn't seem to be people that are fully happy with their their life that really get into this kind of stuff that really go all in and balls-deep you don't you don't get a guy who has like a promising career he's at the top of his field happy family great friends great hobbies loves is light and then it just becomes a UFO nut doesn't seem to be the case you still you got these pool players who please I'm not doing so it's hard out there for a pool player right none of the guys at the top of the game is there's a thing I think those guys just watched too many fucking YouTube videos and they don't have any science most pool players one of the things about what's that common expression about pool players if someone plays pool really well two glorious results of a misspent youth because it takes a long time to learn how to play pool really well and you're not going to be doing that while you're you know got your nose buried in physics books I think like people like like this like they get things out of them they're getting something out of it is giving them purpose in their life it's like you know it's kind of like a hobby in a way like you're just doing something because you enjoy doing it like playing chess yeah except along with that hobby of doing stuff they actually have a belief there's required for them to actually do their hobby and they don't obviously think of it like that but they're essentially what it is they have this activity they like doing like gardening or whatever mm-hmm pretty requires them to believe that the earth is flat so they spend all the time like making YouTube videos about how the earth is flat or doing their experiments about how the earth is flat and they're getting something out of it because it's their little hobby yeah I do the same thing except I'm actually doing it for science like I do these fun little experiments like on the plane today I was on the plane like wedged up against the window looking through this holding my camera up against it and the woman next to him so that I was this crazy guy you should told I think I learned that the earth isn't flat ma'am she probably thought that I was thinking the earth was flat I've seen other people on YouTube they're bringing levels on the plane and they're like hey look the level isn't moving well if you work all day and you have an eight-hour day plus commute plus family plus whatever bills and issues that you have to deal with and then you get into one of these YouTube videos you simply problem you simply don't have the time to really explore all of the possibilities and all the science behind all the arguments and it's just yeah I think what happens is either they you know they get this superficial understanding of the conspiracy theory yeah or the actual real-life suffers mm-hmm a lot of people get sucked into consideration if there is like like chemtrails or 9/11 truth and they become socially isolated yeah so and they become they they get divorced and they lose custody of their children happens all the time yeah and this this isn't like you know it's not like the government punishing them or anything like that it's just because they become obsessed with something that is outside of societal norms and they feel a dis overwhelming compelling need to tell other people about it yeah and they they say talk about oh yeah people roll their eyes when I spring up objective controls or the Flat Earth and of course they do it yeah but from their point of view they're trying to wake up other people they're doing they're doing like the Lord's work by giving the truth to people but then there's some theories that are really compelling like when you look into Operation Northwoods and you find out that the government really was planning false flag attacks it didn't work that's exaggerated I know it's not at the college exaggeration well there it was a discussion document of course designed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff yeah it's it was rejected by anything like any yeah it was designed by the different she didn't get very far it was just one document right they signed it they got it they didn't sign you that they wanted to do it but it was an idea the idea that you were going to attack American civilians that you were going to armed Cuban friendlies an attack Guantanamo Bay you're going to blow up a drone airliner these were all proposed things they were proposed things yeah but it was just like you know white but you can notice them I understand what you're saying but spitballing that you're going to deceive the American people and kill American civilians and this is a normal part of the way Nero burnt Rome Hitler bone burned the Reichstag that false flag attacks are real and they have happened throughout history so when you do have an open mind and you are compelled to try to seek the truth you got to be aware that these things have happened in history they are real and if you dismiss everything you'll be thought of as a shill as much as I mean as much as people who look for conspiracies and everything they're also people who try to dismiss everything and you have to be very careful because there are a lot of things that people do conspire to do like one of the things that I brought up a forum people hate when I talk about this but I'm gonna do it again people say I don't believe in conspiracy conspiracies all right so you don't believe in any conspiracy no okay do you believe in 9/11 happened do you believe that people flew planes into jet the blue jet planes in the building's well then you believe in conspiracies because someone conspire to do that and they did it they pulled it off a bunch of people got together decide they're going to attack they flew a plane into the Pentagon they flew two planes into the World Trade Center towers I mean that really happened so that's a conspiracy and they pulled it off so when you deep bomb all these things that are absolutely false like Flat Earth and chemtrails and UFOs and all that jazz you got to be careful and not try to debunk everything because now people you know anything I just think like I personally just feel the Northwoods thing is a bit overblown I don't think it is at all what it was I think it speaks volumes about what the mindset of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were is war it's one example and it could one know yeah but it didn't come up with any others what about what got us in the Vietnam go for Tonkin yeah how's the false flag well that's debatable too because that was just basically they thought that they were being attacked nothing available yeah I think that's pretty much been agreed upon the Louis's like it was a series of events led there was the that didn't have to over two nights the there was reports of the boats being fired upon and it turns out it probably wasn't anything there right so it's debatable is did they think there was something there and it was once a living soul did they completely invented out of thin air right now I probably used it as a pretext to to University of the enamel but they just took advantage of it laying the same way the Bush took advantage of the 9/11 right to push his agenda you know is that a conspiracy is hard to say like what knowledge did Bush have of the 9/11 attacks beforehand we know he took advantage of it right and we know that you know the the American administration back then took advantage of the Gulf of Tonkin report we don't know for sure whether the Gulf of Tonkin reports were fabricated or how much they were fabricated or what actually happened on that night and but we do know that they were taking advantage of yeah well my whole point is that you have to be careful when you're a person who debunks things that are legitimately ridiculous you have to take into consideration the possibility that people do conspire do things okay totally they do and that's happened within pretty high levels of government with Enron you mean this is then there's been a ton of conspiracies that turned out to be and there's what the album's fear and iran-contra show handle yes I probably went to all the way to the top oh yeah Reagan probably knew oh yeah that that was where it was hilarious when it was when Reagan was showing the first signs of Alzheimer's when he didn't remember didn't remember anything people like always lying then turns out no he's actually memories really eroding I mean he was an older man I mean he's in his late 70s at the time wasn't he yeah yeah he was a crumb sage I think Jesus Christ trumpet there was a fucking hilarious article about Trump today that he doesn't believe in exercise because he believes that the body has a finite amount of energy in it and then when you exercise you use up that energy hmm and that's why it's so much energy because he doesn't exercise I heard you have strange diets like he has he steaks well-done he likes to eat lunch meat straight out the fridge look it's not a hint of that I'm sure he's a very nice guy are you never met the guy yeah he doesn't look healthy but he got a lot of energy man kind of amazing how much energy he has Alex Jones yeah yeah well okay it kind of looks reasonably healthy I guess he's not healthy no no Alex has looked at healthy he's overweight right and he's a he's younger than me like I always used to freak out that he's younger than male that's how you're younger than me like he just goes hard Alex goes hard all the time you know now takes a toll well it's also I mean constantly worrying that the government's after you and that there's you know every fucking turn that you take has the conspiracy behind it's the mind and it can only take so much pressure yeah yeah who should we talk about small flat-out so sure well to you out there you got notes I do I read everything I could think of I'm a flat earth which is a shit load of stuff the International Space Station oh that's a good one yeah I think did that footage is fake too think it's all fake yeah but what you can do is you can go back to the Skylab footage and ask someone who believes in flatus how they faked the Skylab footage because there's footage of Skylab words people like you know they're running around and running around in circles in zero-gravity those long sequences of people doing certain zero-gravity and it's in a space there's actually too big to fit in any plane that's ever been built so it couldn't be still filmed in a thing you know where they do the farm it corroborated the Vomit Comet yeah it has to be something that was actually zero yeah yeah four people don't know what that is when when you see scenes in movies where someone was moving in zero gravity they would film that in a plane that would literally be they would get the plane up to like forty thousand feet or whatever and then they would just literally shoot down so that you're kind of going faster down than gravity and you could float around and this there is a narrow gravity here yeah run around in circles you do all kinds of stuff like that you get three of them running and this is the space that they're in there is so big that it wouldn't fit in like probably would even fit in the Beluga thing that they use for transporting planes but that's us back to area 51 because there's some giant airplanes that they make at area 51 they used to simulate zero graph yeah I mean it's obvious that this is in space yeah and this is like from the 70s yeah pretty amazing by the space station the International Space Station it flies over at regular intervals and this is like one of the ground truth things that I was talking about earlier you can see it you can look up when it's going to fly over you can get them to send you alerts there's a cycle spot the station as a NASA site but you don't have to trust it but you can still sign up and it will tell you when the space station is going to fly over to the second they'll tell you to the second when it's going to appear and now a will be and how long it live is a little four and you can get to send you an email and get your camera out and take photographs of it when it when it happens so you know that this website is correct and you've proven it on the ground and you can also like do it from different positions and get to people doing it and you can figure out how how high the space station is by triangulating a see yeah what's this angle what's the angle very how far apart they are and you can figure out that the space station is actually 250 miles high it is actually always being the earth at two hundred and fifty miles and you can also take photographs of the space station with this camera and you can zoom in close enough on the space station to actually see the shape of the space station and the solar panels and the main modules and everything so you can see that actually is something that is moving along the same NASA says is moving along and at the same speed as they suggest and it's at the right height and it's the right size because you can do the calculations on the camera figure out you know what the size of the space station is so we know that something they're the exact same size and shape and speed of the space station is exactly where NASA says it is and there's really no way you could fake that on a flat earth because you have to have this bizarre you know a thousand foot wide floating thing moving along like 14,000 miles an hour doing this kind of wizzy pattern all around this spirograph pattern around the Flat Earth it's just it's literally impossible whereas if you'd look at it from the globe model point of view it's just a space station obviously it's orbiting the globe but does this bother you sometimes you're even debunking the stuff do you it does it does I said let's catch myself and go fuck am i doing yeah it's obvious like yeah one of the most stupidly obvious proofs that were not on the Flat Earth is that if you get three people yes then one of them at the bottom of South Africa one of them at the bottom of South America one of them in Australia and have them all look South from that position now on the Flat Earth you got one person here one person here one person here and if you look south like away from the North Pole they're all looking in completely different directions but in the real world what do they actually see they all see the exact same constellation the Southern Cross right in front of them so they're all looking in different directions on the Flat Earth but on the round earth they're all just looking towards the Southern Cross so I assume what you're saying it's literally impossible to do that on the Flat Earth right and you can actually see this and take photographs installations and compare yeah and that's something I was talking about with the ground truth thing with stellarium like you can you could go virtually yourself to these places and see what the sky looks from that position so either stellarium is lying or these near the Southern Cross does actually appear from these three different positions well that's another thing that these flat earth people keep bringing up is Polaris the idea that this one our exploits a great one and that all these other stars rotate around it and that this is somehow another proof that the Earth's not spinning would that we're on a flat earth what's so stupid about that is that people in Australia have a completely different constellations back in the stars rotate the the other direction around and the stars are all coming towards us from the east so if you look north the going that way it looks out for the going that way so the rotating around the North Star which actually isn't anything special it's just the stuff that happens to be closest to the point the North point and it changes all the time if you zoom in you can actually see there are stars that are even closer if you take a time-lapse of a North Star it actually makes a little circle well and also that North Stars not the same North Star as in the past yeah because the axis of the earth so there's a single precession where the every 26,000 years and wobbles yeah was away yeah the air the south to South everyone's looking at the same thing in the south and the stars are rotating in that direction but yet Polaris Plus is a good one for a number of reasons one is not really fixed it's a it's a you know one degree off from the center of the celestial sphere but if you look at a time-lapse photograph of the earth they point the camera up like say from North America what you get is the illusion that all these stars are spinning around that one star is fixed but it's because you're looking at a time-lapse of only a few hours where it's dark out at night whereas this precession of the equinoxes is a very slow process that takes 26,000 years and you're just not going to get a 26,000 years of time lapse photo there you could simulate it yeah it could simulate valerio and you know it's going to believe that what's interesting is that some cultures it's been pretty much observed that some cultures were aware of the precession of the equinoxes thousands of years ago somehow that they kind of knew you know quite impressive well a lot of old cultures did actually take records of the stars because stars we use for navigation yeah the pole star you know this Lee is is something that gives you this fixed North degree but the other stars as well like if you know you know what how long it takes to go from one place to another you don't really understand the exact maths but you can use it for navigation go celestial navigation what are the ridiculous things can we point out before we wrap this up my head starting to hurt I had food poisoning yesterday folks I know what happened I hate talked about it a greasy diner well Polaris's and a good thing because you can actually look at the angle of Polaris was out of banging to hear banging I heard banging yeah I'll go check oh it's next door he is putting something on the walls act like they shut down the stream twice on us already oh really yeah it's flat earth I'm recording hold things we got damnit um what are the things ridiculous the similar pleasures is wonder why they satisfy arisen sucked off into space well how about the one where that's a good one but it's a good one because like I've winded up myself I know now why why that is I know why it's such a in space why you're sucking today because you think you think that a vacuum sucks things right it's going to like suck everything it sucks everything away so if this is atmosphere on the earth the the vacuum of space will suck it away but the thing is like vacuum doesn't actually suck vacuum is nothing it has no energy it doesn't know anything there's no power the reason that things flow into vacuum is air pressure and air pressure is a function of gravity so gravity is pulling everything down towards the earth so there's no there's no nothing that can push it out hmmm if you say that see what I'm saying okay if you imagine like if the universe was suddenly filled with loads and loads of gas like oxygen sigh then you stick a big planet in all the gas we kind of like gravity would bring it down towards this planet well they don't believe in gravity yeah they don't gravity electromagnetic this is my favorite new one did you see the front one where they show that if the earth was a globe but all the water be on the bottom yeah I wonder wonderful I think that was a joke you think it's a joke how can I be so sure about the other ones as well but no no bring it up Jamie this one's wonderful I think they're being serious yeah the gravity thing though it's kind of like almost irrelevant because yeah you know we know that things fall down right but it's electromagnetic something-or-other well it's a magical force that's making things fall down it doesn't really matter you know gravity we could say we don't really understand what guy how do you explain lava lava is a part of gravity too right lava well it's the idea that all these rocks are pushing down there's exception and heat buoyancy buoyancy and density you can see in density there are functions of gravity learn if you stick something in the water is and all the water is flowing to the bottom this we're looking at this image folks it says gravity is not strong enough to stop a small stream from flowing to its lowest point then what is stopping the oceans north of the Equator from emptying into the ocean south of the Equator this is what the earth would look like if we lived on a globe gravity is pseudoscience dot dot dot a theory that can't be proven they forgot the apostrophe and can't you fucking dumb too that must be pretty well you look at that image though it's hilarious why is there water on the top at all how about that you stupid fuck it's raining relatives it rains on top only rise from the bottom and comes around oh I would be kind of cool if half the planet was dirt and half the planet was water colored why would that be any weirder than what it is now you know the reason they don't like gravity is that if you actually apply the laws of gravity to a flat earth the flood would actually scrunch up into a ball oh oh yeah right of all that rock here is no way you can it can lay flat like yeah it would it would it would either be like gravity would be intensely large because you've got any phenomenon to rock underneath you or it's like something on the back of a turtle or something anyway scrunch up into a ball what do they think lavas molten rocks I mean they just think it's buoyant because it heats up and becomes less dense than the other rock but why is it why is it down there in the bottom why is a core the fires of hell are heating it up fires of hell look at this what is this tennis ball you know why doesn't water fly off the earth and then because the the forces spinning says this is this is a fundamental misunderstanding a single habit they miss them they misinterpret angular velocity and linear velocity like we know the earth is spinning around a thousand miles an hour great so they think like if this ball was spinning around at a thousand miles an hour then the water would would fly off right but it's not flying off because of the surface of the ball going a thousand miles an hour it's flying off because it's rotating like 50 times a second or whatever ten times a second it's the angular velocity which creates the outward force linear plus is something to do with it it's only when you're actually turning you know when you're driving in a car like you'd be driving really really fast you don't really feel any forces act on you but when you go into corner right you get slammed over to one side so it's the the rate of your angular velocity now the Earth rotates once once every 24 hours so it's going really really really slow put that back up please and if you imagine that taste ball and if you take it and stick in a little turntable the rotates once every 24 hours the water is not going to fly off right and it's the exact same force we're acting on the earth because the Earth rotates once every 24 hours fact that it's like you're going a thousand miles an hour it's completely irrelevant because it's essentially going in straight lines around the edge Jamie go to that photo in the upper left hand side scroll up I'll be here Satan's globe earth lies this bottom picture here is a great example of how ridiculous things are its hold on Satan's globe earth lied the Big Bang and evolution explained life you were an accident we evolved from primordial soup we are specks in the universe some people are more valuable than others foundation for the new world order you are worthless next image God's Flat Earth creation is the only explanation we are incredibly valuable the bible is 100% true we live on an unmoving firm foundation you were created by God in all caps God loves you oh that will that seems better that's better probably a true believer though oh yeah you think that image there is a is a good example of like things that are completely ridiculous on the Flat Earth like you see they have the Sun on one side and illuminating home here you know and the way the way it's curved like that the thing that runs we're closer to right yeah they think the FX the Sun act like a spotlight look at that it's not acting like a spotlight is illuminating all of the ice wall what is that well it's the white suffer sighs well yeah oh yeah which is actually it's just a Antarctica stretched into this projection why doesn't one of those dickheads getting a boat and take a photo that war that's another thing like they think they've got guards all the way around it oh there are guards yeah yeah that's what is that that's there's like 36,000 miles of cards of guards in the ocean and with on a freezing ice wall it's like you know the war drama was it Game of Thrones it's what 36,000 miles well they they make up facts and then they use those facts to kind of state their point like you can't it's illegal to fly over Antarctica yeah that's that's kind of based on like half well a quarter truth like you have to have you can't fly two engine jet over Antarctica because if one engine fails you wouldn't be able to get to an airport so they only allow for engine jets by seven four seven three eight is to fly so all those those flights that you see they go over at the Antarctic ice they're all 747s yeah because if it fuck's up you're doomed yeah yeah it's a long way with nothing but regulations called ETOPS which is all about how far you can go away from an airport and what configuration are playing that you have to do see now I wonder how many people are listening to this and it's turning their mind do you think it's possible do you think there's there's got to be a spectrum of people that believe there is there's a spectrum and some people will will be turned this will cause a lot of ruffled feathers are you ready for the shield tweets are you ready will you wear a round earth shell shirt if we get you one James calm no I actually don't like it's very common I know it's all it's all in good humor but soft you know lady joking around but I think it seriously oh yeah I had a write a t-shirt that said I make stuff up that my wife got me because like I'm always making stupid jokes right and someone saw a photograph of me online wearing this t-shirt that said I make stuff up that's my quest I'm missing I'm completely serious yeah but they're stupid um yeah but it's more Lima harder to reach people if if you know that the pointing the bend is a distraction right something like that yeah I guess I guess I hear what you're saying I'm pretty easy to dismiss they always say that you work for the government that's the big one you're a government employee you made video games yeah a retired video game programmer I helped make the Tony Hawk series of video games and made enough money to retire on and now I just putter around the house do gardening and do debunking stuff do funny experiments in the box you live in a goddamn American dream so you're doing you made enough money to not have to slave away and these assholes want to think that you're some government chill like the government's involved in the Tony Hawk video games they recruited you they said listen I know you're doing a good job making these video games we've got a better place for you which I need to do is cover up the Flat Earth and chemtrails and UFOs and what else what else you cover up well gallons more Gelinas disease is a fascinating one it's one of the ones that we interested that we in investigated on that show and do you know that one of the guys we interviewed was a doctor and what he thinks is that everyone who has more Jones also has Lyme disease and Lyme disease has a neurotoxicity effect and he was talking himself about his own hallucinations that he sees things like crawling across his eyes that he knows aren't there he was a very rational guy and he was also saying that Lyme disease when you get it from ticks that you're not just getting this one disease but you're getting a host of pathogens and sometimes these pathogens will interact with each other in very different ways and that you know some are more extreme some are less extreme but he's like you might be dealing with hundreds of different pathogens that are undiscovered or are undefined and he thinks that what's going on with a lot of these people that have more gel ins is Lyme disease and whatever these other diseases are that's causing them to hallucinate and think that fibers are growing out of their skin but really what it is is they're scratching themselves and then they get like carpet fibers or clothing fibers on their skin and then they think it's coming out of there he was very reasonable and you made a ton of sense because we went to this more gel and Convention and we talked to all these people that had it and they fucking all have Lyme disease they all have it well they all they all get tested positive for it yeah that's a bit of controversy about that because the tests that you can do you can basically keep doing it and it's a kind of a very inexact test for Lyme disease India gives a lot of false positives there's a bunch of different tests but there's so many people in Lyme disease which is where it's interesting that Lyme diseases it's I know a lot of people that have gotten it from ticks and it's a real thing it's a real thing devastating there's a lot of controversy well it's one of those things that the medical community has a mainstream opinion about whether there's this long term effects from Lyme disease and then there's people who think that there is these long term effects so there's some dispute there is some but let me clarify from people that I know that have gotten it one of the things about the medical community is the ignorance of the Lyme disease and that you go to a lot of different doctors and they they poopoo it they say oh there's nothing you know worry about my friend's son got it and he developed Bell's palsy Bell's palsy his face went numb and that was when they took it seriously and they finally gave him this intense round of intravenous antibiotics but my friend was on antibiotics for months I mean he was devastated and we had a guy in here that had it for three years and he had it for a full year where he was undying Steven Kotler in a full year where he was undiagnosed his body just was ravaged by this stuff I used to do write a lot about Morgellons which is you know related to Lyme disease and when the reasons I stopped doing it was the it's such a personal thing for the people involved yeah and I just really wasn't comfortable like condom liars not that but just trying to trying to figure out what's really going on and raising possibilities that it might not be like these bugs living under their skin yeah because they just get very upset and you really you weren't reaching a lot of them so eventually I stopped that and I moved on to chemtrails which I thought would be more reasonable people involved but it's another one where some people or initially invested in that idea and then once they become initially invested it's so hard to shake them off it's so hard they just are absolutely convinced with the government's praying thing so yeah I have conversation with a friend of mine I was like that has got to be the most ineffective use of money ever like they're spraying things and what the fuck has changed nothing nothing's changed they're spending all this money spraying things in the sky that just happened to look like clouds but yet we know that you can make clouds with a jet engine a certain amount of condensation in the atmosphere the heat of the jet engine causes clouds like we know that but they don't think that's what it is manners is established science itself sounds more like you the flood earth is establishment of flatness of the earth is established science that's been going on for a real long time and people just pick and choose which science they want to to use what keeps you going with all this stuff with running metal bunk well I enjoy like doing these little little experiments I do a lot of stuff like and going to my backyard and testing things out like a lot of the stuff near the pictures of UFOs and things like that and you can you duplicate them because some of them are like right like reflections or things in the camera and you can go out and say well this did this or people are saying that you know certain photograph is indication that it's false or these shadows go this way and the moon lining had lots of fake shadow claims made about it what do you think happened at Roswell Roswell New Mexico the one that's the big one why 1947 a UFO crash I think it's what what I said it was it was a that those balloons that they were using to detect Russian nuclear bombs in the atmosphere and it was a secret program so they weren't allowed to tell anybody about it so they came in they picked up the remains of the balloon and then the story just took off that's a funny one though boy that's that's made a whole town famous for UFOs if you go there now they have like alien themed gift shops they're milking it it's like I said earlier like people make money out of something and then they get stuck into that because they're making money out of it they're motivated you know to you know promote whatever it is a Bigfoot or if it's aliens have you ever seen anything in all of your years of trying to debunk these things that made you question whether or not this was a legitimate phenomena the chemtrails anything anything anything UFO camera thing is like with with UFOs there's all things that you cannot explain there are things that are right inside but there are there's usually plausible explanations for them right I like to like whenever I'm given something like a mysterious thing I like to list all the explanations that I can think of and maybe none of them are perfect fix the fits that you can guarantee this is what the explanation is but like it being like a ghost or an alien spacecraft as an explanation is usually pretty close to the bottom like you start out saying oh it's a balloon is a bird or it's a drone or it's CGI or it's you know it's something something somebody fakes afterwards right or it's an alien spacecraft nor in between that like oh it's something else that we don't know what it is is there any evidence like in terms of UFOs that's interesting I have you know to be on assignment but it looked into the the whole sphere of UFO ology I know a lot of people have but just looking at the quality of the the best cases they put forward like I mentioned earlier like you know some guy in 1964 like got his car beat up on a road right these are like the you know top ten best cases and this was like number two or something what about Bob Lazar you were looking at that guy and I which was he was are the guys supposedly know supposedly worked at area 51 became a whistleblower and now I haven't but a lot of that is something you see in the 911 Community is and in the chemtrail community is people kind of becoming celebrities yeah and then they kind of start going on road shows and you know they they go to conventions and they speak and then they write books and then they start doing things and they they get sucked into their beliefs and there's been lots of examples in the past of people who made claims like this and then eventually you owned up to it in a classic one really classic one is the Cottingley fairies where these girls in Cottingley England sound I went to school in bit still world famous thing take these photographs of fairies and they convinced a large number of people including like Arthur Conan Doyle really yeah I wrote Tarzan yeah he believed in the fairies I well know the guy who wrote short combs did Arthur Conan Doyle right tie another William Burroughs no what no no I am someone else anyway but they look at that they stuck today they something takes us today because I'm out of a magazine or something and then they owned up like basically on their deathbeds like 70 years later but they were they were milking it because once they get into it it's embarrassing to admit that you made something up plus you're getting all this attention right and he in some cases getting money I don't know if they get any money I wonder how many people were so duped by that they changed their life and they started looking for fairies wasting their time when I was growing up that was that was put out as being a genuine fairy sighting really yeah and you believe it don't know well I probably did when I was like yeah 13:06 well yeah people people get sucked in and they become celebrities and then they like there it is yeah TNA reveals the first time letter which ended the cotton Lee prodding reading Lee here Emily hoax yeah I win the gold hairy tale just behind the house so for 70 years this lady kept a lie yeah there was one here that I think what bitch and there's people like that in the UFO community who like you know you have stories of abductions and things and then near later their stories either become too we dick ulis and contradictory you know that they were lying there's a wonderful one from this guy from the 1950s where it's great old black-and-white footage and they talk to him about his UFO experiences and all the different aliens that he communicates with and he just seems so obviously crazy and yet this was like heralded as one of the most important cases viewer follow gee and and you know you know the guy I'm talking about I forget the guys now as made always there was a think of as hubcaps and shit the Montauk chronicles which I think you would did a segment on that it's like an island where they have an underground thing where they were rumored to be experimenting on children Plum Island no that's not what it was until uh miles anyway those there was something like that this guy basically said he had all these remembered memories of working on the secret government base and he became like pretty famous here at loads of books well yeah I think he might just be a bit crazy but well there's a lot of that out there sure is anything else in your pile of notes over there I wanted to a lot of people too I think like the thing I would really encourage people to do is look closely at things it's really hard to do but if people who are on the fans they need to look very very closely at the claims that people are making like the claims that they is making if Eric Dubay say something like you know the horizon always rises to eye level this is something you can actually check now it's not easy you got to be reasonably careful with this to dollar level but you can actually check to see whether that is correct you can check for yourself if something reappears over the horizon when you zoom in which is something that he claims something that seems a ridiculous claim that's been made for like over a hundred years that when things move away from you they disappear from the bottom up and if you zoom in there will reappear it doesn't actually happen when you zoom in on something all it does is it makes the picture big it makes the image bigger and you can check this for yourself you can go down to Santa Monica Pier you can focus on like the North Shore like Malibu and you can zoom in and you can see that the picture does not change at all throughout the entire zoom and when you're fully zoomed in so you can see the cars whizzing whizzing along PCH you will see that the bottom part of of the road is the buildings are at these obstacles and you can do it with Catalina you can turn around and look at Catalina and you can zoom in on that and you can see that two-thirds of Catalina Island is missing I think a lot of what you're saying is very important because what we're talking about is just being able to look at things objectively and use facts to determine that this one theory in particular Flat Earth theory is not true but I think what's really going on is a thought process there's a way the human mind gravitates towards these puzzles and these problems and these these undiscovered truths these these mysteries that people just want to be the person that knows they want to be in the know and it's very intoxicating and that's what really this stuff is all about more than anything it's about the way the mind works and about the way your mind can be tricked and it's an information issue that we're dealing with today with things like YouTube where no one can stop you from making like you don't have to go through the people that work at NBC or Fox or whatever you have to go through the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times editorial board where they have to review your paper and go hey you wrote a bunch of stuff it's not true no that doesn't have to happen anymore now you can just make a video and it can be really well done with good music and good images and the way it's done can really influence a lot of people who don't have a background in science or not curious about looking into the debunking version of it oh that's why whenever someone sends me something I would say just Google that whatever you sent me and then debunked just do that first yeah and then look at both sides you know but people don't want that debunk that debunks not sexy yeah lots Piercy sexy yes I know people are turned off by the the debunking and I hate it yeah and that's why I do tell people to go do their own research but really actually do some real research as in do some actual observations and exploring YouTube videos are fun you know you watch a youtube video about dinosaurs being faked that's fun you know like what they're fake I can't believe it they fucking got me just like watching YouTube video about Roswell rods or any of these other silly things so kind of excited about the Eclipse I think that's an opportunity to like get people excited about thinking like a scientist though yeah you're not thinking like a loon yeah I get excited about the Eclipse but not everyone does well it's exciting it is exciting three rare solar eclipse the banana come in front of the Sun yeah okay you can what does that happen check it is 21st it's going to be totality and in Oregon but you get to see it from all of a lot of people going to go to Oregon just to see it yeah I'm going to Oregon are you Wow look at you you don't fuck around die paralysis Oh get an excuse yeah so you gonna try to like schedule some sort of a dinner oh yeah very time there we're going to be out of the campsite yeah looking at the Eclipse um anything else for and it's all the same oh and it's kind of complicated but let me just rent by a real quick collapse maps maps you hit the McKay turbo projection know the standard map that you see in school rooms has this really stretched out Iceland Greenland it looks like distorted it's not like the real world the reason that we use these maps this particular type of map is that if you draw a line between two points on the map and then you sail along that heading you will end up at point now this this is a type of navigation called run line navigation that's being used for like hundreds of years and the thing is that the map the Makeda map gets stretched out to the top it also get stretched out at the bottom because the navigators of from hundreds of years ago knew that the world was round and that they knew if they drew a line between two points in the southern hemisphere using the same map it would get you to that destination using rum navigation which is it's basically just one more piece of evidence that the actual the global map matches reality because people have used rum navigation for hundreds of years if not thousands of years so you're saying that the image of the continents is in some ways stretched out and distorted yeah we can take a glider they do that we will take a globe like just you can't just put it onto a flat surface right because you can have to distort it somehow so there's various different ways people use of putting it on on a surface you could just take you know your latitude and longitude and just map it into a rectangle that works out fairly well that's a nice thing that's called a equirectangular map but the most common map that was used like before like say 30 years ago was this Mercator projection which is the the map that people use navigating ship routes so you can get from point A to B if you wanted to go from England to you know North America across the ocean you just draw a line between the two points and then you say oh that's the heading I've got to go in so you head off in that heading now that doesn't take you in a straight line it actually takes you in a kind of a curved line because if you keep going a constant compass heading on a globe you actually kind of curve in towards the poles or away from the poles depending which way you're going I really know I was 10 what you're saying but all is is that there's this method of navigation that people use that relies upon the earth being a globe and it's this very very simple map that is in thousands of homes millions of homes and schools that everybody uses and you can see that on the map the lines get smaller to what's often you get small as well as the bottom and if people are doing a voyage around the world they're going to use this map and it only works and it works on the globe world that's another issue two people have circumnavigated the globe yeah well there's a major sail around the outside which of course would take a lot longer that's another thing like that Australia have you seen Australia on the Flat Earth Map no it's like you sit on that image that was up earlier it's like this kind of squish thing you notice ray it looks like it yeah it's more or less like this looks like the earth it's kind of like this it's all stretched out it's like twice as long and half as wide have you seen the theory and conspiracy theory that Australia is scooby-doo no let's give it to his head yeah yeah I can see that it's just a joke Italy as a boot yeah they just it's one of those joke memes yeah so the distances between places in Australia don't work is that the flatter yeah yeah it's the Flat Earth map and that's Australia and it's really looks nothing like that and if you lived in Australia you would know it looks nothing at all like that which is hilarious that there's so many versions of this hilarious there's so many people who have taken the time in front of a computer to create this flat earth map and put this ice wall and the idea that how do they know it's an ice wall like where where's the pictures there's pictures of ice shelves from like Antarctica so they think that's the whole law you think that's the wall yeah so that you'll see memes like yeah globe earthers be like what flood what ice wall and yeah be like agree on this and let's show you the suck on that sitting over an ice shelf which is a tuna fish I wish you could fly over well that's the mentality right it's a bunch of little kids or a bunch of dumb people or a bunch of people that have very little education or a bunch of people that are also speaking they're preaching to the choir it ties into like misconceptions that are natural like funny thing like when I was in the video game industry there's you know platform games you jump from little platforms and sometimes you have like platforms that move around rather than like Mario type things right in some video games when you jump up on a moving platform and then jump down and fall down you will fall down but the platform moves out from underneath you sometimes you jump up and you move with the platform and you land on it depends on what the programmer did right now a friend of mine was doing a video game and one of the programmers said it's like oh if you jump up and then jump down the platform should have moved out from underneath you so you should be able to like a you should be able to you know this is the way we should program the physics and then my friend map said no that's wrong and he couldn't convince this other guy so eventually what happened he says right what we're going to do is we're going to go out onto the road with my pick up my pickup truck I'm going to get in the back and you're going to drive along at 30 miles an hour and I'm going to jump straight up in the air and we're going to see whether I land in the truck or I land on the road so they did this experiment the guy the other guy was driving the truck was totally expecting him to like jump up and then fall out of the back of a truck because the truck wouldn't move done because he's moving the same speed whereas the truck three jumps up and then he lands back in the truck right and this that this is illustrating that this video game programmer had the exact same misconception that the flat earthers do because they say oh wait the earth is moving so fast why can't you just go up in a helicopter hover a bit wait for the earth to move underneath you then go back down again right it's just you know it's completely backwards physics because you're already moving so you'd have to slow down to zero which is the same as speeding up relatively speaking so my point is that anyone can make misconceptions about physics like that yeah and it's easy to get sucked into it and it's actually quite hard to break them even below this reasonable guy who was liking a video game programmer who presumably knew something about physics he was convinced that Matt was going to fall out of the back of the truck and quite possibly die so if I still only did the experiment let's end it on that because is literally hurting my brain yeah but what you're doing is very important and I really want to thank you that your website is very important it's very important for people who are curious and concerned and don't understand the physics and the logic and the science behind it all but I've sent your site to many many people that believed or don't believe and we're trying to figure out a way to explain it so thank you thank you thank you thanks for being our edge alright folks that's it for the week see ya [Music] [Applause] [Music]
