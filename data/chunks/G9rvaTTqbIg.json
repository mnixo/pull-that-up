hello freak bitches my kids are getting old enough now where their sports leagues no longer you know for a while there was just driving me crazy as a parent and going to a game and realizing that they weren't keeping score yeah because they didn't want it that's the whole reason why people get better you fucks yeah meanwhile the kids are keeping school kids know for sure and kids don't want you to blow smoke up their ass right you don't they'd come off the court and and if like you know I would like the oldest boy scooter is ten years old and he's he plays a lot of lacrosse he's been playing for five years and so he's he really likes it he does he does well but you know I'm not raised in the you know a Division one champion there right I'm right but he plays other sports too so there's there's sort of a well-roundedness there but we came off the field one day and we were walking along and and all the parents were kind of marching off and the game was over and and he says he says how'd I do and I said well you know you could have done better I said I just get the impression you didn't try as hard as you could what do you think and he looked at me irritated right he looked at me like I can't believe you didn't just say I did great and so he said what and and I looked at him I'm walking along and I didn't realize the parents were within earshot and I said well look you know scoot do you want me to blow smoke up your ass and you want me to be honest with you and to his credit he said you know he honest with me even though it wasn't happy about the honesty so you should be honest with me and so we tell kids that we they know better you know if you tell a kid that they're great and they're doing wonderful and they didn't what do they take away from that they take away from it that you're kind of bullshit right you know unless they're just super super young they pretty they get it at a pretty early age well here's here's something that's important to relate to children that you are not your accomplishments you are you and the only way you are going to get better at accomplishing things is to be a hundred percent honest about the amount of effort you put in and what the actual result of that effort is whether it's a failure or a success that does not define you that defines your participation in this particular activity it is not you you are an individual that will hopefully learn from all of your endeavors but you're never going to learn if you lie to yourself you're never gonna learn shit but if somebody makes this nobody scores a point and there are no winners and there are no losers and everybody's amazing that's not good because good boys by the way it's not good because there's going to be people out there that are fucking driven and psychotic and they're gonna get ahead there's people that are task oriented and goal oriented and they they have an idea ahead of them gonna try to figure out how to make this happen they have a goal they want to reach it and if you're competing with that person in any form of life and they're not burdened down by the bullshit that we give so many kids today they're gonna have a massive advantage and this idea that this kid who's been coddled and treated like he's always gonna be a winner that somehow or another they're gonna be happier is fucking crazy if they can't that kid can't process what's true and what's not and the kid can't process criticism Yeah right constructive criticism right you don't just stand there and berate your kid of course not that's just as bad absolute stand on you everybody's seen them right the dads or sometimes the moms it's stay on the sidelines and parade their kid because kids jeopardizing his scholarship to some moron school yeah morons but no I I think you're absolutely right they've got a the sooner they're able to assess that that equation effort and result yes and compare it to what's going on around them well look you know not everybody wins the lottery life right but but isn't that the problem with socialism and the idea of we should even out the playing field yes I mean the idea of a competition you're a competition guy right but you know a famous Democrat John Kennedy said that life isn't fair but it's not fair right now you're just trying to bang a little shake and you can't you know you can't dwell on the things that you don't have hey I wish I could have been born better-looking I could have been born taller you know you got to make the most it's like playing poker you got to and play it you can have the worst hand and you can win the pot so you know obviously is it easier to win the hand if you got four aces right right but you know what if you're a bad player you'll win nothing because everybody's gonna drop right and so even getting the best hand doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna play it right but you know it's not if two people if I want to hire somebody and the way they look I believe is going to help me earn more money because I think that having a more attractive person in particularly business position is gonna somehow lead to greater sales I mean that's really the only reason that you're gonna pay somebody more money if they look and look it on you know I go on fox television or CNBC it's not an accident that all these women interviewing me are pretty hot right I mean unattractive women can read the news and ask me questions just as good as they can but they're hoping and they're betting that more guys like us are gonna tune in to watch a hot chick interview me then a homely one and they're probably right right because probably lots of homely girls that are applying for these jobs are not getting hired no I agree with you 100% but there's a fascinating thing that's going on today where competition is thought to be and somehow some way shape or form a negative thing and that this kind of competition whether it's cop even capitalism itself is criticized right like there's a lot of people today that are in favor of socialism that's one of the reasons why Bernie Sanders is so attractive it's because like hey you people that are not winning this crazy competition out there that don't have any desire we're gonna even out this playing field and those people that are out there kicking ass and taking names we're gonna take some of that money and we're gonna just give it to everybody else yeah that is the appeal of socialism because it appeals to the lowest common denominator that'll just appeal to ignorance but it appeals to greed because it's an envy like oh this person has so much more than me and it's not fair but here's the beauty of competition because this is why we want competition we all want stuff right and and so I want people competing to sell me stuff right I want to have as much as I can as far as consumer goods that's what we all want we want products and services that enhance our lives and the way we get the best products right with the highest quality that deliver the most value at the lowest price is to have lots of competition all kinds of people competing for my business hey I've got some money to spend Oh buy my product buy my product competition is what's make is what make sure that I get the best thing that super hard to wrap your head around yeah and there's the big you wouldn't get paid the big bucks if it were easy but the big question is why yeah why do you think this is all happening or do you ever use that word why it's why is a weird word right yeah why is it weird is happening it is so what's causing it to happen what are the forces that caused it to happen yeah ever why do you ever look at all and go is there a purpose to all this so short and I think the answer is no I think they don't I think that yeah there's no reason why and again just looking up into the sky you know unless the purpose was to make a pretty sky boy anything that we're seeing here on earth could have been done much with much less effort than making a hundred billion galaxies right there's no evidence in anything that we've learned about science or the universe that gives us a reason to believe that there's a purpose behind it all if anything as time goes on the entropy of the universe is increasing and the universe is becoming more random and disorderly I think that we're you know riding a wave of the universe that is growing and expanding and cooling and and becoming more and more disorderly and that's a finite amount of time so 14 billion years from the Big Bang to today sounds like a lot that's 1.4 times 10 to the 10 years but the future of the universe is enormous li longer than that according to our best current theories it's its way it's potentially infinitely long anyway the last star is not going to burn out until a quadrillion years from now we are very close to the beginning of the history of the universe and but it's not forever doesn't last an infinite amount of time so the universe is ephemeral we human beings and living creatures are temporary structures within it and the idea that it's all for some big cosmic purpose seems to hold very little water do you ever contemplate what what function human beings have in the in the university the way we interface with reality the way we interface with our the nature with around us yeah I think that we don't have the function I don't think that's the right way to think about what human beings are we should be glad to be alive enjoy it while we're here be nice to each other and try to learn more about the universe but it's not if we choose not to do that that's not going against any preordained function that we have you're remarkably calm when you discuss these things do you have any existential angst do you have any like I think the other way around and honestly this is very very small amounts of data but from what I can tell when personal tragedies strike people who are atheistic cosmologists and scientists deal with it way better than people who think that we're embedded in a matrix with a bigger purpose or a spiritual reality really yeah because you get that this is this happen and you have an infinite perspective when someone dies it's sad you can be sad but you you can't say well it shouldn't have happened right this is these are the kind of things that happen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
