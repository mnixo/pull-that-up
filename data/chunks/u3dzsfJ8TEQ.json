boom and we're live Jen yeah Li Po Lille the man with the most beautiful axe in the world I just read iTunes review saying it's kind of we're listening to this guy describing this horror story with the accent from it sound like he's making you pizza while he's talking and they don't know is I am making that bit all I'm talking that is what's happening yeah and if they could see you you look like a professor that was kidnapped by a biker gang first came here with this red Brotherhood jacket this leather jacket from his Native Americans with his big red fist on he's got a bandana on you just be missing a motorcycle so you're missing right that's that's next you could be in like some Easy Rider type movie right I could see it carrying a shotgun - I did so are you digging doing this podcast are you kidding fire oh man I'm loving it I'm having fun well let's put it away I love doing it it's a royal pain in the ass the research well your podcast much like Dan Carlin's is very different I always feel ashamed calling my podcast a podcast because it's just you sit down a talk but yours is like it's an audio lesson on history and in-depth audio lesson on like very extreme aspects of history yeah it gets and you know that part I enjoy because the storytelling part is awesome you spin a story make it exciting connect it with pop culture do something that's fun that's the part that I love is the month prior to that of just brutal research just calm been through boring historical book after boring historical book to find us little nuggets that are amazing yeah and then spin it into a narrative that's the part that gets a little old sometimes where you're like man I do I really need to read 200 hours of stuff for this one thing it's like that's a lot yeah I can only imagine that when you do that when you're going over combing over all these different history books and all these different papers written on various times do you are you like extracting chunks and like putting them in Microsoft Word and then going over it and then like how do you form it well the question is kind of like do you form it as a script how much of it so everything is completely written out no not exactly because otherwise then it sound like we sound like you're a guy reading a thing that it doesn't sound right I just take super extensive notes kind of like if you are to give a lecture that you've never given you're not gonna sit down and read it by you are going to you know you have something to keep you on track to make sure it's like oh where am I going next okay great there's lying so it's as detailed as possible without turning it into a dry guy reading this page type of stuff yeah I mean history is such a fucking awesome subject because people are crazy and throughout history people have done so many crazy things that it's just it's it's such a great thing to know like when you if you only had today like if we only had our current era and we're looking around how fucking maniacal people are how crazy the world is we were like God how'd this happen how do we get here and then you just listen to your podcast and you go oh this shit's been going on forever yeah seriously this is the good in case you are wondering good times and yes there's much to complain about yes it's much we can do better without a doubt ladies and gentlemen but this is as fucking good as it's ever been by far yeah the human psyche is a very weird place because there's so much amazing stuff that human beings don't or just so much and then there's the amount of horror that can be unleashed throughout he that has been unleashed throughout history by people against other people is just insane yeah what it's like when you go back and you you go over history what is the most confusing or disturbing era you know to me is not so much a particular period because the same patterns emerge a lot of the times in a different point in time is is more those moments you know when when mob mentality takes over because in the realities the average person is not I don't have the word viewer I think the average person is evil I don't think that I think the average person is weak which means that when in a conditions where everybody's pushing in one direction is very easy to jump on the bandwagon and in some cases then a very ordinary human being can do horrible actions you meet them for dinner and you think a pleasant person good enough but you put them in the wrong context and everything turns to shit I just did I just finished right now this two-part series that's probably the most disturbing and now I wanted what podcast about flowers and paths this because this one was heavy man I did this series on kind of compare and contrast on the Sand Creek Massacre of the Cheyenne in Colorado in the 1860s and then me live in Vietnam in 1968 and actually split it because I had I did the Sun Creek and I had this guy Darrell Cooper was the murderer made podcast his enemies in podcaster and he cover me lie and and I'm in the third episode we're gonna sit down and kind of chart what does this all mean about the human nature why do the reason why that particular story in those two stories interest me is because it's it's a brutal massacre of civilians but in both cases there are soldiers who refuse to participate or actually try to stop it they are not the majority they're a minority but they are there and they try so it's not just a story of people doing ugly stuff it's like what is that make one guy when older hey go shoot that three year old one guy goes yes sir and does it and the next guy goes no that's now we are screw you I'm not doing that that's what interests me is like the individual element of what make people in the exact same circumstances one person go down a really dark path and somebody else instead I mean the balls to say no that's not why I am that's not what we do with the Native American mask or what who was how many people were the ones that refused because he never hear about that I hear about it's their horrific actions of the soldiers yeah which was the mantra but there was also like there was this one guy um that's a guy named Silas Sol he was talked about a guy with balls of fire on because the guy he and a couple of other officers refused to let the man under them because they were divided in different companies so their companies they say no are not participating in this this is just straight-up slaughter these guys are not even a real targets these are a bunch of civilians so they refused and then Silas all testified against his commander at the inquiry and he was promptly murdered shortly after so it's like it's a crazy story but still to this day there are people from the Cheyenne tribe who every year they have a ceremony for Silas all because they said it not being for him a lot more of us would have died on that day and he did a really brave thing and paid a price for it so you know if you're looking for heroism you can do a lot worse don't look at this guy story because that guy was seriously you know stand up for his conviction and their most extreme circumstances so can't tell Pope I admire that ya have to be incredibly difficult to just imagine what those people were doing mean when you hear some of the accounts of the slaughters of Native Americans it's just terrifying that people can just look at someone and just decide that's not person or that's not us this is the other they've got to be eliminated so we're just gonna kill all these kids gonna kill all these women and it happened all over the country I mean there's there's two things that happen to Native Americans one the big one is disease and wasn't on purpose there's this big myth that people put like they put smallpox and blankets and that's all bullshit right it's pretty much been proven that they didn't really understand right bacteria are diseases there's one story that's impossible is not a proven thing doing because initially nobody understood bacteria yes or the first hundred plus years completely unintentional there was one tale about the French and Indian War where during a break the British are talking about it saying one of the commanders saying hey maybe we should give them some blankets from the smallpox hospital but you know while we do know that he suggested it we have no proof whatsoever that it was actually done so let's probably have the rumor got started right problem but in most cases would happen is just that the Europeans came over and just inadvertently introduced Native Americans diseases and 90% of them were wiped out yeah that's a crazy number if you really stop to think about it it's going to see there are probably the most dramatic demographic disaster in human history because you know I never for you at a situation where a whole continent was not exposed to a series of diseases and so of course there's no immunity the first time they are exposed like you know you don't need to even have smallpox you can sneeze in somebody and the next day half the village is dead you know yeah that's crazy it's just it's amazing that if a group of people just has not come in contact with something that other people come in contact with all the time and just god we've got a cold you'd be fine just have some chicken soup take a nap meanwhile these people are just dead that's probably off that's probably why aliens don't show up it's like those motherfuckers are dirty amazing show up they sneeze on us and we with our whole planet will die or maybe the opposite they know they'll kill us exactly maybe they have like some super advanced diseases that's the other possible yeah I guess it's just a immune system thing right if your immune systems not prepared for it so it is there's a great book by a guy named Dan Flores well he wrote two but one of them actually a woman actually was a paper that he wrote about the Buffalo and he's saying that it's really interesting because he compares the initial encounters that European settlers had and European travelers had before the Native Americans were wiped out and they talked about how many animals were on the plains and they make a direct account of it and then after the Europeans had come and 90% of the Native Americans have been wiped out that's when the Buffalo population increased goes through the roof and you're seeing these gigantic packs of million would be packs herds I guess of millions and millions of Buffalo and he say that's directly attributed to the lack of predators which means lack of Native Americans they were preying on these Buffalo of course really interesting yeah that guy you item on the podcast once right yeah I'm on again I love that guy that was awesome his book coyote America that book changed the way I feel about coyotes yeah I used to be like fuck those little rats run them over and now I'm like those little wolves yeah that was a good episode I enjoyed that one yeah did they are so gangster one just stared me down the other day I stopped my fucking car and just you know because he was in it was a kind of a not a lot of people in this area yeah it was it was fairly late at night and he was on this road I someone just pull over and just see what this coyote does and he just fucking stood like thirty feet from my car just staring at me just staring at me that's badass right there just like whatever dude what are you gonna do I'm about to run into these woods you're never gonna see me again or I'll stick around maybe you fuck up I'll eat you right I'm just trying to figure out what to do right here those guys don't mess around that's crazy that they just can live and it'd be completely embedded in our society like there we had a biologist what was the gentleman's name that we had from the department of parks and services see if we find this guy but he's actually a biologist who tracks coyotes mm-hmm and he tracks them all over the state and even tracks mount lines they tagged them and put those collars on them and stuff but he said that there's a pack of coyotes it lives in downtown LA yeah I believe in the heat of everything they found some abandoned building and they'd end up in this abandoned building and that's where they look how those guys are resilient they thrive in anything yeah yeah you like crazy animal stories so check this out about a coyote there's my mom went for a walk with her dog and her dog is a big mean dog right so they are walking and they see ahead of them this little girl probably 10 years old with this tiny little five pound dog type of thing and there's a coyote maybe like 20 yards behind there that's clearly stalking them and the girl didn't see it and is obviously aiming for the five pounder and this chest and so my mom yeah that there like a watch out so the girl freaks out pick up the her dog and she figure she's safe coyote doesn't get actually still stalking them down and so at that point my mom kind of let their dog ago and dog chase the coyote often that was that but I was like man those guys don't yeah you don't want to leave little dogs you don't want little girls around I know it's like why a ten-year-old is walking the dog by yourself that's probably not the best idea today there's an instance that happened a few years back where a 19 year old girl was murdered not murdered killed partially eaten by coyotes coyotes yes yeah I think they bits chunks out of her tore apart she died in the hospital pretty sure the 19 year old and I yelled yeah but there it was unusual circumstances and then one of the unusual circumstances that the Coyotes in this area are very limited in terms of what game is available okay so much so that they've been known to go after moose that these little coyotes actually go after moose and have successfully taken moose out yeah so these are gangster coyote ex when you look at that they don't look that big really big ones like 50 pounds yeah yeah I watched a video the other day of a mother moose trying to stop these wolves from eating her cow I'd love your cow I've seen that's a terrific yeah she's running around stomping these wolves and they're circling her and then they just grabbed the calf and dragged it away and she's fighting off the other wolves and stomping them she stomped the shit out of a few of them yeah she fucked a few of them up small satisfaction thoughtfulness when yeah yeah I said I want that one sucks because there he is Justin Brown that gentleman very nice guy we give us a lot of interesting insights to like what happens in you know like with biologists how they how they tracked these animals and what what some of the problems are but we we're in such a unique place in Southern California because there's such a massive population of people but there's all these predators that are sort of like entangled oh yeah in our system no like hawks everywhere everywhere you look there's hawks swooping down snatching doves and shit and my my daughter got a little dog I always thought little dogs were nasty rats but I started liking these things so like okay I'm changing my mind about it this is a cool dog but it's still like eight pounds or so right so I'm like you can't let him alone in the yard not because there's probably not coyotes in the yard but they're definitely hawks around there's definitely owls that thing look like a big rabbit they're gonna snatch it in three seconds you cannot leave him in the yard like that because yeah I mean that's how it is that's when you have predators around you need to keep your eyes open yeah there's no getting around it there's no getting around it you know and when we look at how horrific the wild world is it's not a surprise that people who were just like recently civilized over the last you know like really realistic but that's the thing thousand years yeah everybody's like there's this really dark thing in people's minds where it's an option on the table most people are never gonna pull the trigger and go there but that's part of who we are as human beings and I think that's why I enjoy doing these Sand Creek meal I because it's a story that's not trying to bash genocide is not like oh look at those bad Americans doing these massacres mmm is more they were horrible people there they were also great people belonging to the same side so it to me is not about one particular group of people that one nation or the one ethnic group or anything being the bad guys it's not an individual level what is that makes one guy go down this whore in desirable directions and other people instead choosing you know cuz that's what it boils down it's nice choosing not to be that person you know that's what fascinates me yeah you know it's just there's a great book by Sebastian Junger called try right have you read it right that one good it wasn't it interesting when they talked but when he talked about all of the people that were kidnapped by Native Americans that chose to live with them yep and then when they were taken back by the Americans by the settlers you know they were like fuck this I'm going back I'm going back to the Native Americans and they went and live with them again but no one went the other way No which is really crazy something not flattering about the your American culture of the time yeah there's a great Benjamin Franklin cool time I'm gonna butcher because I only remember the beginning something about no European West tasted savage life and I'm basically going to can bear to come back to leaving our settlements or something like that yeah I'm like yeah that's say something about it's fun yeah the way they're living their camping right this is hunting and fishing everyday and you go back and these assholes are wearing powdered wigs and banging a wooden mallet on a table for everybody to pay attention fuck off that's hilarious but that here you hear you that's what I read about cultures right people sometime with that romanticize native cultures is like oh they are all the Oh hug trees and talking with the furry creatures of the forest and I'm like my well yes and no there are like in what you mention right if you were captured specially in the east when like French and Indian War or stuff like they were going on if you were captured by it within a native raid one of two things happen the good one is that they like you then they decide to adopt you and then you end up replace in one of their dead family members like if they lost a brother or a father then you become that person for that so weird thing that they did it's very weird but but the thing is the adoption process was so thorough that they love you like you're the real deal and you end up feeling like you're part of this family and you know everything works out everything is great if they don't like you dead they torture you to that over 3-day period and so it's these are the same people right they can be the sweetest most awesome humans or really messed up same culture same individuals do you think that's just because people have evolved big dealing with tribal warfare and just we have to have that switch I think is because I think it's interesting about natives is that it wasn't a racial thing they adopted anybody right didn't matter what skin color you have that they did not have a barrier to hmm but there is a big insider outsider you know if you're part of our tribe and you may become part of our tribe race doesn't matter you can become part of our tribe but once you're part of our tribe you are one of us but if you are no part of our tribe then you know the same rules do not apply to you you are the other you are an enemy you are mmm in that case that's when it gets really brutal yeah even with other Native Americans that's the thing that people need to really get in like we especially people that only have a peripheral understanding of Native American culture like the reason why Sioux are called sues because that's a Native American word for enemy yep they call themselves the Lakota people right exactly so all the other Indians were like fuck these crazy assholes they're the enemy yeah they were just dominating yeah it's it's really fascinating when you consider that these people had these hunting grounds and there trying to protect and one of the things that they've found is that there are areas or wildlife thrived and the wildlife thrived in these like gray area that's because like this one area would be you know one Native American tribe and then their hunting grounds went to a specified distance ya know obviously always in conflict but then past that was another Native American tribes but in the middle that's where you'd find all the fucking animals of course I get it nobody finds me or they are worried about killing each other in your zone so now it's crazy that they figure that out it's like have you been to Yellowstone yeah it's beautiful right it's amazing one of the things it's really crazy is if you go around the tourist center there's elk everywhere and just lounging around they tell you don't get more than 20 yards closer to an elk because they will charge you occasionally they like tired of people taking five and I've seen elk in the wild walk yeah but they've figured out that wolves don't come to the tourist center so like I got an idea and then they realize these people are different than the people that hunt us somehow or another they put it together like like one day you know all could go wrong right civilization could collapse and you just go right to Yellowstone go to that fucking tourist and just meet everywhere mold on the app you need hundreds of them on the lawn at the tourist center yeah it doesn't make any sense but I don't know what it is like what is the intellectual process that allows an elk to understand that these people are not going to try to eat me and that the wolves are not going to be around these people it Perley took some really stupid elk to stick around people before they realize those were to go to us and that everybody was looking back at like how I think over there they're feeding them peanuts yeah we can try to whoo yeah I wonder what it was I don't know if we really know like the mechanism that allows them all as a group to go yeah you could just chill out around these people right just lie down please lie down on us you're right it is funded all the national perks you see the most animal right there by it's hilarious and it's always it's fascinating that no there's never been like a non warring successful group of humans because it only takes you know you can really be a pacifist around somebody who isn't because yeah you decide to go in mellow peaceful happy society and you get your ass kicked by there's a great story about the origins of not even before the United States like British colonies in what will become the United States everybody hears about Plymouth Rock right there's the whole the Puritans they show up all of that what usually people don't hear and they also Russell played a little with the store in his book there was this other settlement called Marymount that was just down the street from Plymouth but they were completely different their interpretation of Christianity was pretty much a very Christian Pagani's mixed with a couple of Christian ideas they had the exact opposite approach of the Puritans they were having drunken orgies with the native tribes they were realized yet they were the equivalent of like the hippies of the sixteen hundreds just having fun and the period I started getting energy because when new people would show up on the coast they would take a look at the Puritans they would take a look at Marymount and be like yeah I'm going to marry mousetrap ureters these guys are weeping themself and life sucks over there and so of course that was bad competition even some Puritans were like see you honey I'm God for a couple of weeks because and so the the hardcore guys decided well we can't have that so they got their guns showed up and closed down Mary mountain and that's the problem like at the Marymount guys not be so damn lazy hippies and actually got their act together and trained with guns and stuff they would have been able to keep their community going with those values all you just you need that minimum of self-defense so there were somebody else quashy which is exactly what happened is that the from the the name Loyola Marymount does it come from those people I dubbed it because you know what I have no idea so I'm gonna live but but see the Loyola doesn't strike me exactly as that I cannot race with that's why I was confused yeah yeah I never heard of that before but it makes sense that there would be someone that would deviate there's always someone who just looks at the way everyone else is doing it and just says this is fucking not for me man talk Tony yeah but it always goes bad like there's never been a cult where you know they got together formed a commune and just really were cool of each other we I'm actually fascinated with exactly the thing you say why why can what's so damn hard about power it's the boss what if there's one person in power the one person in a position of power is almost always abusive and they almost always use that power to their own ego ego gratification and dominance they always fuck all the other guys wives yeah that's old they all father a bunch of children they take everyone's money you know it's I'm fascinated by that kind of stuff because one of the things that you you see when you if you become famous or if you do something that gets you a lot of notoriety is I know how I feel around certain famous people like I'm not like I've talked about like first time I met Anthony Bourdain whom I respect a great deal first I was like a little school kid I was like I was just such a dork I was like dude I fucking love your show I was like those lives is Jenni and I love his writing - yeah so I was genuinely excited to see him and meet him you know it still to this day when I talk to them all Dork tout so when you know you take a person who's none I'm used to being around celebrities I've been around a lot of them but when you take someone who's not used to being around someone who is in this position of adoration and they don't know how to handle it and they just they just give in to whatever you know bata tendencies they have and this alpha just takes over there's a natural thing that human beings do in these small isolated groups that don't get checked and it almost always is the the man who is in charge of it winds up abusing everybody yeah yeah yeah which again he goes back to that part of human nature is what why do you have to go down that path you can have a great life you enjoy be nice to people making you are in a position of leadership use that to make sure the whole thing run smoothly everybody's taking heads that way yeah to me is I mean I understand it and I don't understand it because I mean I get it I've seen it enough times that I know it you're exactly 100 percent right but at the same time I really don't get it because you can still have a great life nobody's denying you all the good things that you want just be a semi decent human it's not that hard come on you would think it's not that hard but when there's no one checking you look you're in the Oregon woods and I've got this fucking yurt and everybody lives together and you just bang everybody all their gold it's people for whatever reason when there's a person that is the king or a person that is like some you know cult leader or whatever you Messiah whatever you want to call them people just want that person to have the answers they gravitate towards that yeah and I think that's precisely one of the thing that bugs me about a lot of people who are willing to put themselves in that position of like I am your big leader no to me there's a way to be a leader that's awesome that's great sort of the Taoist approach where people shouldn't even feel that you're a leader by are like subtly moving things along to make sure everybody's taken care of right that's a leader but that's not because it's not obvious most people need exactly what you say deeds they need their father figure to lay down below to be very dogmatic and certain in there I know it all don't worry have all the ends you know this is good this is bad and people love that they love that in dictators they love it in religious cult leaders they love it in in everything that type of personality gathers a whole lot of followers who need somebody to look confident and sure of themselves doesn't matter whether they are or they aren't if they put on a good show people will buy it yeah it seems like a pattern that just sort of gets established in human beings from being a child and having your parents don't touch that that's hot come with me this is the way to go this is what you have to do this is how you put your shoes on there's a Thai shoe this how you get to work this I do this do that and then you all of a sudden you don't have anybody telling you what to do anymore and then all along comes the cult leader yeah yeah like I've got the answers guess what they're coming straight from God so fuck your parents your parents didn't know shit but that's what's bad is that the same people who grow it up would be like your parents tell you a tie your shoes that you're like fuck you suddenly somebody come along with their 20 or 30 tie your shoe and you're like oh you're so wise yeah let me listen to this is the way to tie my shoe oh great master exactly yeah this just I don't know man is just it was interesting I don't know if you have being following like we're done Carlin the stuff that he has been saying about his other show common sense I haven't listened to lately yeah he hasn't been releasing a piece on lately that's probably why you haven't because he has kind of shut down with that it's not officially done but in this thing is my approach meaning done talking my approach is to be come with some whatsapp dolls and what like play not be overly dogmatic one way or another to think of my feet to mix things together and that's something that most people don't want in the current climate most people want the very black-and-white type of approach now I disagree with done because I think that still there is an enormous need for what it provides and I don't think that just giving up is the solution but I do get it because it really doesn't take much you know if you start screaming very dogmatic either super leftist or super conservative approach you get automatically a bunch of followers mm-hmm if you are thinking on your feet and just going this thing yeah you're right but let's look at the other side and constantly having you know what any decent human being should do just being intellectually honest and thinking things or not people don't respond to that because it's not that easy or rather people do some people yeah it is a number wisest way a minority compared to what you got by being a black and white kind of guy yeah people desire very clear resolutions and very clear thinking in terms of like enemy friend this is a black and white issue there's but I think damn that also just felt overwhelmed by the time seems like this just seems like everything so fucked up I'd rather not even talk about it and just sit back and I don't see what is is really happening we we're on the phone I swear I spent like an hour on the phone with you or whoever I can afford I was playing in by by that was played remember the second movie of Lord of the Rings where there's four although carrying the ring is over there I can't do this anymore I think I need to step up my game I'm a shitty Sam because I was trying to do that for that I just kind of motivate him and I miserably failed so I respect where he's coming from he said that when he was on the show recently he was talking about that sort of same thing that he's kind of put that podcast on hold long as he keeps doing his podcast hardcore history is just so important I think I think him and you are providing you guys are providing an entertaining and interesting history lesson that really wasn't available before I mean before you could get a book on tape and if it's really well-written book and it was read by someone with a good dramatic flair it was exciting stuff but nobody really got into it I bet I bet the numbers have you consider the numbers of people that have listened to his podcast in your podcast in comparison to like before you guys were around there's probably a radically improved number of people that know a lot about history yeah for particularly things like the Mongols I never even thought about the Mongols until I listened to his podcast which apparently right now if you're in the LA area in Simi Valley at the Ronald Reagan Museum at the Reagan museum or library what is it there's a giant Genghis Khan exhibit really yeah they have the pose and all the stuff they stole and yeah the textiles and all the different things they warn their yurts that they slept in all kinds of crazy shit awesome do I go yeah I mean that stuff's over a thousand years old right or close to it it was well yeah so close to a thousand years old yeah but oh there it is right there yeah they had bows that required a hundred and sixty pounds to pull back I know what the hell where these guys who pulls 160 pound boy it's insane they must have been animals there must have been so fucking strong yeah you pull 60 power you're like holy hell this is heavy 160 is insane well I have a compound bow in the compound bow I don't have a regular like a recurve like these guys I believe they invented the recurve - they didn't invent it they were around in the era when the recurve was invented with just by the design of the bow it pulls its it gives you more power more energy gets released through the arrow but with a compound bow there's a big let off so it's only difficult so if you had a 60 pound bow it's only DIF it's only 60 pounds for like the first six inches or so I was pulling it back then as you completely pull back there's like an 85% let off so it's much easier to hold right though they were pulling a hundred and sixty the whole time all the way and it was harder yeah of course yeah and they could aim perfectly on horseback whoo I'll ride in a full gallop is like hooda I mean apparently used to time the arrow release while the horse was in the air yeah because then you don't have the unevenness okay doesn't guys makes just that serious that Dan did on the Mongols is one of the greatest of all time I urge people it's I think it costs a dollar an episode just go through iTunes get it for a dollar or I don't know whatever whatever it couldn't have do you have if you're cheap Android but it's a dollar in episode and it's worth fucking hundreds of dollars that's amazing I've listened to it no bullshit at least six times you know I need to stop bringing it up then because by now people are accusing me of like you know you like then probably a little more than a heterosexual man should they always give praise beautiful God he's awesome nothing wrong with I love that is one of my favorite humans but listen your podcast is fucking awesome to men and I really particularly enjoyed your first one because you talked about that one store that you brought up on freak me the fuck out right when the end of Spartacus rebellion they they capture all the remnants of Spartacus army and crucify every single one of them on the way between the Naples and Kappa but next to Naples and Naples and Rome every whatever 30 40 yards nursin you guy crucified and thirty yards down another one kind of like lampposts all the way between these two cities and how many miles is that a hundred twenty something like 120 miles of crucified people yeah where you have it every 30 to 40 yards there's a new one and then another one and then another one and it's yeah that's an intense kind of story since the last time you were on the podcast I went to Rome oh yeah oh yeah so that travelin trip yeah yeah dude it's art that's one of those things we just have to like no one talked to me for a second let me try to process this you know like we had a great guide who is a professor it was really it was really cool he guides people in the mean time and he was just so excited to talk to me because I was so into it of course you know because most the time you know people are just like barely curious about what he has to say but you know we talked about the significance of the pineal gland and the pinecone and and the in the Vatican and you know he takes it you want a tour of all the different artifacts that's that's a trip that I feel like but just going there especially the Vatican going near the Colosseum was big too but going to the Vatican and just seeing all that artwork and getting an understanding of what those people were really up to for hundreds and hundreds of years just conquering the world for hundreds and hundreds of years and all this artwork there seeing it live in person just sort of reset my perspective that's amazing it's yeah Rome is a place that you ever never once in your lifetime you got to do it you know it's just I don't know if you have been there's a place Castel Sant'Angelo which is kind of close to the Vatican and but if you go to the top of this castle you basically get a panoramic view of all of Rome from there it's so spectacular it just it's wild river you see all the buildings you see everything and then you come back down and you just do your walks and and how was I seen you know once in that I swear room that I was blown away by you know this artist Caravaggio was the painter that I loved that guy because basically what happens with this dude is he was around in what was the end of the 59 end of the 5900 Serle 69 hundreds and Caravaggio was straight-up gangster like he was probably the best artist of the era to me he's probably starters of all times like you look at his paintings and it's just insane what he could do it pained but then he had this life on the street as a literal gangster he would just get he at one point kill the guy in a duel was wanted for murder every time he would get close to power and he will be up that's kind of a draw for you looking like they're raising that painting is you know what year was this made around 99 yep God look how good it is no that's insane a medium that's that is so close to photographic and you think that this was in the 1600s yeah and these people they couldn't even stand still for him I mean how do you think he did that did he have a guy pretend that he's getting choked they do this all from his mind no I think he used models there was actually one of the scandals is that he was a mouse well of course but that was not this guy that was part of the deal though the scandal part was the fact that you know the church was commissioning a lot of his work and he's clearly was not the most pious guy in there sense his view of Christianity was hey these guys were Jesus and his followers were poor man from the street they were not the Cardinal in purple roads so he used his models more than once for the Virgin Mary he used the hookers that he was leaping with real and so the church was like you cannot use a hooker for the Virgin Mary that's just not okay that he would be like don't worry okay next time and again he does it again his paintings of the Virgin Mary find hilarious there's one is if I remember that there's one where there's a naked baby Jesus with Mary squashing a snake see if that pops up that what is great because you know there was this big shot at making a big that church was trying okay keep it together be a good boy because you're the best painter there is but you're fucking crazy so please just tone it down and he turns in this painting where the Virgin Mary as just big cleavage showing in a red dress she baby Jesus is but making the squashing the snake supposed to symbolize the devil and stuff but they were like yeah that's not what way bad was the one that's the Virgin Mary yeah she looks like a freak I know well she was he's a lover who curse oh yes that Wow part of the problem and the baby Jesus squash a snake yeah was dick Shawn exactly that was the other thing that this guy was explaining to me was the penis sizes of the Roman statues they were all small because big penises were supposed to mean stupid people and like aggressive animals that were just you know not a part of the civilized amazing culture that Rome represented so there was pride in the micro penis yeah well it wasn't micro but it was definitely not that's not optimal yeah I was like because I was asking I was like what do you think that is we were trying to figure it out you know we were talking about it before the professor gave me an answer and I was like maybe they just like had little or to expect that like maybe was just you know that was how it went and he's like no it's just I think they probably associated big dicks with rape with like the barbarians and the Moors and all these people coming in chopping people up and fucking the shit out of everybody and like no no we don't want that you know and that little tiny dicks like this sophisticated dish people who write poetry they were clearly made by the artist one thing they did do though in certain eras they covered the dicks with leaves it wasn't initially what I would do and they went back on a lot of them and repurposed them and put new leaves over dicks I think you know right now that are gonna be about seven bunk beds boring the name from you like sophisticated dekes will be the name of a new band coming out tomorrow be a good man's fist gated decks yeah I like that name that's yeah it's a it's a weird thing that people have done throughout history it's like sort of trying to trying to control artistic expression and trying to have it represent the time you know so you don't necessarily get a full version of what was going on there but you do get a version of the suppression which gives you insight into the full version of the times definitely you know that their coven covering ticks with leaves and stuffs so strange and sometime they would have the pain third giving the edited version of the painting public consumption but then the same guy would Commission he was like okay give me one for my private collection so that's where I could have all the way more explicit stuff yeah I mean they didn't have pornography back then so they must have been beating off the paintings and stuff it had to be yeah yeah I mean had to be thought of as being arousal inducing so much so that what was it during the Victorian era where they put legs of tables they would put dresses on them yeah they would wrap in the legs of the tables because you know their legs yes they are bare they may give you ideas which I don't know about you man but you know look at the leg of the day that really doesn't do it for me so something to it where people got so horny right the table legs but that's what you know you really have problems right when you look at the leg of a table and you got all excited is like man yeah that's not good no you may want to revisit your life choices up until that point it's fascinating these people must have agreed to that too what's up Jamie I just looked it up it says it that it originates from a satire that was written in people I guess took it as truth so it's not real yeah supposedly not but they definitely did cover the last thing they did but the reason why it's exaggerated says he was poking fun at Americans that didn't sound like that how about this point of the meat the meat is to Cora that's prosperous farm house parlor in 1900s and that is a cover this is 1900s right this is um the Victorian era is when they did this oh it okay 1839 an Englishman wrote a satire of American tour he wrote the American propensity to use the word limb in place of leg though he says the English do it too then he says that he visited a boarding school young ladies New York Strip with sorry square piano fort with four limbs the mistress of the establishment had dressed all these four limbs in modest trousers with frills at the bottom of them his exaggerating and not subjects is exaggerating or not subject to speculation he is poking fun or whether whether Marat Marat is exaggerating or not is subject to speculation he is certainly poking fun at Americans but I can attest that having Paige see dozens a book showing old black my piano photos of Victorian tears I saw not one example of a table piano or any other piece of furniture with skirts around the individual legs that's interesting I like the legend so much better hadn't you always heard that yeah professors yeah I remember hearing that from a history professor I'm all off the you know between boring history and a fun legend always side yeah I would like to think the people were wearing more stupid than they were yeah sometimes we feel good about this error exactly we're in now yeah maybe just um I mean you look at the dresses that people had to wear you know that went all the way down to the ground I mean it's not really much different than what we see in the Middle East yeah it's it's very simple I mean what we see in the Middle East they have to cover their face the hijab and the whole deal and the head scarfs and that's a little little more extreme but not much yeah I mean they they wore shit that went all the way to the ground if you showed any ankle you would lose their mind yeah well you know a repression does it yeah I wonder if they were more hyper-sexualized than we are I bet not I bet because of porn we're probably more hyper sexualized right there's I think different arguments there because some people say the more you rest of the more than you're gonna obsess with it so that's all you think about all day one that kind of indulge more in it is less likely to obsess then again there are lots of people are so addicted to internet porn that I don't know if that idea works but you know that's the well internet porn is the problem the internet porn is the availability is this is you don't have to go someone at least back in the day when you had VHS tapes or DVDs or something like that you had to go to a store gotta buy them you know put them into the TV at a sit back and get the remote control you know there's a process that was more involved the minors TIFF minor work yes right yes now it's just far too easy yes part mean how many people that work that have jobs go into the bathroom the dorm beat off mmm that's there's a lot of people listening right now doing exactly that right now beating off right now stop it go back to work Jesus is watching that's what I hear yeah um it's just it's interesting I guess if you have to think about it like they were trying to control those people and trying to control their urges because it was beneficial to society it's beneficial to society that these people needed to do their fair share and get to work and they couldn't just be staring at legs all day and and you know engaging in impure thoughts but you know that's the that's the problem with any kind of prohibition it's completely misunderstanding of the human mind works is you do not say no to saying says you are not gonna do this yet guaranteeing that people are gonna obsessed with this right it doesn't work there's has a sin story that I heard once that I thought it was hilarious can remember we're heard it but like guy go to a Zen master saying hey you know you'll recall at peace and happy I want to be just like you what do I need to do Zen master says okay just for the next 24 hours don't think about monkeys guys like monkeys never thought about monkeys how is that gonna make me a light and send my shut up no way come back in 24 hours don't think about monkeys that like okay well becoming a light and is gonna be a piece of cake because all I have to do is nothing about monkeys and of course the next 24 hours become the most monkey filled hours of its life that's all I can think about right for it being the ball you make something a taboo the board guaranteed that people are gonna press with it yeah it's like even think like drinking at 21 in u.s. right it's like growing up I don't even know if there was an age in Italy where you're supposed to not drink but it's not that glamorous you know is what your grandparents have for lunch and you know are maybe six-year-old and you wanna try a little wine and they give you a tiny bit saying if you have a little more you got a headache so Tresca and then one day you do got a little more you got a headache and you go oh shit you're right okay yeah and you kind of learn how to drink rather than being like we got away cool now we got all these booze and people drink throw up all over dance feels like that doesn't at all why are you doing that yeah I think there's definitely healthier attitudes than Americans attitudes about alcohol but also like wine is a good way to start like you start off a kid with whiskey that's not the way to stop that's too potent yeah I'm one of my first times I ever got drunk was on Jack Daniels and took years for me to smell Jack Daniels and not want to throw I'm sure he get those triggers in your head do you smell it like Jagermeister I used to smell Jagermeister and just be like yep just think about just getting violently ill where your body's trying to purge it from your system so you don't die yet it's to just to hide it from kids and tell them it's that it's taboo but then you drink it and then they're like I can't wait until these fucking people can't tell me what to do anymore I'll get myself a nice cold glass of whiskey I mean it's kind of like that goes also to education in general you know when if a parent has to come to the place where you say these are the rules you live under my roof you need to read them that's like raising the white flag in that meeting I've lost already I lost control I don't know what the fuck I'm doing because this is like of course all they are gonna do is wait for you to turn around and do exactly the thing you're prohibiting because you're coming across as a dictator you're coming across as an a so if instead you can teach somebody like look man you can do whatever you want the goal here is we want to make sure we both want to make sure that you are happy and you're safe simple enough so let's figure out a strategy to make sure you can be happy and safe and we aren't I'm on board whatever that's a lot easier for people to respond to be like okay so you're not just a killjoy I was trying to squash my life or somebody was concerned about me not ending up dead fair enough we can work with that yeah but parents have to work yeah and they don't have any time exactly I have to tell you your parent right just fucking listen to me fucking get my lectures ready and yeah hey hey hey what about whiskey no don't fucking touch that shit get out of that get out of that liquor cabinet all right yeah I remember when I was kid I couldn't wait to drink this is gonna be fun of course gotta be this taboo yep it's forbidden yep but that's the problem with forbidden stuff yeah it never works well it's also Italian food and wine seem to go hand in hand and and it's I think I mean did that used to be what they drank because they were concerned with getting sick right and one of the best ways to not get sick was to drink wine the alcohol content well yeah the alcohol content would keep the water from I mean like if you just drink water all the time especially if it's sitting still mm-hmm you could get some bad fucking water right you can get bad water from a lake I mean how many they didn't know jack shit about parasites back then how many people got some terrible diseases from drinking puddle water and shit never a lot oh yeah you just find some water like oh we're thirsty time to drink and or even a creek you drinking a creek and you think like oh this is a beautiful stream this is a clear water yeah but a beaver took a shit just a hundred yards of that cuz you don't know about it you get what's called beaver fever yeah that's what for real that's what they call Giardia they call it beaver fever yeah that can't be good now it's terrible so they used to drink wine to prevent what they would call travelers disease because people would take these those what are those things called though the leather things that they would carry wine and I want to say flask it's not a flask one of those those leather satchels yeah yeah I know what you're talking about I'm coming in I thought they use philosopher's nuts but I'm not sure might be there's a term it's like a leather bag and it had like on the end like a cork you just drink from that and that's how they would hydrate yeah people must have been just hammered all day yeah when you read the statistics of how much people used to drink it's amazing that anything ever got done because it's just people were drinking morning through night and there must have been horrific to each other yeah then just just to imagine like a whole civilization that is a drunken bar at 1:00 a.m. angry drunk you know it's funny because I never and I mean I've seen it enough that I get it people get edgy and weird where when they drink too much but I never got it because to me is like if I'm drunk is like that's when I'm happy people fuck yeah why would I want to be in a bad mood this is also this well you're a nice guy that's what it is that comes out the yeah if you're a fucking asshole it shows up I see your especially if you just barely keeping that asshole under the surface she's barely just one stabber but in Club them and steal their women and then you get a couple of drinks in yeah and now this there's arrow alcohol is a great social lubricant it's great for releasing inhibitions and letting people communicate with each other more freely and have fun but this it's also it removes doubt mm-hmm and that's not good right I think doubt is critical yeah like doubt is one of the pieces of the great puzzle right the great puzzle has many ingredients and one of those ingredients is doubt and doubt is important you should look at anything you're about to contemplate and go hmm let me think about this let me think what could go wrong when you get a couple of drinks fuck it let's do it let's go and then next thing you know you know you're on an internet meme hold my Pierre yeah we talked about that yesterday like some of the more ridiculous ones but there's so many of those out there and almost all of them have to do with our yeah no you're right and I think what you are saying about that there's a great Alan Watts the guy who popularized as an and now ISM and all of that stuff he had this great line he called it the wisdom of insecurity you know this idea of thread real careful there's a wisdom there in not being sure dogmatic and which doesn't mean the problem is then people take the concept too far and that turn it into having nobles and not being able to cast and that's not the solution either that's the other side of the problem but there's a sweet spot in between where you can take stances but they are careful stances they are sentences that are very willing to be changed at the drop of a dime if you show the good evidence to to change them you know yeah is that to me is what intellectual honesty looks like yeah yeah I agree I think it's good to be aware of all the possibilities I said tell people that when I was teaching Taekwondo if people that wouldn't compete if they were really really nervous I'd be like the really smart people are really nervous because you're aware of all the possibilities of everything that could go wrong to people that aren't worried about it at all they're usually dumb there's that but also to me there are some people like I look at some of the people were able to keep it together in these that kind of like Chuck Liddell right take a nap right before a fire con right I can't tell by look at those guys and just be like you know something I don't know you know there's something there that your confidence for sure I mean Chuck had been knocking people unconscious there are many many years and he knew exactly what to do and I think knew he was good at there's that for sure and I think there's the other side is knowing that okay if I have decided to do it fear is not gonna help me now you know it helped me to make decisions earlier but right now he's not going to help me so let's figure out man it was hilarious there's my girlfriend fights MMA professionally yeah notice that yeah she's wild but pay attention to your escapades online she literally had that Chuck Liddell mode where she took a nap right before a fight and you know like 45 minutes before you have to wake her up okay ready and she's all like okay ready to roll and like I would not sleep for a week prior how do you manage to keep it together like good to do I used to do that I used to sleep for fights it's good that's awesome yeah but you you just can get yourself into a more calm stay it's it's so much better than frantically running around and freaking out Freddie plus is a it's a it freaks out your opponent's I would sleep like right on the bleachers mmm I just go to sleep right there and everybody else would be nervous and shit and you're sleeping exactly you look at them and I'm supposed to fight that guy the guy was sleeping right before the fight hell no like the first match he did when I was nuts because you know you're in the locker room and there's the guy sitting next to you goes out for his match come right back little burn covered blood at their tally okay you get ready you're going next and I'm dying right I just succeed how the hell and she's all like lalala what do you mean her gym no she literally live across the street from me that's crazy yeah that's just where I am and it was funny because I used to say it this is where the universe has a sense of humor because I used to say all the time I I'm kind of I can get along with anybody but I don't necessarily click with a lot of people so my fingers like yeah where do I find somebody I click with or across the street and I said like what they are like look at that yeah I know it was that's why I could looking at the universe go I like okay that's funny ha ha but uh there's definitely little things that almost like slap you in the face well yeah there's a whole system going on stupid yeah pay attention I don't like I know you make fun of Oprah Oprah's got three billion dollars it seems completely preposterous but yeah intellectually I always want to say you know things don't happen for a fucking reason you decide they happen for a reason afterwards yeah because it helps to fit your sense of order yeah it's the funny thing is I completely agree with that and I also can't easily agree with the fact that sometimes things click in a way that you're like okay you're fucking with me this is just - you think about people all the time out of nowhere I'll get an email from them mm-hmm like out of nowhere like I haven't talked to this guy in ten fucking years and also I get an email yep or you know you run into them somewhere like what how is it possible I'm running into you at the airport this doesn't even make sense I know you reconnect it's very strange yeah they're those are the times when you're really humbles you and makes you think okay the universe is such a weird place and what I understand is like probably 0.01 percent of what's out there yeah we're connected in some other weird way that we haven't figured out yeah and maybe we'll never we'll maybe we'll become symbiotes maybe we'll become like completely ingrained technologically before we figure out the biological connections that we share because I think there's I think there's like the obvious sense is that we all have but I think there's some other stuff going on we think about someone and then boom they're calling you on the phone yeah like their dad just to me is too coincidental sometimes sometimes it's random short like say if it's someone that you talked to all the time and then they call you that's just coincidental big deal but there's some times man where you just you're talking about someone and also in the fucking phone rings and I'll go look at this is crazy you haven't talked to them at four years excited calling you right there exactly there's something to that yep and they and you ask them like why'd you call me just stop right now I'm not I'm not saying like why you calling sir sure I'm saying like what was going on like what caused you to call me I don't know I just had a weird feeling yeah it's yeah man you can also tell when people are creepy - right you can tell when someone's a creep this like there's something the vibe that you pick up what is that what's that I really do think that there's something that you know verbal communication is a very small way in which we communicate there's so much more to it because you know there are times when you walk into a room and you already know who you're gonna like and what you don't know and the ones that you don't then you need to spend the next whatever long it takes you to find a reason why you don't click yeah now you already know it there's that something there is going on and this is smell and I think most people trust their perceptions so they're like no no I need to find out the rational reason why would I have this preconception signee to me is like if you feel it there's probably good reason for it you know if you have a strong feeling about it I would trust it rather than not fuck yeah yeah trust it rather than not is a good way and you know don't trust it like that's definitely a witch yeah nobody knew it do not burn your people at the stake that's the bad idea it's just amazing to me that the United States is such a recent sort of experiment in self-government and that no one has done anything like that since then that's what's kind of really amazing to me when I stop and think about all the wacky shit that's taking place in America over the last 300 plus years and then that no one else has done that no one else is a nickel from the spot in Australia and the Australian government has allowed us to carve off a big chunk right let's let's call it you know whatever then Danielle Jael and I'm all for it that I swear I'll be a good leader I well that's that's cruel you're wise maybe but it seems like well it's also amazing is that the United States has managed to become the number-one superpower in the world as a group of all crazy immigrants that all moved into one spot yep ya know the story of the United States is fascinating because yet you don't and probably is never gonna happen again because you know that was the product of a war that did not know about oh there's this other corn you know you find out I knew it's exciting it's everything now you know what's out there and unless you go for space exploration nothing like this will happen in the history of planet Earth it just the only way can happen is a reset a civilization reset yeah like they'd have to be like a bunch of people die like most people die apocalypse most people lose the knowledge of what was going on before Dan yeah sure you can have a post gramma angle kind of story yeah yeah post Graham Hancock that's entirely possible yeah that's entirely possible although I did read something very recently that they think what was the supervolcano that killed most people on the planet seventy thousand years ago they found one pocket of humans that actually survived and thrived in Africa but they think that the entire population of human beings at that point in time 70,000 years ago the entire population in the world was only around a hundred thousand people yeah and then it dropped down to ten thousand Wow ten thousand people because of the supervolcano so the super volcano blew it wiped out most life it wiped out most people it plunged the earth into some sort of a nuclear winter mmm-hmm forget where it was I want to say it was Bali or Indonesia Mount Toba where was that Indonesia Indonesia yeah watcher Sumatra killed literally 90 percent of the people and 10,000 were left so seventy thousand years ago we were down at ten thousand humans which makes all the things about racism so silly that's uh that's a good show for Kevin Hart right even that's a light crowd for Kevin Hart exactly it's like a fuckin blink 182 concert yeah 10,000 people man that's lagging did you stop and think about that it's insane I've done 10,000 people in the night before in Denver I did two shows there 5,000 each that's 10,000 people that's the fucking entire population of Earth you know and that now became 7 billion 70,000 years later it's not we're so weird where is such a weird animal like if you could study us without being us somehow I know that you could remove all of your cultural conceptions and all the other things that you've just sort of accepted and you establish as fact as a human and just looking at completely objective you'd be like what a nutty animal this thing is what the fuck are we doing yeah that's why it never gets old to study the human psyche like what makes people choose this because that's the beauty of human beings we have choices that you know a wolf is a wolf there are only so many things you can choose other world you're you know yeah you could have a wolf that adopts one strategy one another but the range of choices is pretty limited as humans we have this even range of choices and these fascinate is to see what is that make some people doing wonder actually and a completely different one and it's fun it is fun and what's fascinating to me about human beings of today is I've never seen a time where people are more interesting more interested rather in other people doing what they want them to do like other people thinking the way they want them to think other people behaving the way they want the people want it seems to me are more concerned with controlling people's expression and thinking today than ever before and even more so on the left it seems like I'm seeing this interesting trend today where people like it's almost like we don't like where things are headed we don't like what's happening we don't like what the president is so people are being real adamant about enforcing certain types of behavior and that in turn just like we're talking about suppressing people from drinking alcohol that in turn makes people rebel course that's like there's more people that are leaning right today than ever before and I I attributed entirely to the people on the left you know the thing that's funny about it is that most human beings even if you just look at the United States right most people are not the extreme right or the extreme left no we're whelming majority or not right I think a lot of this stuff is also a little bit media created in the sense that is like let's find the most batshit crazy person on that side true once put the spotlight on them which make everybody go like what fuck who are those crazy people and that's how it's kind of like if you were to pick you know the Westboro Baptist Church and make it be representative of Christianity like it's not you know but if you keeps puttin the spotlight there you'll create this perception will create a backlash and it becomes this thing where like that's one of the funny thing that I was noticing because like I really don't like political correctness I really don't like academia I really don't you know there are 10,000 of these things where I'm like yeah that's I'm completely on board with no liking some of these things but then there's another side where you know I have been teaching a university since 2001 right I don't think I've seen once a case of the kind of political correctness that I seen articles in media not once you know like I was doing the math I had probably maybe 11,000 students in my classes over the course of these years and I don't I haven't told one person ever defend hardcore communism or make an argument even among my colleagues which I have issues for other reason that's never been one of the things so I'm like I keep hearing about it I read it on papers but why is it that when I spend you know that's how I make my living on college campuses all the time I hardly ever see it and so I'm thinking I'm not saying that it's not true of course it's I mean of course these stories are true there's an argument but what I'm wondering is how much do they get blown out of proportion because you get cliques because it makes for an interesting narrative which then some people also leave off that kind of narrative and I'm like how much is it something where we are putting the spotlight on a rare exception and make it gnorm versus how much it's a real thing because you know you would expect I mean I teach in Southern California some of the most leave me know Santa Monica almost liberal places around right if this thing was as dominant as advertised I should be running into it all the time right and I don't like that stuff so I would be science it you know I would be paying attention and yet I don't see it so I'm like hmm what's going on here that's interesting well I think the instances are more frequent than ever before but I also think if you put it into perspective and think about how many universities there are Macross the country I mean there are hundreds and hundreds of universities and if you have one incident that breaks out one month in one place exactly and it was about one conservative speaker that's going to give a lecture and everybody freaks out and goes crazy and they go all the people with green hair fucking bang on the windows it's a it becomes something that people were worried about spreading mm-hm and so I think that's one of the one of the reasons because like I'm sure you're familiar with the story from evergreen University Evergreen State yeah and that was a fascinating story and for people who are interested in it Google Bret Weinstein and Evergreen State College and you could listen to him on my podcast I had him on right after it all went down what had happened was there's a thing called the day of absence that had traditionally been people of color would stay home just so that people would recognize that like oh when they're not there we missed them and we missed their contributions and they're an important part of our community I think that's a little silly to stay home but I think it's not a bad thing for people to recognize that everybody plays a part and if these people feel marginalized give them a little extra juice and that's fine but the real hardcore social justice warriors decided that's not enough instead what we want is all white people to stay home and like you can't do that of course is that you now you're telling people to stay home versus allowing people to stay home in which a case you missed them this is the opposite telling these white people to fuck off so Bret who is like a fiercely progressive person telling people like you are making a mistake here you're getting out of line this is not the way to do it right and then they went crazy and they're fucking looking for him with baseball bats and they you know they they literally kidnap classes they held a teacher they held the principal or the president of the school in this room and even when he went to the bathroom they escorted him to the restroom and then brought him back to the room they wouldn't let people leave the stories are amazing no I mean if at that stuff is complete brat shit crazy like right that's crazy we completely agree on that it's like that is ridiculous that has no place anywhere that's bullshit that you don't do stuff like that it's just same thing is like you know the Jordan Peter something in Toronto yeah that policy was a stupid policy and he was right in arguing against it so I'm not arguing that those are they are wrong no I know you're not really right my issue is from there to arguing that this is the super prevalent thing it's like from one story or one story there to say instead you know there's a communist conspiracy to brainwash us all it's like okay what we are starting from a completely understandable premise and taking it like 25 steps too far yeah I agree I agree and but I think that what what's happening is more of these unusual situations are occurring and so people were terrified of this spreading like wildfire across the country because kids are very easily influenced you know and they're also idealistic you know they want to change the world maybe they grew up with the father was an asshole and a racist and like fuck this no racism no fascism and they're calling everybody a Nazi and running on street but that's it and if I have it as a question not as a something I'm sure of but what I wonder is how much of these is media media fueled and how much is real and I think that some of it is real for sure my question is how much is some well there's most certainly media influences people and it influences people in a bunch of different ways it shows that you can get attention for doing certain things it shows that other people are in support of maybe what you thought were your radical ideas and you find other radical people as well but I mean that's also the argument for not publishing the name of school shooters right it's because a lot of these people think that this is media fueled by people that are seeking attention I think they're probably right and sometimes in a certain respect though but it's also just a part of who we are and I think it makes us really consider and taking the responsibility what is significant about broadcasting ideas and how much influence these ideas have on people who absorb them for freedom and for sure I think my shoe it's some of this thing is that often it becomes a partisan thing you become my gun when your guys do that and they show those totalitarian sinks then booba totalitarians my guys do it I'll turn the other way and pretend is not true to me in fact is not a one particular ideology or another it kind of goes back to what you were saying about human nature in general totalitarianism you know this idea that you want to control what people think their choices is horrible regardless of who's doing it and in that case nobody has a monopoly on this because you have seen hardcore religious fundamentalist push totalitarianism you have seen or you know a taste ideology like communism pushing for tyranny completely right you see people on the political life poor people on the political right everybody is it's a virus you know it's a virus of the mind when it take over there's this desire to squash all other choices hmm and I find it equally horrible regardless of who's doing it you know I'm a little suspicious when the narrative becomes look at those guys doing it and you're only picking one side it's like there are some guys where I see even they desperately try to be like no I'm fair look I pick on my as listening to somebody doing this thing I think it was more right-wing oriented and he was saying oh this time we are wrong and I was like oh look at that that's kind of a self critic that's interesting let me listen we are wrong because we are just like the left and you should hear what the left and then for the next half hour it was all about the left and like that's not self criticism motherfucker that's just you're still a partisan shell you know that's like not being honest to me is and that I think what bugs me is when it's an ideological battle when you wanna score points as opposed to saying look there are certain things that are fucked up that are evil totalitarianism regardless of which adjective is attached to it is bad yeah how about we agree on that you know that's that's kind of where some some time I feel a little sketch in the way the narrative gets pushed that it becomes a my tribal versus your driver thing well you would probably know better than most because you've been teaching in universities for so long I mean you would see there you're on the battlefield I think a lot of what it is is a lot of what you were talking about before about people doing horrific things is that they're cowards and they just give in to the whims of those around them and the mob mentality and I think that happens with the right-wing ideology that you see expressed in horrific ways like you know whether it's you know I mean fill in the blank could be Charlottesville should be any of these horrific things that have happened where right-wing people got together and protested versus what happens with the left I think it's a lot of it it's just people wanting to be a part of a group people wanting to be a part of this this thing that gives them they have this feeling of being in a tribe and solidarity and they go along with whatever the ideology is that tribes pushing absolutely and that means such a danger because is you know that sense of belonging is something that all human beings crave to one degree or another and so it's the same thing that make people join cults is the same thing that make people join some hardcore political position is the same thing that make people join biker gang it's the same mentality right is we need to as our tribe our group with the same clothes with the same ideas we stand for because it feels good to have other people who embrace he was one of them or treat you well as a result but of course the price to pay is your individuality because you have to kind of sacrifice the complexity of who you are in order to fit in neatly into this box yeah and you kind of have to look you you have to shut out objectivity mm-hmm because if you if you look at things objectively you're gonna say well we're fucked up too and this is this doesn't make any sense and why these aren't my enemy they're just people that are on our bad path exciton down over oh I could have gone down that road too if I lived over in that community you know I've found myself in this one spot that leans left and so I'm leaning left to right yeah well how does that stop though this is my question about all that kind of stuff like what could ever happen what could you foresee happening in history where people could look past that and sort of figure it out and go you know what there has got to be a better way to behave and think and this is probably one of our main concerns because if you really look at what if you ask people what's our main concern well war okay sure the economy that's that's big and then you know and there's a host of other things that bother people crime and education all these different things well what what is causing all of this conflict what is what is causing it well a giant percentage of what we're talking about is some sort of a weird tribal behavior mm-hmm or you get a get a group you become a part of that group and then that's what you identify with so that's what you reinforce and then you get some sort of brownie points for reinforcing the ideologies of that group and you you know if you're the most rabid person yours the Steve banning of that group everybody rises up and gets behind you this motherfuckers at the front of the line cycle supporting our values yep and then you know you find these communities online where people just they're constantly signaling to all these other people in that group that they're supporting this ideology and they get all these likes and me like I feel like likes on Twitter and on Instagram stuff like that I feel like that's shaping people's opinions and behavior way more than anyone is taking into consideration somebody I mean even the fact that you know the algorithms make sure that you only see the stuff that you already click like yeah so you start seeing the same threads over and over the same topics it really is creating a coach a person that's really not good it's fucking horrible yeah you know it's weird and it's weird what people like and what people don't like a lot of what people like is just really stupid I mean how many girls are getting fake asses just for likes on Instagram no it's probably a lot right that's faintly it's a a very very interesting time for human beings I feel like for you as a person who like is deep be knowledgeable about history and study history and you have this history podcast when you look at today do you ever try to look at today in a perspective of someone in the future trying to teach about today yeah and the thing is that as much as there are obviously cycles in history and there are patterns that are recognizable and all of that today is also so damn unique because if you look at just forget everything else if you look at the way just technology as shaped nuts in the last hundred and fifty years are unlike the previous two hundred thousand years you know in the stuff that has happened in the last hundred fifty years from electricity in the refrigerator internet radio TV it's like the pace of technological development is something that nobody has ever even come close in human history before so we are in a place where is where really munch our territory yeah the human mind has evolved so much from when we're happy monkeys running around but we are now we have these tools to do stuff that we are really not prepared to deal with so a large degree and so is kind of big open question how where do we go from here because there's no previous model that you can say well that one time three thousand years ago when they invented the internet they handled in these ways like there's nothing like it you know the tools whoever our disposals are unlike anything that has ever happened before so that's one of the cases or you know usually history you can see oh you learned this lesson you can definitely learn about human nature and how the human mind works but then from that you have to predict how the human mind will be applied to a context that's unlike anything any other context that I've ever faced as before and then the big concerns that the human mind will create an artificial mind that won't take into consideration any of the previous cultural ideals that we've supported and let's just go run rampant yep DARPA is created a robot that I've been raving about accessorizing crazy it's called the eater robot ei TR it it operates on biological material meaning it is fueled by eating bodies okay what could possibly wrong with that the idea is that on the battlefield I'm sure they're not talking about this they've conveniently left this like one of the things like well it maybe could he plant maybe could eat a rabbit or something right or maybe give you fucking people yeah like my number one concern with all this stuff is that I think it's happening so fast and so many things are taking place in so many different realms when it comes to innovation that this stuff will just catch up to us before we even recognize it tap and it'll be too late for sure I mean even just forget everything else even just the whole atomic bomb sheesh Wow for the last ever since we started from the 1940s to today there have been some seriously close calls yeah you know there was remember the one there was one in the 1980s I think right before the end of the Cold War where there was in Russia you know the guy goes to his boring job where they are supposed to look for missiles from the United States and nothing ever happened day after day after day and then one day there's a blip on the radar and you're like oh shit and he's the guys job to cool his superiors and then if he does the odds are they are gonna press the button and he's like no no let's calm down maybe it's wrong Americans are not that stupid they will not send one atomic bomb if they do it they send a bunch so this must be a mistake let's go relax three minutes later another bleep another bleep another bleep he's like oh shit they are sending a bunch of atomic bombs this is the real deal and the guy still doesn't do what is supposed to his feels like if I make this call nuclear war starts I need to be 3,000 percent convinced the evidence in front of me is pretty solid but I still don't feel it and then five minutes later all the blips go off it was a mistake on the radar and it was like some random bleep and oh the guy promptly drank a bottle of vodka straight because he was like you know he almost caused world worth exactly and do you know most of us all their lives now - some Russian dude in 1980s who decided not to do what he was supposed to and then did and all because of a stupid mistake a stupid bug in the radar that's that's when you know that the technologies we have are way too much for our you'll make or way not enough because it should be better the other side was it I don't even know what the real thing oh yeah that's that kind of shit terrifies me it's just how the ability to do something like that without the the understanding or the discipline to create it is really nuts I always like and it's like giving a baby a gun like the baby didn't figure out how to use that gun they didn't invent it they don't know how to load a around but they could just fucking pull that trigger yep and people can die that that can happen people get killed by toddlers all the time people leave their purse in there and their bag toddler picks it up shoots himself shoots someone else happens all the time all the time yeah yeah it's human beings have access to all sorts of technologies that we would never be able to figure out on our own yeah and we don't we with those great with the great responsibility that comes with using those things there should be some sort of great knowledge that you have to acquire about the thing itself like some sort of some a reasonable facsimile of like what it took to create that thing mmm-hmm like some deep intensive program like hey you wanna you want to learn how to drive a car like this is how an engine was developed this is this is how brakes work this is how and you got to know you can't half-ass this or right you know the same should be said about guns should be said about everything we just have access to too much shit that we would never be able to figure out on our own yeah and we're like well just fucking try it yes that button see what happens yeah old might be our throat you're six right is like learn how to you is it then we can talk about yeah let's come up with new and sit in Russia come up with some new supersonic missile like just a few days ago they announced that they're about it better off yeah you're better off not hearing about it scary stuff with all you know all your old guests on the jury will be here now in your compound with flow tanks and stuff to survive the apocalypse when the zombies attack you don't want to be a survivor I mean you maybe want your ancestors to survive so you should survive but your answers just might get raped and eaten right the process of surviving doesn't look like a fun one right like if you were around in Indonesia seventy thousand years ago in the big one blew and you were one of the survivors and you're you know picking through the wreckage of civilization not good times definitely fuck man but then again if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have Disneyland which is a very important point yes them no Netflix nope it was for them no iPhone because of people in Indonesia yes all because those people did eat those dead people yeah all because those people did figure out a way to somehow or another get enough nutrients from whatever the fuck they ate to compensate for the fact they were involved in nuclear winter that's not smen yeah it's crazy and it's but it makes you realize which is we the people that are listening to this the people that are alive today we're not gonna make it just we are not gonna make it like everyone's so hopeful that the human race is going to make it and that's one of the reasons why we have offspring and loved ones and friends and even if I'm gone I want everyone else to be happy you know I had a great time while I'm here don't cry for me but no one's making it they're not gonna make it either you're just prolonging their life like everyone's life is going to come to a wall everyone's out the game works but we're cool with that we're cool grandma dying grandma died but she was 97 years old she died she was a wonderful woman and she was loved by many everybody's cool with that you know we're not cool with everybody dying oh yeah yeah this is the end of the process fuck no it's not the end it's just we're gonna everyone's gonna die and then we're gonna restart with monkeys it's gonna take another few million years but the chimps will eventually become people again it's it's kind of what Graham says that if anybody's gonna survive is gonna be the people are living close to hunting and gathering conditions today that are seen as you know the most backward people in the world are the ones who actually have a shot at making it in a elliptic situation yeah like people in the Amazon or some like that they're probably the only ones that have a chance yep what's my Oh Jim you see this going around the story about this new company that can upload your brain but it kills you what yeah a start-up is pitching a mind uploading service that is 100% fatal I think they're taking like people that are already terminal patients and whatnot that's their first sort of and they upload their mind yeah I don't know I didn't they're gonna give you some bullshit scrambled version of what it's gonna be all swastika like like we found grandpa's brain and we're gonna upload it now and you'll be able to look into his thoughts oh it's all dicks grandpa's all Dickson and Nazi memorabilia preserve your brain and uploaded company its chemical solution can keep a body intact for hundreds of years maybe thousands as a statue of frozen glass what the idea is that some day in the future scientists will scan your bricked brain and turn it into a computer simulation so they don't even know to do it yet this is bullshit that way someone like a lot like you though not exactly you will smell the flowers again in a data server somewhere Wyatt okay the story's a grisly twist though for neck Holmes procedure to work it's essential that the brain be fresh the company says its plan is to connect people with terminal illnesses to a heart-lung machine in order to pump its mix of scientific and bombing chemicals into the big car Lloyd arteries in their necks well they're still alive though under general anesthesia thank God you put them under before you kill them because we want them to experience any pain for they go into the great frozen glass statue beyond there's a waiting list of course is a waiting list a bunch of fucking idiots Jesus Christ people are stupid there's a you know hundreds of thousands of people signed up to die on Mars do you know that to have the opportunity to be one of the first people to die on Mars hundreds of thousands of people signed up yeah you don't want to be the first to be locked in a spaceship for six months with a bunch of other people so fucking Stu they're willing to die on Mars yeah then you get there they're just talking about social justice the entire way all the way over talking about veganism and social justice and you know Elon Musk on first Mars explorers good chance you'll die a little chance how about 100% you got to die whether you stay here yeah stay here get good chance you'll die you're dying everyone's dying you're gonna die that's the fucked-up thing we just don't want everybody to die all at once we're cool with small groups people that are brown that die in caves on the other part of the world if we could be convinced they're primitive they hold these ridiculous beliefs and we don't even know them right so we're just gonna kill them with robots yeah it's somebody out there who cares it's not us yeah I think just the rate of change it's happening so fast there's gonna be a lot of dumb shit like this it happens along the way Gorge like the bell-bottoms of Technology it's like what is the tough fuck were they thinking I just gonna keep keep happening like that it's I mean you think about even most of the stuff that we do today like which foods are okay to eat and which ones not how many people like to go oh look at that Greg is gone he ate the wrong plant so let's make a note that we do not eat that plant yeah are we sure that's all Greg ate yeah exactly it's like baby should still eat it let's try one more time yeah yeah he's got an iron stomach dude it's old carcasses and shit they had to like express it somehow or another in a way that everybody would remember it probably in songs and shit yeah yeah cuz exactly that's the other thing how do you pass information in a society that's not literate and yet people did it I mean when you think about things like the Iliad or the Odyssey you know this long gas compositions completely passed down orally you know without you know by the time they wrote that down with sentries down the road it's like that's some pretty insane thing that humans were able to do in like memorize all this stuff really insane you know I was thinking the other day about songs account crazy the technology of remembering things through songs are because if like you think of all the songs you could sing along to the words now think of how many poems you can recite it's like very few or stories you can root what poems maybe because they rhyme but reciting a story verbatim almost none very few but like we were at the comedy store the other day we're talking about grammar and sentence structure and stuff like that and I brought up those ABC after-school things like conjunction junction what's your function hooking up words and phrases and clauses like you know what it is like you know I'm just a bill sitting here on Capitol Hill and like they explain of course these things in a way that you could remember fucking decades later you would never remember you'd never remember if it wasn't for those things there was a guy named arias was like one of these like back when they had the Council of Nicaea and they kind of decided what is real Christianity gonna be and what we decide to be the fake stuff arias was on the losing side but part of the scene the meeting scene Lee popular is that he put on all his theology in songs exactly like what you're saying super complicated thing about you know Jesus beast kind of like God the Father but not really and like really brainy stuff put on like silly song that the guy would sing while he's baking bread and stuff and so he was ridiculously popular because he figured that's how people pick up stuff these are people pick up stuff you know I mean to this day right like pronouns you I think that song pronouns take the place of a noun cuz saying all those nouns over and over can really wear you down that means too many days at school good job that that stuff for whatever reason sticks of course I wonder why what making things rhyme and and putting them in song it has a particular profound effect on your memory it is funny because even when you look at babies you know they respond to music so much they have that immediate like some sounds that click with the developing mind of a baby you don't mean to have culture you don't need to have knowledge you don't need to have as baby you can still pick up sings and remembered I mean yeah or sometime you know somebody put some music and one who goes and the babies immediately recognize it is like I know what this is that's what I enjoy and is especially do the other day by the way is fucking hilarious in in Italy this is this little kid he's probably 2 or 3 years old and that keeps trying to play like children's song and the babies pissed off or he's like no no no and it's like what do you want and he say something in the day is like ok fine we'll do this again and whole lotta love by Led Zeppelin star baby just like so happy about it would be amazing if that kid grows up to be like a big rock star right you imagine yeah I mean the whole lot of lovelies a baby exactly that to me is like I kind of did that a lot with my daughter because I'm like I hate to do this to you but you're my daughter and I wanna listen to good shit baby stuff all the time so it's like even to this day like she goes too bad with Hendrix like there's n Drake's as a lullaby of course the mellow and recluse the hardcore stuff is for the day but like at night when she want to go to sleep I'll put on like the more mellow things like when Endres playing acoustic guitar or like little wing or something like that I can tolerate don't give me any baby shit stuff because I just I mean right now she's not a baby but even if she was little I'm like sorry I can do that I like it though the thing about baby stuff is like babies like baby stuff or even little kids like little kid stuff like my kids like a lot of really fucking dumb shows but they love alright it's like what can you do can you say no you can't love that because it's too fucking stupid but it's not stupid to them I can tolerate it if we balance it with something else I'm like okay watch it that's fine I get it it's part of your developmental stage good for you right but give me something here okay let's find a middle ground here or we can listen to the same music or watch something like and that's where I recognize I may have done irreparable damage to my offspring because I realize like the other day we watch a movie and my daughter's come and to basically say this is the coolest thing ever was like it's as good as Conan the Barbarian that I was like yes I'm glad you're my daughter chef was she talking about the books or just talking about the movie the whole of it she like she loves the you know the one corner and it was Martin Arnold another 1982 and of course yeah I read their old Robert II our stories and Wow you know I changed the language slightly cuz sometime in the language is a little like you need to really have a crazy vocabulary for an eight-year-old you know I kind of tweaked it a little but then you know all the good stuff is there and I feel like the best Conan could have been Jason Momoa they just gave my shit movie the script was lucky my my so good he's very he looks like a fucking barbarian like you believe it perfect big giant guy and he's also not built like a bodybuilder he's built like a guy who's in really good shape which you would think Conan would be there is right I think he was the best Conan he seemed to me to be the boss realistic maybe could use a little bit more gym time but not nothing crazy but the problem he had escaped it's that something that's not a first race I mean when you see like all the elements are there and the screenwriting sucks are just like come on just straight dogshit but he was fucking great as Conan like you believed it yep no I just looked evil enough and it looked like a guy who really was a sword fighter who really did live in that era whereas Conan played by Arnold Schwarzenegger like wait a minute what's guys got no armpit hair built like a brick shit I was like it just he was freakishly big yeah that's actually a picture he looks fairly reasonable there all right you know now that I think about it was actually quite a bit leaner in those days than he was and his body builder day yeah yeah that one was just also but he was still this definitely dude had been doing some bench pressing it wasn't someone just swine Club bells around and he didn't get those muscles just by poof in the wheel of pain that was a part of it too right there's definitely that a little bit of that too oh man that not have been the last couple of years have been playing a lot in the world with screenwriting and stuff I'm so excited with that I'm just getting because you know that nothing range like in history on fire and stuff like that is storytelling and I realize I end up doing that in whatever field I'm you know well when I'm teaching most of it is storytelling when I'm history on fire is storytelling and so I started playing a little with scarying writings because I had good hookups man I'm having so much fun it's like driving well there's the stuff that looks there are a few like they are all mostly historical fiction kind of stories and one of them right now looks really damn promising but they've threatened me to chop off my balls and nail them to a tree if I talk about it so I can't really bring it up because that one actually has a shot I'm making it okay there are other things were much more kind of early development like for example all right so you got outside Frank Frazetta painting yeah so Sarah the granddaughter of Frank wants to develop one of the one of the characters for zero girls she's the one who does it all yeah Sharon yeah she's awesome she's super sweet and and I and she started asking you know I showed her some of my writing were chatting she liked it and so she want me to develop like one of those character scene to create a world around it like a game of Thrones meet Conan correcting and I'm like that's what you're asking me to do or you see that's like the dream job ever is like hell yeah I want to play with that that sounds like fun it would be epic so well I think those movies know shows when done correctly when executed correctly are some of the most entertaining compelling things whether it's Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings or does the Conan ones with Justin Arnold did a great job and those are fun but there can't be yeah yeah I mean the first one was but the other ones were painful they were we don't represent Robert E Howard at work already Howard's work is still to this day never really totally been captured yeah I heard that Amazon is gonna be doing a corn and see it I don't know maybe they are if they're doing it who's gonna play Conan I have no idea I don't think they picked it yet because idea would have announced it I think they were just saying it's in development they are gonna try to stick to Robert Lee Howard stories and so who knows let's see but they got the shackles they could pull out the big money and get Jason Momoa to get back in I know that's this he's the Conan I think yeah guy he's like 6 foot 3 is built like a brick shithouse yeah he looks like he would be a barbarian like he looks perfect like when he paid called Drago that's perfection he was perfect yeah yeah he's you buy it you see him playing that role you're like oh I buy that mm-hmm he's a savage he would be awesome they did that man that would be epic yeah there's they are doing a bunch of stuff they're doing that they are doing a prequel to Lord of the Rings on Amazon Jesus Christ that Jeff Bezos guys got a little too much cash hey I'm all for it like do one more yeah do it all look I mean just I mean here they have that really good Billy Bob Thornton show too that people can tell me about I haven't seen it either but people what does it call the N that Billy Bob Thornton show on Amazon Jamie I'll find it sure I don't I don't know what it's called but I know that people keep raving about it and why Goliath thank you yeah it's supposed to be really good yeah and you know the problem with those here's what's weird more than half the households in this country have Amazon mm-hmm I think Amazon Prime yep like right it's like 51% of the households but how many people are actually watching those Amazon videos that's a good question I think once they start putting these kind of money on some of these big shows the odds that that percentage is gonna get always pretty damn high let's find out this I don't know if Amazon releases their numbers they don't do they do it probably not did they do it the same way you don't know Google see if what how many people watch Goliath on Amazon maybe we'll find out because they they no one has any idea how many people are watching things on Netflix other than Netflix and Netflix they they just they don't tell anybody nothing and clearly must be a good number because they keep producing shows public money Nate so you know that it's working for them what they do know is how many people have subscribed to Netflix and that's an insane huge number but the actual number of people that watch every they don't tell you shit like I have a comedy special on Netflix they don't tell you nothing they go great job we like it right you have no idea you like it why yeah it's great people love it okay well how many people love it Lots there's no fucking they don't give you any data yeah which they don't have to and maybe that's good maybe people concentrate too much on the number right you know I mean like I won't someone was saying that the Oscars this year the Oscars is here down by you know five million people they still go watch by 25 million people suck like what yeah what are we doing here like who cares why is that even a thing yeah exactly why we've been concentrating on that I can't find the viewers but this this is the kind of information they give out is the topped binge first season of a us produced Amazon original series ever over its first 10 days I don't mean shit yeah no this season no other season one had a higher season completion rate through ten days well that's interesting that must mean it's a really good show so people binge dydt the first season can you get Amazon Prime on I Apple TV that part of Apple TV somewhere do you have to get one of those fire sticks I can watch it through my teeth my TV has a thing has a Smart TV Apple all right I can get it through there and it says that arrives on Apple TV and over hundred countries as of December so yeah oh so last December December 2017 years okay so we haven't now hmm but still Netflix is just so much more popular mm-hmm it's like q-tips once you it like becomes the name all right like give me a box q-tips do you want cotton swabs no motherfucker I said q-tips you know it's like do you want to watch streaming video and won't watch Netflix all right but we have Amazon streaming video bitch Netflix - stutter what Netflix only took over that recently right because give me a fucking iPhone these to be bullshit yeah fake smartphone nonsense I've um yeah it's pretty recent yeah just male before like they took over blockbuster first and then they're like and now it's all streaming yeah you can still get DVDs I think but I do because I'm a nerd did you get DVDs too really because they don't have the same offerings their stuff that they do have on DVD that you they don't have on streaming and vice versa so like for example what was I watching there was I think the last season of Vikings for example I think that was right watch yeah I'm just watching it now and I want season 2 it's good that's the good state you know it kind of huh don't tell me that don't tell me it goes down you know I'll fucking go crazy first two seasons are awesome Game of Thrones that way through Netflix for instance yeah yeah yeah yeah I can rent the DVDs of Game of Thrones exactly but yeah you punch it through there stemming out but you could only get Game of Thrones DVDs yep yeah we are paying the next year like what 10 bucks a month to rent those that's how they use that's what Netflix was when it started yep 1 2 3 DVDs a month that's weird so Netflix DVDs has Game of Thrones Netflix streaming does not exactly yeah they bother thing for any DVD you can get yeah that's weird yeah there are a lot more on DVDs than they have just streaming there's a bunch of stuff that I want to watch like gazing point again of Thrones Viking some of that stuff is uh I used to freak out and not having a physical DVD player in my laptop but this is ridiculous so I bought one of those ones it plugs in yeah I never used it once raised by Dow you're just watching Orleans 3 you know or a download them from iTunes right I sit on my laptop I don't yeah it's this is also new but yet we're so convinced that this is what this is the future right is it Netflix period everybody else fuck off it's locked in and I think they're doing comedy specials on Amazon as well I'm pretty sure Amazon Prime did Bob Saget's new special and a few other people and that's one of the cool things because Amazon is trying to compete with Netflix they are trying to come up so they're gonna put an insane amount of money in shows hmm and it's great for content because there's today there's probably more possibilities for people doing stuff than ever before you know there were before you are only so many Studios producing only so many movies now there's so much more Brian counts on their Joey Diaz is on their brands on Netflix jim brewers on Netflix who else Tom papa I'm cigars old one yeah Eddie Pepitone oh wow Greg Fitzsimmons so there's quite a few specials that are available on Amazon Jim Norton very interesting that might be where the what was that one that just closed that uh yeah see so yeah maybe they just they have a lot of them on there now yeah I bet that's exactly what it is yeah interesting it says continue watching or watch from the beginning that means Jamie Vernon was watching it hmm interesting yeah I hope it works I mean I would love to see a bunch of different viable outlets for people to release films and TV shows and stuff like that and God knows Netflix has enough money I know they so does Amazon they have ton of fucking money yeah yeah apples not doing that though are they gonna try to do that create original study have stuff they have that one Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon show that's coming out soon look at me look at me had a game show or net games have a plan of the apps like when Paltrow will I am Gary Vee was on that again they're trying to get me throw up yeah not Gary Vee I mean they haven't all necessarily been successful but they're trying I'm just kidding about throwing out if you're a gallon you're to those ladies and just don't listen to me I'm just fuck just make it fun yeah I think it's good I mean I would like to see more I just think in terms of like your ability to sit down and do absolutely fucking nothing and zone out for days there's never been a better time thoughtfully there's so much stuff available Apple is purportedly investing 1 billion in original video content Wow Jesus Christ ok so Apple is add that to the mix and that's Gary Vee the big ol smile on his face how does that guy sleep so he does how's it where's he where's he half the time I'm pretty busy yeah that's exactly what people ask about you is like how does he manage to do like 72 careers in one and no manthena work out and do this and that is like no no I think you man cloning they're like really three Joe Rogan's going around and there are like you have downloaded your consciousness in three different bodies were doing some of this dynamism would fuck up whore core if I did that like it's it's hard enough to manage my insanity with one life alright 5 3 lives going on one of them I'd definitely go off the rails with I think it's what I'll do is it's more of a it's an illusion that I'm as busy as people think I am it's not as busy it is busy but it's less busy with work than people think because the podcast is you know sitting here with a friend like you and talking for a few hours is pretty easy that's not really that hard and then the working out well that's just mandatory these have to go and then there's the stand-up comedy well that's kind of a passion project and it's interesting and I do it all the right like I know avid time down like I'll hang out with my family tell my kids go to bed which is usually like you know a dish there and that's when I leave right and they go to the comedy store like I know I've have it pretty much locked in I get my podcast done before the kids get home from school so I'm hanging out with them right I know how to do it I'm working out while they're at school for the most part pretty impressive though because that means you have F because realistically you do have so much stuff on your plate and the way you make it flow there's that's something in terms of time management I think there will be people willing to take courses from your own how to put it all together because that's a skill right there you have to be really steadfast and what you want to do and what you don't want to do and when you don't want to do something just don't do it alright but I wasn't able to do this until I really started working for myself mm-hmm like working for myself and the ability to like if you have a bunch of different jobs but you're beholden to other people's schedules it's almost on man yeah it sucks and you can't do it but that's one of the thing I'm trying to do what I'm trying to as much as I enjoy being in the classroom I'm trying to be in the classroom less and less do more online and do more Paul custom because I'm tired of me in somebody else's schedule you know no I imagine you like driving it's like I don't mind if you put me in the classroom that's great it's but if I have to drive an hour and a half to get there and that means stuck in traffic this is just no fun do you feel like there's opportunities like real viable opportunities for people now to get an education online legitimate full education it's definitely emerging it's part of the problem is that universe this kind of have a monopoly on the diplomas which is something that rebels on time need for their job is not that they choose oh I wanna be educated there are ways to do it is also they need that piece of paper and of course so far only the official universities have that but otherwise yeah there are a bunch of ways there's like even when when was he gone like that they was arrested at it on that he starting the truest on the Ingram yes aliens that something called I told me change the name it's gone a renegade University my stop stop people gonna figure douchebag I got a do a particular thing waiting as he asked me to do these about history of martial arts like oh man I've done actually that's a course I've actually done at UCLA and it was so much fun check this out this was the virus I only had anime and I usually you need a PhD to teach okay and I was a white guy going into an Asian American Studies department going you know yeah case you haven't noticed some knowledge on American and I do only have anime and I never taken a course in Asian American Studies but I would love to teach for you and deal is why and by the time I was done with the teach about history or philosophy of martial arts they were like yeah you're a hired let's go the way okay now why would they would then want you to be Asian because you're teaching about an Asian subject I mean they don't want you to it kind of works that way because of the way you know most of the people who stick taking a bunch of classes in ethnic studies usually people who are from that particular ethnic group in fact I'm kind of people always look at me like huh what's going on here because I do teach in an American Indian studies Department I have taught in an Asian American Studies department but when you look at everybody else usually there are people who are from that particular ethnic group who are passionate enough to dig in that much to be in that field there is that an issue so I push back if you not I mean it's kind of to be fair people have been really cool about it because I mean I've even at the situation where I taught as part of an ethnic let me Studies class where they were like four people right and there's the African American Studies guys an African American guy in the Chicano Latino Chicano Latino and I was the odd one out right I was teaching the American Indian study section they're like hi you just replaced my friend the native lady who the fuck are you I gotta kind of thing right but you know the thing was they wanna check you and then once I did my thing the first few lessons they were like no he's cool we like him it's all good and then there was no bullshit and like I would have expected to run into a lot more pushback that really wasn't one thing in your favor about when it comes to martial arts although it is mostly Asian and origin it vary so widely yes Chinese martial art Japanese Korean I mean it goes on and on Thai there's so many different styles yep and then of course South America once Brazilian Jujitsu got into the mix of course I mean they in my opinion have revolutionized martial arts more than any other group I think that one part of the country in South America and Brazil they had more of an impact on martial arts I think than anyone because they essentially started I mean they started the Ultimate Fighting Championships just to see if their martial art was superior yep and they proved it to be so at least on its own by by itself yeah at first you know before anybody knew about it I think that stuff was there's the whole period from when Japanese martial arts were kind of crushing because nobody was dressing as a samurai anymore you know doing that stuff didn't make sense anymore and jiu-jitsu was seen kind of as low class activity for gangsters and you know there was less and less popularity for that field and then when jigoro kano the creator of judo started he was this nerdish upper-class guy but he was very passionate about judo so he transformed the jujitsu curriculum into judo give it a whole new spin he's like no it's not this thing to beat people up like all the thugs you have seen so far we're using Jude was a form of Education and I know that yeah it's a super cool story and then he starts sending people all over the world to spread it and so they go to Rush and then mix with Russian thing and they create Sambo and then come out here and then with Brazilian jiu-jitsu when Maya goes down to Brazil and all of that so it's like that whole story how it spins is awesome and then you end up with the joy of globalization or like when you see like hoist go to fight against a crab and um you know Brazilian dude trained in what originally was an Asian martial arts transformed into this Brazilian thing wherein Aggie going against aku was more of a catch wrestler with studied more through Western wrestling a whole lot he was hilarious it's like the Japanese guy was a more Western wrestling back yeah but it's funny that is crazy the Japanese especially Sakuraba were way influenced by catch wrestling but which is American folk style wrestling yeah yeah now I didn't know that that jiu-jitsu was used by thugs yeah that was the part of the reason why when Japan Russian in popularity is because he used to be sort of the samurai arts right you do that stuff but then the samurai and that you know by the 1870s or so that was the collapse of the samurai so there really wasn't a function for this stuff anymore is like and the only people who trained were mostly gangsters and kind of rough guys who trained for because they got into fights on the street and then Cano because he was this kind of sickly child they put him in to strain in jiu-jitsu to kind of build him up give me some strength and he was a complete nerd but he loved jiu-jitsu and so he's like no no no don't put it down it's a great art for other reason and he had his own way of spinning it around saying that was the old stuff yeah to beat people up what we do today is a form of education is a relationship with your body any basically invented a new function for it so that Japanese society went oh shit we can still do that stuff and now there's a better reason for it that's fitting the times that's not the same reason why we were trained in the 7900 right these actually fit the context of our time okay that's the judo and then do they have texts where you can see the techniques or we could see what similarities them yeah there are both inch in jiu-jitsu manuals where there are you know the drawings and stuff Lynette and then by the time Cano comes around they even start having footage after a while right footage of actual films of you utilization that they'll or drills they look goofy as hell because they're sped up and they move money and stuff but they yeah there's it's tough and some of these guys are just badasses from day one I mean some of the old judo guys they got the reputation for just being killers yeah well for sure judo I know I wonder how much jiu-jitsu has changed since then to now because obviously in putting so much emphasis on the ground the Brazilians really refined all the submission techniques to a razor-sharp edge and really changed a lot of the original setups and the way people enter into submissions I would love to see what it used to look like even that's funny because if you look alike some old judo that cause in judo where they have is very ground oriented those guys do leg locks like you see these Japanese guys from the 1920s like lock in each other and you're like oh my god so the stuff that today is hot some of these guys were doing and it probably wasn't as a refine but it was like man they were doing it that's that's wrestling Catrin was about like what exactly they were like locking when you know Americans were really into Brazilian jiu-jitsu and stuff is this what he got here Jaime 1600 ad the history of jiu-jitsu or Jawara huh Wow they dressed up in like Aikido kimonos with the big flowing pants and the guys like doing some weird sort of wristlock go-go pit stops crawling go right up there what was it like yeah it looks like yeah he's locking and getting yeah yeah interesting and then the other one it looks like he's got looks like he's setting about full nelson yeah he has a half nelson on one side and he's got an underhook in the other side yes you know yeah probably gonna spin around and slam him right on his face yeah crazy that they have you get to look at it in these images or they were just trying to figure out like what's the best way to manipulate the body mm-hmm it's just amazing to me how much of it came from Japan yep I mean Japan so many interesting techniques and that one area was so vital and so important when it came to the development of martial arts Japan is that weird like the story between China and Japan is very similar to ancient Greece and ancient Rome you know a lot of the developments came from Greece a lot of the developments came from China but then both the Roman and Japanese took those ideas and then ran with it and systematize them gave them a lot more of a structure game made them way easier to learn and to teach yeah and then popularized them as a result and he was like yep now this stuff works it's a lot easier sting to that they brought it to other countries mm-hmm yeah that was part of canons vision because Canon was not a nationalist he did not have these Japan fuck you everybody else he had this idea of like it is universal brotherhood of mankind so we need to bring our stuff so that everybody can benefit from it and and so he sent yeah he them people all over the world that's amazing there was even I did a power called I didn't three-part series on in history on fire about Theodore Roosevelt because he was just such a crazy motherfucker right he's like no an American president that's the wildest dude out there and he in like 1905 9th somewhere right around there he had a guy sent by Cano that told judo to the United States President Wow and so Roosevelt was one of the very first Americans ever to learn some judo he was such an important president man wasn't for him we wouldn't have the national public lands we have today yeah he was awesome he's the you know I generally speaking when you talk about US president is like different degrees of what I don't like it's like okay I hate this guy I mildly hate this guy I really hate this guy total result was one of those dudes right I mean there's some stuff that he didn't say that you're like how's it okay that I wasn't so good but so much of it is awesome what we said you don't like well I mean you got to give him a passport when he lived but of course the his idea about race copper - we will consider cool today not the he has a pretty heavy rate he started a lot more racist than the end that's why also giving ready for that for being yeah very adaptable and cool in the regard but clearly some of his writings was pretty freaky and and also he's one of the guy who just never swore he didn't like you know he's like or yes sure yeah the art of jiu-jitsu is worth more in every then all of our athletics combined President Theodore Roosevelt 1905 I agree yep I agree me and Teddy Roosevelt same page good old you even seem like he lost sight in one eye while he was president because of sparring too hard he go heat way too hard cause he box all the time right so he can see my vision yep he lost visually wanna somebody thumb the president probably yeah wow that's a gangster as president did a lot of big-game hunting - man that guy went all over the world yeah he did why don't the guy really when you think about it my favorite Roosevelt story speaking of badasses in 1912 he's running for president again as a third party candidate which was cool in itself right because I'm challenging both the Republican and Democrats he is in his car waving to the people in somebody shooting from just a few feet away just straight in his chest but at the time he had this a 50-page speech and prepared so he had all the written notes in his pocket he had his glass case in his pocket so the bullet did hit him but it was slowed down by going through the glass case and the speech yeah but still you just took a bullet to the chest you're bleeding and stuff and so everybody's like oh my god we need to take him to the hospital and Elizabeth coffee nice and he said that there's no blood coming out so he's okay my lungs aren't that they haven't been pierced so what are you talking about hospitals I got a speech to give and so he shows up with his shirt covered in blood and he goes like yeah I'm ladies and gentlemen I don't know if you know I have been shot but she takes more than these to kill a bull moose and then deliver a 90-minute speech before some of his attendants finally like kid we now go to the hospital please and they're like okay sure now we can go what was the hospital back then you probably better off not going I don't rub the dead chicken on you're all probably what could they possibly do to fix that back then yeah you know Wow yeah I mean hard times right hard times Creed hard men soft times Creed a lot of weak bitches were seeing it flopping around in our streets today and that's exactly what of the things that rose vote hammers on over and over here this whole idea of the strain was life the idea net you know he came from an upper-class super elitist background and he realized and a lot of people back then were thinking you know our kids are growing up to be a bunch of wimps because they are too pampered and so his solution since he was a teenager was boxing wrestling hunting just these very tough manly things and so that's what he drive Don this whole idea of like yeah you need to hear a great quote about you have to keep your barbaric instincts in order to go along with civilization and I was like that's perfect you know that's the best of both worlds and yeah that guys I had a blast stuff I mean I knew about him but once you get to do a series you really need to know your stuff in and out so it was so fun to study his life because was a standout like that in the times that he did early 1900s I mean really really pretty significant that's that's actually one of the things that I dig about that I do a little different from the way then approaches hardcore history Dan time to look at things from the big picture you know he's telling you big picture stories and I love that but I also like jumping into I like biographies I like some time telling the story of this one guy and what I really meant to be this individual in this story and so I did you know I did to the Roosevelt I did one on Crazy Horse I did one on Caravaggio the painter were talking about one day you will dig I did Jackie Johnson you know the first black heavyweight champion so far you know my favorite Jack Johnson story is you got pulled over spans of course that's exactly I was telling that curly or gonna do jack johnson and he said ward by ward what'd he say he said you know what's my favorite star I wonder if those will tell the stories what happened was he gets pulled over in some southern state I believe he was Georgia at the time when you know being it was Texas might in Georgia everybody has their you know not many people at the cars and Jack Johnson was one of the guys who loved his fast cars and he was speeding so they pulled him over and the cop is like hey boy the it's gonna cost you you owe me $50 and you know back then you could pay your ticket on the spot in cash then jack ransom puh-lease kasha I would start it is a hundred on the top is like I don't have changed for that kind of money and he's like no no no two hours from now I'm gonna be driving back the same way and I'm gonna be doing the same speed so I'm just paying you I hope that was true I refuse to listen to any way that tells me any different fuck that story about the Victorian yeah yeah ignore or give you that one yeah hello you take that one but I want to keep that Jack Johnson story well there are too many that he did in public fits that persona to thing like if it's you know it's it's how it was he was a dude with 1905 1906 around that time was making a living as a black guy beating up white guys in the ring and sleeping with white women yeah who figured it out he did it and he didn't get lynched amazingly enough amazing yeah I mean how did they keep that from happening how'd they keep that guy alive I mean with the racism that existed back then I mean you're talking about just a few decades after slavery he his parents were born in slavery he was the first generation of somebody was not born in slavery in his family and you know they say that at times he did sleep with a gun and there is pure law they did say times yeah well how the fuck could you I mean how can you even sleep back imagine being a black guy at the turn of the century back then who was just in the kind of racism I don't even think we can comprehend today it's something I mean you think about the civil rights movement and all the the you know the hosing of the protesters stuff like that that was 60 years later that's the mellow stuff yeah that's everybody chilled out by then there was Theodore Roosevelt and Booker T Washington for dinner at the White House and it was the first time ever done a black guy was officially invited for dinner at a White House right after he had the dinner there was such a backlash like some some senators from the south started flipping out and I forget the exact words but one of the guys at one point said you know after a president idi sing we are gonna now have to lynch a thousand niggers in our state put them back in their place and you're like I'm sorry try that again that's the US senator and he was parity accepted I was just in the LA Times about Jack Johnson said you know why didn't Jim Jeffries kill him that brutal beast that you know the stuff that you read the quotes are like come on somebody must have made it tough because they couldn't beat their racist house in the LA Times oh you was that Johnson won the title I believe in 1908 I want to say and but all even in the previous year she was making a reputation for being this badass fire it's amazing that a hundred and ten years ago we were that fucked up that's so recent well when when he had the fight with Jim Jeffries was the old undefeated white champion you know because when he won the title and then he started they started throw-in a bunch of white guys a team that he crashes the great white all right then eventually the writer Jacqueline don't started this campaign to bring Jim Jeffries the undefeated white champion back from retirement to redeem the white race and Jim Jeffries was a beast right he was a Hulk of a man strong and knocked out all of his opponents Maria being retired for a while and so he comes back they have this fight in Reno Nevada on July 4 1910 by the time the fight is over injections of crushes him and wins the title you know defense title is there are riots in 25 states in 50 different cities and by the time the riots are done like dozens of people are dead they caused Jackie Johnson I beat and Jim Dreyfus and were they listening to it over the radio at the time there wasn't even really like they had like Telegraph news sent to the newspaper and there would be a guy in this public square screaming Johnson just landed a left hook that is crazy it's in San Francisco they had they had two boxers re-enact the news of sent by telegraph saw what was going on everybody just walked around back then I mean look at these people wandering through the streets even like when there was a fight going on like there's no one now answers so there's no commentary right yes it sit down and watch yeah this is no TV no no this is this is Jeffrey straining this is clearly Jeffrey strain in training camp then yeah there it is there yes and back then you could clinch a lot in boxing which was kind of Jack Johnson's old style he would get like double bicep control usually he would keep you there so you can't hit him and then once in a while he would break free throw an uppercut and go back to clinching did he was fucking jacked for the time yeah when you think about this time like people back then you know there was no fucking supplements yeah they barely knew how to work out exactly you know even when he's punching like his technique is very different yeah and also they had to be really concerned about breaking their hands because they were fighting with these little tiny ass gloves and it's like MMA gloves with thumbs and some of these fights like they were scheduled for insane things like I believe this one was scheduled for 45 rounds 400 rounds ago I think 15 fought at 2:00 p.m. in July in Nevada and their hundred and ten degree weather it's like wow who does that you know 110 degree were in fucking Reno yep crazy everyone the crowds wearing the same hat that's a good point Jamie look they all wore those goofy ass fucking hats yeah like why did everybody like when I look sexy want to wear a nice hat well I watched a white race succeed like how many black people in the audience know many you've done that yet they say that the band before Jack Johnson came onto the ring shortly before they announced the event he came on the band was playing this popular song of the time called all Coons look alike to me Wow that's right before he comes on so this is like one of those things where like people are hoping that the bad guy loses so they're they're millions of people are paying attention because they want Jack Johnson to lose it's not that they're hoping a good fight takes place and let's see who wins they wanted to get this guy off the throne this wasn't even about boxing this was about race yeah really kind of amazing and when as long as it did yeah and here they are they're in the 13th round you ought to be a different kind of human to fight with those little gloves for as many rounds as these people fought yep no those guys were fascinated or who else have you covered on your podcast biographies let me think that you really like change the way you feel about them Jack Johnson was awesome I had so much fun studying that way you know all the biographies done are some of my favorites did you see unforgivable blackness yeah yeah that was the first thing when I started the research that was where I started I started watching the Ken Burns documentary which was great and that kind of gave me the basics of the story and I'm like okay I see where all of it is going now go back do the tedious stuff of read every damn book about him and plug in all the information and stuff but yet the documentary is great yeah I love that one so who else have you done that really like stood out for you know the big ones have been crazy or caravaggio Theodore Roosevelt and Jack Johnson those are the biographies I've done Crazy Horse is a fascinating one are they still doing that crazy South Dakota sculpture of him yeah I mean I don't know because the guy who started the project is long dead so second they depend on private money so they are not really moving at that well it's also isn't it kind of fucked because there was no pictures of Crazy Horse we literally have no idea what I look like if you're doing this you're just essentially like guessing I mean they could use your face completely yeah yeah I think they should use my face yeah why not duh but yeah that's a better story right there because there was a guy he kind of ever he's almost like watching a Marvel thing about Wolverine you know he has this superpower the guy was a beast in warfare but everyone he loved around him died and so you have these kind of tragic figure of the guy was a beast but for all his powers it can protect the ones he loved well he fought naked and cut little pieces of his body off like he cut chunks of flesh off all over his body his entire body was like a mosaic of scars there was yeah it was even before like a couple of weeks before about tell of the Little Bighorn which is the famous battle with castor and all of that there was a Sitting Bull one of the other main Lakota leaders participated in in Sundance and one of the thing they did was kind of cut like fifty flesh offering on each arm where do you kind of cut this like pin size needle of your flesh but still and the whole point is to go into these strands partially from the pain partially from the hydration partially pray around all of it and the store is that symbol then at this vision that they were gonna be attacked the troops were gonna reach their camp but they were gonna get crushed and so the vision was even had a battle shortly thereafter and Sitting Bull's like yeah this wasn't it this wasn't close to our camp the vision is they are attacking our camp and that's when supposedly the whole little big orange thing that's why they were feeling kind of like we can handle it we're good with this she was she knew that was true the whole you know vision yeah there's the thing about that kind of a culture where the stories that they say like a lot of the time in order to get a reputation for being the guy who can say hey I had a vision and people actually believed you you need to have proven something along the way you need to have because I mean anybody can say I had a vision and it's like yeah that's great show us are you can you now see all that dude yes or no if you can't shut up you're just hallucinating what can you say I have a vision and then it comes true exactly as you said well in that case people like okay now we're paying attention next time you have a vision please tell us but if you say I had a vision that these happen and nothing happened everybody like shut up you're just I just wish we knew that like him going into a state of mind where he was almost dying because right like what was that a man called horse movie where they did that thing that's that Barb's through your nipples and hang you from the ceiling that's the Sundance I've been actually to because that was illegal for a really long time right then they brought it back in the open in the 1970s and I've been to I think seven son dances really do that yeah ended by their nipples they usually don't get suspended and is non nipples is just yeah the chest muscle well they don't go under the muscle is just skin but they go up on top and they so they usually don't get suspended but they dance attached with the rope to the tree and then when they wanna break loose they just rip right through and you know you got like this quarter sized scar out of it and which you know when you think about the whole idea of sacrifice is something that they do in all the religions pretty much to different degrees you know back in the day animal sacrifice was huge that was one of the things and you know these guys have it as you shed blood because that's your energy that's the one thing and that will give strength to your prayers and all of that stuff but yeah first time I ever saw it I was like holy shit this is intense do you think this probably also something to that where they're trying to put people through something to make them stronger mm-hmm there definitely is that aspect that is like yeah this is not something that somebody does really nearly like oh I'm gonna Sundance tomorrow is like no you don't mess around it now that this ritual in fact is probably to strengthen their resolve and make their better warriors just by having experienced such a horrific ritual ritual ritual practice of ripping meat off your tits the one story that they say legit that looks legit I don't know yeah it looks like a guy was on Venice Beach right now the there's a story that they say about Crazy Horse that when he was a kid to toughen him up he's dead killed the turtle that they were going to it but the story goes that the turtle heart keeps beating after it's dead for a while and carved out the turtle and pull out the still beating heart and gave it to Crazy Horse to eat it raw and yeah rot her heart I don't recommend heel beating yeah what kind of fucking diseases you get from turtle hearts but I would say cook that well done right that's the only way to have something good turtle heart yeah I mean what kind of parasites and shitter and turtles turtles eat everything right but that's also what's fun is like when you think about like wolves or you think about people who live super close to nature they could stuff that if we try today we're dead in 30 seconds right and they were fine look at that it's beating yep googled it and it came up right away Wow turtle heart is just going off did you hear about that guy who just got fired I think it was in Iowa he was a schoolteacher he fed a snapping turtle a puppy in the middle of class what the hell you know I did know that yeah yeah he he's currently suspended that's what I think yeah yeah

cool there's fuckin we have a profound Apocrypha fine by me don't you think do you uh you're probably more aware of that than the average person because your study of history I mean the the Hippocrates of the human race are most exposed by going over them and watch these patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again yeah no I mean it's that's why to me I'm completely fascinated by the inner workings of the human mind because the way that people can spin stories to themselves to justify stuff that in another context what we consider completely insane that kind of goes back to that like the average person is a flag in the wind that can go any way you know it how are you close is it that like 200 years ago if you tell people the slavery overwhelming majority of people be like of course slavery school what's wrong with leaving it Oh kind of a freak are you your anti-slavery are you insane and if you say today you know you're gonna have like what 0.01 percent of the population would be cool with it and and yet were the same people two hundred years have gone by but suddenly what was completely normal at one point is considered batshit crazy today yeah it is weird it's weird it's it's constantly changing you know constantly evolving and it doesn't always need to make sense just this is what's the new thing up this is the new way of being and you know there's always a small percentage of our population that's not gonna go along with the program that's gonna be like no this is a stupid idea but but the average is just gonna go wherever critical mass is tilting they are gonna go with it yeah well listen man I gotta wrap this up but always a beautiful thing to talk to you my brother you go check out Danielle Ebola Lee's podcast is called history on
