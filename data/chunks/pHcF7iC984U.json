the Joe Rogan experience can we start every show that you're on like that little song powerful Amy Schumer song why not you could do it you could demand that feels right yeah why don't we above riders you know they put a lot of weird shit in there like white M&Ms and fucking I heard I have the cheapest the guy I've been on the road son I have the cheapest rider he's ever seen it is Louie yes cheapest like what's your rider what do you do will you require it's like honestly vegetables and fruit first movie it's some Greek yogurt it's just like he's like yeah and we're wine which I tell him to hide for me unless I ask for wood about a pair white sneakers well there's some artists that do demand things like that they demand like every time I go to one of these places I always ask the guys backstage like what's the craziest shit you've ever seen because a lot of these dudes that are like working in these comedy clubs or these especially these theaters that have seen like rock and roll bands coming through you always want to know like what come on man what's the craziest shit you seen just rock and roll coke stories for the most part that's what everybody has I mean I wouldn't repeat the stories couldn't want to get anybody in trouble but they're mostly just coke and naked people stories I ever heard was TJ Miller yeah he asked for either an actual or a picture of a pinata in the Greeners so like sometimes the promoter has to like draw the picture of opinion on there but until recently there was some mistake we're told drivers not to look at me or not to talk to me like something was in there and in December I heard that and I go oh my god that's not supposed to be there please take that out and they haven't I just found out they doing it so it's such horrible tension in this on this ride and then they're like they're like and I'll talk to Mike oh you know it says I'm nuts but and I'm like oh my god that's so embarrassing like me being like no don't talk to me I've had that in my rider accidentally as well not even accidentally like it was a conversation that somebody must have had with someone like you shouldn't talk to him like what are you talking about like that that's ridiculous yeah I used to be really pained by small talk actually like on the road because you've so many little interactions but but Colin Quinn like really turned me on to small talk he goes so hard into small talk that like people go the other way it's like an art form to him he one driver at a time one person were to the hotel like he's just he'll small talk you to death and it and it really has it really as like sort of changed the road for me I've had some great drivers I had some really really hilarious dudes I had in New Orleans that grew up in New Orleans and had no idea how crazy New Orleans was and really in yeah and in comparison to the rest of the country like there's certain things you just get away with in New Orleans like walking down a street with an open beer like he was the cops pulled him over he was and he was only like you know a couple hours outside of New Orleans he said he drove a couple hours and he's out there with a beer like sitting there by his car drinking this beer and the cop pulls over and the cop starts asking him questions and while the cops talking to him he puts the one beer down and cracks open another one like nothing starts drinking the second beer and the cop was like are you out of your fucking mind like what are you doing goes wait a minute the car goes where you from and the guy goes New Orleans he's like oh okay listen you can't do that here I can't do that anywhere else you live in a crazy place that's my favorite place but I've seen I've seen the worst stuff there the worst the worst violent the combination of everything bad and I went to college in Baltimore like not a coincidence that they filmed the wire there but in New Orleans I was like 17 I was in a volleyball tournament and I was in a haagen-dazs and I saw these like two guys straight from the Bayou and they were talking they were both like hitting on this girl and they didn't know that it was a hooker and they didn't know that it was a guy yeah you know that's dark and they looked like celebrating that this hot girl was talking to them and I was like oh one of them is about to catch a dick that's hilarious a friend of mine went to California and my friend Eddie we're in we were right by the comedy store you know that hotel by the comedy store that ramp that's going up yeah and this woman was driving up the up the hill and my friend Eddie was dude that chick is so fucking hot oh my god we'll go hot that girl is yeah and she was a transvestite who had a transsexual that had done a piece on the man show with us and I said oh I know her and like she's a he he's like no fucking way I go well not anymore she's not she used to be I guess she's still kind of is cuz she has a penis still sexual is someone who has gotten their sex change okay transvestite is someone dressed as a woman you know you could be a crossdresser too it's kind of weird when you define you know like what they are like what it would it what is a person who dresses like Jim Norton but I mean not even if they I mean not even like a sexual thing because if it a dress like I think you could be a transvestite and be completely heterosexual like Eddie Izzard I think just cross dresses or he did anyway but doesn't like he's very straight I think great I don't know you know I I don't know why he did that but it worked whatever it is on stop and it's obviously that he's got talent outside of that but whatever it is he worked he um he did an amazing thing once where he ran around Europe did you ever see that documentary no my respect for him shot through the roof see that annoyed me I don't even know anything about it but him doing that like it makes me feel lazy and right away I'm like you have to see it to understand what he did because it was incredibly impressive it was I guess it was on the UK on TV and it didn't get on TV in America you got to watch on the internet but he ran like everyday ran a marathon any yeah he ran all around Europe it's the same what he did was insane he also does act like an Arab he does is acting like a bunch of different languages yeah whatever he does it and he's a bad motherfucker that guy's amazing he's like Beyonce he ran around the fucking I mean he's not an athlete this is the thing he didn't do it when he was in shape he did it when he was fat he just did it he just forced his body to do it he finished a 1100 mile marathon around Britain oh yeah exactly but it's so right away you like just respect that because right oh my god what are you running from what are you trying to escape from and maybe my defense making don't think he's escaping or running from anything he did it all for charity and he was oh he had a goal he set this goal in his mind and he just decided to try to complete this goal what was the tragic charity Jamie does it say I don't know he looks great that might just be a website that sponsored it there was some some aspect of it was related to charity Oh his body transformed during the time he did it he ran a hunt a thousand fucking miles but like he had the most great horrendous blisters on his feet I mean his skin was torn apart on his feet just because his body was just so unused to this that's something you try just trying to build up to running a marathon just a marathon that's a fucking serious physical undertaking I'd be like whatever the charity I couldn't do it this guy did a hundred of them I mean Jesus Christ I mean how many how many did he run 30 or something 343 marathons and we're all of them a standard marathon rate of 26 miles is that what it is that's a marathon right 36 miles yeah that's incredible is that the YouTube video or like a website no there is a YouTube video of it you could watch the whole thing every step of the way and there was parts of it where he was running really really really really slow but he did not fucking quit it's incredible like you you know you just look at this guy pushing himself his knees are falling apart his feets falling apart and he just gets up there and he just fucking keeps running I I just think I can't I can't help it I'm like what's he running from but why is he running from something who he's trying to accomplish something right like you don't want to date anybody that shows up at the gym at 6 a.m. like come on no I know I think being motivated and wanting to take care of yourself is one thing but then I think something that insane I mean if it's to raise money for charity like mm-hmm why don't you do stand-up and they'll put that on TV in America because because he's got a goal set a goal to see if he could pull it off I think we have to agree to disagree because I think it's cool like him and like I think he's really funny and so I feel bad no look you've got a point you've got a point I mean why not just ask people to donate the money or donate the money yourself or you got a point nobody I mean but not like I mean of course then why even have a fund raiser but I'm just saying to do that I don't know I I know zero about it except what you just told me but but it right away that's what I think here's here's another optimistic way of looking at or positive way of looking at it he's also on top of what he's doing he's inspiring people because what he did is an incredible accomplishment running 1,100 miles did you inspire me to do anything inspire the feeling in me really you just you just thought like that's a me well you just appreciate humans like doing amazing shit and I just I'm like yeah wait every year the marathon no but I really like going down to the marathon in New York and like Rudy it's so like everyone's so excited like really emotional but I'm like you know do you give a shit about the Olympics when the Olympics come around I not the Winter Olympics I just cannot give a shit about the Winter Olympics but I like that I like gymnastics I get into some some Olympics you know what's the biggest tragedy in all sports is that the Olympics that they don't pay the athletes I thought it was like dupit amount of money you know those have those professional athletes you know the idea that they're amateur athletes is fucking preposterous the amount of revenue that gets generated by their athletic performances is fucking staggering wait because it's so much it's an incredible amount of it's an incredible amount of money that the Olympics itself generates itself when people are watching the Olympics there's fucking millions of people around the world untold millions watching at the same time and the advertising resident revenue is stupendous I mean they must make unbelievable amounts of money it cost a lot of money to put it on it's not a free event but the amount of profit that's generated by the Olympics must be fucking phenomenal yeah it's an excellent opportunity for young athletes you know be more excellent paying bitch give them some fucking money not a little money either a shit ton of money they throw away their entire childhoods and then like one of them makes a lot of money and like there's like a dozen girls never getting their period there should be such a weak this should be some sort of scale you know where a certain amount of accomplishment leads to a certain amount of revenue yeah because that's the thing when you're younger you're like oh if you make it to the Olympics you're just rich like I thought it was like Hunger Games and you were like a victor you just like win so much money right but really it's like well even ballerinas I'm like oh my god only like a handful of you make it where you can make a bunch of money and still you're just beating your body to to a pulp but then a lot of them like never even get there and make no money a lot of them right like what's the number I don't I don't know I talked to a ballerina last season on my show and she said like if you're starring in a ballet if you're like V New York ballerina you make like I think under 500 a year how much to do whenever you do Olympic athletes actually make some money okay does say they do this is the the actual numbers the Olympic Committee Awards cash prizes to Olympians who win a medal $25,000 for a gold $15,000 for a silver and $10,000 for a bronze but the money is considered earn income abroad and subject to irx taxation so when you win an Olympic gold medal you win $25,000 which that's um that's you know hey that's a good wage if you're a fucking Burger King employee yeah that's hard son unbelievable what's the hope that you like a person that they're like okay now like Nike or somebody who wants it exactly you'll get sponsored you'll you'll be sponsored by several different companies you make some money off of that and you know maybe you'll be able to do seminars and shit 25 you get the gold I talked to a model like I was like what do models make here they just but the ones at the very top of the game of course are making tons of money but the like really beautiful chicks that are working models make around that like they make like maybe 50 grand a year from see that's not what I've heard really yeah my buddy's dating this chick who is a model and like modeling quotes she's been know she's like a real nice doesn't advertising campaigns and she makes sometimes she makes six thousand dollars a day fifteen thousand dollars in the day she's made as much as twenty five thousand dollars in a day just yeah posing she's not famous she's young yeah yeah just stupid amounts of money I think it varies so what I'm trying to say but even like that's not a big campaign I think it varies but I know only like three models but they they work and they they've gotten a campaign here there they are on the runway and it sounds like once it's like a corporate like once in a while they'll make a pretty good payday but it's not consistent and and it's not that my didn't sound like that much to me for being that hungry all the time well some of them isn't it just they can do it naturally like someone who don't have to struggle as much like weightless have that body shape and ectomorphic body shape like honestly I've only talked to three models cuz it's not fun to be around them but but they even if they're like naturally pretty thin they still before doing that stuff had to do liquid stuff and what's the thing where you shoot saline and you're wide in your bottle you shoot saline oh that thing was something like oh I thought it was like a treatment or something you do before use that clean that's clean it trust me it looks rushed I don't want you to have to shit broadcast and ruin what I know it's gonna be the best podcast ever what's pulled through the same show um enemas where were we all models would it what the fuck is it about anybody like why would anybody get really hung up on the idea of incredibly skinny people wearing their clothes I don't know but it looks good but what I've heard is that it's like a hangar that's the idea that you're on I'm almost built like a hangar well I just had a fitting today and it was like with someone who knew what they're doing which I haven't had that much of anyway and she told me that it's all about proportion because like a lot of people they think that I'm like actually bigger than I am like people I'm a size six and people don't know what that means um like bigger than a for smaller date okay anyway but um but then like they've been like but I'm like there's some websites or whatever because you can like pick what's her bra size or what's her size oh come on you'll be like yeah I think there's like website let's say I'm like a 12 or something but whatever but anyway it's all about proportion and not and not really about how big or small somebody actually is but these models that like do the best that the clothes look the best it is like a hanger they're like basically frail up here mm-hm and it looks but clothes like all clothes look dope on them but there's only like a very small amount of chicks that you can you can work I think there's also a very different feeling that a woman has when she looks at another woman and a man has when he looks at a woman as far as like what looks good and what doesn't look good there's a lot of things that girls do that other girls think look good like there's certain ways that they'll dress or certain things that they'll buy purses and shit especially there's really to impress other girls but you cannot impress a guy with a purse but women are like really some of them are like really into purses to impress each other yeah I don't like shoes purses jewelry I know nothing I I don't have that like I'm missing that you probably funny I'm just like no it's I mean but I think I could be like oh that girl like looks great but I don't even aspire to try it because it seems so out of my out of my range but I can look at a girl and be like wow she's beautiful but I'm not like oh like lemme I wonder what she looks like naked you know obviously cuz I'm not attracted to girls I sounds like I'm like defending myself but um but it's so weird to me but I understand it because I feel when someone's really thin like all the things that we want to do naturally like eat and fuck and everything we like celebrate people that are able to abstain the most from that like know like like oh god she really knows how to starve ourselves um like yeah like she's so he just we sort of like celebrate people just keeping themselves from biology that's a big one for women to write the ability to abstain it's very it's like it's a badge of courage or something it's like nothing wrong well why should you the idea that we're supposed to is so crazy the only problem with women is of course that there's so many guys that are pieces of shit it's the men are more dangerous in they're physically in the pieces of shit that you run into whereas women are more dangerous maybe financially the pieces of shit that you run into what do you mean well you know if a guy gets fucked over usually guys get fucked over in a financial way like divorces or they get set up like I've seen I've seen guys get set up and it's very disturbing when you guy with any money like I seriously have never even dated a guy I've met I've met guys where I watched them go down I saw it happening they were not attractive they were uncomfortable with women and they had also this really hot girl with them who like slowly but surely stalks her way in this position and then fails with a ton of cash then how isn't that transparent don't these guys that are 80 aren't they know everything curious like why this beautiful Kate Upton look-alike like because I'm suspicious of any guy who's better-looking than me that wants to sleep with me I'm like what why like what do you think I'm not gay I'm not gay I'm Jim don't you but don't you wonder and I know a lot of I know not a lot but I know a handful of women that had guys take their money because I think women are even more susceptible to like just wanting that love and being sure joint checking I'll buy a house in our name I don't think it's mutually exclusive I mean you can get ripped off no matter what your sex is whether what we our sexual preference I'm sure gay guys rip each other off and gay women rip each other as a matter of fact I know they do I'm so like I know a gay woman has to pay alimony my great-grandma was a bootlegger and she was always yeah her liquor store is still on 54th Street Schumer's liquors Wow forestry where um in between Park and Lex or or mentalism yeah it's right across from monkey bar that is fucking awesome what a great story yeah but she she was all she was just pounding it in my head like because she I think her husband tried to steal money from her but she like put it away she's always like save your money good for her yeah you know it can happen you get with the wrong person the wrong guy the wrong girl whatever that can definitely happen but I think that happens more with men men tend to be the ones who have more money in the relationships I don't know what it is but whatever it is I'm not saying that women can't make money don't jump down my throat I'm just no I'm not saying you st. people out there on the Internet I wish that I wish that I've ever dated a guy anything really deal yeah I'm I make I make a good amount of money now you know now so it's weird like yeah cuz guys are just like yeah start dating athletes yes padlock once - first of all I cannot pretend to be interested in what basketball in any I like going to games but I can't like I don't ever want to be like wearing a jersey and being like they're gonna I just don't want to slip you that giant athlete's dick do you know I still haven't been with a black guy once maybe I'm scared I'll be under the trance mm-hmm you will you'll be dancing you'll change I may add and change you were start wearing beads you should wear jerseys a dress going bearing you go hardcore not a vh1 reality show like fighting with other chicks no you'll avoid that you'll be fine change your personality entirely you're just gonna crave the black dick no you know I had one encounter with a huge stick and I talked about it on my last special I doubt I was like no way well maybe the dude didn't know how to use it he was assaulting you with it I mean how many ways are there to use it yes don't you just go like oh you really don't think about it really I don't when it's that big like what are you supposed to do you just have to like stretch out your vagina oh yeah I was like I'm not we're not gonna have a life together I'm not gonna shower through this well how about powering through how about you change your shape how about stretches out just like when a woman has children her breasts stretch out and then deflate imagine no having sex with that guy on a regular Plus super athletes probably constantly horny oh my god no are the our efforts known as being horny oh yeah for sure for real you kidding me any yeah I would imagine I'm never in a relationship where it's like I have the same sexual appetite as the guy I'm dating it's either like they are like wanting it too much or it's me wanting it too much like it's I've never really had it even out thank you yeah yeah where it's been like yeah that's good that's yeah I mean it definitely happens it's how I think it's way harder for check I mean I'm just guessing now obviously I think if but I don't know if like if your girl is like no not tonight does it like hurt your feelings are you like what's wrong with me or you're just like uh no or some hard or it doesn't want to or whatever you know yeah but also you've been you know if you're with somebody for a long time it's different I don't think there's any reason why you know two people can't figure out that they're not sexually compatible and if you start dating each other and you get to a point where you're like spending a lot of time together and then you hit those that thing I don't want I don't look I don't want it like whoa okay we don't figure out what's important here because there's a bunch of shit that's important here the big important one is caring about each other and having a good time together that's the number one that's number one but number two is you like to fuck each other and if you don't put it at number two what are you putting at number two yeah what is there what's number two financial security I mean what is it the coexisting interest now I have almost nothing Co interest with my wife there's not one thing that she likes up a few TV shows and some art things and some but her all her hobbies like things that she enjoys they're just her things and then you know we we hang out we have fun together like you don't have to have the same mutual desires or the same he can not have to be into the same sports like I've actually heard guys saying that they would never date a girl that doesn't watch sports cuz the last thing you want is her complaining when you're watching sports fuck that she doesn't watch sports I don't want to date him yeah I was seen on the my show tomorrow night about that it's called chicken hang I just want to tell you about it but yeah it's guys sitting around she's like a lantern jaw and like really you know yeah like she does my fantasy picks and then you realize like they're just describing dudes like it's just but I mean I know I mean I know girls that are real into sports but and I'm not but but the difference is I'm I don't I don't care about sports at all but I'm not like and I don't want you to like I'm busy and I'm psyched to do my thing and I have my interests and like please dude you I saw a tweet once where a girl said that girls who were into football get bigger diamonds I was like wow those Twitter pictures and like a bunch of people like retweeted it and I think it was like a girl with like a sexy football outfit on or something you know that's so awful and I think that's like the image that's like what girls see and even I've been going cuz the NBA is like a big part of this movie that I'm gonna do oh shit what did I say Amy gonna get some black dick for the first time I don't say it didn't happen but any nobody who remembers in the Internet but anyway like you know seeing these just seeing the way women are represented on TV like all these Real Housewives like just know no one's doing even if they're like oh we had like this luncheon for for charity like good whatever good the thing that's getting edited and what we're seeing is you guys being monsters and like this is these shows this is what girls are seeing like I don't know anything I mean jewelry like I don't know the girls that I'm close to no one cares about a handbag no one no one gives a shit but that's they're all comics yeah well you're all a bunch of artists you're all trying to be comedians if you if a comic like all the sudden became incredibly obsessed with keeping like an upstanding or attractive appearance that would like immediately preclude a lot of the comedy yeah you know because you wouldn't you wouldn't be relaxed at all you'd be like such a you're inciting like a look away of someone looking at you like look at her with their pack mm what a lot of money people care about that stuff and it's not that I think I'm better than that it's honestly insane to me mm-hmm it's it's insane to me that anybody would put value on like just that's it's so transparent like look this is expensive like I just I think that's I think it's totally right but let's play devil's advocate yeah what if you are just really into beautifully crafted things whether it's a watch or whether it's a car or whether it's a purse isn't it possible that it couldn't that I see that a lot of people I believe you're right a lot of people they're watching that stuff and they're looking at different people that have different things and they they want to show off they want to show everybody that they've got the purse that costs XO the shoes that cost Y or oh my God look at the size of the rock she's got there's certainly people that won't do that but isn't it possible that there's other people that could just enjoy a beautiful purse yeah or enjoy a beautiful home I also haven't I haven't like seen that I don't know anyone with really expensive stuff so if someone was like look at this watch it costs 20 grand like I've never seen that and maybe I'd like wow that's amazing I'm about comfort and like I like traveling you know I like my bed is expensive like I like you know thing right sort of lend themself to experience but I haven't seen but you know what if you have so much money and you're like oh I want to get this beautiful thing I understand that but I I do know a lot of dudes that are like posting pictures of their possessions they got on Instagram yeah yeah oh come on like you don't have to do that well they some dudes have to but why what is it mean well they don't have to of course they don't but it's rappers it's like rappers are like I got this mm-hmm you know and obviously I actually love hip-hop but that was the lyric I just went to I've got this like I don't that's obviously not what they say but it's you know it's like a lot of it is like about about how much fashions yeah showing your shit off going on the dub magazine cover with six cars and yeah yeah of course that's part of that culture so I think that's what that's where that comes from it's like touch just ego just like alpha well it's also a culture that's rebounding from periods of extremes like slavery extreme poverty like there's generation after generation of of negative things the racism the riots the the the civil rights movement like all those things are so recent it's hard for us to even wrap our head we're so white - it's you know we don't we don't feel it but I have friends that are half black half white have friends that are black I've seen the differences in how people react to them and it's fascinating to watch you know like big dark black dudes gets treated with fear everywhere they go it's hilarious I that really is upsetting I I I never really paid that much attention to it cuz like a couple of my best friends growing up were black now they're what no they were black and like I never really thought about it until like going on auditions because the sign-in sheet would be like for the whatever susan and i sign in and then it's like drug dealer and then it's just like these black guys are coming in they're like signing in and i'm like oh man like this is just what what a society is done they're like this is how we see you like these guys were great actors it's like someone's got to play the drug dealer would you want to be a great actor you'll have to be some real drug dealer with the fuck you trying to say you liberal bitch no we had last season on the show we had a guy he was a mugger and then in the scene it was called skip therapy and it's a really funny scene it's like and Kyle Dunnigan the comic is in it and and this guy like steals my bag and we needed to be a stunt guy and so but I forgot that so the guy came he was this great stunt guys names actually Muhammad Ali but that's his name and he came and I was well I was like we cast this black guy as the mugger like are you serious there were no like he's like really great at martial arts the best is when you have a white mugger that doesn't look like a mugger at all yeah Oh God I hate when shows do that was unsigned felt like there's some shows or the guy steals the purse and you're like oh my god never has this guy even run before yeah I'm sure yeah I I don't think we could ever even wrap our heads around what it would be like to be discriminated against solely basic you know just completely based on the way you look to have it feel like that's insurmountable and then once you do make it and you you know but you get big I could see all the the braggadocious behavior being like exuberant exuberant people look at me like just getting on stage you know just like my first whatever like ten years I feel like it was like it's like oh this bitch like I look like I'm gonna be a dumb bitch no you're so crazy you do not look dumb you saying dumb bitch meaning just a woman are you dumb wait you think you'd love them I think I look like I've like if I saw me in like a mall I'd be like I mean like well you people have known who you are for so long but do you like how did people like I mean I look like a meathead for sure I'd be like but I have a lot of meat had tendencies it's like it's a rational prejudiced to think of me as a meathead I mean I'm a fucking cage fighting commentator for god sake right and I am a dumb bitch I'm a dumb bitch too I consider myself a silly bitch yeah but I mean there's but the problem is that we have this idea that everyone's so different and then these people that are so different can't be friends like I have friends that don't work out ever I mean Brian is my friend Brett Brian is like just started working out I feel like for years you started working out and smoke cigarettes constantly he's totally unhealthy I mean just stops like he's not like well my point is like I'm not like it's not like I can't hang out with other people that don't fucking live words like to watch fighting like I know my friends are all good for you like that I mean like I know you're in shape and whatever but that's not but I mean I've also spoken you but I don't know if I just like walk past you yeah I know I think it's just it's easy to pigeonhole people and I think there's a lot of us that are a combination of things and that's the people that are most fascinating to me when I meet someone and I think that they're you know I prejudge for whatever reason and think all this since probably this and then it turns out that there are a combination of things that I've never even met before yeah those are the greatest when you meet someone that doesn't fall in any category yeah and you get to go oh I have misconceptions and then like this person is just a unique individual completely on their own little trip and cool to see and then the app that runs in your database and now you're spectrum is sort of broadens a little bit your ideas that's one of the things that I think one of the reasons why people getting there's so many shit relationships because there's spectrum is like super narrow they've only had like a narrow band of people and the type of experiences have been like really similar and negative over and over again but other than it just being a specific like type you know socio-economic that kind of stuff don't you think it's just like those patterns that were set up just real early on just from young shit it definitely can be for sure you also get it from your parents I think plus and and - I think some people see their parents involved in like really negative relationships and they completely change their gears and they just reject it like from the jump you know they don't take any shit from anybody they don't anybody fucking turn them into a doormat either or sometimes yeah yeah I do that I do the em I do the for my god you can't give me the love I need and yeah that's that's a part of the whole reason why we became comics is because we had a whole yeah we're trying to shove some funny in their stuff up that hole and anybody who doesn't have that hole guess what that's what you're not funny yeah I think it was - yeah I think you can't you can't be a comic unless you're on balance but I think somewhere along the line you can be balanced at least I like to believe so that you can balance it out yeah you could right the ship just gotta figure out like what is what are your needs like as far as like your psychological needs and how do you meet those how do you how do you maintain a good psychological exists yeah I feel like I'm getting healthier yeah I hope but I feel like that because yeah you're more successful so you more relaxed - that's got to benefit you a bit I'm I am more relaxed but I don't but it's just yeah I'm just like less stressed by some things but I am having like sort of more pressure on me but I think it's nice showbiz pressure yeah but I think it's just like taking a step back and keeping the people close to you that will tell you like that was stupid or like you're right dogshit just people who keep it real so I've like people I trust and you keep it real for yourself - I mean you can tell you think you constantly questioning things and do you worry about that though because that is an issue with a lot of people people worry about becoming famous then all sudden going cuckoo because we've kind of seen it yeah definitely I've I do worry about cuz I'm you get so like every day I feel like you somebody like slaps you in the face the way I started going out on the road was on The Last Comic Standing tour and we had to do meet and greets after every show and sometimes it was like an arena like 3,000 people however many would wait and they voted for some people so some would come over to me and be like my husband likes you but I know so I just like got used to and it was like 40 cities or something and I just got used like this defense it's just like built-in to me now so I'm like I've been like trying to break down forget my childhood insecurities like what happened just the first times I went out on the road so I'm afraid my defenses it got so built up that I had to really like break them down so that I could sort of let the right ones in but I am afraid that my defenses will get too strong because you'll see like really famous people that are like your idols or comics you love and you meet them and they're so disappointing because they're so withholding and it's like you're like yeah that's probably because they've been wronged by so many interactions but you still can't let that happen to you and so what that is something that I am aware of and I don't want to let happen at me because I am I am like you know afraid of of somebody saying something or like hurting they're trying to take too much and you know what I think about it with Louie Louie CK when I when I first was interacting with him he was like kind of standoffish with me and and he should have been because I'm sure I'm sure I wanted something from him you know just being a newer comic you see someone and you know what the clubs like they huh like there's like you just have this urgency as a comic like and you don't know what to do like no one can tell you this is what you do to be a better comic this is what you do to get work even if they tell you just get on stage as much as possible you could can't hear it so Louie being so like sort of guarded with me he should have been and now like we've a very nice rapport and it's always good to see him when we talk and I and I kind of like resented him a little bit for being being cold to me at first but I'm like I'm like he should have been because I'm sure I didn't even know what I wanted from him but I'm sure I wanted something from him so I get it but but also like you were saying before we're on the air like just you know somebody people project stuff unto you if they have like an interaction that's less than satisfactory but it's not about you like you can't change how anybody feels about you so but I'm whenever my long rant my point is just like I'm trying not to become an asshole and to be broke well the benefit of the doubt at least like I'll go into every interaction like hi and then if they say something to me that shuts me down then that's you know at least I went into it open right I feel what you're saying and I I think that that concern is a good thing to have and it's cool that you're thinking like that because we all need to learn from the people that we've seen that have disappointed us yeah yeah well though we've seen that you know just for whatever reason someone became a prick because it came fameless' yeah that's happened to a lot of comedians I've seen it I've seen it and they stopped being funny - there's another weird thing that happens they get a little too famous too much adulation too much you know they have a sitcom or something like that and then where they want they want credit for like their new art they're doing like look I know I was funny at one point but now I play the standing base and like if you want to come see me that's what you're gonna get and it's like who does that well I'm like I mean like it's not the standing base but I'm just saying I think cuz I even will have those impulses like I don't want to be funny right now just and and yeah you know but you're like but then I'm like bitch that's how people know you but wait a minute why don't you you need a podcast that's we need you always say that I'm assuming you need a goddamn podcast because you could first of all you're really good at it you're very smart you're very articulate you'd be fans fascinating you're breaking things down but all those misconceptions would go away if people got to listen to you talk then you wouldn't worry about if people knew you because you would put it out there so many times there would be like real clear but I'm not that worried about if people know me right but well okay I see your point you're not really worried that people know you but your interactions like you're worried about your interactions with people yeah yeah okay you just want to make sure they're as good as possible I want to like know that I did my best and then I was open having a nice interaction and and and making small talk and whatever I don't know you know we're talking about like you you were saying you worry about getting detached to worry about people that's henna that gets goofy yes well yes a hundred percent because you get feedback all the time yeah you constantly get updated and check to your concept I don't but but what what's the feedback good for I mean and I'm on Twitter I'm sorry I know I'm on Twitter and I do think you're right though but but then I like I don't think it's good to reinforce positive feedback like someone will you know right you know like you're disgusting and then you look and it's like oh they write to famous people yeah use Baucom you know I just think I would never reward like that what's that you don't that's I'm gonna talk to you about I mean sometimes people will have valid opinions about what you're doing yeah stand-up or whether it's a podcast right the fucking upright tube or whatever you do everybody everybody has you know they're gonna have opinions you're gonna have opinions and everything you do yeah but some sometimes having those opinions like if if they're mostly swinging to the right side yeah they're mostly swinging to the good side it gives you sort of a frequency that you're you you know that they appreciate it you like tapped into this thing like people love the Amy Schumer show boom inside Amy Schumer on Comedy Central now Amy has a blog hey watch Amy do videos I'm gonna go do laundry you know like you you're you tap into you you tap into a certain vibe when you get a certain amount of feedback yeah I and I feel like as a comic you know there's that urge to communicate yeah which I have but then there's also I think also as a girl as a bunch six and I and I talk like very openly and then some of that feedback it makes you like oh should I not be sharing this much of myself because but then you're like I'm like no I've made a decision like I'm gonna live my life this way and try to make people laugh and maybe feel better right but then like that sometimes that's met with where you're like is it worth it cuz this is so hard sometimes and and I'm not just like scared of somebody saying something mean to me like it's also people not respecting your boundaries and hmm and it you know it's it's like a struggle and it is like you know I I do have to like kind of work and be aware of not becoming like real standoffish right well you're you're not really capable of filtering who knows you once you become famous and that's a big difference between that and just being an ordinary person going about your day especially an ordinary woman going about your day because so many men like with women take on an aggressive approach it's almost like it's it's almost commonplace right the guy just aggressively comes up to girls and hits on them women are just as aggressive I find sometimes but it doesn't come with the physical threat oh it feels like with a man like if a chick's aggressive with me I'm always like okay it's a crazy bitch I gotta get out of here but I don't I go oh my god if she follows me to my car that is true no there is there is the added fun bonus of like oh this guy might try and I try to rape you yeah I mean that's less fearful with when you're man I mean you're always could worry about someone doing something to you it's a real bummer to know that you could be sexually assaulted I can I mean I can imagine but I couldn't you know it's like I couldn't imagine couldn't imagine being pregnant there's a lot of things I could pretend to imagine but I really can't imagine them I can't imagine not drinking for nine months Wow that's my Eddie Izzard marathon you know people drank while they were pregnant for years and some of the greatest people that were ever created were created by Piaget my mom always says that she drank there all four pregnancies I think you're allowed to have a little wine I think like a small glass of wine is actually good for your body and it relaxes you great but I hear that and then I would yeah yeah I'm Halle Berry I bet you're not finding them black athletes been doing that show get some of that super sperm squirt you'll have twins before you even know it yeah I've got twins I've got little half black babies hey like the crazy thing is all I did was check him off he came over late didn't know I was pregnant I mean come in I don't want kids I take you to court for alimony they fucking right you don't need any money they ran through the lines in your crotch like like fire ants this bird just what is different they move they swim they swim on land yeah just flapping around like those fish those snake fish that come out with us make me head fish that come out of water and they walk on the land until they find some new water no a real fish god damn it have you ever seen that did you finally know it was gonna be three days so I was like so psyched when they gave us the glasses I was like what it was like one of the best surprises of my whole life I used to have piranhas allegedly what yeah I had a bunch of them nice to feed him goldfish allegedly this is all fictional legal yes many decades ago why um yeah the Willie you could send them into if you were an asshole you could put them in a lake somewhere and they go in them non-native waters and they would wreak havoc and that's happened to a bunch of different fish species think this snakehead was one of them actually if it's not the snakehead it's a different fish there's a walking fish is that it invades New York City people through them some people through these fish in the pond that's in Central Park as because they thought it was funny and so now these things are living in the pond and just destroying everything when I was there I saw some fish some big giant fish attack something else in the water just to speak froth of water and then whatever it happened you know happened it was like probably there's a pond in Central Park you know that big pond in that water there's some crazy ass fish this is yeah monster fish in Central Park there's an attack does it attack anything icky just see it oh that's it right there you see barely could see it yeah that's a snake snakehead fish those things he ducks they'll eat anything they're like super Hardy to like you once you get them in an ecosystem you have to essentially kill everything in that lake to get them all out what do they do they just eat everything and then become cannibals yeah it says if you see this fish and like this see a terrifying fish with teeth in Central Park kill it immediately that's too late the problem is these things are just shooting out eggs and sperm and breeding like crazy this is like predator like remember that movie predator like if predator landed and just started killing all the people that's it's like for that thing like that thing going into the pond in Central Park it's like whoa let the party begin there's lions a lion just got led into the fucking zebra cage the zoo that's what it's like I was like that happens it could happen that's what's happening with this fish it's just that's what it's like a super predator just got introduced into this humble ecosystem you might watch murder behind you fish murder nah but the fish is like the worst thing you could ever see for a creationist the fish walking on the ground and walking to the next pond because of your creationist and you see that you go away but I mean don't creationists do that all day looking at everything yes with denial yeah but this is the one of the most preposterous things ever if you're seen you never seen one of these things walk no I'm so grossed out I come here I leave upset because of the videos together fuck by the horse that yes thank you welcome this is nothing nearly as disturbing but there's a video in the Congo where I think it's prehistoric fish eaten by dinosaur bird that's what it says there's this crazy bird called a shoe bill and the shoe bill is like five feet tall with an enormous beak it's because like a giant hatchet yeah it's beaches like it's beak rather is literally like an axe on its face it's huge beak and this bird is something out of another era yeah they used to be birds like that like seven feet tall that lived in North America and they would they don't fly they just sort of run around and attack things they're predatory Birds then why is it a bird like a penguin penguins don't fly birds yeah did you see that dinosaur 3d movie that's available right now and if I did not it's really good no it's not it's not animated and there aren't that many dinosaurs in it but it's a really different thing yeah this is not the dinosaur Sutherland that's the dad he narrates it and it's like it's really good three III obviously I'm psyched by 3d oh so it's it's a recreation of like what they look like yeah and they like water in Jurassic Park style yeah and it ends like spoiler with a big it's not a pterodactyl but kind of like an ostrich like it just looks like some sort of like prehistoric sort of evolving bird that's like so ostriches another good example a bird that doesn't really fly right they don't fly they don't do shit they fuck you up they'll kick the shit out of ya they fuck you did I saw that video they try to fuck people I do I think I've talked about this in here before I I remember being real traumatized by seeing a guy laying there blindfolded and he doesn't know what's fucking him and it's an ostrich well that's not me you never saw that no I by the time that happened earlier to giving up on watching people get fucked by animals there was a certain time that Joe I'll tell you right now I'm done there was a certain time a few years back where if you said hey here's a link of guys getting fucked by an ostrich I would cook it but not today today you wouldn't call my bluff because honestly I don't know where it is I don't know if it was something absolutely fantastic where no one had ever seen anything like it before then I'll click on it but I don't want some dude get fucked by Andy um [Laughter] something like that starts a fucking pinwheel in your head that's spinning around I got this guy ever get to that point what did he start out as he used to be a baby one time what did his parents do to him that's me watching any porn wow that's a problem I mean our powers are it but well I always look at it and go out and yeah we're gonna fix them now yeah with some dick God as a plan yeah you can't you can't fix them unfortunately but that is exactly how you should feel if you're sort of a humane person thank you see them and you go all these poor people probably the victim and you don't call them them poor people yeah these can you call them these poor those people you know it's a weird thing that everybody watches that but nobody nobody admits to it it'll admit to the don't like to admit to porn having done it but really watching it yeah I don't know anyone in my life that doesn't that doesn't watch porn Wow you hang out with different people didn't me really I don't know it's a single dude who doesn't watch porn oh yeah girls you know a lot of girls watch porn all my friends watch porn are all freaks but you know when I was younger I was like I was I did not like porn like at all I remember I had a boyfriend I was like three or four and I was like I thought it like cheating and then I grew up and then you're like oh wait this is awesome for a lot of guys 23 is when that's the age cutoff so they don't get to that new mature woman they just find another girl's porn no I really I know I really like it I have friends that are like that too only getting when a girl gets like 23 they completely lose interest yeah and they move on yeah yeah all my girlfriend's again there are all comedians but um I think that girl comedians probably just completely different animal I guess I'll fight I guess I don't know you know i yeah i thought i think crazier I don't even think so I don't think so I don't think I'm any wilder crazier I think I'm probably like pretty boring but I you know like having sex like yeah it's not wrong with saying that on the radio or podcast no I don't know why it's like so why is that a thing I means everybody it feels good like why is it it's okay to say you like massages people always ask me like in you know like local press they're like why do you talk about sex so much I'm like it's the most interesting thing we do as people I think like why wouldn't I want to talk about I think it's like really funny why you know mm-hmm and it's not that I think I think I'm probably having like pretty mundane sex compared to everybody else pretty basic but just like just hearing a girl like mention it just kind of makes people like why I don't this is just judging by doing like local press right well you got to think about different people's looked at jobs they have and the amount of restraint that's required to keep a job in an office where you're not allowed to talk about anything freaky like eight hours a day you're right I haven't had like an office even before Santa Paws is just like bartending yeah you're like like Ari Shaffir but you're a woman thank you you're a comic you know your your perceptions like why they would be upset at you for for talking about sex or liking sex because to them it's like a mind-blower like she talks about sex all the time just talks about like oh but but it's not that I'm like oh my god like I can't believe there's not something in my body right now I I feel like I have a totally normal sexual appetite totally normal I think I probably watch porn like twice a week the controversy is just talking about it talking about a sexual appetite at all that's the controversy but like that's so weird hmm I think even I just you know did some some shows on NPR and like they're they act like they've never experienced penetration before well you remember what happened with Sarah Silverman when she did that TED talk and they completely censored her they pulled it down but that was about like a kid being retarded I thought it was her act I thought it was like the joke and I'm I don't remember what the let's find out we should find out since we're talking about Sarah Silverman TED talk yeah I don't think it was sexual I think it was okay making it she's so sexual is she I don't think of Sarah is super sexual oh my god you kidding me her act is very sexual it's very dirty it's hilarious oh she's hilarious right Ted versus Sarah Silverman fight turns really retarded okay uh known for her shock and insult humor was invited to give a TED talk she subsequently trashed TED organizer Chris Andrew Anderson who tweeted I know I shouldn't say this about one of my own speakers but I thought Sarah Silverman was god-awful you believe he wrote that he's a bitch the problem was that Silverman kept using the word retarded to fight Sarah Palin's recent rant about the word the whole talk flew right over the Ted crowd so wow that is hilarious Anderson deleted his tweet but Silverman hit back today with our own saying that kudos to Ted Chris for moving Ted and unsafe for making Ted and unsafe haven for all your a barnacle of mediocrity Bill Gates asshole oh my god she crushed him yeah you're a barnacle of mediocrity on Bill Gates asshole oh my god oh my god that's so funny and then Steve case waited in a OH founder Steve Case waded into the fight to defend Anderson he tweeted shame on you too Silverman adding the sad thing is you're not that funny ah you lose you lose just for saying that stupid if sad face shame on you you lose unless you're being silly right like if you say something to me I say shame on you shame on you Amy Schumer or how dare you Amy Schumer that's I'm joking this guy is shame on you for real so when you say shame on you for real you're out you lose games over the sad thing is you're not that funny oh no what okay you explained to me the whole barnacle on Bill Gates asshole line then that shit is hilarious and Silverman's response was you should be nicer to the last person on earth with an AOL account she got him to boom bitch the fight between Silverman and case continued but you get the picture oh that's beautiful well that happened when like they went after salon.com went after Patton Oswalt he crushed them it's just so arbitrary there's just no you have no control over what somebody picks up on what happens like that I mean of course if you go on some rant where you're like saying racist said like that's ridiculous but but for comics it's just so idea it's just a slow news day and they're like this was a problem people just like choose Norton after I people were getting really mad at me about a joke I made about steve-o and the sheen roast and Norton he he like stood up for me it was like you're selective outrage was steve steevo or the guy who died the joke was saying that i that we all are yeah that was a joke they made the same joke about about Geraldo with with Anthony but but it's a comic you're allowed to do that comics on the road I know he's a comic yeah well listen I'm with you yeah it's one of those things where you Knights but hey with the comedy it's always who's gonna be the first person to make the hike you know and a lot of times I honestly didn't think it was like you does it it's like it's like I got an extra impact I he didn't think that was gonna be that big of a yikes Wow I wasn't going I would I would definitely I wasn't going for the headline on BuzzFeed I would definitely think it would be a hike I don't know what the fuck man I realized where I was really surprised because it wasn't big it wasn't a big deal in the room it was like we're all hidden we're all heading hard right like I just didn't even think that was gonna be a big deal I just think that's comics I think that I'm used to sitting around those guys at the cellar yeah you know it's fun it's how we communicate yeah like I can't tell you where half of these guys who are my best friends grew up but I I'm ready with so many insults for them if one of the marks back wearing a stupid jacket I can't wait wait Norton is awesome with that to everyone Oh Norton has crushed me so many times Norton talked about this funny story he talked about our OB ante where he was uh he had a slice of pizza and Louie CK saw him on the street and he just slapped a slap of peaches to the ground and called him a faggot and he starts to laugh and he's telling the story he's like I was a juicy pizza pizza too is a nice one you couldn't do that to another person that you know they wouldn't appreciate it the humor in the inappropriateness the other night we were just playing Keith Robinson's when he got eliminated from Star Search we were playing it over and over again in front of him and by the way don't don't think you can come up to Amy Schumer and slap her fucking pizza down that's not we're saying know each other a good friend but that's so yeah I tell is the best a tell did you see a special road work I heard it's awesome it's so funny so you can get it I did so happy that he's doing well again his show looks dope he's fucking hilarious hilarious I don't think there is a funniest guy alive but he's one of my favorites that's for sure yeah but he am I was saying at the table with my just saying rounds a bunch of female comics and we were all like eating like dessert it was like a really like sad moment he just walks up like hey Dave he's like oh what are you guys having no boyfriend alamode [Laughter] you know every bite of that like tiramisu that'ss oh that's so funny Rick hey Dave he didn't even see us til he turned and then just boom fired right off the cuff boom he's definitely one of the best joke writers out there yeah yeah he's got so much of his actors joking he joke joke joke joke and he choke choke choke you know yeah he's hilarious that skanks for the memories one of my favorite CDs ever so good yeah it's a nice time big comedy fan yeah a lot of good comics out there now it's just totally different experience than it was 20 years ago I think I think a lot of it is probably because the internet like more people have an avenue there's more demand for comedy I even think saying it's some comedy condos on the road the whole big VHS is of old specials yeah and a lot of pretty shitty like it'll be like and there is that like off the cuff like that movie punchline how it had Sally Fields coming out at the end kind of just like winging it and like it working out as a comic it then just set up a whole I think wave of people being like maybe I'm amazing at comedy and I don't know it well that movie was so bad it was so so obviously not real stand-up it was like they were faking in the audience reaction was fake you can't do that it doesn't work with stand-up like you can fake being a fucking union boss screaming at the fucking people in the yard yeah but if there's an artificial feeling to that it's not nearly as offensive as the artificial feeling of watching Tom Hanks kill it with nonsense just you're he's just talking you can yeah you could see like he probably could be a comic he mean he had good delivery good setups was that who's doing the prior movie I don't know if they cast who's gonna play yeah but I was like I wasn't gonna be Eddie Griffin at one point in time I don't know but I hope it's a comic it has to be uh I don't know I would have to me I mean I would think you would have to but even then it's not gonna work one guy pulled it off ever what does Dustin Hoffman you ever see Lenny no it's fuckin brilliant yeah it's fucking brilliant yeah fucking get ready for every doing did he go on that's a really good question I don't know what he did but what he did do when he did the movie is get Lenny Bruce down to a fucking tea yeah that's incredible I mean it's one of the best performances of his career and very few people know about it yeah I mean very people outside of stand-ups even know who Lenny Bruce was it's more more people know who Bill Hicks says yeah but Lenny Bruce is just sort of a name you know like a fucking Sid Caesar you know I mean all those names you don't really ever see red buttons oh that guy yeah heard of them you know sit around unless you're like a real oh yeah I like that's something I like to do on the road is go on record stores and listen to whatever comedy albums they have oh that's really fun it like well first of all it's like sad that I'm like and then I'll do this today when I'm in his city like there's a sadness to it but but that that's and it also keeps me up because I I feel bad like why is it sad um I just think I think being a stand-ups such like an isolating life and so but I like will be like I'm looking look forward to like my couple things I like to do in cities I don't know I think I think everything about being a stand-ups like that really I think so do you go on the road with other friends um well I have I have mark Normand who's hilarious opens for me or I have my friend Bridget Everett actually now she like closes for me she's she's hilarious she's a cabaret singer but she good yeah I know one can follow her what does she do she says she's danger well she does I'm she does like she'll do like the nasty show but she like I have to close it because she's it's not stand-up she's a she's a singer she's like an amazing singer but she the one who does that Hannibal Buress show she just did Hannibal show with Method Man I keep saber ass it's breast yeah I always do that I've known it too for years I wish I bet you guys are fighting together yeah dude so I've seen her I saw her he showed me a video a killer so at first I just like want people to see her she does she's the only like I do stand up on my show and I'll do like an interview and the only time I don't interviews if she's performing she's in a band with ad-rock she's like such a badass but I was like I just need people to see her mmm Bridget Everett and so so she came on the road with me but I was like man she's such a closer but then I was like I still want her to come out with me so I just like would do an hour and then I'd be like that's the show and I have a special guest and I have her come out because I feel like she changes people's lives you laugh so hard and it's just I don't know just like changes and there's yeah I praise oh my god that's awesome and you buddies in real life yeah so that makes the difference for me yeah like going on the road always always travel with my friends yeah don't you just have one person open for you or you sometimes - okay I've done - so I've done three before really yeah I've done three that'd be really fun we just we got to go out on a bus this time and it was fun because my mark Normand has been opening for me and he's he's hilarious like but Bridget what she does she goes out into the crowd like it's such a um she sits on dudes laps and sings I'm sure she'll motorboat anybody she ever her act is so killer but it's but it's been like so cool because I'm yeah mark start opening for me like four or five years ago so the answer is yes you like to go in the row with your friends so when you go on the road with your friends doesn't it make it less sad because you're all just having a good time together yeah totally totally yeah that's ten years a long time ago I figured that shit out way earlier I took a pay cut way early to do that right because it's just - yeah and I would even get grief about they would say well you know across you this much too far this worse now and that much to hire them and you know you're making this much less because I'm like so what well no I got I got my sister traveling with me my brother-in-law like we have a camp we have a little camping and that's why the road has been really sweet lately that's nice that's definitely a good thing yeah it also I find like I feel funnier when I'm hanging out with all my friends because we're all laughing at each other right and it keeps you down yeah I'd be like yeah you know what I like I'm doing Orlando on Thursday with Joey Diaz nice yeah or Friday actually this Friday we leave Thursday but what's it what's that it's gonna be some theater yeah we're just gonna have so much fun yeah I mean it's like I can't imagine not having fun hanging out with Diaz all day we're gonna have a great time laughs so the road is like home you know cuz Joey's family and we've been together we've been friends for fucking forever Joey will go to the gym and tell me about his fuckin jujitsu classes did you just do now bell swings and shit no he's just doing try be healthy yeah do a little exercise yeah he's uh he's the most fun guy you'll be a son on the road the first time I did Orlando Mart when work opened for me and we stayed at this hotel and it had a waterslide yeah I was like oh my god and and it made me go do that club again cuz I was like oh they've got that waterside at that hotel dude waterslide there was a place in Phoenix we used to do the Tempe improv that waterslide it was fucking awesome atomic scene are you gonna oh god that Club is super weird but the hotel is good like they do a free hour of drinks okay you know what else has a water slide is the Hard Rock in Florida with Florida yes Hollywood Florida that me and Tate my friend Tate we went that way we had like a couple hours to kill before a flight we found out about the waterslide yeah we were slight of like two hours before we had to leave it was so much fun there were like tunnels and shit you go shooting out at the bottom of the tunnel good we were there and there was a family and I guess they were Muslim they were wearing bikinis oh my god have you know this that's real yeah they were all all the girls were in Burkina it just yeah but bikini but it's a burka okay waterproof so their face is covered or their whole body's covered it was there their eyes were out their faces out and everything else was covered Jaime pull up burqini Jesus Christ they're gonna see this that can't be real yeah and I was like I want that like why can't Jesus Christ I would have gone on the water side ten times in that that really literally freaks me out that chick looks so first of all the chick does not look like the people that were at the water park with us but that freakin shame is like Kelly come on Shane Keeney that is insane it just it's insane that they look so happy but you're being cute but it's it's inside that culture like it forces that that's that's one of the most insane things in 2014 that's it here we are I mean isn't that just fear I guess it's also a pattern it's a religious pattern that religious pattern one of the left pow-pow-pow the one on the right now oh no no no no no Jesus creating fixing that yes poor girl I went to Dubai once for stand-up and it was a real bummer it's a bummer yeah it's a bummer seeing people and you know they don't think it's a bummer because they're used to it yeah it's a bummer for you though if you have freedom to dress however you want you see something like that and you just go what's going on why only the women like how come the men can wear shorts and you can wear whatever fuck you want like the lion can they though I don't know I mean love the men wearing religious garbs as well Emiratis there to do whatever whatever they want whatever even some like comics I was working with it was like some of them could say things and some of them couldn't I feel terrible whenever I see any form of suppression so when I see that that was the most visible that was the worst thing was seeing the way that they dealt with like the Filipino waitstaff just the people because it's such a caste system there it's like forget about the the women being that you know um shield that it was like that was that was the bummer well have you ever seen there's there was pieces that were done on some unscrupulous employees or employers rather that were taking these people from other countries they were getting them from like a guy who'd be like a Wrangler and he would go to these other countries and tell these people that they were gonna get a lot of money and tell these people that all these good things are gonna happen and then he would bring them over here to start working for these companies and then they would take their passports away and leave them these like subhuman conditions his horrible conditions sleeping like head to toe in a room with 23rd floors and holes in the ground to shit in like vice to the peace on them and you're like this is incredible I mean it's not all establishments there but the fact that it does happen and that the way it's set up you know that I don't know who's responsible I don't know if it's the people at the top or the people at the bottom that are hiring these people like who's made the decision to force these people in this situation take their passports away I don't know who made those decisions I'm like I know like that's really awful but like honestly today I asked for a decaf and like the chick I know there was caffeine in that you're being funny yet no I just like it makes me when I hear things like that I think of like what's the dumbest thing today what I thought was important oh you know what I mean like you know the things that I'll be like ah this is this is foam you call this foam barista in traffic on Santa Monica again bullshit weatherman didn't say it was gonna rain and then you're like oh you had to sleep head to toe with people that don't bathe and you haven't seen your family oh great the stoplight is down we have to figure out this intersection on our own when I called they said they had my size what's terrible when you really stop and consider how uneven the playing field is from from birth from birth to death in this in this world that we live in like you can get the most awesome spot ever like Amy Schumer and be born in a nice City didn't like I wasn't born to a rape camp yeah you weren't born to some people in India that sold you to some government because they need your money that they're gonna send back so you're working in some kitchen somewhere yeah some other country you know they have your passport you can never get home Jesus cry was complaining about having to learn how to make signature cocktails while I bartenders you know that's a real issue the passport thing they take their passports you can't go back which is just dark as fuck no that is really dark I mean that's that's slavery that's essentially like you're not me and there's no dogs there's no gates there's no guys with guns there's no getting out but don't isn't the one thing you get like they like you send your the saddest amount of money home yeah apparently but who knows I mean who knows if that money even gets there if you can't communicate with your friends back home or your family back home and how are you communicating with them if you're not if you are communicating with them and it's free and uncensored you'd be saying get me the fuck out of here they have me they're holding me hostage that's just the people that get taken but there's also that's going on where they didn't take their passport but it's the only way that they can send money home and voluntary but it's awful know that no doubt there's a bunch of different you know there's variables there's a bunch of different variables when it comes to people that live you know if you are born in a third-world country or a really poor village a really poor neighborhood somewhere it's a fucking huge handicap starting from there is incredibly difficult yeah I have a friend his name is Justin Wren and he's been on a podcast before he used to be a UFC fighter and then he went to the Congo and met these pygmies and he's become obsessed with helping them and saving them so he he takes donations and he goes over there and builds wells for them and helps them and endures all sorts of personal tragedies with them he's got NSYNC he's got some horrible like dengue fever he almost died when he was over there I mean like really horrible horrible shit just to go over there and try to help these people just because he was over there and he just recognized he had this feeling like oh my god like they were so unhealthy and I can help like I know I can help them so he just felt incredibly compelled to make that like his life's mission to try to help these people so really and there's him right now that's the pictures of him with all these pygmy people it's unbelievably touching story he's like the sweetest guy ever he used to be a comic he was a fighter okay fine you have she was a really very tough guy really was on The Ultimate Fighter and I was going through all this shit like bullshit depression and you know and alcoholism and you know all the problems that a lot of people go through in this life and found a new purpose when he went over and met these people don't you feel susceptible to that yeah you can get definitely get susceptible which part I mean you personally like I could see you getting real into a specific cause and well but no but you like your family I would definitely I absolutely could see myself getting into a certain cause something along those lines but I just don't have the time to dedicate to go over to the Congo and you know but I appreciate respect that he does yeah you know and I donate and I think that donating to anything is a good cause donating to anything where you can you know change people's lives like directly I think that's a good thing for you to do with your time I think no matter what if you can find something in life that enhances your perspective on the world because you've done something positive that's a good thing and I think that's really what I got out of what he did the most is that it really truly enhanced his perspective of the world he became like this really happy guy with like a real mission yeah and he sees like a tangible result and all the the care and helped and aid that he gives these people it's just cool as far yeah cuz it's so selfless and so it's it's beautiful in that regard you know I think anytime we see something like that it elevates all of us as a species you know I mean anytime you see someone who's so selfless like that does something like super super positive it just it elevates us as a species you know yeah and that guy is just a awesome example of what a human being is capable of it's cool yeah and it's also a fascinating thing that this guy was like in the dumps and his life was terrible until he started doing this and now he's like this really driven happy person you see all those pictures he's smiling and loves those people so much just you know hard time first of all being a fighter is unbelievably difficult very strenuous very nerve-wracking they're always nervous they're always you know forcing themselves to get into unbelievable shape you're constantly disciplined because you're doing strength and conditioning work then you go into spar later that night and then you wake up in the morning you're gonna hit mitts and then later that night you're gonna lift weights and then the next day you're gonna wrestle and then at nighttime you're gonna kick box and then it's it never ends it just keeps going keeps going there's never enough fucking hurdles to jump over there's never enough kettlebells to lift is never enough mitts to punch there's never enough bodies to spar with you keep going going going going going going going and you redline your body in a lot of ways a lot of guys get depressed just from that just from overtraining they get sick a lot they're exhausted but if you don't put yourself through that then you get your ass kicked and that's even worse it's a lot of shit involved and being a fighter we think being a comic is hard it's a joke no I mean the I don't know any I don't know any UFC fighters but even just what wrestlers go through I'm just like man that's unbelievably hard for your body too because car accident over and over and over again yeah over and over and over again got some sets that I felt like that actually in Orlando well you know there's a lot of for sure there's a lot of bad feelings that come from bombing and it's not good for you and it's it's damaging the issue about sports though or wrestling or anything along those lines is that it sort of breaks your body down yeah and then you got to live the last third of your life or half of your life or the body that's essentially wrecked from the first half some of them yeah you know I don't know if all of them get fucked up they all get fucked up I don't know what is the thing that goes wrong what goes wrong Oh like you're just murdering your body like just the arthritis standing on your toes yeah and if you don't if you don't actually ever get injured which they all do it's still just so hard on your body like you you can't you know what I heard I heard they just fuck a lot and they blame the injuries on ballet and Liz Valerie that's what I heard they just get a lot of ballet dick like Baryshnikov dick yeah like crazy from hell that guy from the movie box looks all of those girls right the guy that erector guy he's always the guy he makes it he's aloof with them jesse plays games fucked the other girls too remember remember he was like really mean and he got them really insecure like he pulls him enclosed and he pushes him away he plays those creepy games yeah I guess you're right that guy did fuck everybody he's the heterosexual he's around all these insecure women and he has a power over them like he gets it he's the director that dude just bangin left and right that dirty bastard he's horrible is a terrible person might as well be drugging them my opinion it seems like what guys should do guys become comics to hook up with girls it's stupid just well the one guy in ballet well I don't know if guys become comics to hook up with girls but they definitely become funny to make girls laugh at them and then along the way they look at the career options and usually their burger for con forum and stand up looks incredibly attractive and then along the way they realize from doing show that you could hook up with girls I think very few comics get into comedy going I'm going to be really funny so I can hook up with girls I think it's sort of a consequence of like you know they just realized as they were after they started uh guys I'm friends with her yeah I guess they they just make it sound like that was a part of why they got into it well I think it's probably part of what makes him funny for sure yeah he's probably one of the only times I was ever funny before I was a comedian was like talking to girls yeah you know or truck you trying to impress them it's probably one of the only times I was ever funny like making fun of things are mocking things yeah it was that or locker room stuff with my friends there's a lot of that a lot of like oh just like me well I you know I came from a weird place because I came from like I was martial arts instructor and I was a competitor and I did that was like the main focus of my life growing up so I I didn't have a normal upbringing in that sense it was very abnormal there was no partying there was no very little drinking or you know had a couple girlfriends to tolerated me for small periods of time and then they'd eventually just get tired of being crazy girls just like going to your like martial arts shows like oh get that belt I don't think I ever brought one to a fight an actual fight no too much pressure yeah i wouldnt want to watch them sit there in the audience watching me me thinking about them and watching me like my sister came to see me fight once and i remember it's being a wreck there's one thing i really appreciated about my parents they never they never like for they never said i am going to your fight like you know they'd say do you want to go i'd like that I'm like no don't go oh really no I don't want I don't want him to see me hurt in anybody and be upset at me and I didn't want to see anybody hurting me and then being except set and then the idea that I could get hurt from my mother was like extra pressure the idea that I would lose in front of my mother that was also extra pressure like it's a very solitary pursuit martial arts you stand up yes they've seen me do stand up a bunch of times completely no not at all totally different fan you know because the stand up is just fun you know it's just it was bad the beginning when I wasn't very good right but once I got good it was it was pretty easy to have him there it's fun it's fun to have him there fighting was a totally different thing that was just more more creepy yeah it's just too many things to manage you know you're more inside your head so I wasn't really fun I was rarely funny with girls even I was just rarely funny really yeah I wasn't funny at all until I decided to become a comedian I was more of like a a questioning person than funny but you seem like like I think you would be funny just by accident like didn't you just make people laugh well that's what happened was the reason I got talked into doing stand-up in the first place was guys in the locker room I would be doing impressions of each other like I'd be doing impressions of my instructor having sex with one of students or other friends you know I would make fun of things yeah but it was really rare you know but every now and then I would do it wasn't like something I did every day but when you did it everybody was like every now and then I would have wait until they were good yeah you know I'd have something I'd have some something actually funny yeah I wasn't like I was a very quiet thing like martial art one was very friendly and everybody would go into the locker room what's up what's up but but we knew what we were gonna do we're gonna go out there we're gonna kick each other and punch each other it was a very nerve-wracking thing to be like very close with people that beat you up but like I know that that fighting is totally different but I do see a lot of parallels with with stand-up yeah with that because it's like yeah the people you're most threatened by you feel the closest to in a way yeah yeah some similarities for sure I think there's some yeah I've been thinking about just and even like I like watching them I always like to rap battles I mean growing up I just like was interested in them I still like them in the and I never made the connection that those were kind of like roasts or like hang out with comics to me but it's like of course like even the blue tang album in at the beginning of a method man of that song it's like they're just trashing each other right and I'm like and I loved I loved that that growing up and then I'm like by never even made that connection until like really recently I'm like oh yeah well battle rap is all about you know like coming out on top yeah and everybody would come up with the most vicious scathing shit dude's mother yeah and make it broad but how many times you seen battle rap that ends in fisticuffs there's a bunch of those videos online right it always looks like they're about to yeah some ther are you know they're there seen some really nasty shit to each other yeah yeah in a way yeah I think that's probably a lot like stand up but stand up it's rare that we go head-to-head with each other like that like that's doesn't it's only roasts where that kind of happens and even then but even but guys sit down can't respond for a while yeah but even if it's not like but even I know you you and I both have heckler people put videos of us when dealing with hecklers online and that feels like you're fighting training like I think that stuff plays a part and just and just like your defense mechanism is how you're set up how you've been preparing for these moments you didn't even know you're gonna have sort of it's also you recognize you have to handle something in real time and you have to also be completely in the moment while you're handling it because you're you're directing a moment where X amount of people in the audience they all paid to see you and some shits going down in real time yeah and sometimes you'll slip and you'll say something awkward or you just say something that still like forced or stupid or too much in the ground yeah he's just a drunk I mean I've had some people swear that things were planted just cos P is so right I had a guy goddamn and I can't remember where I want to say it was Milwaukee but there was a guy that was so drunk that he came up to the side of the stage and he was literally falling over and he reached up his hand like to shake my hand and then like was like blacking out and I caught his hand I was holding on to his wrist I was literally keeping this guy standing yeah like he was that fucked up and the audience was howling like I'm like this is I've never had to hold a guy up like how fucked up is this guy like he stumbled out of his chair came like lunging towards the the the stage to the point where I was wondering if he was handicapped I was wondering he had like an issue with his muscles or something some physical issue and that's really hard that's what it's a hard yes this guy might have had something wrong with him on top of being fucked up yeah but the fucked up thing there's a video of it somewhere the video of me holding this guy up by like to show that it really is real love it they're like cuz it's like this real moment they're like what's so ridiculous but I mean those moments like Amy Schumer is responsible for you're responsible for you know in real time here's the guy like he's standing there [Music] yeah yeah guys okay Amy sure he's gonna pee while this guy but you are right now is maybe the drunkest guy that's ever survived we're gonna learn something just by watching you you need to sit the fuck down cross-legged and just close your eyes and think about the seventh phrase there's no way you can make it up those stairs cleaner the inmates in the state see you like let's go back let's go back to grammar school let's buy the seventh grade feeling good two years 50:14 that's when you brother that's upset you really turn to walk why are you doing then get on your knees in your hands brawl because you don't have the mentality of the human right now that's why your mind [Applause] that's that guy folks that's that guy who's funny with it are you with him is that your friend who's right there you folks look sensible usually fairly chauffeurs men traveling solo [Laughter] [Applause] what that is [Applause] [Music] there's those moments man when you put your forehead on the white porcelain and you pianned good I gotta fix so many things about my life staring into the abyss of that white porcelain just comes back to you answers I think that's probably the end of it [Music] that's how things thinking about wasting too much pressure [Music] I completely forgot about that dude I totally forgot about that whole exchange about how long it went on but the guy was so drunk that I was holding him up and he didn't even look up at me he was so drunk he was just like letting me hold him up and he was just sort of looking around the crowd trying to figure out why oh no no they handled it right away like you could see right here while while this guy is stumbling this guy comes over the security comes over and grabs them and they card him off and then I started talking about that guy's like the roots of your tree he represents life let him hold you up and the guy walked the dude towards the towards the back of the room and then they yeah well I had to I mean I had to talk about it was just so ridiculous I'd never seen a guy that drunk he was I mean he was there was no way he was talking he could barely move his body right he was just making noises with his mouth that didn't represent words you could see that he was trying to speak English but he was so drunk he couldn't talk at all start wondering just I'm wondering what happened how'd it go wrong right that's another to me too and then sometimes like you know if people like keep keep firing at me I'm like don't because I will I will pinpoint what happened it's not good for either one of us even if you win you're gonna feel bad later like I know if I say one more thing I will regret it for the rest of my life style well then sometimes it's funny when you go too far and you go alright I went too far yeah yeah it's not like DUI if you actually get angry and that's the debt that's the thing yes if you actually get angry but I yeah cuz nobody wants to see that but I learned from when I was opening for Norton and the town on the road because people would yell shoot at them and they wouldn't they wouldn't fire back it was never like they were being attacked they would just defuse right so I try to do that now but then if somebody keeps cutting but then I've also seen if somebody keeps coming at them they will go to town yeah there's a difference between someone having fun and someone that's like fucking it all up yeah you know at the risk of ink purging this today I'm not encouraging this but I was in New York when I was in New York this guy yelled out something that was fucking hilarious it was uh I was uh I was talking about the most I was trying to figure out who the most famous woman in the world was setting up his bit yeah and the guy goes your mom just for childish I'm 12 reasons I started laughing it was just a perfect time really yeah because it's like first of all that is not true your mom is not the most famous woman but it doesn't matter I know maybe a mother makes a big best cheeseburgers maybe your mom yeah probably your mom like somewhere along the line throughout history there's got to be a woman who has sucked the most dicks ever there's a world record holder they probably don't keep it officially yeah it's on a video it's probably done probably it's on a cave somewhere carved into the rocks it was probably an old record that nobody ever even cleaned your kettlebells and be like wow what a prisoners calculating how many days till they get out till they get released that makes those fives on the wall or straight ones on the one across go over to her door of death it's just all these jerks analystics in the cave mmm right by the cave door Brighton how many dick she sucks it's hard to get you know if you have a limp stuff to get some Buffalo you gotta do what you gotta do what a minute my point is yeah that's that's a good hat call but it was only in the moment it was good it was another moment it could be bad you know it just it worked that time I like do you ever do a QA yeah you know what you should do there's a thing that they're doing in in LA it's a podcast called thunderpussy and thunderpussy is you don't go on stage with any material at all zero material and the audience yells out suggestions whose choice no it's red band red band Jeremiah Watkins sorry Jeremiah based on his name Jeremiah Watkins very funny young kid and he and Brian have this podcast where they have guys go up there and they do that they do everything is completely off-the-cuff you do everything with the audience but isn't it better to do the stuff that you know where sometimes but as an artistic like exercise it's a great exercise in creativity because you come up with bits and then they become actual bits you come up with bits when someone yells out something and you have a suggestion and then you try to work it out like or you can several times several times come up with actual real bits from that that have become real bits I try to like make myself do at least a couple new things every night on stage that's good yeah but I mean it's hard but that's one of the things that's amazing about this IDE this thunderpussy ideas because you're doing an hour yeah well me I did an hour I didn't I didn't one hour once in an hour ten another time how much time did you get out of that in the long run for ten minutes are the two sets yeah two sets is 10 whole minutes so you know a lot of it gets tossed out a lot of it's in the moment a lot of it it's not applicable or maybe it is someday once I hash it out Edinboro yeah people that do that they say like you know you're there for like a month and you have to do a different hour every night what that's what some comics say that they go and they do that oh my god you get so much time out of it didn't Maron or is it Melbourne one of those Marin has a fantastic story about going over to some festival and bombing horrific Lee Melbourne I think it's about it's a great story though it's really good at telling because it's like really early on in his career and just the whole thing was just wrong you know the wrong vibe thing where it's caught up in the wrong and if you start off a weak bombing totally brings up so many feelings right away recover that feeling when you start off Thursday night eating shit on stage all the blood is in your head you're like how am I even still standing here when all the Bloods in my head and you can't even believe they're gonna let you go up on Friday but it's just cuz they couldn't find a substitute for you and you're like oh my god here we go seeing spots I had two sets this one place in Connecticut the first thought I had was great it was really fun it was easy it was fun the second set I had it was awful I was terrible Hartford I was bombed no I wasn't even hard for it was like some bar gig in Connecticut but it was just early on in my career and it was just I had another one after that that went well but everyone gave me the stink-eye Oh dink either way their friend couldn't believe that I did well this time compared to the last time they wanted to keep bringing up the last night even though I had a good set they kept wanting to bring up the last time when I ate shit up there I'm like I know I bombed so bad I don't think I ever told us here but at the Schomburg improv which they called the Chicago improv I know where that place is it's an hour away from sucky but anyway I went there and I was opening for timing fest Emily and I went out there and like I did this and I was used to I was like in the middle doing last comics so I've been dealing with all paid audiences so I was like I was like I think I'm a killer now and I went I mean bomb like 20 minutes of just zero like where I was like I almost said is this thing on like it was that bad and so it's my it was my second night and I'm just I'm like 10 minutes into my 20 and I'm dying and Tammy comes onstage and takes the mic out of my hand and and I'm like you know what I'm always like ready to say something like I'm Eliza I know I couldn't believe it she goes Amy um and she's like everyone I'm really sorry but there's been a bomb threat I'm like this is what she says when someone's bombing like this bitch I cannot believe this but there was it's in a strip mall there was a bomb threat in the mall so we ought to evacuate and she wanted to be the one to tell them and so we're all like and I was like fucking thank God you know diviner for all filing it'll be there and I'm filing out with the crowd and they're all talking about like how bad you were horrible I was oh my god and then just night after night just taking it to the chin just going out there's so awful yeah a bomb threat while you're bombing is never never good though I don't know it's all wrong Buffalo in five minutes okay what what was wrong was a you was the audience yeah what made you turn the corner as a comic just I think bombing so many times that you just don't care and then once you don't care with a name yeah cuz they're not worried they trust you and because I might think my jokes were funny it wasn't that my material got that much better you just nervous up there I was just like is this okay is this okay oh yeah it's funny oh that wasn't funny okay like quick let me get to this other thing is this fun you know just tap dancing through my set and then and then it was like oh that made you upset well let me say this thing that's ten times worse than that last thing you got mad at and I don't care and then yeah just they just be totally unapologetic yeah do you think it's more difficult as a woman to do stand-up no you don't I've had a very sweet path like and I think I've worked really hard and I think I don't know what the quote is but like opportunity plus preparation equals success okay thanks I don't know but it's like I have worked really hard right but but I am I think it's annoying I think it's harder to be a woman I think being in check sucks and I wouldn't wish it on anybody for real yes really yes it's awful what's awful about it everything you're like born with this invisible calendar counting down to your last fuckable day you're you're you're valued by your appearance above all else but at the same you bake less you're you're taught that there's no there's no ceiling to what you can do don't and yes there is and society wants only a specific thing from you and even though you're programmed a different way it's but aren't you proof positive that that's not the case that that's always gonna be the case right but aren't you proof positive that there is no ceiling and that you can be successful with hard work and talent I mean that's what you've done right I think you're way more talented than a lot of men I know way way more successful as well but the people that have seen those men and me perform would still tell me that I was their favorite female comedian they've ever seen her like it's a handicap like would you say that like you're my favorite black comedian I've ever said it's I think it's really weird yeah well fuck them for that but I've said that before she's one of the finest girls ever yeah all-time well you know like Roseanne Barr was on and I went like super I was super conscious to not say that she's one of the funniest women of all time because I think she's one of the great ones yeah I think if you had a pic like you know I could top 50 greatest comedian list ever Roseanne Barr in my opinion it's like she's a real she was a real pioneer because she had a very specific unique style when she came out yeah she was hard-hitting and aggressive and she didn't give a fuck if you liked her she wasn't trying to look pretty shut up you know she just and she shoved it down your throat just knowing it was good and well-written stuff and performance delivery so yeah I made I'm but I could see how that would be annoying like then just numbers like how many how many female comics are headlining theaters on the road right how many of them are in successful relationships how many of them I've seen a pazsitzky that's it yeah they sort of broke the rule the boss I'm you know boss and Bonnie yeah you know there's like there's good for the ladies in Boston Bonnie Solaris two because Bonnie's a smart one and fauces the you know the guy who's constantly the butt of advice is there he's the butt of the jokes like all of their podcasts you know it's like schimper shitting all over how dummy yeah but then it's like you know it's like I I am successful as a comic right now but then it's like but then there's also a price to be paid for that for being a girl okay but is it with everybody or is it with idiots you know and isn't the price that you pay when you're ready it's no I mean good people nice people I think I think it's most people still want a kind of I think I think some people are grateful for for the female comics that they they love like like I was grateful for the my favorite comics were we're girls growing up and and those community characters and I was really grateful for them and so I still and I hope that people will feel that way about me one day but I'm just talking about the differences we were just discussing the differences between men and female comics and how few female comics there are and about when you look at the number of females that are headlining theatres and there's and that they were always your biggest influences and you're always big fans of these female comedians that's a good listener well I'm very fascinated by the subject because you know I had a conversation once with Judy gold about an interview that I did where we were talking about she's so funny she's very she's an animal - she fucking she's a killer she's so good but she's also you know smart just quick yeah if you fuck with her she'll kill you you know she knows how to just shut things down like it especially a heckler yeah it shuts him down but oh I remember I was gonna say um well please don't say it then I'm sorry but I think a lot of people are probably pretty relieved when Judy and I leave the room Watts come on no one who's worth a fuck yeah I know I think you're right and the people I'm close to and the people that I love and then I care about our you know our end are into it but you know what I think I think still there's a lot of work to be done in the world with like the perception of what we want from from women maybe I see what you're saying I I'm sure I would see it from a completely different perspective if I was you and I'd lived your experiences my experience though with friends and people that I care about is you know I don't always agree with Jerry Seinfeld but one thing that Jerry Seinfeld said that I really do agree with there someone's talking about diversity and comedy and he was like look I this is all I speak it's funny I just I want to know what's funny like what I think is our people are funny if they're men if they're women if they're black if they're white he goes I just like funny and that's true because Chris Rock is one of his best friend's was a dude who used to host MTV half-hour comedy hour Mario Joyner is a guy who's been as well a friend forever yeah but I think he's I think that the conversation was with Colin Quinn when he was talking about why he had no women or black people on the first season of his riding in in cars with comedians and and it's like funny is funny but are you looking for what's fun are you I don't think of you know do you have your hand on the pulse of are you who's it whose stand up are you going down to watch who Jerry Seinfeld men in general like you know you know what's fun I think that's true what's funny is honey and like I don't I don't I would never specify like this is my favorite female comic this is my favorite black comically that's insane to me right um but I think people what they are looking for if they're like I'm gonna Google comedians in cars and often they're there yeah yeah yeah yes that's what it is it's a talk show but I don't see his show does it he interviews people like Larry David well it's he he interviews people that he thinks are interesting that's all it is I mean he just gets like David Letterman goes for a drive in his Volvo right yeah and then the second season he had Sarah on yeah he had you know he had women I cuz Collins like you're gonna get a lot of shit for this but that's not wait did it yeah I think that's what he was saying when he said the interview he's like I don't care he goes all I care about is funny I think you're like that I think I'm like that you don't think he's like that no I don't know I have no idea I have no idea but what I'm saying is um I think that that's what what he was talking about was Collin I'm telling him like you can't just like heaven no it was actually an interview it was an interview without an interview no no no no no no it was here it is it so this guy here I'll play [Music] [Music] what's going on here but no this really pisses me off but but you made a comment on the Tina Fey episode that I thought it was interesting that I'd like to get your thoughts on a little bit more you said you were talking to her and you said something about the female comedians it's a struggle for them to balance their feminine projections with their comedic goals yeah and in the context of comedy not gender diversity I just want to know what you meant by that well I was kind of curious what it's like to be a woman in comedy as opposed to a man there was a little bit of a difference and I thought that might be an interesting thing to discuss from her perspective she's so successful at it and I'm just wondering how she looked at it if she even thought about it and she kind of gave me the answer which is yeah you do have to think about that but you know it's just another thing to think about okay yeah a lot of things about communities of cars in the beginning the first ten I did I think we're all white males and people writing all about that which I part of the reason why is I people had tweeted at me when I said I'm interviewing with Jerry Seinfeld okay ask him about their gender diversity on it yeah I mean it's people think it's it's the census or something I mean this is represent the actual pie chart of America who cares it's just funny you know funny is is the is the world that I live in you're funny I'm interested you're not funny I'm not interested and I have no interest in a gender or race or anything like that but everyone else is kind of with their little calculating is this the exact right mix you know III think that's to me it's anti comedy it's anti comedy it's it's more about you know PC nonsense okay then are you making us laugh or not right right he definitely also talked about that when he just sat on stern and but in reference Colin saying that he was gonna get get a bunch a bunch of shit about that also he's talked about it a few times yeah yeah yeah but I think I don't know I mean you disagree with them I think I'm not gonna disagree with the statement what's funny is funny I I think what somebody thinks it's funny I don't think you should just have a woman or a the person who's not white on to not make people upset right I don't think that's you know I have my own feelings about like I have my stuff my old stuff with that triggers for me is going back to when I was young like really young in school and and and being funny and and having but but knowing and getting a reaction from people like just try to be like nice and pretty like that's what we want from you like be a girl like shut up the boys are talking we're funny and knowing I was funnier wait a minute why does that him saying that he doesn't believe in anything but funny trigger that in you because I don't believe that that he's aware or looking I think I think that I think that maybe he would be more likely to dismiss someone or not really pay that much attention to to something other than what he's used to thinking is it's funny like it like it being like a white if your favorite comedians the people you want to have on the first season of your show know your first ten episodes are all one type then then that's your type and I don't think that you can say what's I don't think you can say what's funny is funny because there are plenty of comedians that go up there and kill and I'm like nothing you know and like Chris Rock I think I said this on here last time but he told me like like how was how was his set and humble like he killed I'm like yeah but how was it and he's like no respect the kill and like I was just talking about this with Wanda Sykes she was like yes sometimes you can't and I'm like yeah sometimes you can't so it's like okay what's funny is funny what what makes what makes a roomful people you know tears laughing you can say well that's they're laughing it's funny but to you it's not it's not funny but it's not up to you but I can't tell you what's funny and what's not like I don't think anyone can say what's funny is funny actually it's subjective right but you say what's funny to you and that is what's funny is I totally understand that but I don't understand why you connect it to what your personal feelings I'm saying but saying that you weren't funny and you were a girl and that you were everything it wasn't funny they were saying well they wanted to be quiet they wanted you to be quiet and they wanted the guys to be talking and you were funnier than the guy right like me like as a person with a personality was like dismissed like you're right we will come get the girls like when we need I understand you from you but why do personally but him why does that his statement had zero to do with gender or race wasn't because he was saying very clearly he doesn't care as long as you're funny that's what you care you can make a statement what's funny is funny I mean think that's so easy to say like you just that's such a like I don't care you can just say I don't care with what's funny is funny so you're accusing him of being dishonest no absolutely what he means I'm so confused I don't I love you I don't want to get into an argument with you about I don't at all feel like we're in an arc okay okay good I want I want you to understand to um what I'm saying is I believe that he believes what he's saying you're saying he discriminates in some way because of his choices and that his choices should reflect a broader range of human beings just to I don't think I would never use like the word should with what Jerry Seinfeld should be watching so tell me how his choices bring up in you this that someone other you were personally discriminated against because I think to say what's funny is funny is like I don't think that's true because because comedy is so subjective right like somebody goes to him right but wait let me let me like work through this okay um but but that's the thing right what's funny is funny to me it's like um so but but he didn't I don't think he said that I think he said what's funny is funny no I'm sorry he's interested what this is he said the language I speak is funny all I'm interested in is if you're funny that's what he said right so saying that but then also choosing 10 white male comics for the first season of his show he's saying like sorry if you guys were funnier um other races and weight and and women then you would have been on the first season in my show and I'm saying I don't think that he's seen I don't think that he's is open to seeing people other than that that prototype and that is what connects me to my childhood stuff because people are used to this is who I'm used to being funny people who look like this people who do this and and so that's that's why I'm connecting it I understand I understand what you're saying I think you're adding a lot of extra stuff to what he's saying and I think you're also not taking the consideration the idea that this is his individual creation this idea of a web show and that he has probably dozens and dozens of friends if he's doing ten episodes and he has dozens of the greatest comedians in the world I don't think that it should be up to him to diversify his cast neither do I so then what he said is essentially I'm interested in our people funny if you're funny that's what I'm interested in to him that's a true statement yeah it may be very well suggest subjective you might think that some of those people are not funny whereas you know there's people that think that a perfect example is Gilbert Godfried there's people that think that Gilbert Godfrey is the funniest dude to ever walk yeah not every comedian III know communi what I'm saying is every comedian you can say this guy's hilarious and then someone else is saying hmm and I don't like it when when I would never say any comedians not funny like just no he's not funny it's like no you don't think right it's funny exactly it's like everything else it's like music it's like movies it's like anything else I don't want I don't think Seinfeld should have done anything different and I don't I don't I don't think that he should have to I think he wants to make this show he should make it with the people he wants just like the like girls that show got a bunch of shit for just having white people like let them make the show that they want right but I'm allowed to that's allowed to trigger something in me that I can feel like his choice to not do that even though he's every right and I think you should make the show you want to make that does trigger something in me I know it's not that when Elijah Towe do you feel it's fair does it make sense objectively when you analyze your feelings inside of you no no okay so you know you don't validate them you don't try to justify them they're just in there I understand I have a right to my feelings about it I don't think they're right or wrong okay and I think all day long were triggered by by people or interactions it's like why you yell at a bank teller it's like me why did I but do you know what I mean it's like you know somebody triggers something in you and it brings up old stuff and I think Seinfeld so funny I really like him I see him when I'm at the cellar and I but but seeing that hearing talk about on Stern it it brings up it does bring that up for me and I don't I don't think that and I understand why it doesn't make sense to you well I know it's a not saying that it doesn't make sense your feelings absolutely make sense you know we might disagree with whether or not it's valid but you seem to think that it's not even valid that it's just reality and just these are feelings that are brought up and these are your feelings and you don'tyou don't justify them or rationalize them in any way I think it makes both I think it makes perfect sense for why that would trigger that in me right but as long as you don't hold him responsible I don't I don't think you should do anything different some people do though there's a lot of well that's good you're a very healthy attitude I mean I really don't I think but I think what's saying like what's funny is funny is it I think that statement should and maybe you did and I just didn't catch it but it should include what what's funny to me is funny to me because hmm because funny I think I was implied you know he's saying my interest is I'm interested in what's funny that's course ma'am some people speak with like a lot of authority about a lot of things I and I I don't know I've never heard him say this but I think I think some people can act like they are the decider of what's funny and what's not and I don't think and I you know I've had a great I've had a great reaction like I feel very lucky and like work has paid off and people come to see me mm-hmm and I make people laugh I think but um someone's like I don't like your stand-up I'm like sure if they're like you're not funny I'm like no that's not true right okay I get all that personal shit but I think you might be applying it in this situation in a way that's like you're adding a bunch of stuff to what he said you know I really think everybody said well this this the feelings like this connecting it to him saying that you know or him being some sort of an arbiter of what's fun you know what I should add into the mix here you PMSing no no but again that is something that nature creates that's not my fault that were punished for like why are you being crazy like do you think I want to feel crazy am I like oh can I please like bleed once a month and feel insane cuz that's what I want no and I think I might be PMS no but I also you know I've been past that I've been working at the Comedy Cellar for seven years now and been a stand-up for ten I also you know i-i've interactions with with Seinfeld once in a while mm-hmm and so this isn't just me seeing the comedian Jerry Seinfeld has a television as a web series and he didn't use its I'm not just reading these headlines I also have like you know personal experiences with him that lead you to believe you think's in a certain way just like and you know what these are I'm sure they're unfounded what they check what they trigger and in me but you can't help that stuff people do it to me all day I know I look like I look like somebody who went to high school with that that like was annoying or a bitch or something and then and people just don't yeah and you're like that's not it's not my fault but you're not wrong you know so so yeah so when I see that video and what's funny is funny I do feel like kind of like he's dismissing um not by the not by the choice to to just use white male comics in the first season of your show like do your thing do whatever you want of course uh-huh but um but it you know it does it does bring up feelings in me which that's okay yeah I mean as long as you're not blaming him and you're all you're just doing is being honest about your feelings and sometimes people trigger feelings in people unintentionally I'm not doing well like I of course what I'm saying that doesn't mean that those feelings are invalid if something triggers those feelings it doesn't mean that this look life triggers shit in people you know you watch an eagle snatch a fawn and and fly off with it oh you might freak out but guess what it's tough shit that's yeah people people will like lash out at me like a girl when I was opening for a towel she would write to me like I know a girl that L was dating or just some crazy girl tell fan and it was like I know like she had created this whole thing and I people reach out that was made by the way under wasn't you yeah but I try to you Intel fucking but when people like are mad about something like that you know I I was like great like well just think like I hope she's okay you know like this is good for you but it's me yeah I hope she get hit in the head by a fucking meteor I do many people but I'm just like you know people like will feel real strong about things that make no sense or they have sort of no business like it doesn't yeah just like doesn't make any sense but it's like so you feel that way and that's okay I think I think he obviously he's an amazing comic and made one of my favorite television shows ever and and it does it and it's allowed to it's allowed to trick or something in me I mean I understand what you're doing I mean you're also trying to dancer on your words and be you know very fair about all this it's a very tricky subject it's a bold one to sort of take on I worked with these people yeah no I know what you're saying I know you're saying I'm and I'm glad you don't think that I think in that way at all I try to I think it triggers something in you because you're mad that people were yes because I don't think that you should be forced to hang around with anybody other than the people that you choose to hang around with whether it's cast them on your own television show or whether it's put them on your podcast or whether it's go with on the road with that whatever you like it's I don't think you should have to but I don't love that he didn't naturally want to do that and I'm allowed to be naturally wanting to do something doesn't mean I don't think you have enough choices like let's say well then that I mean that's a different conversation I think the whole conversation because there's only 10 spots I mean how many people does he love that are in those 10 spots and why do one or two I don't know can you I don't know I have no idea I really have only watched two of them I watched the one with not Eddie Izzard what's what's homeboy Eddie the other Eddie other English Chevy god damnit famous guy not Eddie Izzard the other one Benny Murray oh no of course in the sky what the fuck is his name who's that other famous English guy that fucking other comedian that's on all the time you must be one of the ten funny what are you all who's the other guy was on Opie and Anthony with them jesus fucking christ i can't believe i can't remember his name oh my god come on he's one of the 10 funniest people right alive thank you ricky gervais thank you very much Amy Schumer sister comes in the closet I can't believe it sorry Ricky Gervais I love it I was I was so blown away by Eddie Izzard accomplishment of running a thousand miles the office know that his comedians and cars getting coffee is that what you're asking okay so he the 10 funniest the only one I saw I saw Ricky Gervais and I saw Letterman those are the two that I've seen he's yet he's had a bunch of them Alec Baldwin Larry Larry David Brian Regan he had a bunch of his friends I mean that's really essentially what he had he had ten of his friends and they happened to be all white guys yeah I think that triggers Chris Rock was on there too though I guess I was that season one yeah season two Chris Rock was on season two that season and then there's Louie CK in there and Sarah Silverman's in there season one these are the these are the what's funny is funny with time for Michael Richards Carl Reiner Mel Brooks can't argue that whenever Colin Quinn and Mario Joyner there's a black are by the way Mario joiners you know he's a good friend of his Larry's comedian look I don't think he's having meetings I just he's putting a bomb but he thinks it's funny those are the people he got you know I don't know Larry I can see what you're saying and I but I I don't think you're dealing with it I would I would never put somebody on my show because I thought they filled like course some diversity count you know like I think everybody should be able to do have whatever if you if you never had girls ever on your podcast that's your choice and I would have feelings about it and not because you should have to have them because I like I love that you love women and think women are funny and that's not it's not all of them no I like the funny ones I know but I'm saying that's that's the men to go why because because there are there are still men who are just like mmm the women in the clubs I swear that's still that's still yeah well I and I don't think that Seinfeld even feels that way I was going back to what I was saying about Judy gold is a conversation that we had about this interview that I did was what I was trying to say in the interview was that I think it's it's way more difficult proposition not saying that women can't be funnier or better or you know more clever but I think that starting out there's reactions that a lot of people have that are prejudiced against women they don't necessarily have against men when a woman goes on stage I feel like she's a point behind at least one you know right away especially if she goes on stage and she has any sort of opinions about politics or sexuality or anything I mean a lot of times women are forced in a lot of ways to be self-deprecating at a level that a man isn't just to sort of get in the door well a guy doesn't want to listen to you unless he thinks he could definitely fuck you there's that maybe for some people I don't even believe that I don't even believe that but some guys yeah but um I think I think Judy's hilarious I think you know you know I'm not like I'm looking I'm looking at you or we're having this conversation and I think like men are are all triggered by women in general because like who's the one you've known the long is your mom you would try women in general I think when women talk yeah when would win like a woman is talking longer than you like it can it can just yeah I think I think what about what a man's talking longer you want to beat the shit out of them it's a completely different reaction really yeah when men are talking long you like dude shut the fuck up it's it's it's an aggressively assaulting on your senses sort of thing when a guy is like overbearing it talks too much men get angry you know men might get bored if a woman everybody gets bored if anybody has shitty social cues yeah if they're boring and monotonous and self-obsessed and they don't understand the ins and the outs of a conversation the ebb and flow of two people enjoy each other's company if one person just yapping at you like I'm doing right now just yapping at you I'm not even letting you talk right I think when you go on a stage as a woman when you start out you have a strike against you yes more than what I think I have enjoyed that strike I kind of miss it because it was really fun to go up there and surprise everybody it still is right so like your first joke you get off boom they start laughing I feel tension leave the room and then yeah then they have the other confidence when I got eliminated from Last Comic Standing cuz I I just um they're bringing that show back how dare they I know and uh and they posting it uh JB smooth oh really yeah and he hosts the last ones know JB smooth fucking irony I got a great story about him but they showed me a clip one of my worst bombings ever what following no I went on before him oh my god he was supposed to go on first and I was supposed to go on second we were working together in New Jersey and he got lost I got lost - it was a really hard place to find there's some weird fucking college in New Jersey so the show was already like 20 minutes late and there JB's not here and I got let there lay and they said we're gonna wait for him to come I want you to have a seat in the rec room so I sit down on the record when I started watching this documentary on the Malibu fires and oh my god is it depressing people who lost their homes and this kid was calling out for their dog they were hoping their dog made it and they walked a smoldering fucking embers of their house and they're walking around rusty where are you rusty they're calling out for a dog this guy comes down and he was a fireman and he didn't even lose his house they saved his house but his neighbor's lost their house and this guy was weeping I mean openly weeping he was talking about how this house is all he has and then he saved for forty years to build this house and this was his house and he was so worried he was gonna lose this house and he feels bad that he's happy that he kept his house because his neighbors lost their house and he's fuckin crying and weeping and they go okay JB smooth still not here so we're gonna have you go on stage so can you go on stage now and I was like yeah okay okay yeah let me just get a water and I'll go on stage and I just went on stage him just I ate the shit buffet of my life and my girlfriend was with me you know and I try to explain it to her why but she had seen me doing well before but I try to explain to her like I know there's no I was just not gonna do good there's no way I would do good I just it was horrible horrible experience so I went up there and just ate plates of shit and then JB smooth shows up after me and destroys just levels the place and they were so happy to see him because I was so terrible yeah oh and they were like he was really funny at NACA I swear he's funny I could hear them talking when I got offstage about how bad I was like the people that booked it they were like trying to say at the convention he was very funny that's why we bought him and then I go I'm sorry I watched that thing on the fires they go why'd you do that I'm like you fucking sat me in that room with the TV that was on I didn't didn't flip the channel to that shit that just was on I learned a lesson now he's valuable what you have in your mind right before you go onstage very very very important I've done it more than 1 times where I've gone they're introducing you write a book about the Kennedy assassination once all day read this book all day for like 10 hours and then when I stitch and who's a deck just Chomp Chomp Chomp Chomp just couldn't be fine I also take a fucking kill Kennedy they fucking kill Kennedy ok the casket was empty ok there's a different in there autopsy report for us fucking ranting to anybody wanted to listen to me no you're just listening the eye of the tiger no now I just try to be relaxed and have fun and I try have a bunch of different songs that I like to listen to yeah I'd like to listen to like fun music you know and have my friends around but no negativity and just no even if something negative happens everybody has a good energy yeah not getting in there I gotta go see you giggle all the way out of there yes my rocks and fucking tortures are being thrown my way you gotta know what to let and what not to let in right before you go onstage super important especially when people pay to see you you know someone's going out there to see Amy Schumer you can't go on stage yeah that's huge that's everything I mean that's what endears you to fans there's no other way around it and you remember what it was like when you were a fan yeah you know bill burr was on the podcast he said it best and you know in sort of his own bill burr type language he was armed I when I was a kid I go see a band and then he goes see him a year later and they fucking phone it in they just say fuck I never forgot you know and I just make a deal with people I'm not gonna fuck you I'm not gonna fine no I'm not gonna fuck you I'm right new jokes I'm not gonna fuck you I'm gonna work hard yeah well he's a real artist you know I'm he's really that guy he's he's really a great comic I mean that's what he's supposed to do in this life he found the perfect occupation he's fantastic at it and he's got a real ethic for it there's a gang of them right now there's you know there's guys people that people haven't heard of like christina pazsitzky and Tom Segura is gaining steam those guys are getting singing the podcast is gaining steam and then there's people that people forgot about like a towel we're just you know I'm telling bill burr are my like I would pay to see them above everybody else right now Meade stanhope standing up over everybody he's my boy he's so funny yeah well there's a great a bunch of great ones right now I don't know Peretti I think is like I need you know you have to see her I need to see her Joey Diaz is my all-time favorite though if I had to choose one comic the last set that I ever get to see in my life before the fucking great meteor lands yeah it's Diaz for me Diaz smoking a joint on stage talking about his balls are you enjoying doing your show yeah is it stressful it's yeah it's a lot of work but it's worth it yeah yeah but it's a lot of work but the result you're you're enjoying the process you're enjoying I enjoy the process of making it yeah yeah yeah it's getting great reviews yeah you're saying like yeah you know I was like I'm gonna make this show that I think is really funny and I didn't know if if people were gonna be it was a lot of darkness on your show well you're a happy dark person it's an unusual type of darkness it's not overwhelming it's not overbearing is the better word yeah you know it's yeah have fun but I do yeah my mind goes dark but it's not like yeah I'm not like do you face any resistance like subject matter wise or like the things you want to cover no no I don't think so not really no that's awesome yeah but then it's like a lot of pressure because they're like okay the network like no notes well they're letting us like this season we were like we don't think you should be bleeping the word pussy and they were like all right we're like what don't be a pussy or my pussy mmm either whoa can't be sexual hmm well then it's never my pussy no it is my pussy my pussy hurts yeah that's sexual this is certainly depends on how you say it yeah one that black dick right my pussy hurts then it's just like oh she's a sign matter so they said yes that yeah that's not bleep ting we were like would welcome to the Internet okay the internet exists you can't just fucking pretend those words aren't being banged around like I thought it was real cool badminton Birds brink toss and pussy around these days different world I know I am yeah it's a different world right you know if it's all self-imposed all their restrictions on language completely sorry babe but I mean people yeah they're just like scared they don't wanna lose their job but I really appreciate them doing that well it's not they lose their job it's losing advertising revenue and you're the revenue that are getting from you is you're already a controversial comedian you're ready tackling you know dangerous subject matter so what about shit shit get flies to right well you could say bullshit right there's I heard the tonnage issue I think you can say shit like a couple of times oh yeah now if your show airs late at night like the after certain time is it do they have a difference in what they bleep and what they don't I know they did stand-up yeah totally you can yeah if there's a lot less bleeps after there's subject-matter restrictions though even in the unbleached one so it's interesting like they bleep some shit out when they aired my stand-up special my last special they bleep some shit out of the earlier stuff blanket she they bleep some shit out of the earlier stuff that they left that they edited out of the unedited stuff yeah like they decided like without the bleeping it's just yeah this gay marriage Time Machine bit I have we what I love that you did it you didn't Atlanta right yeah yeah why why did you choose Atlanta I love Atlanta you love it I love it too it's an awesome City yeah it's one of those cities that people don't they sleep on it yeah sleep on it Lana Lana is a great city and those people are ready to go nuts they're very it's a very diverse city - it's there's a lot of diversity in Atlanta there's a lot of like there's a lot of alternative people as far as like tattooed up and piercings there's a lot of like real southern people there's a lot of black people a lot of black like people that are professionals like a lot of black lawyers you run into a lot of black like more so I think you see more integration of black and white folks yeah hanging out and partying together you know I see that more in Atlanta than I do almost anywhere and I'm sure racism still exists I'm not naive but I think that I'd i enjoy the diversity when i go out in atlanta i think it's a feeling so much so that i've thought about living there there's a lot of nonsense in atlanta bunch of people like yeah the same vibe there like it's everybody age race nothing matters everybody's like just hanging out I think whenever you have people that are more inclined to be partying you're gonna have people that are more inclined to be fun you know I mean that's just the reality of the world that we live in and could pretend to be noble by like what you were talking about earlier like abstaining from sex or abstaining from things that you enjoy yeah you could pretend to be noble but let's get the fuck over that this is not right and who's gonna be more inclined to do that as people that are more comfortable with it yeah you know I love that place it's great look like the less restrictions people have the more I think you know people and come to like a comfortable state on their own without being oppressed because that oppression is always gonna make people spring back in the other way if you tell people they can't drink they want to drink more tell people that can't fuck they fuck behind every goddamn closed door you can fine I dated this girl in Catholic school when I talked about her this poor girl could not she could not help herself if you rolled a dick down a ball of yarn in front of a kid did you just dive on it she didn't know what she was doing she would dive on it like a crazy person like she she literally like it's unfair if a guy pulled his cock out in front of her because her hair was just like a fucking leprechaun showed up at the bottom of the Rainbows like no cold it's right here suppression suppression Catholic suppression all that crazy human beings don't like to be told like I have children and I have daughters and I see it very clearly when you tell them what they do they I want to do it anyway but if you rationalize with them and have conversations with them and say listen you can't do it because it's raining outside and it gets dangerous and this is electricity and electricity causes spark so you can't do it can't go outside with this oh okay but I want to I know it looks like fun it's great right now you got to go to bed but I want to stay away but you got to be up in eight hours and you gonna be really tired I know you want to get but listen just relax we'll read some stuff I can't I I have these like rationalization conversations with them to try to avoid that backlash that comes from being an overbearing parent or an overbearing teacher yeah those that people don't like that shit no nobody likes you telling them what to do the way it is right that's why suppression doesn't work in any form whether it's sexual suppression or suppress making you know alcohol difficult to get a hold of people want it look what the fuck is going on in Portugal you know they they decriminalized all drugs and they have way lower cases of HIV way lower cases of addiction they they're there all these numbers drop their society like leveled out because there wasn't this massive stigma attached to all this stuff anymore I don't mean why not why not porch up probably I think you go somewhere another country I mean you unless I go for work I would at least want to acquire a rudimentary grasp of the language yeah just out of respect yeah that's tough ladies very hard Portuguese even in Spain like you think you speak Spanish and they're like well France apparently you know everybody like talk shit about the French but from my experience or my friends experiences that I've talked to them they say as long as you try as long as you like some effort to communicate with them they're very polite what they don't like is Americans like how much is this right I give you American money and I like shake it in front of face in Spain you're like to say something Spanish and they would answer you in English oh really but yeah but they're like yeah yeah sorry questo they're like $20 did you like Spain do yeah I loved it my buddy Chris lived there for a few years there um he lived in Barcelona yeah because he used the Castilian less but it was just the two of us what is the Castilian list Barcelona owes how they say it yeah but like below no not if you're from Jersey wait a minute over there they say barthelona yeah really I didn't I mean not all over Spain but if you're in Barcelona they do it yeah mm-hmm and it's called the Castilian this that's fascinating that's I learned a new thing from Amy Schumer I had no idea that was a case probably 30 hours total and that's the newest the new thing I'm sure of a bunch of things in the past let me review them don't get touchy well he said that he never learned anything from me and he was implying that I was a dumb girl and that's myself that what does that mean is that me I learned Barcelona Lisp dallona like Castilian Lisp imagine like you're just talking to your girlfriend she knows you're from New Jersey and all of a sudden just the two of you and you're like oh Barcelona and you're like uhm Barcelona say it right say a bitch you know who we are like please espana yeah españa like when the next time we go to Espania wait what what what you mean Spain the fuck are you saying you're from Trenton I you know I believe when you're over there in the culture you should have mirror yourself it's just the two of us there's a lot of annoying fucking people out there Amy Schumer but if it wasn't for them we would have less to talk about hm we wouldn't have as much fun doing comedy we have to air our grievances on a microphone in front of drunk people yeah and well not only that there's a given I take to the universe and if everything was all blissful we would have literally nothing to talk about or talk shit about on stage if without chaos we wouldn't exist Amy Schumer we would not exist as comedians it be known there would no need for us if everyone achieve enlightenment we're a dinosaur we just don't know it yet as soon as the fucking the the Machine plugs in and everybody becomes one the transcendental mine universal mind mesh happens due to technology we're out of business you gotta stock up all this inside Amy Schumer money now while you can okay because once the fucking singularity hits you and I are fucked any day now probably 20 49 but any day now can happen you need someone's dude from Silicon Valley or one gal or one guy in another country it's gonna come up with something some fucking invention that's gonna change the whole game and flip it right on its head and we're all gonna be able to read each other's minds and there will be no more jokes I'm more worried that I forgot to TiVo divas on E this week I think you could probably get that on-demand we live in a new era you can get a lot on demand a lot of shows the shows are going on demand diffused with comedy inside Amy Schumer it's on tomorrow night right it seems more like an interview than any conversation I've ever had with you know oh well it's usually like a bunch of yeah well no it's just the the breaking down the mindset you know like I love talking about the process I love talking to glad we do it more often yeah let's do it when are you back here again I'm here in the next two weeks and I'm okay well you going back to New York yes keeping with the money leaving with our milk and honey going back to your dirty city on the other side we're all back the goal it's not cold anymore you can return to your lair that's right joy uh what you're hedging your bets against earthquakes by living here a few months out of the year so where you doing good scared yeah I just had my first one it was not fun I think my pool is broken [Music] [Laughter] I noticed the crack the other day I don't think the flowers great got me these bitches these motherfuckers in there earthquake the really crazy thing is those poor crazy assholes that live on those hills like when you go through Laurel and you drive up the canyon and he sees people that are literally perched on on these he's still gonna do it's crazy I watched one house fall apart when I was when I first moved here and wasn't a really big earthquake it was a small you know what actually I want to say might not have even been an earthquake it was a landslide and it was a landslide arm on on Laurel Canyon I guess you're going up if you're headed towards the improv you're going up the valley on the right-hand side there's this house that the back of it just came down and just crushed the house it was only that house on the street so I'm pretty sure was just a local landslide just destroy this entire house pushed it off its foundation it happened really recently in Malibu to like well over the last couple of years there was a neighborhood where these people got woken up at the middle the night these bang bang noises and it was their house breaking apart and falling down the hill and they escaped they ran out of the house just in Tyler half their house went tumbling into the canyon how do you sleep like a baby you do you really do like a bear like a hibernating bear like a bear they got shot with a tranquilizer dart that's good because I feel like you're mine like I just know we're gonna get out of here I'm gonna work out at midnight and then I'll work out for like an hour so and then I'll be exhausted by the time to clock in the morning rolls out and then I'm out 8 hours like to sleep 8 hours tomorrow gotta get up a little bit early because I got to do some ESPN type shit got to talk about some fights upcoming fights on Fox this weekend I'm also I'm a fox analyst you know I'm a sports analyst I can't no I did I can't believe like yeah why you're like you're Beyonce are you sure definitely not her or anyone's marathons I'm just talking it's a lot harder to run the marathons I wouldn't do it you use your mind like like you know like I get tired playing chess like I some buddies like oh this like stuff with the the plane like I just my mind just shuts off it's just too much for me to process and I'm just like but you don't get tired when you're working on your show right I mean you do but you're so enthusiastic about right yeah I think not yeah okay totally the same thing it's a completely exactly the same thing I get different mindset well it's just what do you you're not passionate about chess so if you're playing chess you like oh my god I'm investing too much energy and there's fuck this but if you're working on your show trying to put a sketch I'm like very meticulous and serious about it yeah it's the same thing with me I'm just lucky that there's like more than one thing that I do like you know between
