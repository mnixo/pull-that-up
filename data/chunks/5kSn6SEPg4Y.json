the girag an experience we just we just adapt it to our environment mm-hmm this is one reason why Chinese people have like really skinny eyes I don't know what it is but whatever the reason is why they like to develop that that thin slit where you're you know you don't have like this big wide eye and develop like a less hairy body whatever those reasons are I don't know what they are but that had to adjust thank God for them woman like every one of those attributes the littles the little slit eyes so she can't she can't see that I have no hair because she can only see the middle part of my face and she's got no hair so that's that's really nice alert aful feet a lot of them do but there's some of those women that get their feet bound that's an Asian thing too they were they were bred to have little tiny sweet feet they're not they're not like big American women feet with the fucking bunion and like and there's a like one toe that's longer than the other one it doesn't bother me no no the toe thing it doesn't bother me at all but the crooked toes bother me yeah shouldn't shouldn't really care I'm all broken up why would I get yours must be all fucked out no they're fine I'm kicking people yeah that's weird yeah I don't have any anything your feet smell go oh definitely yeah whose don't well if your feet don't smell it means you're not working yeah but they're not getting anything done mine smells like bad like I just foot spray everything and it still comes back the next maybe it's a health issue yeah maybe sandals he's segment well you know when your feet are sitting in these like polyester cotton socks right and you're sweating and so I'll just brewing funk in there I mean when you have a plastic sock okay that's what a nylon sock is your plastic socks on is anybody wear nylon socks I guess they do right they're kind of nylon right yeah rayon way to fucking socks made out of it's it's not made out of wool okay and anything other than wool it's not gonna accept all that moisture and dry it up very well so things that get soupy in there like especially if they like plastic Cotton's pretty good about back to mundo your balls smell Brian no but I'd take like two showers a day but I was thinking they should have like ball hats like where you put your balls in like a little little sock wouldn't make all underwear dude fucky talking about that you put there like smaller than pants and you put them on there like shorter than shorts wait a minute wait I feel you on this okay what would you call Greg there under your clothes under that no it's your ball Sox all Sox and then they have like an opening what if there was like you can't open for your penis to come out of like it's there technically but the flap is so big that you actually can't I'm down dude listen vest warning you want to hear a crazy thing you're talking about like intellectual connection and stuff like that so coffee was invented in Ethiopia as we said and in Ethiopia they they do it like a coffee ceremony like a you know it's a very ceremonial way to prepare it and drink it mm-hmm and when they do that this coffee ceremony they it's like they gather people together from the village they and they talk about things they talk about the news of the village they talk about things that are going on in the in the world when coffee moved from Ethiopia to Yemen totally different deal like in Ethiopia it's always a woman that makes coffee whereas in him and it wasn't like that but they still would talk about news and intellectual and stuff like that mm-hmm then coffee moved from Yemen to Europe you know Italy and England and places like that and the coffee house still remained a place for intellectual exchange and discourse and stuff like that they planned the American Revolution in coffee houses you know in they were wired right like fuck there's something but there's something about coffee that like that like get your mind going as well as it stimulates you and like wakes you up but you think there's a tea party movement like that had an effect on the the way the United States took off just by simply the fact that they went from tea to coffee that's what they there is there are people to speculate that that's holy is validus yeah that that coffee consumption is a part of the American drive to ingenuity and imagination we're on fucking speed we're country on speed I wonder if they could show gross domestic product post Starbucks you know like we're not Starbucks impacted people's productivity but still right if you go to meet somebody at a coffee shop right you're gonna talk about something that's it's different than going to drink with somebody at a bar yes or you have dinner with somebody or something like that it's different it's somehow more about exchanging information and more imagination it's stimulating it's the stimulant of caffeine in coffee is stimulating and then the flavor is enriching you enjoy the flavor and then you get fucking happy and it's been that way since the origin of coffee well coffee houses yeah coffee houses are always thought of as places where people read poetry and you know yeah I mean key politicking cetera and as you said plan revolutions that's interesting to me yeah it is interesting and and that's one of the reasons that I think that I like to work in coffee likewise what's one of the dumbest things the government has ever done is try to keep pot from people know you've smoked it you find out it's awesome you don't die and then you start just trusting everything right well masturbation think about how many people thought they were gonna die from masturbation right you lose your mind you get hair on your butt when did that's end that wasn't my time no well a little Affleck no no I'm talking about earlier times early 20th century not you know I never heard that you were gonna go blind drink oh yeah there there are medical books in the nineteenth century a log it had this whole thing about it you know they it causes insanity insanity it causes hair to grow in your palms that you know yes that weird logged isness Kellogg from Kellogg cereal yeah yeah he had a thing he was very creative people who masturbate the other thing about that book I mean the whole thing with the cornflakes the reason cornflakes were invented was to stop boys from masturbating yeah how is it how is the idea behind that we explained this before yeah the idea is that spicy foods excite the sensibilities and so if you eat something that tastes interesting you're gonna want to come so they and also graham cracker graham was another these big anti masturbation evangelizers so they invent these really intentionally bland foods you know how they like to keep the teenage boys from jerking off so that when they finger their assholes they immediately come true I'm so fuckin hard on this and they spin your finger father your cow could milk itself that would be bad climb fences cows like how that does yoga and can reach its own teats a cow that's so smart it realizes how fucking huge it is I can just run through that fence any time fences these keep cows in with that's unbelievable
