Rogan experience train my day Joe Rogan podcast by night okay we're joined today by the world's coolest wine maker what's up brother one nervous cuz I've never actually met Brian some kind of yeah he's a weird motherfucker trust me kind of make me nervous he's gonna make you more nervous as time goes on is he looking at me he's gonna have a few comments that are just getting my god dude he's looking at me look at me he does he does look at PE bones he doesn't know the effect he has on folks um how the fuck do you go from being a rock star to being a rock star slash winemaker what was the it was just a whim did you have this idea I think the biggest the biggest hurdle there you have to get over is it I don't think I've ever really been a rock star I've actually dabbled in the rock star stuff you know um ala American Psycho but for the most part it was just kind of me putting it on I've always kind of been a small town kid working in the garden so you think of yourself as just a human being who likes to do things that are interesting and this is what's interesting too you know just you know yeah I done things over the years and just get get inspired and do more things and then all sudden accidentally overlong the way somewhere you you make a few dollars on something and I just go great then I can do more stuff but even the way you did this is so uniquely you you know you didn't you didn't do it in Sonoma County didn't take an established orchid orchard rather and you know take over it you know you went to a weird place you went to fucking Arizona you know people think of Arizona you think of kidnappings and and in Mexico and you know that's easy don't think of nicety yeah you don't think of wine vineyards well historically almost almost every state that could actually sustain grapes then--if er of so European grapes almost every state had vineyards and really and prohibition just threw a wrench stuck total monkey wrench in that and we can go down the whole conspiracy theory regarding prohibition oh yeah well it's a beautiful one yeah it's real still working today with marijuana yeah insane same people right so it's a so that pretty much what that did is it just interrupted our appreciation for wine as a daily and it didn't in Europe and that's why European wines became so much more popular than American wines right well you know but they have they have some places in Europe have had thousands of years to develop what's going on on there on that particular spot they've had that just decades and centuries of notes whether on the terrain on the results on the process so they're so far ahead of us in terms of just understanding those things and it's part of their culture it's the ground in the soil and what what minerals and story with people who have not had any experience in farming might not know but they vary wildly from place to place how do you find the right spot if it hasn't had a vineyard there before or do you just say this is a good spot let's you know you you join the military you get out of the military you form a band Digga million dollars you go dump that million dollars into a fucking black hole in the middle of nowhere and then go well that was the wrong hole when you move over here and you dig another hole how many times did you do oh god oh she did a few well there's a couple sites that's just start working they've tried bad one so it's it's basically at the like get a printer that can actually print money that looks real and make sure you keep changing the cartridges so did you have to buy new land did you oh use a place know you end up well I mean you just have to pick the right varietal for that spot so if you're pretty if you have a pretty good idea that an area consisting good grapes that are going to make you know the kind of wine you want to drink then it's a matter of figuring out what varietal is going to work best there I mean we're not trying to grow we're not trying to grow wine and grow grapes and Alaska that's gonna be hard you're gonna have to really hard for us to find the right vibe that Elijah Lee grow there you know we have Canadian ice wine you have like a lot of American hybrids to like that all Blanc nor in the nose kind of grapes that will grow in that extreme cold temperatures not a lot of daylight to really ripen vinifera but in our area we have everything is that everything's there everything's set up so it's just a matter of finding in that particular location that you dumped all your money into this land like it figure out what grows there it's not going to be it's probably not going to be what you think is going to grow there it's going to be something else and it's going to take a lot of trial and error and you know 40,000 dollars an acre to find out so you have to try different grapes and then go through a full season and then test the results well yeah it's more like a it's more like just looking at the soil and and that in that particular terrain and where it is and how its oriented north south east west and then try to pick the right grape for that site before you put anything on the ground figure out what grape might work there now this is a natural resource process for you is it something that you knew about already because you were interested in it or did you have to learn all this as you went along had to learn why learn the hard way so you know when you put the vine in the ground you don't know for we can might if it come you know if it sticks around the next year well then you know you're at least you got that part then you know it actually grew then you got to figure if it's going to get the point where you can actually train it to start you know setting fruit on it so you're not going to see fruit on that vine you can probably push it and get some fruit on there the third year but if you really want quality of fruit you want to just let the plant really sink in find its way get the root system to get the whole structure of it happy and healthy and then set fruit on it on the fourth year and then you make the wine out of that fruit in the fourth year and then get to try it like in its fifth year so five years down the road after having planted those vines you go well that wine sucks oh man what the fuck yeah there's no other way you can do that there's no other like high-tech DNA not necessarily mean predetermine lands right yeah if you have if you have it like if you're in California and Napa Valley and you got a vineyard over here and a vineyard over there your chances are the vineyard right here in the middle is probably gonna do okay then you'll know what to grow by what everyone around you is now you have a history but we have no history your you know your guessing you're you're trying to make it work and we're finding now through trial and error and you know many many dollars later we're finding that the Italian and Spanish and varietals and southern rhone varietals are doing pretty well what was the motivation to do this in such a you know sort of a from the beginning manner you know I mean you you went at it about his most difficult path as possible to creating them to creating a wine um that's just it was where I lived and just having traveled around the world seeing other regions that kind of resembled those regions and uh I don't know kind of on the the contrary --n you know didn't say one thing i'm going to go the other way just to balance things out so just looking at that place i just thought okay let's have an idea you're looking off your back porch i'm looking at land i saw go okay um this sounds like a i want to try this because how many other vineyards are in the arizona welders there are now when i first started there was about 20 maybe 18 bonded wineries now there's about 50 CSU model yum set yourself after them i look at like what they're using whether it's similar to yours did you have like you know anything to go on not really no I mean I had a guy from UC Davis come out and kind of chase his tail a little bit and look at and go checked lock now do you have to treat the soil in any way do you have to mulch it or not necessarily you have to make some soil adjustments if really needed but you know in a perfect world you don't do any of that you just let it be what it's going to be so because you want to really express that place as much as you can and you want it you want to help the minds along if there there's some nutrient deficiencies as you go you'll you'll notice right away in the vines if you're paying attention but you can also test for it you know it did a little petals that like the end of the vine you send them in to just see what's in them and what's not in them so they'll be able to tell you roughly what kind of a wine it will produce no they'll just play you know whether that plant is healthy so what it needs nutrients yes so whether or not I mean we could plant like I said we can plant American it's there and they'll do great thrive look look awesome but the wines crap you know you know wine made out of Norton it's very rare that you have somebody who will impress you with a glass of Norton I don't even know what Norton is never really yeah Manischewitz its equivalent the first time I ever heard about an area making things taste differently was I had a friend it was really into Cuban cigars I mean you have this V L toe I forget what the name of this one area of Cuba is but it's a small area you know and it's it's a few hundred acres or something like that and in that few hundred acres they produce all the world's Cuban cigars it's just whatever is in that soil just making all that much about cigars but I know I've had people hand me okay here's here's three different cigars that had the little thingy wrapped off it and trying out yeah oh I like that one Cuban it's amazing how strong they are it's amazing like what it actually does to you I get to fuck a drug like if you have a good solid cigar like you're like whoa like I'm high right now like this is gonna build something yeah yeah you get motivated to do things we had a guy in here yesterday Rob Wolfe was a nutritionist who's telling us that a creativity is enhanced by nicotine gum like nicotine is actually not bad for you it's bad for you as all the shit that's in cigarettes right but the nicotine itself actually you know it's a positive drug just hard for us to wrap our heads around so you you you found this spot and how many years did it take you to you producing what you have here today you have two wines here today yeah these vent the this the the rosacea that I brought this is the lady nebula Rose a this is from our southern Arizona vineyard that we actually purchased it was an existing vineyard in Graham County area called Bonita Springs vineyard so I've been you know with my cuz I have well 3 3 wineries caduceus and Merkin vineyards are my label I make these wines and then Arizona stronghold is my sister company and I'm an investor and co-founder of that company and that company bought these two existing vineyards out of southern Arizona so there's the Arizona stronger than your Cochise County out of Wilcox and the de Bonita Springs vineyard in Graham County so this is most of your focus right now is making wine when you just vary it well when it when it comes a harvest time that's that's where I have to be because there's it's there's no other way around it it's that's you know I my wife runs the lab and I make the wine so when it's harvest time Monday so start in Monday you gather up the grapes then start the process of turning them into wine yeah so it's a it's it'll it'll go on through you know we'll see our first we'll see our first White's probably around the first week of August so I have to basically be back there to just get ready and get everything ready what is the process of the fermentation process I know you gather up the wine or you gather up the grapes rather you smash them and then what happens depends on depends on how you how you do it there's some there are some people that you do the harvest you bring them in and you actually destem the grapes you put them in a December it's kind of like a big tumbler and the grapes fall through these holes these little paddles and knock the stems out the end and then they'll fall into either a crusher that just kind of pops them and puts them into the bin and you know they're pumped them into a tank or you put them in a bin and your friend um by the way or as it's de-stemmed you just leave them whole berry and that's carbonic maceration so that's more like a pinot noir process so the produce different results where they have a stem or not I think personally my my choices I do all my wines all the reds I do them carbonic maceration with the whole berry because I feel like just in the results when you crush them sometimes depending on the region the the skins and the stems and the seeds you know seeds and seeds and skins mainly when you crush them you actually have more exposure to those kind of like negative tannins kind of like a green tannins and bitter that don't quite you know they don't necessarily precipitate out how did you get involved in all this is this something you've always been fascinated with or did you just one day get into it and never look back um it's I think it's I grew up you know we're getting fruit orchards and my dad and I think it's just kind of we kind of fall into it a little bit you know reluctantly back then of course you hate it you don't want a weed you know what to look for the cutworm you don't wanted like do all that stuff but then when you look back on you actually that was pretty it was pretty cool hands-on you know when you see what's the food on your table it you know as a teenager you don't get it but later on you go we made that okay actually from Ohio originally originally from Ohio yeah uh my mother from Ohio awesome hmm I'm also from Ohio ah so and so I left he left to go to Michigan Oh uh-huh I see what's going on with Ohio people and we love him and as a you know just desert as a thank you for letting me leave but we gave you Detroit Detroit is now in northern Ohio I will thanks a lot that's sweet bears are moving in Detroit so can we try some of this stuff no I mean yes snow it something anything you can try it here I'll pour you one of these do you uh do you still do a lot of art because I know you went to college for art and a lot of your your videos are very art based do you personally do any art store or we really ever into doing it I think I was more like the director producer you know like I was kind of into the the coordinating of getting artists in a room to do things but as far as the actual talent I can't I can't believe piano I can't play guitar that can barely draw how did you become the lead singer of a band then accidentally I was the loudest asshole in the room you were the most bold uh-huh mmm that was a guy who thought I had something to say well I dug your music man but of course like everybody but I really became a fan when I read this piece that you wrote on Hicks and Gracie huh why you know he just just nailed it he nailed the whole valance of the Ballantine woman yeah yeah and Hickson himself was a fascinating guy what oh he's a there's very few people that I've met that you meet him and like right away you know there's something different about this cat and Hickson is an incredibly intense guy that's it's so rare you find a real martial arts master sort of a cliche term that we you know we think of and you know in terms of like movies the one man who is the master who has it all in control well not to take anything away from Nixon but I've actually learned more from training with Euler Euler is amazing yeah boiler and and Carlos Machado because we travel around I just I can't train consistently so I can't just walk into a dojo and just throw my ghee and respect not to have my ass handed to me and then not be able to do the show right right right so you know I just do privates and I just doing with the guys who are as old or older than me so they don't have anything to prove so it's just like hey let's just have some fun and rather than trying to put a notch in their belt with high blood well none of the older guys would do that anyway the especially the meanness when you get to a black belt level no one's trying to no they're very cool about it but you know I can't just walk into a room and just dive into a class yeah not it not at the age of 48 going on fifty did you use to do that did you used to take classes yeah you know earlier on and that's how I got injured you walk into the wrong place that they think for some reason you're you know challenging their manhood and all of a sudden it's like do them and at that point I only weighed like 135 so you're rolling into any any dojo rolling into you're like you know you might as well be somebody's child the real problem is that a blue belt a purple belt stage where you're just trying to get as many kills as you can and it's like anyone that comes along look at this guy he's only 140 pounds so that's a kill I'm gonna get this one I'm not ignoring him looking for the photo of Euler so I can prove that I actually did that oh no I no idea I've seen you I've seen photos of you and Dave Camarillo and BJ Penn and I'm sure this wine by the way delicious yeah what kind of says it was this is a rose is a rose a Nebbiolo there's there's my boy look Gracie I just saw him recently this is one of his fighters fought in the UFC a couple weeks ago mmm no a little you can see his hairline haha what an incredible family I want to talk about a family that's had an impact on martial arts it's a really an amazing thing that in the 1990s with all we thought we knew about martial arts this one family from Brazil can have this monstrous in hair and it's funny how like when now you know that and do you still see guys pimping their you know dance the air sort of much much more rare dance much more rare than ever before you know there's there's still a few holdouts that are teaching some silly form of something yet I had a friend who was working with a band and he's you know a solid practitioner finally got his black belt and but he just you know does security he's doing mainly a director of security and enough for these different tours and this particular one you know he wasn't doing any martial arts I've just like doing his job and directing what was going on and then one of the artists was flying this guy in and paying him all this money to do this kung fu stuff hey you know he's being respectful he's just letting that like not my place to even in certain into that but like you know he's would always like the angle into getting an opportunity on the road cuz when you're traveling trying to train and try to do stuff is it's almost impossible it's really hard to do and so you know if there's any way he can work into at least getting to train with them it'd be great so you know whatever the opportunity presented itself he's like you know I I also you know try not do jujitsu would love to jump in with you guys at some point dish to get a workout in or something and the guy basically said look if I'm you know wasn't responding to him so he's like finally went look you know what we do is like you know university level the that jujitsu thing is like kindergarten so my buddy's like okay it's uh so he calls he calls hens Oh it says hens oh I'm on the East Coast I need a place to go train and this is what happened and hens was like what to bring them with a fucking kungfu motherfucker down of the Yemen it was so amazing that like so you know this guy is now he's kind of cornered he's an Android he's kind of basically challenged my friend and I and my friends try to be as respectful as possible she's going the guy just kept going and going about with you know uh the disrespect talk was that's how you know he sucks most likely mmm it was and there's a video online of the schooling and it was a video that's online is its after like it you know they started they did some stuff and it was over so fast that finally hands will kept going okay now you can't you can't hit him you can't you can't tackle them you can't use your arm like he kept like taking things away from my guy they like to make it so that it was a little Israel just destroying yeah and it's like just embarrassing so the guy wasn't been paying this guy there's money this whole time is looking at this going what the fuck have I been paying for nonsense yeah there's a lot of that out there we're dancing well for the longest time that was the majority of martial arts was fuckery you know I mean most of schools you would find on corners my friend my friend Eddie had a guy that he was taking kung-fu from and the guy went to China to learn secret techniques under this deadly master and he found the guy supposed to be in China he found his fucking car at the supermarket parking lot he found the guy in a suit like the fuck man I thought you were in China oh yeah yes I mean I'm on my way to trip's Chinatown I was going to Chinatown uh you know it was uh current it was a hustle for a long time all you had to do was pretend you just had to like throw some techniques that you learned from I mean you could watch a Jean Claude Van Damme movie and kind of get a good idea how he's moving his body and sort of recreate that and if you were really crazy next thing you know you can have a school where you're teaching your own style of self-defense that's completely ineffective I want to do when it's like a it's you know practical fighting where you're actually you know you're gonna be in a bar so he might as well be drunks we call just beer Songdo and you show up and you immediately found a six-pack and then we start training that's a good idea right we got to throw your chair away right now instead I think I don't you grab one okay the ones that don't get used as much don't squeak as much yeah I thought that this is back no but imagine if it was that would be that would be that one of the worst feelings ever if you've dedicated a massive amount of your life to some bullshit and then it's just exposed in front of you like that right that happens to a lot of martial artists man I've met a lot of people who you know whether it was Taekwondo or whatever traditional martial art that had a giant hole in it and they didn't even realize that well I was the same with my friend he was like he was a black belt and I think Taekwondo and he won't he rolled into would rego vajjis place in st. Louis and went okay you know whatever this is let me just show you he just had his ass handed to him like repeatedly anyone okay I'm sold yeah I was a black belt in Taekwondo before I ever did you did so and when I first did jujitsu there was this kid that I'll never forget this purple belt kid my age my size is nothing special about him and he used to just maul me every class he would maul me it was like I was a baby like I couldn't do anything to him I couldn't defend myself I'd be exhausted he just fucking strangling and after tap it was just so humiliating and humbling you know I remember thinking wow I was walking around not even knowing somebody my size could do that to Baker I have no idea really had no idea was to living in a completely delusional world of martial arts proudest well we have to remember that we always the reason that we're here at all is at some point during our human development we you know instinctively and just accidentally realized that we can't rely on our strength or speed we had to rely on our brain so because it you know we don't just run out and grab the line and rip its head off we the run from it and find a stick and sharpen it and you know go out in teams and you know take down the elephant with five guys you know so that you know so when you think of martial arts in that manner you start to realize how important the mental game is as opposed to just the physical game well especially in jujitsu it's one of the rare martial arts where technique is really the most important aspect of the practice and when you get a really big strong guy it's actually a disadvantage for a strong guy to learn jujitsu because the best technical guys are always small weaker guys because they have to be technical there's nothing naked muscle or force whereas the big guys they can get away with some sloppy shit because of the fact they're big and strong so they're really hindering themselves by using strength I mean that's there's no sport like that and no martial art even like that I mean technique is very important kickboxing but athleticism and speed is equally important you know if you're if you're very technical but slow it really won't work in jiu-jitsu these guys the saddest thing about rolling with someone like a Hickson or a Jean Jacques Machado it's like they don't even trying like it's not like they're straining and moving hardly too slowly oh my friend oh you're on your back again or you better protect this arm cuz this is the one I'm going in 9 8 7 you're like what's he gonna do if he does it and you go pixel would you that's a black belt to pick an arm and tell them I'm gonna get your right arm in an armbar and you're like there's no fucking way I'm just gonna chill - mother firearms over there how are you gonna get me in an armbar and all set he's over there and you're tapping out yeah it's I didn't know that there was something like that before and when you once you understand like how technical jujitsu is it really becomes so fascinating Josh Waitzkin is a famous chess player he was that movie searching for Bobby Fischer was based on him and he sort of got disillusioned with chess after I got bored with it and devoted the same energy to Jiu Jitsu and he's one of Marcelo Garcia's protegees now and he has I think it's called mmm GJ and Marcel Garcia jujitsu in action mgj and action calm and it's maybe mg JJ and it's the website he hasn't broken down the way you would break down chess like he breaks down moves and how it's different you know different transitions different moves so you can look at it much more maybe analytical and a calculated move move way you know that and then you would if you were server his name is Josh Waitzkin okay yeah there's a guy that the word of the works trains out of a hen's of a studio in New York anything his name is John John Danaher maybe yeah he's a beast and it's just like it's it's like mmm like the chest you watch his brain going okay this is this is this millimeter in this way he was a philosophy student he was a university student and he was bouncing if that's what he's doing for fun you know or to pay bills and along the way someone said hey she learned some jujitsu and he became completely obsessed sleeps on the mats I mean literally teaches all day I mean Danaher is a legend in jujitsu circles he's a suit it's what happens when a super intelligent guy gets physically absorbed in a sport yeah he's just he's he works with a lot of top guys like he's always in George st. Pierre's corner he's there's a lot of good guys that come out of his gym and there's guys who give good instruction and those guys who suck in the corner in the corner some guys are just you listen to them and I have to do everything I can and not criticize them what the fuck are you saying that guy this is nonsense like you know him you're better off saying nothing because you're you're putting in like an air of despair and idiocy into this into this cage they say such stupid shit but not Danaher man Danaher is like super precise you need to hold your left hand slightly higher your chin tucked shoulders up move to your right side if he's throwing the left first duck under then go for a single the single does not work you transition to a double have water three deep breath and you're like whoa this motherfucker just got schooled you know you hear him talking you know this guy knows exactly what I'm supposed to do if I could just listen to this guy I think I'm gonna be okay the crazy world the world of the intelligence and and risk and martial art and that's what it would you know people like for the wrong reasons associate martial arts and especially associated competition with meatheads assholes dummies but the most brilliant minds and some of the most interesting people that have ever met when martial arts practitioners because there's a certain amount of calculation you have to do while under extreme duress and pressure and there's a risk involved and the risk is like physical health and all those together create incredible ward when you're successful you know the reward is amazing but the downside is like mad for most people that the down is too low and they avoid it and that's the people that can can make their way through those waters though the strongest salmon to get up that waterfall to me some of the most interesting people that I've ever met yeah that would have to agree yeah that's what I got out of your article I was like this guy gets it you're seeing the the essence of what this is all about how long you been doing jiu-jitsu now I started in the mid to late 90s I got injured right around 2000 and I've only done it you know on and off now whenever I can when you're when you're doing your whines it must be like 16 hours a day my must be well I mean you know I'm pretty I'm pretty organized so I you know make sure that whatever I can whatever I can bring to the table as far as making things easier and smoother and not getting in my own way let's a lot of logistics and understanding like if I do this I'm gonna have to undo this in five moves so I always like I've laid things out in a manner that you know I'm in the winery around 6:00 a.m. 6:30 but I'm wrapping it up around you know eight o'clock so you're a black belt in winemaking suede trunks I'm no black building logistics black belt logistics yeah just understanding the process and not getting in my own way and then when you go from that mode into musician mode do you just do it on based on your schedule like whenever your time becomes free you go okay you know starting in and it's October well there's a little bit more emotion a little bit more randomness with that with that you know you kind of have to kind of ride those waves a little bit but in a way when you have enough time under your belt you can kind of force the situation you can you know a lot of times I just get in my my truck when I got a decent stereo in the truck and I got the tracks and I just that way nobody can mess with me I can't get a phone call nobody's knocking on the door I just go park somewhere and turn the music up with a notepad and start writing because nobody now you're in your world if you might um in my house you know the phone's gonna ring I'm gonna check my email I'm gonna write ask a question or you know mails in you know oh it's that Super Troopers on HBO yeah so much for writing yeah that's why I write when everyone's asleep I don't I don't even start until 11 p.m. 12 p.m. everyone in my house has to be asleep I like it when people around me are sleep - I'd like to think the neighbours are sleep I think that I'm not picking up any weird vibes from anybody everybody's in Z zone right now do you when you when you write do you have like specific times we set aside time to read you just try to do it whenever their creative whim the whim you know just kind of do it you know it'll be like focused periods of time like I'm gonna this week is gonna be dedicated to any and same thing with training if I'm gonna train or if I'm going to be doing jiu-jitsu I'm gonna do any of that stuff I will hire somebody to be there mm-hmm because now I have to do it right so if I have friends over you know musician friends they've flown out we're gonna write this week okay I'm in my truck I'm over here I'm gonna come in and we're gonna track some stuff that didn't work back to the truck why Arizona that's where I live just always lived there I moved there in 95 really yeah why 95 uh I hate LA hate your town it's not mine but I don't like it either I enjoyed to escape I left I moved here in basically December of 89 so you know basically 1990 January and it just it only took a little bit of time I mean I got don't get me wrong I got a lot out of this town things you know odd things happen for me um you're just kind of set the ball in motion I mean there's you know I was doing a lot of things with my life before I moved to LA and there's a lot of achievements and things that I did I'd kind of done for myself and but then it wasn't till I was actually an ally in a band where somebody was profiting on my decision making that you actually heard about me so you know there's a lot of things that I was kind of doing before I got here and then I bailed into the band thing and that kind of got popular and that was why I actually stuck here for as long as I did because I just within like a couple years I was like this is not for me I don't I need to be in a small town when it got to a certain point will you of you the fame of tool you could pretty much have done whatever you wanted to anyway because you're mostly just touring and you just had to be around the people when you were rehearsing and preparing right kind of yeah a little more hands-on than that but yeah for the most part that was that was the case but you know and then you know in the from 95 to 2000 I kind of bounced back and forth a little bit from Arizona to here just because of the work you know you have to when you're recording and doing stuff you have to kind of be there for any right you're on the road for pretty much and that in in those days it was easily six months out of the area traveling but of course you're younger then you can handle it now the the area you're out is like that's like a haunted Wild West Town right it's an old mine it's an old copper mining town it's like a billion-dollar copper mine it had this huge ore body underneath this side of this hill the billion dollars worth of copper and that was like you know 1920's 1930's billions so it was a huge or body like big enough to put a cathedral in the hole in the ground that they took all the copper up and did you just pick this area because it just seemed like an interesting yeah yeah you know like the vibe of it no I am at I had a dream I was supposed to be out of fucking LA Yiddish yeah and I just kept having this recurring dream and it's like a like an you know it was a very specific images in place and I think you know for some reason I thought it was Arizona and I remember talking to Hicks about it like one I think I think I'm supposed to be in Arizona and I mentioned it to Tim Alexander and you know I said I been to Phoenix I'm not I'm not having it um and I described the dream and Tim what oh I know what that is ci cuz he's from he's from Arizona and so he went okay oh no I have to take you someplace we drove up there and like rolling into that Valley just going holy shit this is the place Wow and then I got up to the town it's like no shit do you interact with the town's folks cuz to me that's the hardest thing about moving anywhere to got to find cool people you know that I am the absolute troublemaker and that doesn't you know they you know it's a was an old mining town it kind of that they kind of turned a lot of that went away is like twenty thousand people in this town at one point without working the mine like in the clarkdale area in a cottonwood area and draw Mary work in this mind you know when a pro I want to dry it up and there was the depression in the World War one and doing all that kind of stuff it kind of shut down it dropped down to like you know thirty people in the small town whoa and then of course you know the seven sixty seventy so the draft dodgers and the people that just wanted to do what they wanted to do moved into this basically in abandoned town are you anywhere near Bisbee no I'm sure where Bisbee is just not I think it's more on the edge of the state somewhere so another weird mom at a very similar very similar scenario so you know the trust fund baby is in the hippies moved in and kind of took over the town and there for them you know for the most part the people that moved into the town are not the kind of people that built the town not the kind of visionaries that came into it I think there's copper under this thing and then did all this stuff I'm more like those people and so I'm kind of the enemy because I do stuff alright you know heaven forbid so how you a troublemaker in the town though these days I don't want don't you know they fear change and you know we came here to retire and and not do anything well you make too much noise you're too strange I just stuff I'm just doing stuff for bringing by you know by discovering the terroir they're making wine there I'm bringing people to town you're what you're bringing people we want to make people in town so your house they're gonna pay for your pipes and your electric and knock how you're gonna make your streets be safe it's a municipality not a camping ground you need you need you need funding you need tax dollars to fix your thing you know the best way to really fix your town is if you have something that's unique to your town and export if you will I found it how dare I so you're doing well for the town and they just don't like anything moving or anyone there's a handful of people there like the hand does a handful of people that are basically they're their mo is it just lie in the street and if you can move them okay then you can kind of go down the street but if you can't move them you give up they win and you just kind of sail tail between your legs you leave I don't I know how to move stuff that's my problem with LA is that la is where my friends are and if I had to move to another place I'd have to deal with a bunch of fucking people and all their nonsense and you know unless you bring everybody with you which is also start a compacted yeah get all crash on it do you have friends Alan Jerome yeah absolutely did you have them already good you know you made a lot of friends or some really really awesome artists in that town like really good people and they all mean well but don't get me wrong all of every single person in the town means well and they're all good people but you know it's just personalities in small-town politics but still better than the insane buzz of this hive this fall yeah 30 million play high I much prefer the conflict wood that we have with our with our people and Jerome over whatever the hell was that went over there on the five and the third one 34 today hey we just decided to shut this ramp down well if you ever flown in to LAX and you see the 405 and you see literally seven eight nine ten miles of stopped cars and you crawl into your overhead bin and hope that they just let you go back to Tokyo it's like what the fuck is that this is craziness this is just we're just banking on nothing going wrong ever in a place where the earth moves yeah yet here I am like an idiot I'm trying to get out I'm working on it right now and I'm working on my next move I tried any minute now I tried Colorado for a little bit it's a long story but my dog got eaten by a mountain lion I came back mm yeah Colorado is a weird one like you go to Denver and there's that area where almost everybody's missing an eye and arm right wheel chair or a walker it's a clear like like a Twin Peaks but like on steroids area and you kind of go we have would have contests like okay we're here for 24 hours whoever seat can count the most wheelchairs and and you know three points for a wheelchair one point for like a missing arm people coming back to like you know the sound shit going I got 40 points really whatever you have Denver's it's right on that sixteenth Street Promenade area right there under sin in the center town there it's insane it's your you therefore if you're there for longer than twelve hours start going what's going on some kind of is there like a you know like testing out these things are they are these people actually in them I've never noticed I I pick Denver because it's got a strong medical marijuana community so once you get used to the way they have it set up in LA is you can't deal with the nonsense of dealing with drug dealers just become so stupid but Denver is set up pretty much exactly like LA is Denver and Boulder there's places everywhere they have a think they call it broad stir damn and they have one area where it's I think it's Broadway they're with us like you know bakery shops and you know the whole deal it's got a good they have like a sensible liberal vibe you know Denver and boulders a little bit more radical but Denver has like a sensible open minded vibe like they support guns they support hunting they support outdoors activities but they're also in favor of gay marriage and they're also in favor of not discriminating and you know so it's it's a very interest so that's why I picked it but Arizona always scared me then it's it's definitely a scary place when in terms of all those things you just mentioned but I think it's I think all that stuff's kind of changing there because you can't have something that's so far one way and not have a push back yeah and have a and have a community that's just the complete polar opposite and it's absolutely there so eventually it will just kind of come around the idea of living in cities I think is one day not going to be necessary anymore I think we needed it because everybody had to be on top everybody cuz that's where you worked and you know in order to communicate with everybody but now because the internet I think there's a lot of people's jobs that don't have to be in this swarm yeah I mean there's a lot of there's definitely a lot of just change in general happening with just the way we think about stuff and I don't know you but I've had like a had a week there about two months ago or it's just everything just seemed like the gyroscopes were off I couldn't couldn't get anything right it was like I'd forgotten how to do the most simple things you know like you know not that's the perfect example I get a walk outside to change a tire and I've got like a carrot and a know a candle like okay what I think it was a cycle like a vibe but I think I think it's I still kind of feel a little bit but I was and I was I kind of called a friend who she's she's as crazy as I am early she's like she does a complete Kundalini Yoga unless she wakes up at 4 a.m. and to watch the Sun rise and do the Breath of Fire and so she's you know either she's a complete kook and I'm and I drink the kool-aid or or we're onto something here but you know she she said just beautiful I should ask that because that's kind of over what she's seeing in her world how everything's done you know the gyroscopes are just kind of off and and the biggest I think the biggest thing she was suggesting I've done some reading on it as well like it's just more a matter of paying attention um not letting it get to you not being my called you know 20 Robbins get all you know positive greeny guy but you know just like know that it's all going to work out and don't let the teddy shit get you down don't let the the dark stuff sink in because it's almost like you're in a record groove you're in the light groove and if you let if you flop over to the dark groove you kind of get stuck on that groove and it's kind of a downward spiral so one thing that I found its most difficult to deal with when you deal with a large city or a large population is you are you're constantly getting other people's energy in there sometimes hard to dictate your own path mhm and that's what she was saying she said in a way you have to kind of just not hang out out of fear just kind of settle in calmly and just like we're talking about with the jujitsu the guy is big and he's strong and he's got technique but you just had to take a deep breath and and some level know that one way or another it's all gonna work out that's Kundalini Yoga people are fascinating Oh buddy mine has a friend who does the same thing every morning she does the Breath of Fire and she claims to achieve psychedelic states she says that because of all her years of practice she it's just like is if she's taking heavy she goes to other worlds and communicates with entities and you know and has which he describes his indescribable experiences she said if I told you what I could do just with my own breath exercises and Kundalini Yoga you wouldn't believe me right and you know most of my friends that are into that stuff and then that deep they don't talk about it just because it's it's such an individual experience and and I had another friend who a similar a similar path and you know she kind of grew up in the in the sixty was in everybody's doing will do an acid and stuff and she had mentioned that you know it was kind of it was cool for the the JumpStart for people to kind of get into that consciousness and be thinking on that level but at the same time they didn't really do the work to get there so they really didn't understand what it was they were experiencing so in a way she called it spiritual theft you got like an all said you're just right in the middle of this thing but you don't really have any business being there right can't really process what it is that you're experiencing recreational mushroom trips yeah and so yeah that's so you're like here you are and then you know for most people I just that's fun lights out for them they're gonna be a little Mars the rest of their lives but I kind of agree with that I think that some of the work taking that time and and really taking your time getting to those states or in just in your life in general and doing anything and but it's it's really difficult for most people these days because they want what they want when they want it because they're still used to getting whatever the fuck it is they want when they want it do they don't get it they lose their shit yeah which is exactly opposite of the psychedelic experience what it would teach you I think the the approach is so important and doing the work and saying doing the work is so important because you're treating whatever this experience is is going to be with a deep amount of respect and unless you do that you know I don't think you're really going to get the most out of it I mean if you just go into it and try to just let it cure you or let it figure you out or let it you're just going to be too blown away with the whole thing to really absorb any of it right doing the work and like one of the things that I really appreciated about the people that really get into Kundalini Yoga is they all seem legit I haven't met anybody who claims the psychedelic states who who doesn't really seem like a humble person that really seemed like there's never any weird ego shit or you know weird a trace of bullshit it seems like this this is just what they do and they'll talk to you about it and they'll describe it to you but they say it's not about the it's not about the psychedelic state of it it's all about just like sort of a you know it's about knowing that it's going to go knowing that it's all going to work out yeah you know and we might not even be included in this form that we're in and how it's gonna work out and if you can let go of the fear of worrying about whether that's going to happen or not so you can just let go without fear and just you know let go just appreciate what is appreciate what is don't worry about what can what would what may appreciate what is and know that even if it doesn't work out it's going to work out because it's it's all works out even if it doesn't work out exactly it's too hard for us to wrap our heads around how big the whole picture is you know when you realize that you know what is the the Woodstock song we are Stardust we are golden we are billion year old carbon we really are fucking Johnny Mitchell yeah Joni Mitchell and who was a crosby stills a dick on the cover it is that's her song yeah brilliant song and it's so true this is the thing that people understand human being is actually made because the star burns out explodes and that it has to happen if it doesn't happen you don't make those materials and human life carbon-based life forms don't know don't exist so even if it doesn't work out it works out doesn't you know you can understand in our in the state that we're in and you know this this real tactical tactical tactile existence we live you know you get caught up with the game you know you kind of get into the fear yeah and that's part of it too brazen so it's okay you know but the every now and they get kind of wrapped up in and I remember like last week the same guide the jujitsu guy that I was telling about Todd he he's he just out of the blue texted me like so man how's it going like it's almost like intuition like how's it going like funny you should ask there's just been a shit storm the whole week he goes oh well let me just give you this and he sent me I hope I brought it you sent this thing I ended up forwarding it to a bunch of people because I knew a bunch of other people were going through some weird shit and may I sure please so live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart trouble no one about their religion respect others in their view and demand that they respect yours love your life protect your life beautify all things in your life seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over to the Great Divide always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting up or passing a friend even a stranger when in our lonely place show respect to all people and grovel to none when you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living if you see no reason for giving thanks the fault lies only in yourself abuse no one and no thing for abuse turns the Wise Ones into fools and robs the spirit of its vision when it comes your time to die beam out like those whose hearts are filled with fear and death so that their time comes they weep they pray for more little time and live their lives again over and over in a different way instead sing your death song and die like a hero going home that's fucking beautiful it's unlike so of course all my friends are like you know who wrote that so I had to go back to him ago where'd you get that he goes a homeless dude gave it to me wow it's Jesus like please don't say it's l ron hubbard we gotta be my luck like oh you know adolf hitler you know well it sounds like i believe i - it's actually found it online and it's chief de Kamp's a Crouching Tiger from the from the Shawnee nation whoa he died in 1813 Wow Wow that makes it even more cool cuz I thought it was some new-age douchebag totally delivered some stuff off the internet and pieced it together no that's perfect Wow I agree with everything he said except for making fun of religion you go girl other than that it's copy I think religion has to be made fun of because if you look if you can't make fun of things that are ridiculous you're missing out a big part of what's fun about this life and religions ridiculous respect it but made fun of it right yeah yeah other than that I'm down I'm down with the Shawnee warriors yeah that was a great that he you know he says some homeless dude while we lost we lost such a massive chunk of what those people had learned about living like this life of nomadic life of following animals and you know following following herds of buffalo around and and learning about the connection between I mean you got to think about the the deep respect Native Americans had for the animals that they killed and you know it's it's such an interesting way of life they kept up for so long while most of the Western world had already moved on to you know riding horses and kingdoms and houses and agriculture and these people were just traveling around and living off the land so it's so much wisdom we could have learned from those people and was wiped out so it's so weird time to mean you think about that just that was just a couple of hundred years ago a blip in human civilization and there was these nomadic people you know living in this area I remember watching I went to movies with my son as a few years ago and was that Black Stallion movie it's you know some animation and it was pretty I'm just kind of sitting in the theater just kind of it kind of dawned on me and I'm kinky like the the curmudgeon with his son like you know my kid just going can you just enjoy the movie please but I'm looking at it going this whole movie is based on this exhilarating feeling of like this black horse and this guy kind of stopping the white man from moving west it's like but I'm watching the fucking movie in Los Angeles it work and my son's just like will you let it go and just enjoy the stupid movie and get me more popcorn please that's yeah it's like you root against us I mean that's what avatar is yeah I mean avatars you don't think they're coming back on yeah that was the first shot obtained iam that worth billions of dollars I think obtained iam air we're coming back without obtained I mean that was the Santa Maria right Avatar Shep there was the beginning of the first wave of the fuckers yeah I try the other stuff woody what is your uh this is the shinola I'm really a red wine guy yeah but I love that Rosa it's delicious this is a this is a special drop um we had we got hit with frost really hard in early 2011 so we didn't have a lot of Arizona fruit in our vineyards to work with so I panicked and I is this one yours yeah and I sourced some fruit from right over the border from our our vineyards right down on the border on the ten as you're heading toward New Mexico it's in Wilcox in that area so right over that border like another hour or so just past Wilcox is a New Mexico vineyard and this guy's out there grape grower he's got all these fantastic Italian varietals growing there and they're you know there's a historic it's a pretty old vineyard there so I picked these all these grapes up for not much and I did this blend at Sangiovese Dolcetto Rafal Co and primitivo sort of straight-up Italian blend it's delicious from New Mexico grapes and uh it's what do you call it shinola come on is that your own name yeah know what I mean you know it's a is that a type of wine an actual type of law it's it's a reference to the jerk the shit from shinola yeah okay yeah Wow recognized um yeah New Mexico is a fascinating area you know I think that's where val kilmer went and grew his head that's where I was watching magical space so I was watching the ghosts in the darkness the other day and I was like there's a funny fucking internet meme where it's Val Kilmer at his most bloated and it says remember when I was Batman lol Val Kilmer move - no - New Mexico and just bought a ranch and just grew his head yes I don't what the fuck happened but in this ghost in a darkness I'm like Jesus Christ I was a handsome man you know I was stunning he said but some just decided yeah I like pills better and just moved him in the Mexican did that movie a couple years ago with Robert Downey jr. yeah whether was that crazy movie he's shrunk a little yeah he's trying to got it under control yeah yeah it seems like you realized it's actually a fun am i doing I kind of liked it yeah was a fun movie I don't remember what it was though when the hell was it called some sort of a it involved letters yeah and arrange the in a certain order and I can't remember any of them yeah they all get blurry after a while um you became buddies with one of my biggest influences and one of my biggest idols is Hicks how did you how'd you meet him how'd that go down uh well you know as you do you kind of just somebody can hand you a cassette back in the day it gets a cassette it's a it's a tape recording and it goes around and around um uh you know right around the same time as eight tracks but he got the cassette when is his two first releases and on the on the road just like you know absorbing all this stuff and eventually we when we put out another record we basically thanked him on it and sent him a copy of the record and he reached out and then we just kind of hit it off and we had out all these plans this is back you know earlier earlier tool day so um you know we had all these plans that we wanted to kind of do something with him and we were you know we were still kind of a young bands this is like 93 94 and we were going to do a tour together and then he got sick lookin I'll you know plans right out the window kind of suckers right right when the time was we were small enough to where we could still we could actually do a comedy tour you know with a comedian and a rock band uh as soon as it was you know a year later that was things kind of blew up a little bit and it would have been yeah I mean for example we played several shows and in the California area where Tenacious D opened for us but we were big enough band were people in the auditors like get this shit off the stage like throwing shit at them when we had like we've had like David Cross and Greg Behrendt do stuff in front of our a show to open the thing is just getting pelted with stuff now you know that wouldn't happen now because they know who they are but it was so happy it was tenacious it was so good yeah I know people are brutal man yeah um
