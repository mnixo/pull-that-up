and we're live what's going on brother how are you I'm awesome man it's good to be here good to have you here man thank you I've never had a guy coming wear his own hat and his own t-shirt you're number one you're the first I'm I'm surprised by that given how many podcasts you've done but that's how I roll I don't know if anybody's ever come in wearing their own shirt Jamie any thoughts someone has to have I just can't recall it yeah no definitely no one is worn their own hat in their own shirt oh yeah maybe Edie's worn his own shirt but that's a tent plant shirt that doesn't totally count it's a shirt with my face on it too so that's a triple whammy all right maybe I don't know I don't think so maybe anyway what's going on man how long you here for I'm all good man I'm in LA for two weeks it's my very first time here so I just got here two days ago so just let me so Canada what's the mindfuck like it's crazy huh it's weird man I feel like I was driving her I was driving around in an uber and it feels like GTA I think more like GTA feels like LA cuz that's what it's based on but uh it was just kind of trippy and there's levels to the game right the the top level of the game is probably either like Singapore Beijing or Mexico City in terms of Mexico City is the only thing that I've ever seen that's more chaotic than LA but la is it's it's right up there yeah I think Lagos is more chaotic Lagos Lagos Nigeria I've never been okay that's more chaos yeah in Cairo I think they're definitely more chaotic jairo Egypt really yeah I found the more chaotic well Cairo man I would love to go to Cairo but I just I am nervous about traveling to Egypt I keep hearing but I keep hearing two stories from people that go all the time like Egyptologists it's amazing amazing don't worry about it the worst thing you have to deal with this constant beggars and then hear from other people fuck that don't go there it's catchy yeah I haven't even been for a long time when I went it was when I was a kid oh yeah but Lagos I've been to more recently and it's certainly more hectic and chaotic and I think you're here it's just it's just interesting it's very very very spread out and just seeing yeah it's people driving everywhere and much public transport and all that even compared to other cities in in the u.s. it just seems like a totally different vibe but I like it yeah there's just too many people stuffed into one area and everyone's driving or they're in an uber so someone else is driving them so yeah just constant driving yeah but I'm happy to be here man a little bit surreal but it's cool yeah I'm sure right so what are you doing on here I'm doing I'm doing this I was on the Reuben report yesterday actually I've got got a whole bunch of guys that conservative guy that conservative guy that got a on blazed TV yeah story they wrote about him he responded he's like I'm Pro gay marriage Pro weed legalization Pro prison reform Pro immigration pro all these different things and yet people are calling them conservative well you know we live in a times where everyone's saying is right-wing so so it let it be so high don't know well if you're not as progressive as humanly possible you're alright well yeah exactly pretty much I've seen all sorts of titles levied on to everybody including including yourself so yeah for people don't know zoobi won the World Championships and women's powerlifting you identified as a woman for a brief period of time yeah nine second left all you have to do yeah I mean this is the world we live in dude that that thing blew the internet off but it's crazy I'm saying how far it went mad yeah I know I saw that people there it is yeah yes I identify as a woman whilst lifting the weight don't be a bigot you know I think I think when you first talked about that I had like 40,000 followers it's now well over 100 and 115 and when I posted it I had 15,000 followers so I've gained a hundred and I've gained like yeah like 105 felt one hundred five thousand followers it worked as video congratulations yeah thanks man really does highlight how preposterous these new world rules that we have and regarding gender but to their credit the u.s. powerlifting Federation I believe that's the name of the organization they just banned transgender women from competing okay they just said out rap just flat there's enough enough of that I think if you want to compete I don't think this anything wrong with transgender women competing but I think they should compete against transgender women just like how we have men compete against men and we have women compete against women let's have transgender women compete against transgender women let's not deny science and biology yes to make people feel better and just to support some strange progressive ideology yeah I think if they if the goal is that's why I think the goal is more about it's more ideologically driven then I think it is actual inclusion driven because if it's just about inclusion then yeah you can either just have an open category like most men's categories already are they're not actually restricted to men it's just you know the best of the best so anyone can do this so either that or if there are enough athletes in whatever the given sport or competition is then yeah you can just have a different a different category and that way everyone can be included without stepping on the feet of half the population that's a bold move by the men so anybody can be in here that's how it is in pool you know men can't compete in the women's division of pool but women can compete in the men's division yeah it's the same in most sports most people aren't aware that most people think that they're they have specific restrictions saying only men can do them but that's actually quite rare well there's a lot of successful female to male athletes working females transition to males and dominate male sports okay what is this what is going on well have you seen this there's a soccer player's wants to be an NFL as a kicker because she there's a video of her doing a place kick of a 55 yard or yard field goal recently that's incredible that's really far no one coming out or anything was just like in practice but she nailed it which is pretty far yes well can you tackle kickers they can get hit yeah they're not during the actual play of the kick they're not supposed to be touched but for sure they're in the play of the field so mmm well that's fucked up that's not good that's where the problem is Carla love yeah yeah but stop yeah it's a bad idea oh oh by the way I brought a couple things for you man yeah so that's is it a zubi t-shirt so my latest album that is zubi t-shirt that one actually glows in the dark in the dark if it has the back hopefully it'll does it kill Turtles not that aggressively and that's uh my a new fitness book there's no you have a boy you are it you already shit it is is it basically workout routines and yeah it's just giving people what they need to know about a nutrition training mindset motivation I just wanted to keep it brief and concise all the stuff that I think is most important that people need to know whether they're beginners or intermediates oh this is a good sized book to read yeah I put it out first as an e-book but then um a lot of people ask me to do a physical copy so oh that's cool did those just before leaving the UK and they've essentially sold out already nice congratulations on that all you lazy fucks get out there this is a good book for you because it's short you don't have to look people see a fat book too much work but this is not even a hundred pages yes six what is it ninety three page 93 boom so there you go there we go strong you know quick it all benefit what is your background athletically athletically um I used to actually play rugby yeah so I don't know how much you know about my background so I was born in the UK I grew up in Saudi Arabia so when I lived yeah when I lived in Saudi I used to play baseball and football or what you guys would call soccer and those were my sort of main sports I also did swimming and a bunch of other things and then I went to the UK for boarding school actually when I was eleven years old and there's no there's no baseball there so I yeah rugby became my main sport I started playing rugby when I was 11 years old and I played that all the way through the university and I got into just lifting weights and stuff when I was in my mid-teens I have a friend who's British and he says that that is way more common in in Europe and the UK sending kids off to boarding school yeah I do I do think so I mean with me it was largely because I was in the American school system in Saudi Arabia so after fifth grade because there's a little bit of a transition between the two systems there they're quite different so it was thought that if I'd stayed all the way up until ninth grade then it would be a little bit difficult for me to transition into the British school system and university system so my parents decided when I was 11 same with my my older siblings like we all went to boarding school when we were pretty young so yeah Kim came back over to the UK and was kind of back and forth between the two countries for several years and yeah did things that way but um well you was you're down to militarism no my dad's actually a medical doctor oh yeah he's a medical doctor but um he works for own a big oil company out in Saudi so we lived there for a couple of you know two decades pretty mom was that like I enjoyed growing up in Saudi man really yeah yeah I actually really liked it it's weird it reminds me of La Vie I'm being serious yes if there are then you don't really don't really see them now but just I think the heat and the way the way the roads are the way it looks actually yeah because if you live like where I lived was sort of an expat community basically so we live kind of in a compound so where I lived it was a little bit of a little bit of a bubble and then outside of that you kind of got what what I'd call the real the real Saudi so if you go out into the city or you want to go shopping or something like that then you're out there in the real city so it's very very different it's interesting with me because my family backgrounds originally from Nigeria but then I was born in England I live in England now but I lived in Saudi Arabia for 19 years or so so I've kind of had exposure a lot to three different three very different cultures and ways of doing things and even laws and just the way society is structured and stuff like that so I think it's given me a pretty interesting and unique perspective on quite a lot of things yeah what a broad range of culture that you've been exposed to that's that's pretty fucking cool yeah Nigeria is a strange spot because I've never I've never been but when you look at the numbers of successful immigrants like businessmen and people that have come over from Nigeria and how industrious they are and then you look at how many successful Nigerian scammers there are it's a wise very clever place you got the email from the prince - huh I didn't get it I have but the one I was thinking about was Jaime was telling me a story yesterday about it who would he sell they sold a non-existent Bank Airport Airport the other Bank - that's right he sold a non-existent Airport to a better there's been several stories over the last couple of weeks about Nigerian scammers making big scores yeah there's one that I think closed down a Brazilian bank it took so much of their money but the bank had to show the bank had to shut down what is it about Nigeria why are they so good at that a lot a lot of smart and enterprising people and I think if that's channeled in the right way then that's a very good thing well I think some people obviously there's the resources are very limited so they're they're deciding to just go dark and scam people but as a person who hasn't been a victim of this it's quite amusing yeah if you see if you see some of the stuff that that can get pulled off it's uh it's quite impressive is it is very much like men it's actually 330 equivalent to American dollars 3 on 30 million it happened in the 90s though I guess the story's just now going around okay the reason what happened in the 90s which is what this says con man once sold an airport that didn't exist for 330 million now for stop and think about that 330 million in the 90s is probably like 600 million today or something fuckin bananas yeah that's larious yeah listen there's some crazy stuff that Nigerian fraudster and con artist Emmanuel howdy spell how do you pronounce his last name n Wude Moody maybe moody no say it again moody I guess something like that what are you you starting with a M how do you say uh moody with an N but Emanuel but how are you doing it it's it's an N but it's the pronunciation is a little bit different say it again Moody well it sounds to me what you say moody no it's it's an N go I'm cause we are weirdly enough that guy's name is two letters off my actual first name really yeah my until my first real first name is in zoo bay well which is spelled n z ube so that's actually two letters different so you just said zoo B would be a little bit more yeah he's just easy just easier it's cool name to no one no one has that yeah thank you I've never heard of so he pulled off the third-largest con in history by selling a non-existent airport to Brazilian bank for 250 million u.s. dollars before Nigerian internet scams became synonymous with your original early 2000s email account mood day to do it yeah close enough thank you successfully convinced an unassuming bank manager by the name of Nelson Sakaguchi that he was selling a yet-to-be-built airport for a price of 330 million dollars as the former director of the Union Bank of Nigeria himself moody was privy to confidential information that was crucial to him pulling off his long con also he knew shit about banking mmm using the information he imper then impersonated the governor of Central Bank of Nigeria at the time Paul okay here's another one Paul Oguma Oguma Oguma Okuma so you wouldn't go womb ah it's a goo MA aguma Oguma and connected with sakaguchi we need steve aoki comeback name to inform him of a mouth-watering deal Nigeria's plan to build a brand-new airport in another one Abuja Abuja Oh Cass the capital to juice it up a bit for poor sakaguchi moody promised the head of the Brazilian of the Brazilian bank a commission fee to the tune of 10 million US dollars if the deal was approved to get it over the line Sakaguchi paid 191 million in cash as you do and the remainder in the form of outstanding interest awaited patiently for the construction of said airport well Wow that's the kind of thing you can only pull off once huh yeah if you get that guy again I saw a guy that got scammed and there was a documentary about it was it was a television show rather it was really sad because he was a dude who was an older gentleman looked like he was in his 60s and he was convinced that there was this woman who was you know his love and she lived in Europe and he travelled there and he was sending her money and the whole deal and he traveled there twice to meet her and both times she couldn't see him both times well but he still believed and his daughter was like I don't know what the fuck to do this guy really believes and you could see had this lost look in his eye when he really believed that there was a woman over there that was corresponding with him back and forth and he was sending her money sent her a lot of money yeah I think it was more than a hundred thousand dollars where I remember correctly and he really believed that she was gonna be there for him and then when you went over there something came up and I couldn't meet them and yeah it's weird with stuff like this I always feel like in in some way you kind of feel sad for the person but in another kind of like what what were you thinking how do you bounce back from that like people hit some lows yeah people hit some lows in life how do you bounce back from thinking that there's a girl in Europe that's gonna be your love and sending her a hundred thousand dollars and traveling over there twice mmm and getting duped both times and then how do you bounce back from that and the first thing you should do is not tell anybody like take take the El without just in quiet justice just take it take it quietly and privately and don't uh don't tell people his daughter knew about it okay so it was like and then the camera crew I mean this motherfucker brought Cameron home I don't know why I think the show I very vaguely remember this and I think it was about ten years ago I think the show was all about people that were getting scammed okay it was about why people get scammed and what you know what is it that makes people believe ridiculous things yeah but when it comes to romance and money those are the two where people get greedy yeah I was literally gonna say it's greed it's greed because only greedy people can fall for some of those things I mean you see some of those scams and it'll come through saying okay I've just inherited 30 million dollars and I need somebody in the US with a US bank account to you help me out with this and I'll give you a 10% cut and you know that should raise a lot of red flags for anybody who's kind of thinking with that with a head on straight that's true but if you pay attention to televangelists do you have those in the UK not like the ones in the u.s. in the US it's another level yeah yes it's another level man everything's another level over here yeah everything's bigger yeah including I mean you get those megachurches and I don't there's probably one or two mega churches out there in the UK or in Europe in general but not one or two that's it I don't know I'm not even aware of any I'm kind of hedging my bets saying that's probably a couple but I'm not aware of any nominees mega churches do you think we have in America how many do you think we just have in Texas yeah Texas might have a million of them because I mean the guys who run those things they're like I mean Dave themselves yeah though themselves are celebrities right yeah there's at least 10 because it says here's an article about the ten largest so in Texas yeah in just in Texas Wow yeah those things Holstein guy he's a fucking baller and a half he's got private jets and mansions and he he bought a stadium he bought a sports stadium and converted it into his gigantic metric parently a megachurch is defined as a church with over 2,000 members over 2,000 and there's a parent 10% and at least 200 Texas yeah and everyone's given 10% or at least most of them are given 10% right tithing correctly what is the how many do you think there are nationwide let's say you guess how many mega mega churches are there in America so do we know how many there are in Texas that's just 10 biggest in Texas at least 200 in Texas 200 and 200 in Texas 200 people ripping people off 200 if there's 200 in Texas wow I must say 3,000 nationwide I was gonna say you're gonna say 3,000 3,000 mega churches nationwide yeah I'd approximate around that man I'd approximate around that what do you think Jamie you got your hand on Google though don't be cheating no too late I'm already on yeah cuz I'd imagine some states don't have any what did you think it was gonna be Jamie a couple hundred five hundred but this is it love I don't know I didn't think there's that many that's somewhere in the range of well so since it's two thousand that seems low because like I went to Catholic Church and there two more 2000 people some of those churches right but they're saying mega churches right yeah that's a thousand members are in the church uh well I mean maybe they just think two thousand scammers but it says there's thirteen hundred such Protestant churches but then it goes into like there's three thousand individual Catholic parishes that have more than two thousand people so hmm it gets to where that's what's in it I think several thousand like the big building I think there are large churches that are legitimate yeah like they're really following the Christian doctrine and they're really holding real services and they're really wanting good for people and then there's those dudes that have the super expensive tailored suits and drive it around and rolls from prosperity gospel they call prosperity gospel if you if you give then you'll get see what I have you will get what I have yes you bring me your money yeah it's um I've got the flying oh wow Mississippi pastor dubbed the flying pastor glides into Christmas service he's gliding in with an angel outfit on please rewind nothing along he's getting outfit on he's flying from the sky oh my god that's a that's a good move okay because now everybody knows about this move I was bringing chicks is that Beyonce spinning around yeah you know pink had one of them goddamn things no she didn't she was doing aerial those milkfish fell oh really walked herself up really bad like she had like internal bleeding and fluid in her lungs yeah it was bad well ya know these these megachurches thing like I think you know a church like you said it with a congregation of over two thousand people if they're sticking to the script and doing what they're meant to be doing and not trying to yeah at least their least their congregation and absolutely nothing wrong with that it's um the ones who use their position of power and their cult of personality to then just and rich themselves at the expense of their congregation those are the people I think God's going to be having a serious word with God's gonna be very mad I don't think it's interesting that they like the Nigerian scammers they're just playing off of weak Minds they've just tapped into this group of humans that's gullible and believes nonsense and they know how to they know how to pull those strings yeah I think it's like I say when I say I think God is gonna be having a word with those people I mean that I mean that very seriously because I think it's you know it's one thing ripping people off or doing some kind of scam or deception or something it's another one using the power of religion to do so where you know that this is what these people believe and you're in this position of power and you're now just using that authority to you know buy yourself a new new Bentleys and I mean wasn't there one where um what's that guy's name is it creflo dollar yeah well he think he had um I think he had a g4 yeah he own yeah he won yeah and he he he did basically like a crowdfunding appeal to his congregation yeah saying that his pride his current private jet is the old model and he needs the new model and he crowdfunded I think to get the G but I saw this thing I was just like oh my gosh you shameless you famous like I bet Taylor Swift could crowd fund a private jet it's ridiculous as it sounds probably if you just were shameless yeah if you just like I don't give a fuck I need a private jet I want y'all to buy it for me here's the link I think that's shameless but to say you're gonna do this and you're gonna go to heaven because you did this that's it well his whole thing's the prosperity gospel that so I'm I'm sure there was something in there you know be generous now and you know you'll be rewarded later clear this creflo dollar would get seventy million dollar Gulfstream g650 yeah that's not right man oh so so somehow or another he crowdfunded seventy million dollars is that real did you really get that much money that is a lot of money that's jet why do they cost so much they're made out of metal well they made out what's going on in there that's so much money how is that seventy million dollars like if that was a car right a same shape you'd be like well it's nice car in the air it does fly get it fucking air I understand but how much different is it it's a lot that goes it safely goes in there right but but how much different is if a still did very fast right it's definitely different but how much different because if a car was that big if a car was that big it was a dopest car ever like a Bentley maiya bus let's just say it was a million dollars if they like right I think the new Bugatti is like twelve million dollars something like yeah but that's a different kind of animal right because that first of all that shouldn't be twelve million dollars they're fucking people right now but also they broke world records like the new Bugatti hit three hundred and four miles an hour which was insane that is insane how fast that is I personally don't like them I don't like the way they look I think they look kind of gross there's a if you bought there's a different size just thinking if you bought a Bugatti you get to drive it you buy this plane you don't get to fly it that's true unless you take the lessons well would you want if you're gonna say yeah I think if you're gonna spend seventy million dollars on a plane I don't think you should be one of the one flying it I think you should have some system staff asking price sixty seven million nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars that's a stage where they just round it up to seventy what does this a total hours 1616 and you don't want to use death landings oh so this is my time just one they're all use yeah but they don't make lots of new ones box it gets passed around and yeah it was made December 16 2014 yeah it's a five year old jet and it's still 67 nine so I make sure the interiors clean total land age 625 that fucking thing with a bus when I was those blue lights what is it black light yeah oh my god just splatters of jizz all this year you get dan Bilzerian jet it's coke in between the seeds just come everywhere Dan's beard hairs everywhere you go you're picking up beard hairs definitely mixed you're a pastor that one yeah I mean what what are the what's the building cost of making a jet like that it's amazing they retain their value to if I yacht is way more like super yachts you know hundreds of millions of dollars working great yeah yeah I know some guys the four Titas that own the UFC they have some preposterous yacht I saw Steve Jobs yacht after he was dead in Italy it was yeah it was in on the road in Italy and the guy was with pointed out to me and it looks like an apple store looks like a floating apple store what's it okay oh damn floating apple store doesn't it floating apples yeah it looks weird and the back is weird talk about everything is run with IMAX like yeah that's how it looks and if you look like in the back windows it's like everything seen it really seems like an Apple store and everything is run with IMAX it's just those IMAX screens are all over the place hmm interesting yeah Google needs to step it up develop an Android boat entry boat it's a cool looking boat but yeah not much that fucking thing cost that had to cost five hundred million dollars or something ridiculous yeah gotta step up games ubi yeah man 100 million 100 pounds yeah oh yeah what is a euros to pounds it's almost up almost it's almost the same oh really almost parody now yeah but his pounds almost double what all changes yeah your own pounds are almost one-to-one now oh okay yeah it's like 1.03 or something he used to be awesome to go to Canada because if you go to Canada your money would go way further cuz yeah you know I say stock was drawn the last time I came to the States it was two to one pound like you for every hundred dollars was 50 pounds last time I came real and now it's like Phenom accountants is like $60 now so was fucked up yeah that breaks it sounds taking a beating over the last couple of years is it is it weird the whole brexit thing over there um for people who are really into it I don't follow it that hard I'm kind of just bored of it just kind of just do something just make your decision and while the decision should have already been made three years ago but just execute it like let's go let's get out of here what's the general consensus of like your friends and people that you hang out with over there people I hang out with those who live in London are primarily on the remain side those who live outside of London primarily on the on the leave side oh so it's an urban thing like the United States yeah so like the cities are anti-trump mm-hm in the farm areas yeah so if you if you imagine like London and the South East are more equivalent kind of like the the coastal cities mmm Pacific Northwest of the US in terms of being much far more liberal in general and being more Pro you and pro remain whereas if you go outside of that if you go up north or to the Midlands or anything like that then people are yeah I guess both more conservative I guess in a way and also a lot more NTEU in general sentiment hmm so a lot of the people in London and around London work totally blindsided by the brexit vote in the same way that a lot of people I imagine live in Los Angeles in New York were blindsided by the Trump presidency yeah yeah yeah have you ever seen the girl with the sock hat on oh yes of course yeah I've seen her yeah well I watched that one on when I'm feeling a little down I watched the Trump reaction video that seems to sort of embody at the beginning of the chaos that has ensued because things were kind of squirrelly before Trump was elected yeah but now they're just off the reservation yeah well that's part of how he got elected I mean I was what I remember in 2015 before he even won the Republican nomination and I was talking to people both friends and family and saying I think he has a good chance of winning and people were looking at me like I was like I was smoking something yeah I'm annoyed I didn't put any money on it because at the time was her gambling online gambling yeah I think the first time at the time I first said it I think it was I want to say like forty to one or fifty to one or something ridiculous like that I called it on my Netflix special wouldn't get the fuck yeah I'm like we are that close to President Trump like yeah yeah well you you travel the country right so I think your perspective is gonna be a lot more balanced and actually accurate well also what I really don't realize the problems with Hillary like she's that I don't think I think that if they had gone with Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders could really want a really thinking good one he could have beaten Trump yeah I don't think Hillary is ever gonna win she's got too many skeletons there's too many things you can point to there's too much too much madness too much smoke yeah there's way too much weight just way too much yeah it's been going on like most of my life - that's that's the thing is like this isn't a new person she's been involved in this thing for decades yeah and then when the the actual DNC was rigging the primaries against Bernie and Donna Brazile wrote about it in her book and it's that dirty organization it's dirty yeah and she just that's the thing people always forget with Trump is people are always how did he win or why did I do wonder what and it's like you also have to consider like there's all the factors in his favor but there's also I mean who he was running against that's a big part of it yeah that's that's that's a big part of it so people are acting acting as if the alternative was so much better or something and I'm like they found out but it wasn't so they fucked up Bernie could have won I really I really think could have won mmm it would have certainly been more interesting because I know a lot of the Bernie people went over to trump yes you know as time goes on one of the things that I've been noticing and I watched a David Pakman video the other day where David pack once pointing out Trump slurring his speech and I had no idea it was that bad okay I haven't seen it I hadn't seen it there was one time where he literally literally like he's fighting through like safety someone puts you on pain medication they said hey zubi you got to make a phone call yeah oh this is really important him talk to a bank maybe like you know that was me have you god bless america like have you ever seen the video of him no no dude and it's not edited or no no no no no no it's he has a really hard time saying god bless america an attack been pointed out it looks like he's like wrestling with tongue hmm something wrong Oh fair enough I mean now when I see him I mean that guy's got some crazy energy for how old is he 70 73 73 yeah guys got some guys got energy yeah it's called pills you know you need to fucking hop your grandma up on fucking speed to cheat all kinds of shit it's legal doctor doc I'm suffering I've got fatigue I have a chronic fatigue and the doctor go well good thing for you we've got a thing called adderall and make sense knows it's something man yeah it's something I mean we've talked about it on the podcast too much I don't repeat myself yeah but I really do believe that he's on some kind of stimulant yeah he's been on something in the past there was allegedly a pharmacy in New York that was prescribing him diet pills for years and some journalist uncovered the whole thing he's not surprised yeah look I know a lot of people on it man some of them that are functional some of them that are off the fucking charts crazy because of it is the video yeah this is the video but just play the one where you see him slurring his words yeah back up a little bit right there play that listen to this our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities and finally I asked the leaders of the region politically religious Israeli and Palestinian Jewish and Christian and Muslim to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace thank you god bless you god bless Israel god bless the Palestinians and god bless the United States thank you very much there's the last couple words there bro yeah that is listen to you yeah now listen to him yeah listen to you now listen to him that's a guy who's hopped up on something yeah he's hopped up on something or he's dying it could have been drinking he's having it he doesn't drive he doesn't drink doesn't know that's cool drinking gets in the way of pills bro gonna slow down the pills you here for progress we're here to complete tasks and set goals and conquer and make America great again mega the way he was campaigning with the amount of energy that that dude had I mean you gotta assume for a seven-year-old man they've they got a medicated on some shit yeah it's entirely possible negated people yeah we were talking about who the fuck was it that told us about Hitler but Hitler with the we're I remember who brought it up first but it's a bit like three weeks ago now yeah Hitler when he went to meet Mussolini he was apparently super exhausted so they pumped him up with steroids and cocaine the cocaine they injected him with steroids and cocaine and then he liked it so much he asked for a second dose and they thought I was gonna kill him and he said give it to me and then they he went to visit Mussolini apparently chewed Mussolini's ear off for 5 hours Mussolini was apparently thinking about getting out of the war and Hitler talked him out of it just fucking spit and Koch talk Adam Mukherjee is the worst thing you can give to that guy that's a fucking Ric Flair I'm a good man yeah I mean I think they've done that to people forever apparently that was the case with Kennedy Kennedy they would shoot him up with em feta means really yeah see if he can find that what just to keep his energy levels okay Kennedy was very sick apparently before he died and he had severe back pains like he was he was really banged up and he had some sort of a disease I don't know what the disease was but during much of his presidency they would put him on and feta means to keep him active they didn't think about the consequences of those things back then I don't think they truly understood addiction back then I don't think they truly understood look the way it affects your decision-making process well that's back when they used to just you know advertise heroin in the newspaper and stuff as a sort of in the 60s not when was that when was that what we did was that alone they used to just you look and you look in the papers and they just have like such-and-such heroin that take this er and when they still give women tapeworm eggs as diet pills and yeah those were the original diet pills right they used to give a women a tapeworm eggs so you you ingest it and then obviously the tapeworm grows inside of you and eats all the food and you lose weight we have so much to talk about let's find out Kenny first so we've heard of dr. feelgood that's who his doctor was dr. max Jacobson was injecting him and his wife and a list of other people I thought it was a Motley Crue song okay dr. Jacobs oh my god mmm here we go what does it say here the most scrolled up a little bit the most famous doctor patients were President and mrs. Kennedy dr. Jacobson frequently visited the White House and often travel with the Kennedys in 1961 for example he went with the president to Vienna for a summit meeting with Khrushchev and dr. Jacobson said an interview gave the president injections there in addition to the Kennedys other persons who are patients of the doctor included Truman Capote Cecil B DeMille Eddie Fisher alan jay lerner i don't know that is representative Claude pepper of Florida blah blah blah bunch of other politicians from and Tennessee Williams Wow including included among the number of a number of other prominent patients of dr. Jacobson have been a bunch of other famous people blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah an extensive inquiry also turned up the names of well over 100 others in ranking positions in government journalism finance industry Society and several entertainment fields who are said to be patients of dr. Jacobson but who could not be confirmed as such what does it say about okay it cannot be said with certainty that the Kennedys or with a few exceptions any other specific patient received em fetta mean it is known however that dr. Jacobson uses unusually large amounts of amphetamine in his practice the doctor's office reported that dr. Jacobson buys amphetamine at the rate of 80 grams a month that is enough to make 100 fairly strong doses of 25 milligrams every day hmm so he's got a hundred people taking hardcore doses of amphetamines every day 25 milligrams apparently they're saying it's a big dose I don't know I mean is it a lot okay if you just take an adderall she was like 10 to 20 max sometimes people that are crazy get 45 your fucking grinded enamel that's objected to whoa right to the source fuck stomach acids get in the blood baby well yeah I think it's been going on forever yeah it seems like it well I mean it's about energy right like look at poor fucking Joe Biden that poor bastard you've been paying attention to him a little bit he's bleeding from the eyes yeah I saw that on TV is that I just start bleeding yeah well I want to see a million he's a million years old he's only like 78 or some shit he's not that much older 78 is too old to be it is too old stool if you're that guy I mean you could be 70 like Jack LaLanne when he was 78 look fucking fantastic when he was 9 he was pulling boats yeah do you ever see that I don't get think of science ayats it is eyeball yeah and that's too old man you know and for evasive answers evasive answers I can't see fucking bleeding out of his eyeballs that's like some Hellraiser type shit because if you do get into office I mean you age it like four times the normal rate or something anyway well he thinks he's been in office but that's horseshit use a vice president the vice president it's like probably the easiest job in the world the Bryce vice president is like slightly easier than hosting fear factor that's what I think you just kind of show up everybody else does the hard work that fucking garden that's a bear that's barely a job that's like the best way to go into hiding become vice president nobody gives a shit about you okay unless something happens the president you got to step up yeah but nothing ever happens yes true the only thing the only time it's ever happened little the last time I was Kennedy got shot it was the last time and most likely Lyndon Johnson was in on it oh yeah how about that I said it no I cannot confirm nor deny no but who knows who knows who's in on it um that guy ain't gonna win the idea that there they haven't pulled that guy aside go hey Joe mmm no he's the front-runner though right I don't think anymore I think Bernie and Kamala Harris are very close so Trump is should win really but because tulsi gabbard shut down Kamala Harris you know yeah they pushed her out of the debates even though on multiple polls she has enough support to be in the debates they're excluding her from the debates because she attacked camel Harris and rightly so and accurately hmm I think she's on the wrong I think she's on the wrong side I think she's in the wrong party I think she should be a republic I do yeah Wow yeah why she's not on these Democratic ideas though yeah that's true but given the way the Democratic Party is going now I think she's far too sensible for them hmm I don't think so I don't know I think they'll come around maybe if she doesn't win this term she will be president some death okay I really do yes I watched I watched your watched and listened to your podcast with her so that was interesting I've seen enough sue I saw that one I saw that Andrew yang one as well and I think it would be awesome if we had a legitimate badass woman president mm-hmm I think she's the one I can do it I think it'll it all certainly happened eventually no question I don't know next next time I don't know you know I don't like to make public predictions I do think if things keep going the way they will I do think Trump will take it fairly easily if they let Joe Biden get to the front Trump's gonna win yeah Trump lead him yeah he'll chew him up sleepy Joe Trump will be grinded fuck it spitting out fillings I mean fucking a man in Trump is a funny guy he says funny shit it's funny he knows how to shut people about did you see the thing that he did though with the the hurricane map I didn't know he was telling people that the hurricane was headed to Alabama like mr. president there's no indication that hurricanes headed to Alabama so he posts a map with the hurricane path with a sharpie that draws Alabama also in the path of the map bro it's so the one I loved was yeah oh look at this like you see the path that hurricane and then there's a Sharpie drawn around it okay see see this is the original God and then you see the left that Sharpie drawing yeah somebody tripped Oh what was the exact wording that you used today I saw it on the news they're saying that like White House officials wouldn't deny that he didn't do it or something like that they wouldn't deny that he did or didn't do it so no one's saying the President did not definitely did not draw that he posed like give me the map oh yeah we'll just put it here just draw a bit where's Alabama that one okay they didn't just add it in yeah like guys that guy's funny man the the thing with the Trump Tower on Greenland that was amazing yeah actually that was funny that tweet that was very funny but it's you know he's uh and then you guys have your own Trump that fucking dude Boris Boris Johnson the Prime Minister looks like Trump it's crazy skip the crazy hair yeah yeah you know I mean and he's the one he's a pro brexit guy right yeah he was one of the key leaders of the brexit campaign what's happening well backlash man backlash I understand it completely I understand it completely I mean yeah a lot of it like there are a lot of different factors but that's a pretty key one and just you know the the condescension from people in certain cities about the rest of the country or all the other cities I mean you see that it's the same thing in the US and in the UK like I was saying I mean when you've got people even just referring to all of Middle America is what they call flyover country yeah like dude you can't call you can't say that and then this is those people to vote it's not even just that it's expanded even further and the best evidences Dave Chappelle yeah Dave Chappelle's recent sticks and stones Netflix documentary for whatever reason Rotten Tomatoes thought it would be a good idea to only have it reviewed by five super progressive critics only critics they closed it off to the public yeah it got zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes they then opened it to the public and it got ninety nine percent of course if that doesn't show a crazy disparity between first of all the idea that you're gonna suppress it like you're gonna say it's zero percent so no one's gonna watch it and we're gonna shut Dave Chappelle down he's canceled buck him but people love them you can't cancel someone who doesn't care man but you can't cancel Dave Chappelle no you can't but on top of that like how would they not understand that someone is going to know that you're not opening it up to the public and that once it does get open to the public you're gonna get a massive whiplash a backlash where people gonna come and even if they didn't want to vote on it now they do and now they're gonna give it a hundred percent or 99 percent I knew I had to watch it when I saw how all the media channel many of the media channels that I really dislike and do not respect we're coming so hard at it and saying oh no you don't need to watch it and all this although this means I absolutely have to watch it the Guardian gay in the UK gave it one star and then I saw a vice saying like don't watch it Vox saying don't watch I was like okay this is this means that I have to watch this this is gonna be good well and I wasn't disappointed the influence of a small group of your relatively small group of human beings that are in charge of these media conglomerates is it's really astounding and that they it's not just opinion right it's like they're they're trying to get people to behave and think the way they do it's just yes it is activism and in this it's also it's undisguised activism it's very transparent activism it's in a postage journalism I really wish there was a place where we could go we can get 100% unbiased information in news yeah and we can get an honest perspective of both sides this side believes this and this is why they believe that but this side believes that and this is why they believe that it's very hard to do and if you have a podcast one of the things that's really interesting is if you even talk to someone who has an opposing point of view of yours or who is right-wing or who maybe has some questionable ideas you are somehow platforming them and supporting their idea and then supporting some alt white alt-right ideology and there's no room anymore for people to have conversations with people with differing opinions and just find out why there is there is it's right here yeah you've you've literally created it man seriously you you've you and a handful of other people have created this well it'd be a nice fact we could go somewhere well yeah if I could go some I mean it's nice that I'm doing it but you gotta trust me I don't know what the fuck I'm doing I'm not the guy to be distributing information I'm certainly not the guy to be analyzing things yeah I'm too busy okay I have too many other jobs I got three kids I got three jobs I got a lot of hobbies you know I'm fucking busy all right I'm not the guy to go to that's gonna give you an in-depth comprehensive analysis about the way the world works yeah it's not gonna happen I'm not your guy yeah but what I am is someone who's interesting talking to people what they should have is someone who has my I don't wanna say my sensibilities but my my willingness to communicate with almost anybody yeah and then also someone who does a real exhaustive research does real exhaustive research on the actual facts behind all these critical issues they're gonna affect everybody I don't see that anywhere well you're not kind of you're certainly not gonna find it on television just because the format just doesn't allow for that you've got the time pressure the advertising all that it just simply doesn't allow for it and then in you know the way newspapers and journalism is going I mean the stuff that's been paying is the click Beatty sort of stuff you know the stuff that gets people outraged stuff that gets people fired up highly partisan stuff it's you know being sensible is not the in the old media that's not what seems to be profitable I know but is that everything is profitability anything mean where's real journalism yeah because I I feel for real journalists because I do think that they are fighting for their lives in terms of this world like nobody I subscribe to a few different things I subscribe to the Washington Post in the New York Times and a few other periodicals online where I pay money to read their stuff online because I think they have valuable contributions I just I don't think many people are doing that there's so much free shit Vox is free all these other places are free and so if you're only going with free shit you're only going to get biased stuff and you're also only going to get stories that are commercially viable to the people that are making it and what why would they be currently viable well they got to be click that's that's the only way you get people to pay attention to shit that's I think that's that's already starting to stop working you think click baby stuff yeah I don't know if you I mean if you remain think back a couple years ago where I don't know you'd go on Facebook and you'd get all these kind of like BuzzFeed things and you had all these new media companies that sprung up and sort of took advantage of the clickbait era but people are pretty people have become quite wise to that now I think and people are starting to realize I mean I think if you went back even a decade I don't think most people thought that the media in general was particularly biased maybe they would have thought ok maybe that one and that one but not just generally now I think if you were to survey people like a lot of people understand that even the ones that are supposed to be impartial things like CNN and things like the New York Times especially when it comes to the opinion pieces you know people know that those things are not just giving it to you straight they know you're you're getting some spin some cases you're getting it from a totally partisan angle and I think if people are upfront with that if they're like look we're a conservative news outlet look we're a liberal left-wing news outlet and that's the filter everything is coming through if they're front up front about that then you know I'm kind of like oh yeah yeah that's that's fine but if people claim to be unbiased or claim to be totally impartial and just bring you the facts without putting too much opinion or spin on it and then you can kind of see through that and see that's what they're doing and they may not even know that they're doing it right because so many people get stuck in these echo chambers so I don't think all of it is necessarily on purpose but that's just how it is and I think the vibe I'm certainly getting I know with myself and with other people and listening to what people are saying is people are starting to notice it a lot more I know you've talked a lot about the online tech censorship and bias and stuff like that which is another thing that again I think if you went back ten years ago I don't think people thought that Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or any of these things were biased whereas now in 2019 it's like okay you've got enough examples to see okay they're do platforming a lot of people of certain political persuasions and then you've got other people who are outright calling for violence or just saying like crazy stuff or threatening people and they're fine they're turning a blind eye to it you know and it's so it's just in your face and it's kind of like well this isn't me being a conspiracy theorist it's just look they've taken off that person that person that person that person but all these people are still there so these rules are not being applied fairly then that's certainly the case and it's also certainly the case that they're trying to manage this stuff at scale right so they're trying to manage like one of the things that I got from communicating with Jack Dorsey the head of Twitter is that you saw how many got hacked yes when they used a very simple way to do it SMS text because they used to have a system we could send texts through you know to Twitter through text messages and they hacked it that way yeah that was so weird I was on Twitter when it happened I was like scrolling through my feet I was like it is fun right isn't it fun when someone like Jack gets hacked what someone like Jack is hacked it's like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute the guy who's the fucking head of Twitter yeah who's been at the head of this the helm of his controversy when it comes to censorship it got hacked yeah and his pin tweet is something about how Twitter wants to open up conversations and yes I get something very very positive and then underneath it it was just like whoa I think he really does want to open up conversations and he really does believe that blockchain is eventually going to have virtually every conversation that everyone has ever had ever available for everyone online and that the idea of censorship is going to be preposterous in the future and I think he's right and I think that's one of the reasons why his own personal philosophy is that Twitter should essentially be a town hall this is what he and I is when we got into it particularly with the Tim pool and vigía yeah when we talked about it his philosophy his personal philosophy is that Twitter should be available to anyone to communicate their ideas and then it which should operate much like the First Amendment so you know the only thing you can't do is call for violence and dogs be things along that are they gonna bring people back then they should I told him he should they said they should and then he said that there was a thing an idea of a Wild West Twitter like he'd have to Twitter's he'd have a curated Twitter and then you have anything goes Twitter yeah yeah bring back Alex Jones and whoever the fuck else has been banned who's a few people the big ones Laura Loomer yeah all them Megan Murphy yeah Megan Murphy's ridiculous way it's been on my podcast I want to get her on and we've talked about having her honor I hope eventually I can if people don't know the what happened she got banned from cheese what's called the turf which is a trans exclusionary radical feminists mmm a trans exclusionary that's a weird word exclusionary I don't even say it right I say exclusionary exclusionary radical feminists is someone who thinks that trans women are not women and so she has said you know publicly that she doesn't think that trans women should be in feminist spaces communicating as women and so she got into it on Twitter with someone and she said but a man is never a woman and they lifetime ban yeah they no they actually told to take that down so she took it down but she made a screenshot of it and then she can close it up the screenshot that said a man's never a woman and they gave her a lifetime ban yeah which is goddamned hilarious yeah I mean that that's crazy I don't get the lifetime oh we were talking about be people on Milo as well of course Milo you know got taken off several years ago let see they wouldn't tell me exactly why Milo got taken off they said that Milo had harassed Leslie Jones but he had he made fun of her but apparently there were some allegations that there was many accounts other than Milo's connected to Milo that Milo was operating this was the allegation I don't know if that's true yeah and then this is one of the reasons why they had made the decision but that might not be the case that might be the case of someone saying hey we suspect that these other accounts are also run by Milo so it's because they wouldn't say it on the podcast yeah thing is look even if even if someone did ban for genuinely violating some Terms of Service the idea of a lifetime their life I mean forever you're not still banned that's insane I mean you can be you've got you'll have literally convicted hardcore criminals on there who can have Twitter accounts and stuff but it's like okay you said something that someone didn't like Gavin McGinnis isn't yeah Gavin McInnes yeah there's quite a few yeah there are quite a few you know the problem is when you ban these people the way their they've done it radicalizes people in opposition absolutely and it also looked here's the reality man Twitter's a terrible way to communicate it's fucking terrible limited amount of text the text is a terrible way to communicate true I mean we were just talking Jamie and I were talking yesterday about disagreements that people have had that we know through emails like that emails like someone reads it wrong and then someone sends you a message hey you know this guy is disrespecting me and then you go and read it and you go what is going on here man because people read into text they they just decide that things and text mean certain things they might not really be accurate yeah I think that's a problem and I think that though the method of communication through Twitter is just a terrible method Twitter is good for letting people know you got things coming up like hey I got an album out yep fine perseverance perseverance zubi Twitter's good for I love it for posting science stories okay yeah and interesting stories where it's amazing Twitter is the best social media platform by a mile I don't interact with people anymore I don't blame you I send things to the world that I think are interesting and I hope people enjoy it genuinely I don't want I don't bash anybody on Twitter I don't attack anybody on Twitter I've had opportunities where someone's informed me of something that someone else has said and I'm like that's not even true people say wild stuff about you man it's interesting people stay some some wild stuff about just just generally but you know I think when it comes to communication the further you move away from face-to-face real world communication the further you abstract away from it the worse the communication method is and the easier it is to because you lose so much yes and easier is to intentionally distort it is it is and you know you lose so a phone I mean real life is the best and then second to that probably a video chat after that a phone call after that a text after that a tweet and the further you abstract away from it you just lose more and more of the actual communication because you can't read any body language now there's no intonation in the words you can't tell I could say something now and it's like you know you say something with smile on your face it's Joey's joking but if you tweet those exact same words one person will read it and be like okay I think he's Joe I think he tweeted that with a smile on his face someone else is like no that's that's dead serious like that's a yeah something crazy he's saying there and nobody really knows and then because it's all public I mean it's Twitter is weird because there's not it's like just going into a room and just full of people and just shouting something yes it's not like a forum where it's like okay this is the topic we're talking about this right now mm-hmm Twitter's just like ah this is what I think about anything and you just throw it out there and then you wait for people to people to come back with stuff you know what's interesting is when someone tries to be someone tries to establish a narrative about themselves on Twitter like hey listen as a happily married man who's a Christian this and that and that like wait whoa whoa who are you talking to you you shout in the south or are you trying to are you trying to describe yourself for people so people have a certain way of viewing you oh yeah because that she ain't gonna work yeah they're immediately gonna go why are you talking like this what kind of person says these things what kind of person like tries to establish a narrative about them mmm well they do it before they even talk I mean people do that with their Twitter bio oh yeah have to do it with their bio I mean some people who put in you know this is my species my phone my location my pronouns my religious or non-religious views you know who I vote for like all of that yeah like here's my folks if you see anybody that says they them as their pronouns block them just block them right now no I've got something I'm trying to coin is zu B's razor which is that if someone on Twitter has their pronouns in their bio then there's like a 95% chance that you can just yeah I dismiss a lot of what I'm saying zoo bees raiser is a very easy way to describe me and I'm gonna use that for I'm gonna call it zoo bees raiser you know it's interesting I noticed that you have an Android phone what Apple did the fuck people is when someone is about to write attacks to get those dots dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot to let you know they're typing and then it goes away like oh they were gonna type something and then they fucking stopped whereas with Android you send a text you get a text back maybe you do maybe you don't but you don't know if anybody's in the middle they could write some long lengthy bullshit text and then wake up sober and go oh my God thank God I didn't send that you know it's like emails you don't know whether or not someone's gonna someone's replying to an email but that dot dot dot dot dot you get that on Instagram too if you sent a DM someone is typing ooh that's a weird one gives people an xiety to it does you can annoy people you can you can just start type and then walk away just just keep the app open and use other apps yeah it's crazy all the social media stuff I feel like we're just right now in the middle of sort of the biggest experiment amongst humankind that's ever taken place and we're you know we're all guinea pigs in it like we have no idea what the long-term implications and repercussions of some of this stuff is gonna be but it's like we're all just in here using all these different platforms and I mean you can already see some of the effects yeah it's uh seems pretty well-documented that things like depression and anxiety or going up as use of social media goes up I mean literally during the introduction of it with the smartphone's it's the combination of smartphones and social media yeah I think that does it I don't think it's not smartphones alone it's not social media alone like when you had to go login on a PC to use MySpace or Friendster or hi-5 or whatever and then you go out the house and you're no longer on it it's just the fact people are constantly carrying it around and you know trying to get this validation and you know you've got Instagram now talking about potentially removing likes or YouTube removing views because they're seeing how it's affecting people and all this kind of stuff and yeah it's not gonna work though that list is too late and the box is open you know you're a grown-ass man so for you you can handle all the shit yeah I think the real problem is kids yeah kids growing up being 13 and 14 having Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and having anonymous people say really shitty things to them anonymous friends or enemies at school that's a real issue and Jonathan hate wrote a great book called the coddling of the American mind great book it's really good right okay and it goes into that and Devyn it really made me fuckin super nervous for my kids like growing up and developing during this time where we have this you know sort of uncharted territory of social media there's not like a lot of documented history of you so we can go back 200 years of people using social media and this is the way to do it healthily and that's the way to you know there's there's people that are just fuckin tweeting all day long yeah it's just an experiment a lot I think going crazy pulling the fucking hair out taking pills barely barely getting by in this life and just tweeting all day long yes it's weird and you've got people have different and then you got people who just post ten selfies a day the same same picture same face and just really yeah there's some it's generally women but there's some people's profiles you can go and it's just you go on their Instagram page and it's just all just their face same face same pose and we're just the time today just there but oh did you see that video clip where the girl had the selfie stick and she's she's trying to get a photo of her own but with this with a selfie stick she's like on a deck chair I've seen that just yeah that's hilarious someone took a picture for doing it so her ass is straight up in the air like that oh my god she's trying to get that perfect ass angle I was like well that's the 2019 Thursday people are so thirsty they want like so badly yeah it is it is very weird and then you've had people who have died because of it okay yeah I don't even Canyon you know keep falling off the grand really yeah yeah people falling off buildings there was that couple where there she is still loving our generation hosted that oh no she actually ice got herself a stinkin barstool she has gotten selfies no she does have a selfie stick oh she put it on the selfies day look at that dirty bitch see see right there she's got her arm up and this is like not good enough let's get that selfie stick out oh my god it's so hilarious range but imagine that's your daughter you like no she's really strange have I done because I think it's it's both exposed people for what they are but it's also changed people's behavior yeah you know people do things now that you just wouldn't even something as simple as taking a picture of your food well here's something that never existed before no man verse this is something that you see now that you never saw before ready here's the look oh yeah the right side right that's a new thing the head yeah it's taking photos of yourself is a pretty new concept I remember in myspace people used to do it in the mirror and the bathrooms and bathroom and stuff like right that's when they first got thirsty yeah this first start seeing six-packs and nice asses yeah it's just weird I just wonder what the effect will be in a couple decades to be honest with you coincidentally myspace is also right around the time that why people started figuring out they like big asses something's happened with that hasn't there I was talking about this with one of my friends well they go back to like the Dukes of Hazzard yeah okay this what I was talking about that Catherine Duke she was like one of the hottest women on the planet Earth in like 1980 and she's a beautiful lady with an ass as flat as this table hmm she probably never did squat yeah ever and nowadays that won't fly you you know you can't get by you can't get by without a big caboose it's weird it's um part evolution part diet part I don't doctors squad squad so you know going to the gym has become a lot more mainstream though in general hasn't it it certainly has but there's a lot of gals out there faking spunk yeah there's a lot of gals out there with some plastics shoving their buttocks area and ready for this dun dun dumb ass cancer there's a whole group of humans that are experiencing cancer in their ass because of ass implants really the same kind of cancer that many women get when they get breast implants oh it's not a hundred percent of them but it's it's it's relevant like there's an issue there was an article written about it recently that women are started their doctors are starting to find the same types of cancer that some women get is you know everyone's body reacts differently than everything and there are certain risks that you take if you get some sort of an implant in your body that you're probably rejects it or then it causes cancer so women are getting cancer of their ass men that's a rough cancer bro you got to go in there and scoop out chunks of your butt and maybe you die maybe you die it's not worth it because you weren't willing to do squats yeah just do squats that's the thing you can do squats it's like if a guy has a little dick all right and there was a machine that let you build your dick up there would be a line around the block for that machine all right I mean everybody would be on that goddamn dick machine but women have a way to build their ass up it is a real thing you can do squats and deadlifts you can run stairs you can do squats and deadlifts and you will get a big firm ass and it works you know you're not gonna get a JLo ass unless you got those hips yeah have you seen that when guys do the like the six-pack implants or of course you must have seen like since you know synthol and stuff where they where they yeah inject the oil into them it's like muscles and swell up yeah people do crazy people do some strange some really strange stuff the six-pack one is the weirdest though yeah because it's just this is just there all the time yeah even if they yeah but it looks weird cuz some even if you even if they gain weight and then the rest of their body is kind of flabby you still just got it looks like a ninja turtle is like both yeah it looks like value AB implants over his keg it looks like a mouse Bowser from Mario you know show me that in a large version Jesus Christ that's weird right that's so crazy because that guy's fat it just doesn't look right wow that's so weird and that's definitely fake is it only that guy just does a shit ton of setups no cuz he's got a barrel chest but he doesn't have any any pecs which is weird who is that says celebs I think this guy was on Big Brother in the UK yeah and he definitely got an app implant yeah that's adds impact yeah 100% I'm pretty sure I don't know yeah this is shows our plastic surgery plastic abs go back to that image that you were just at before go back the way you just weren't know scroll down no no on the other side scroll down the boxer right there the left-hand side yeah that guy was a boxer above it right there that guy had PEC implants okay that was a boxer with PEC implants and like crazy plastic surgery face he we we we watched a video of him before he was fighting in Mexico he had like fixed fights no and Mexico remember that this guy had like faked everything like fake fake chest and fake muscles and just so weird cuz it doesn't fucking odd because it's it's so strange though because it doesn't even it doesn't even function Yeah right if you had big arms or armies arms that look big pumped up with synthol or whatever but then they're not even strong alright and then the problem is look at that neck grab a hold of that neck bro you ain't you ain't defending any choke sir there's a tiny-ass neck oh that one there that before-and-after really shows on the left the ABS oh yeah go to that far left yeah you can that really shows that wow wow that's incredible my god but what's weird is because your abs only look like that if you're lean and like if you're if you're flexing them yes but when they do that it's like that all the time all the time so it just it doesn't look right that that's incredible this is different this is dodging itching so it's not an implant but like sculpting in some way it was that guy did also lose weight between those two pictures yeah he certainly did he's certain that dropped his body and it looks like his arms and chest got bigger so he leaned out I'm not buying that I want might be just and then that you got that synthol guy up there I don't know people do some people do some strange things so the thing is a woman can get things done like boobs and no one cares guys look she looks hot mmm but if a guy's got like a fucking sock in it oh wow we're looking at a girl who has fake implants of her abdomen her abdominal muscles that are so obviously fake that they're over her ribs yeah like those muscles are literally over the rib cage where they don't even belong no that's not look at her face too steroids yeah so you can see look at yeah so look at that guy you can see when he's sitting like the abs are still look ideas - bro you got to lose weight if you're gonna rock fit that's so lays an 8 pack - that's so lazy see abs are a weird one cuz if you really desperately wanted abs everybody can get them if you just work hard enough you know abs it's not like what what is that the guy's abs and then a weird swelling underneath oh is this flesh fanny pack yeah but what is that I don't know sorry what is that that's just a weird picture yeah yeah but guys with fake things like get no respect you know I mean a guy with a fake dick like get out of here I got with fake pecs get go away what is this whoa inject it into his ball sack my god man dies after injecting silicone into his testicles for sex cult game okay yeah that's all I had issues but like dudes with fake pecs and guys would fake muscles like nobody wants to see that shit no I just go to the gym and eat right it does work yeah we imagined they were really if there was a dick growing machine you know I got a squat rack for your dick boy boy would there be a line but after wouldn't it just become like that would just become the new norm if ever yeah girls will be all stretched out everybody have a giant hog but you know what I don't actually think most people would you just like most people don't go to the gym I mean you've already got this option to increase your muscles and make yourself look better and most people don't do it so I'm not convinced that if it took actual work and effort I don't actually think the majority of people would do it I think you're a hundred percent correct yeah if it was difficult it was hard work that's why people want these operations all they have to do is go to the doctor's office the doctors gonna take care of everything Mike I'm gonna put you under and when you wake up you're gonna have a hog of a lifetime you're gonna have a giant pecks and a false sculpted six-pack and synthol stuffed muscles there's one video this guy that's Brazilian dude who's got these synthol muscles and he's dancing and it looks like he's got water balloons all the body dysmorphia more people just don't see what other people see like same as anorexics and then same as you know I guess bodybuilders have that same issue like a lot of really enormous bodybuilders still feel like they look small yeah it's it's weird man it's it's weird like I just think if you want to change your body you want to change your physique you want to feel better you want to feel more confident there is a way to do that yes that doesn't involve paying tens of thousands of dollars are taking massive health risks or getting cut up or anything like that just go to the gym lift train I it works yeah it really it really does work not everyone's going to be able to reach some elite level but you know everyone can look better man everyone can look better you know the people that I have sympathy for people with physical deformities hmm you know issues that just can't grow muscle or something's wrong with your body or you have a disease like yeah I get it then for those people I do truly hope that science comes up with a solution and it's through some sort of CRISPR type engineering they're able to here's a question for you Joe do you think that there's any sort of limit in terms of what science maybe could do but sort of should not do you mean like a science advances and things get a little more crazy and they're looking into things like making people immortal or all that kind of mmm in your own mind do you think there's like a level where it's like maybe we should like to leave this alone and not go not go that far I don't know I think even if you do think that and I'm sure that you could find examples where I would say that's a bad idea it's not going to matter because I think that people are going to do it and if the United States isn't gonna do it China's going to do it yeah I mean I think China is already experimenting on people in pretty pretty radical ways and they're they doing yeah they're doing CRISPR on fetuses and you know they're they're going to do genetic engineering I think it's in you know it's just in the cards in our lifetime we're going to see some product of genetic engineering that's some super freak athlete yeah yeah I mean I'm when you and I are old men we're gonna be watching television or whatever the fuck they have back then or in the future rather and we're gonna see someone who can fucking jump over buildings we're gonna see someone who can you know literally fly over cars just leap over things and just someone with preposterous physical attributes that's all created in a laboratory yeah if you think about the greatest athletes the world has ever known you know you look at like the the very best physical specimens that humanity has to offer and they just figured out okay well what are the traits and how do we how do we impart those on people and how do we actually improve them how do we double them and triple them you know you know what myostatin inhibitors are yes I do they allow the muscle to grow far beyond yeah we can't and they exist in for whatever reason in some cows naturally and also whippets yeah believe I've shown people pictures and like that's not real it is really something with whippets apparently when they breed them you know like breeding dogs is weird like I have a friend who has a chocolate lab and their eyes are about as close together as my two fingers are that dog is fucked like it just it's just like I don't like being around it'll bite you like it's a it's it's overbred like it's like some fucking West Virginia hillbilly just left alone in some small town they can't get anywhere and they there are people like that right inbred people well there's inbred used to be a big problem in with royalty right yes yes yeah yeah because they only had to breed with otherworldly yeah this whatever reason when you breed whippets and something goes wrong because they're just breeding with other whippets they developed this fucking preposterous ability to grow muscle and they look like Hulk dogs and it's not that's gonna happen to people man there was already a boy who was born in Germany I believe who had a natural problem he's like his body naturally had the same issue that a whip it had have you something I think I know I'm trying to actually remember his name because I know the kid you were talking see if he can pull that up well there was one kid they called them the young Hulk turned out that his father was actually injecting with steroids when I was a little kid which is awful but this is a boy from Germany who had this myostatin inhibitors and he was fuckin jack how old he was little yeah like four four or five at the time when I saw the pictures and I'm talking just thick muscle caps you know he looked like Paulo Costa the guy who fights in the UFC yes fucking jacked that's nice Jack Jack little baby that's so yeah we're gonna we're gonna see the Hulk you know like a real live version of the Hulk it's gonna happen I don't know that that kind of stuff it does freak me out because it's kind of like eugenics 2.0 right yeah you know I'm just kind of like man where how where's this stuff all gonna right all gonna go well there's a beauty in our diversity like our physical diversity this is a beauty and the fact there's really tall people and really short people and really smart people really stupid people and sometimes stupid people really good at certain things sometimes smart people are really bad at other things and this there's like there's a beauty in the chaos of human life is that we are all weird and different and and if you can find your way everyone can make some sort of a contra be it's not that everyone's going to make some sort of a contribution but it's possible that most of us can find something where other people find value and what you do and you could do something in an extraordinary way yeah definitely I think I'm a great way to stay humble is to always remember that like everybody is superior superior to you in some way shape or form right you know it seems like you've got people who are kind of awesome at everything or whatever but it's like you know what like every person out there has got something that especially if they tapped into it and they actually reached some fraction of their potential then people who have people are capable of all kinds of crazy things when they actually do it and they train and they work on it another perspective enhancer is that the grave beckons I mean we're all gonna die yeah dwelling on what you're great at or not great at in this life okay you got much time bro seems like you do but it'll be there before you know it that Grim Reaper is gonna be knocking on your door yeah I think that's motivational though there's a little kid yeah yeah he's four years old fucking Wow jeez is that the kid he does gymnastics the best I could I thought this is here talking to type-in mile statin in here but yeah yeah but I don't know if it's coming up on him I'll if they have Studies on him but I don't know if that's him he's Jack though he's so Jack he's four years old like seventeen year old super dude look at this shit look at the shoulder striations what that is so unusual no that's not normal no so unusual that guy's gonna fuck his way through grammar school that's not normal [Laughter] yeah we're gonna see a lot of those we're gonna see a lot of those coming out of China aren't my words you know there's not a big little older now that's him now oh okay what happened stop lifting weights my stuff they got them off the shit 15 now my feet when I see something like that and then I also see him lifting weights or he's younger I don't think this is the same one because that's also he's Italian right Romanian his Romanian yeah um there's another kid from Michigan which he said Germany so I thought it was a German kid yeah I thought you know you're talking about but we could search for a long time before we find didn't interrupt the podcast we'll never get done but uh I think we're gonna see that I think to answer your question now yeah I think there's probably a lot of things that we shouldn't do you know but what are those things and who's to decide and and does it really matter I mean look it's entirely possible that this fucking plan is gonna get hit with in our lifetime by a giant asteroid we're gonna wipe us all out possible that's possible it's possible that's not outside the realm no I mean this is their big one it's supposed to there's a real chance it might hit around 2029 I thought we were all supposed to be marked to bite in 2000 or so but I don't know that was just the y2k is just watching a book that was just the bug it's gonna stop civilization in its tracks yeah I thought aleris is that when they were coding they didn't take into account that 1900 2000 I've ever even even at that time when I was a lot younger I was thinking surely they worked that out like surely it'll just go from 99 to zero they're not it's not gonna just explode and they call this case I worked it out and you had people like hiding underground and doomsday prepping and although imagine if you spent all your money building a bunker in your backyard and then the day after mm poke your head out and people driving I'm Ike gonna stay in there to stage this a face yeah yeah I mean look people are fuckin silly but we we all have this understanding this appreciation the fact that we know civilization like our grid our power grid is fragile the internet is fragile there's a fucking there's wires that go under the ocean that connect us to other countries that's how it works yeah the Internet is literally wires laid down at the bottom of the ocean that connect us with Europe yeah it's nuts it's it's crazy how quickly it's how quickly it's happened as well I know it's interesting with me I mean I was born 86 and I remember in you know the late 80s when you couldn't even render a circle on a screen right like they didn't have the technology to make an actual circle so in all the video games and graphics and stuff it would either be a square or at best a hexagon or an octagon because you couldn't actually do round curves and that's in my own lifetime and then I mean I remember the early days of the internet when I was especially when I was in boarding school and stuff and using geo cities and Netscape and all that kind of stuff and it's just kind of crazy how it's gone from that and all these Atari 2600 and these very basic video games and stuff like that and the Apple to ease with the big floppy discs and all that stuff and I'm just like man I'm only I mean I just turned 33 and I'm like man that's just in my own lifetime so in another 10 20 30 years it's yeah it's amazing to just think of what stuff's gonna be like because they'll look back on what we have now and what we have everything we have now is gonna look like the Atari 2600 does to me right now they'll be looking at these phones and being like gosh people used to use this inevitable yeah you know what's interesting is that there's there's nothing classic from our lifetime either classic classic like like there's classic things from like the night like classic muscle cars for example from the 1960s people love them classic cars from the 90s can go fuck themselves no nobody wants a 1990 car get the fuck out here with wasn't it all already classic by like the 80s though like classic rock was already classic run yeah was it again stuff happened quick yeah but people realize is something had happened there was this like this blip in time where people went wild and they you know we talked about it with aoki yesterday we were talking about Hendrix and Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison these people just were a part of this revolutionary change in culture and then it was swiped out in the 1970s so by the time 1980s came around when I was in high school 1970 cars were fucking classic cars okay they were classic Monga 1970 Chevelle in 1981 when I was 14 was the shit okay it was like a classic muscle car like my mom had a 1970 barracuda 1971 barracuda when I was 14 in 1981 that was the shit but it was a classic car was an old car but it was ten years old okay it's like we realized some way that the culture had shifted and that was never gonna happen again because cars were dogshit in the 80s I mean they were just dark if you didn't have a Porsche Porsche is probably the only cars that are still cool like I have a 1993 RS America it's a very lightweight air-cooled Porsche super-lightweight stripped down no air conditioning no radio it's a fun car and so I was like one of the rare cars it's worth a fuck from 1990s one of the rare ones yeah most of the shit from that era is just nonsense you know for whatever reason they just the 80s and the 90s like people just said they went into this dull zone of creativity a lot of a lot of things classic video games though I guess music music and video games entertainment yeah music films comedy comedy no those Eddie Murphy delirious 80s yeah a lot of Richard Pryor shit was from the 80s it was amazing so maybe not in terms of tech or manufacturing yeah but in entertainment I think entertainment and culture I think some key stuff happened in that decade well there's these bursts of novelty and of creativity and we're certainly in the middle of one right now like right now is probably one of the more interesting times to be alive in terms of like constant innovation and new things being created yeah Apple has apparently some new AR glasses they're about to release ok mented reality glasses yeah I also just think now the time we live is people just have the opportunity and potential empower people have as individuals now is insane yeah it's it's not what it's ever been before I mean nobody told you to start this podcast right this is just something you you started and you've been doing it you've been doing it now for a decade plus and you've got the ability to broadcast this out to millions of people doesn't matter where they are in the world I mean I live in the UK I flew over here to come do this podcast and I've had people in the UK aw cool awesome you're going on on Joe Rogan yeah I watch that and it's like that's thousands of miles away and you've got people all over and you can reach all of them largely for free to write you can just do that you can put something out on your phone you can reach millions of people through their whatever it is you're trying to communicate whatever it is you're trying to promote I mean that's new yeah I really enjoy the fact that it's free I think that's the coolest aspect of one of the big media things today which are podcasts is that you could just get them it's just like downloads so many of them and get them all the time and there there are always new ones they're always available yeah and you get them I love the fact that you can get them instantly - yeah you have your podcast don't you I do yeah a real talk with do be real talk with zoobi he'll talk so I can go right now to my iTunes and I'll type in right here here we are we got there we in the podcast app and we're gonna go with real talk with zoobi talk with you there it is BAM we'll talk with zoobi here it is boom do that and I'ma subscribe and then I'm gonna see checkmark and then down low Wow awesome everybody else go do the same right now everybody I mean this is what's crazy is it's not like instantaneously play it I mean we're having this conversation survive benign images I mean go and that's crazy my shut up that's that's the most amazing thing in our lifetime it is yeah is that you you just pull that out of air this thing is pulling things now the sky with you know it's nuts I feel like people are aware of it but they're kind of not most people are not you know what I mean like people that are are yeah people people use it everybody knows the internet exists everyone knows social meet is there I don't think people realize like what you can really do with those tools it's like yeah you can sit there on Twitter and be mean to people in Detroit and troll and troll and go on YouTube and write mean comments or whatever you can do that but you can also just create something from nothing right if you comedian you're a musician you're an actor or whatever you can just go make a YouTube channel create new channel create new account yeah and you can just start putting stuff out there you've got a phone which can record an HD 4k video good audio I mean it's not so even if I just go back to the 90s or early thousands and you look at music videos and stuff like that and an iPhone or a standard Android can record better quality video than the top-tier stuff that they were recording music videos how films with not so long ago and it's just like man that's just in your pocket especially the new androids like the Galaxy Note tend to blur the background like portrait mode in 4k video so you're making 4k video not just blur it but they also have this filter that you can make the background kind of fucked up and scratchy like an old VHS tape okay you could do cool effects with video while in real time yeah I mean it's they also have wide-angle lenses so you can film and and take photos and wide-angle they have night vision mode where it turns night into a much more visible environment it's it's weird it's weird and it's still early that's a crazy thing is that it's still early I love the fact they're all competing with each other right like Apple has to come up with something better than Samsung's done and Huawei and you know oneplus it's like it's this mad dash to come up with the greatest shit the world's ever seen it is what's doing it I do think that they would be good to have a little bit of a moratorium on new phones though really why they won't do it but there's no of course not of course not they want to keep the competition going keep people fired up but the differences between them now are so incremental it's it's just diminishing returns now so you know if you put out a new phone every six months or every 12 months the difference between them now is kind of like sort of but the difference between like yeah if you look at like the screen real estate of a Galaxy Note 10 person I pas iPhone 10 which is what I have they're 10s tennis max okay that was a shit just a few months ago yeah but when you look at that next to like Steve Aoki was here yesterday and he had a Galaxy S 10 Plus that thing looks way cooler than this if you look at them right next to each other like oh there's no there's no bezels on the outside and there's no notch at the top yeah there's a tiny little hole where the camera isn't my yeah yeah well I guess what I mean is like the difference between the Galaxy s5 and s6 edge was like a big leap right and then between the s6 and the s7 a little less between the s7 and the si a little less I mean between me what do you got over there what do you use this is a one plus six I'll give them I should give them a shout-out that's a great phone 1 plus makes a great phone a sort of unheralded phone they have the very best in screen fingerprint reader apparently yeah so that's a philosophy called out to him teaching me yeah so they've made three new ones since this version I only got this last year but this is already three generations let me see that that's the new one plus seven the one plus seven has a full screen so I got Megatron on the back though oh the one plus seven has a full screen there's no not at all there's nothing about camera camera go a little motor yeah which is pretty incredible yeah a lot of people here don't seem to know oneplus know everyone seems confused by my phone here right that's everybody's Apple crazy ok ok it's everyone's locked into the ecosystem ok apples done an amazing job of roping everybody into their ecosystem 100% with iMessage and with airdrop ok those two things and FaceTime FaceTime weird thing over here everybody face times people there's a new thing like I got FaceTime calls for my friends I just FaceTime me out of the blue I'm like alright I guess we're gonna talk on video one and then they're there and then your videotape like the first one to do it to me was killer Mike I was taking a shit and killer Mike FaceTime me I'm like what's up man but apparently kids are doing Andrew Schultz does it a lot of a lot of people just FaceTime people now that's the new thing yeah people are into facetiming Schultz is an interesting example because he's a guy that couldn't get a Netflix deal couldn't get a Comedy Central deal so he said ok I know what I'll do I know I've got great comedy I will just put it all on YouTube and he created this YouTube channel he put his his stand-up comedy special he was self produced it paid for everything put it up on YouTube and it's got millions of views and he went from being a guy that didn't really sell out club all that often to selling out theaters multiple shows and it happened inside of a year yeah just all self-made all done by himself with with the people that he works with he puts a little clips on his Instagram they get hyped up he promotes them that way he puts clips on YouTube and now other comics are following suit and they realize like hey this is the way to do this and so many people can watch YouTube on their television now oh yeah of course yeah it's just the opportunity out there right now is is incredible yeah it's incredible I mean I posted a dumb 9 second video on Twitter and you know got international international coverage on it I've been invited to fly out to LA I'm now on you know the Joe Rogan experience doing all these other podcasts and it's just it's just nuts you know you can heat for that oh of course yeah what is what did people say well 99.5% was positive most people got it the people who were angry it was kind of funny because people were angry for different reasons because a lot of people didn't get it so I don't say a lot of people a few people didn't get it so some people were upset with me saying that what I did was not fair towards women you kind of got the point but you also sort of hugely missed it here so I got some people saying that you know you're not a real woman and you shouldn't be doing this what you did was unfair up against women and blah blah blah dished angers I'm kind of like dude you always gonna have people that need you need them to dig holes yeah yeah and and that and then of course there were the people who were trying to say that it was some attack on trans people as a whole or the entire trans community or something something like this and it was just like no it's just making a very biological factual point this is not an attack on any individual nor group and like you said I mean online what's weirdest people try to read malice and stuff into things that's not there yeah someone will see one tweet and they'll start coming up with all these weird assumptions about what you believe or what they think you are or whatever and you're just like no that's not what I said that's not what I believe I just said what I said I did what I did that is one of the interesting things about tweets right is that if you can define someone 140 characters so the bigoted moron who's this in that and boom yeah and then you send that tweet out there and then you know you read it that's not me no but it's these mischaracterizations are so easy when there's 140 characters or 280 character a lot of it is malice too you know if people don't understand something or something goes against their beliefs or their ideology it's a lot easier to just try to demonize the person I'm saying it or slap some kind of label on them which means that you can just ignore that person or it's people try to do it all the time it's not something that works with me because I'm very aware and cognizant of these type of tactics and stuff people try to use to mob people to shut them down or whatever so it doesn't work on me personally like I've had tons of mobs come after me and try to you know label me so I'm sure no reasonable just doesn't work because I don't play into the game yeah they just end up looking silly because they'll say something and it is like no well you've got your finger on the pulse of culture and all these shifting tides and turns where do you think this is going because this is not something that we experienced 10-15 years ago this is this is all like the the boiling point is completely new yeah what do you think this is going it's a good question I is like a particular aspect of it do you mean those the political stuff or well there's animosity for sure but yeah it seems heightened it is I it seems more people are particularly politically more polarized now than ever before the quickest I've ever seen for people to label someone a bigot or a racist or a transfer or a sexist it's like everyone want there's there's so much intensity involved in discourse today that I I tribute some event to the dismay of having a maniac in the white house you know well he's he's more of a symptom than a cause it was already happening and I'd already seen it happening yeah so that's a big reason why he won as far as I'm concerned because people were getting tired of some of the nonsense yeah people are getting tired of I I often joke I mean it it seems like in 2015 and 2016 the the strategy of you know some of the Democratic Party was to call half the population racist and that didn't work so now their strategy is to call 70% of the population racist it doesn't work I mean it doesn't endear people to you if you're trying to win people over then trying to call them things that they're not is really not a good idea and a big problem with it as well is one it dilutes the terms right when people start throwing around these terms racist Nazi white supremacists are it dilutes the terms completely because if you google which one Google were they called ben shapiro oh yeah and who's a Jew an Orthodox Jew they call it to Orthodox Jew or one of those and Dennis Prager is also Jewish they labeled them in internal memos as Nazis it's insane Nazi it's crazy yeah I've been called a Nazi whoo I'm a young black man I've been called a black white supremacist yeah so like Clayton Bigsby from the show I I wish I were joking my best thing is like three of the people who have called me that or white - oh so I was just like you can't see the ridiculousness of what your what you're saying here yeah so people just throw around these labels and I think it's a problem for a lot of reasons I think one it massively minimizes the reality of people who have actually gone through some crap or been oppressed or something like that if you start just tossing these things around if you start comparing stuff to Nazi Germany or whatever the people who genuinely went through that stuff will be like wait what are you even talking about right that's not fair number two is it just it makes it really hard to actually determine a sorta it dilutes the terms so things that should have a sting lose their sting if you're gonna just call everybody a racist you're gonna call everybody a white super Emmas you're gonna call everybody these things then it these words lose their power and then third it actually provides cover for genuine people who hold these views right like white soup he's not some big popular common thing but you know those people do still exist neo-nazis do actually exist and you're providing massive cover for them all if you're gonna just start going around and bandying out these terms what like willy nilly because now when people hear those terms if you use hero so-and-so it's called a Nazi now my default that you know ten years ago I would have been like oh really like we know what is this serious right now I mean now it's like oh do you mean like an actual Nazi or do you mean like an immediate ride wolf exactly exactly and you know it just becomes to the stage where words just lose their meanings and I don't even know I don't take these accusations even seriously anymore and a lot of people feel the same way because so many people have been called these things I mean what do you think it's gonna normalize for everyone's gonna calm down or anything it's gonna keep ramping up it's it's a good question I depend I think it depends on whether or not Donald Trump wins again I think if he wins again it might ramp up I think he will win again because it's ramping I think that people need to chill that's really that's really what it is people need to chill and not get so caught up in you know it's so weird we're living in this time where people are saying that gender is a spectrum but yet politics is binary okay so you're left you're on the left or you're on the right that's a good point that's it and it's like now most people I mean firstly most people are relatively apolitical most people are not actually that politically charged like right you know those people are busy most people most people just want to get on with their lives and not really be fucked over their taxes exact they want their schools to be good yeah yeah and they're not you know they don't want people to be discriminated no they're not right a Depot exactly they don't ride or die for the blue team a ride to die for the red team you know it's so weird when they are - yeah it is it's exhausting when you're around someone who's really political oh yeah I mean I get it if that's your your job and that's what you do and whatnot but ultimately look all these people have to live in the same town city country planet so we need a way for all of these people and all of this diversity on all levels to work and function and people don't step on each other's toes too much and everyone can do their things have their beliefs have their views and not massively encroach on other people and I think I think we'd actually work that out pretty well I want to say in like the late 90s to early 2010's stuff seemed certainly in the West like oK we've kind of kind of got it here and that's why I feel a little bit dismayed when I see some of these ideas popping up or some of this identity politics nonsense and stuff popping up over the last five to six years and people are kind of falling back into this very tribal mentality whether it's men versus women or black versus white or red vs. blue or romaine versus leave whatever it is I'm just kind of like look I look at people as individuals people I'm not gonna be running around the street trying to find how do we promote that though how do we promotion looking at people as individuals because I think that is really that that's that's one of the keys to getting out of this mess it is is to stop tribal ideological recognition and and definitions of humans just to look at people's this is Tom this is Sally this is this guy this is that girl this is this non-binary person whatever the fuck they're I think that's a lot to learn from children in that regard because I don't think kids generally don't that kids don't care kids don't care I mean where I grew up in Saudi Arabia I mean off the bat I was just surrounded by people of all different skin colors different nationalities different religions and it was just always cool some of these ideas like I'd never heard people talking about race anytime more in my life than now mmm which is really weird to me right you know in the 90s in the thousands I wasn't hearing people talking about you know white privilege this what fear white man that what and suddenly it's like you know oh let me tell you about my blackness or you know hearing terms like blackness and whiteness and I was like what you even talking about like this is this is nonsense people of color this but I can't stand that term by the way you know like just all this terminology and people are just talking in these really bizarre ways and just kind of grouping people into these weird groups and I'm just like what's the point of all this what's the get some juice out of it you know that's why for them it's worth the squeeze yeah because they get something you know they get something by appealing to fellow Europeans or by appealing to you know like the straight Pride Parade you know they got a bunch of people to fuckin parade they got together like I'm so proud of being straight like oh great you're proud of being 90 percent of the fucking population more than that Shea people are under attack like what what does that mean that is so crazy I don't know pride makes sense they I know a bunch of guys well I know at least three that are in the closet that want to come out but can't yeah they're scared yeah whether it's because of their career or because their life you know they're gay amongst their friends they let their front but they don't want to tell anybody so for them it's like a lot of conservatives right gay gay is the only thing that you can hide right like if if you're black it's obvious yeah if you're white it's obvious if you're gay no one knows yeah no one knows yeah so you can hear people say gay jokes and say none things and and you could just swallow it and like you know and you could feel terrible and you could hear pastors talk about how you're going to hell if you're gay you're like fuck and there are gay and they can't come out so for them the idea of gay pride makes sense it's a celebration it's an affirmation that it's okay to be who you are yeah that's that makes sense straight pride is fucking preposterous it's so ridiculous man every fucking most people are straight bitch what are you doing you're taking time out of your busy day and you're gonna March you gotta fly what what's is the gay pride thing is a rainbow whatever what straight people get I don't know what's the flag kind of greedy they took the whole rainbow they did they stole it from the leprechauns excreting what is the let's stop and think about that like was the straight pride flag what color would it be maybe all black are all white I don't know uh black and white I don't know hmm what is that black-and-white is a black-and-white for real there's a flag there is I said fag sorry can't avoid really this would it there's pictures on these please put already the fucking straight oh yeah that's nice Christ oh it's exactly what I thought it would be I was gonna say it'll have the mail a fucking nailed it look at that that's incredible like a meme but I don't know bro we need to get that hang one of those in the studio straight for pride flag holy shit holy shit there's a straight pride flag this place for everything you know I know god damn it that's hilarious though meanwhile the gay one they have a way better flag make America straight again oh my god oh my god it's straight dude that's why there's so many of us you fucking America is mostly straight that's why there's 320 million people oh yeah people can do what they want man the fastest I was joking thinking there's a straight pride flag and the fact that you nailed it perfectly well that's probably black and white that's another one red and pink and blue the fuck out of here with that one nah is that another one yeah oh so there's division amongst the straight pride folks they can't decide what's what it's great to be straight look at those Oh what do you get what do you get people that no one wants a fuck look at them look at them that guy's got an American flag bandana bitch you ain't Hulk Hogan you take that goddamn thing off right now better a bandana around his head stop oh well what do we do zubi keep doing keep doing what we're doing man I think discussion to answer your question I think discussion is what is needed to keep the keep the lid on the lid on the pot I think I think that's why is you know when we were talking about like deep platforming and all that kind of stuff all that stuff plays into the polarization as far as I'm concerned I agree you know it drives people underground it pushes people to radical fringes and whatnot what you want is just keep the communication channels open I mean you've only got three ways of dealing with any conflict you can talk you can segregate or you can fight you know doesn't matter if you're talking individually or countries those are the only three options so as soon as discussion breaks down or people don't want to talk or people think oh I can't talk to that person because they they voted Trump or if they voted leave or they voted liberal or they vote a Democrat or whatever as soon as that breaks down and I mean it's crazy you've seen all these stories about couples breaking up or families where the parents won't talk to the kids anymore or vice versa or people are kind of you know exiling and denouncing their own friends and family over politics and when I see stuff like that I'm like that is sad yeah it's very very sad I mean if you you can have a disagreement you can say okay I believe in this I think this I'm going to vote that way you vote that way cool but you can still be friends you can still be brothers you can still be cool like that stuff I mean if stuff is functioning correctly politics shouldn't play such a huge role in your life it should be a very much a background thing you know what I mean it's just there so one of the main characteristics and cults yeah is to separate you from anybody that disagrees it is it really is that's one of the things that they do in cults they separate you from your family it's one of the first things they do it is and that's how people end up in echo chambers people are like oh how did we not see Trump coming it's like you didn't see Trump coming because you don't talk to half the population right and if you live in these high population areas where everyone has the same sort of ideologies or shares that ideology it becomes a real problem New York in LA in particular yeah it's weird I mean it happens the two things it I guess it happens with most are politics and religion right so if you live in a place where everybody is religious and everybody is of the same faith then it's easy to sort of assume and behave in a way that everybody else in the world or outside thinks and believes the exact same things everybody you know does the same thing can happen politically if someone lives in a you know a super liberal area or a super conservatory you can just think okay well everyone everyone I know thinks this so that's what everybody thinks and a lot of people I mean I'm a musician you're a comedian we both go around respective countries to different places and you talk to different people you have this podcast you've had all kinds of people of different persuasions on here really just non-religious you know political all across the spectrum and whatever so I'd imagine that you can understand and empathize with all of the positions you've got your own views but it can be like okay I get what I get where that person is coming from or I get how that person believes that or I get that and just that level of empathy is really what is needed I think it's really just about empathy it's about being able to understand that most people most people want the world to be a better place there aren't that many people who wake up every day thinking oh I want to make the world worse I want to make my life where it's not want to make my families let most people want to make stuff better people have different ideas on what will make things better but I think as long as people sort of extend that charity to other people and don't try to consider things in the worst possible way if somebody says something whether online or offline don't try to interpret it in the worst possible way that you could or read some kind of malice into it that's not there just understand that coming from a good place you may disagree and then you can have that discussion and even if people don't change their minds you at least understand other people better I think you're entirely right and I think the idea that we can get through this world existing in echo chambers and solve anything is ridiculous yeah we have to communicate with each other absolutely you know want to talk to someone and they said how did this is a real weird conversation I had they're like how do you talk to so many different people people that you agree with and disagree with like oh well I find things that I agree with even in people that I disagree with yeah I try to find like common ground you know it's like it's an old sting song the Russians love their children too you know okay so old so funny same thought of it for whatever reason but it's theirs we all you can find things that you agree with with people you can find common ground yeah morals and ethics and kindness and communication compassion and camaraderie and friendship and we work out from there and try to figure out why does someone have these politically polarizing views why does someone have this idea about that or this and let's figure out what the fuck the middle ground is and you know and was a big part of it man yeah you know and the more people restricting people and the more people are trying to enforce their ideology on other people the more the other side's gonna dig their heels in and then you get this this stance that we're at today yeah yeah I mean one of my things I mean like I myself you know I believe in God I'm a Christian always have been and one thing I often say is I think you know if you're taking something like religion I always say like look if someone says I can't do such-and-such because it's against my religion that's totally cool if you start saying you can't do such-and-such because it's against my religion right that's when that line gets crossed right when you start trying to force things down other people's throats and try to you know try and change all that so and I think that's something that you know not everyone is not everybody is there yet but I think most people sort of implicitly understand that you know okay cool like everyone people can have all their different their different beliefs their different ideas or lack of belief or whatever the case is but as long as you're not trying to force stuff from other people you know people don't like being forced to people generally don't like being forced to do things or to believe things were being being punished for what they what they think or what they believe in whatever so when you wherever that comes from I think if you start having that whether it's from a government or an individual or whatever that's when people are really gonna clash and collide and there seems to be there seem to be a lot of people right now who don't really get like that it's you know think like us think like me or we will punish you yeah and that's not primarily coming in the West anyway that's not generally coming from religious people now I'm not seeing it's more of a political thing you know like we were talking about some of these some of this weird intersectional far-left kind of stuff that's very much what they're doing now even when you're talking about them ostracizing people or Kant trying to cancel people or whatever it's very much like look this is what we think there's what we believe anyone who doesn't if you're not with us you're against us and we're gonna attack you we're gonna verbally demonize you we're gonna deep platform you we're gonna do all this and I'm like look that's that's a problem you can be claiming to be tolerant then you're treating people that way and you're talking about people that way all that's gonna do is keep raising the temperature well it's a temperature down yeah well said it's very very important what you just said the way said I mean it and there's also a tremendous amount of unhealthy people unhealthy emotionally unhealthy physically unhealthy in terms of their perspective and their their ability to be objective about the world they live in and to be introspective about their own Fallin failings and shortcomings and just treat people well I think if we all went through this life with that as our directive let's treat people well I'm gonna treat people well and be nice to people try to be friendly as much as possible and try to do my best yeah you know do you know who Don Miguel Ruiz is I do for agreements I think there's like five agreements now I don't think so see if you pull up what the four agreements are it's be impeccable with your word always do your best why can I not remember them see it pull it pull them out please you got it here we go yeah there we go the impeccable with you were don't take anything personally don't make assumptions that's three that's three where's the rest of them oh that's hilarious but there's more than that be impeccable with your word don't take it anything personally don't make assumptions always do your best though always do your best is missing from that for whatever reason that's hilarious so that they oh it was only three but that's Wikipedia get the fuck out of Wikipedia go to that four agreements the website right there BAM okay here you this is it's a really good book okay and it's very interesting because it's very simple and they added a fifth one C be impeccable with your word don't take anything personally don't make assumptions always do your best but just those being peccable with your word very important right yeah say what you mean mean what you say and if you fuck up be honest yeah yeah don't take anything personally that's very important and I've worked very hard to develop that in myself that whether people saying things about me or whether it's something that goes wrong or someone fucked me over I try to take a deep breath and I try to forgive them yeah I really do I work hard at it yeah don't make assumptions that's another one don't make assumptions it's not there's no value in that and always doing your best man you can't go wrong if you always do your best it's one of the best things anybody could say in life and I think the other one he's got a new one is be skeptical but be open to do information I think that's what it is be skeptical but learn to listen they're just yeah these are great so he added one cuz he realized yeah man I need another agreement that's a really good a very simple book that's not a super complicated book but those tenants ways to live by I mean that is a great way for people especially people that are secular that don't believe in religion like that is a good structure and I think that one of the things that religious people have an advantage in is that they do have a moral and ethical structure to absolutely live their life by and if you live your life by that look when I was young I used to think there was something wrong with it I always think well it's all fairy tales and nonsense why would you believe in that and then as I got older I realized well no no if you just follow the tenets of it like that's a great ethical moral structure to live your life by yeah and I think there's great benefit in people and there's a lot of people that find tremendous benefit in living life with you know guidelines yeah guidelines on how to be kind I mean as a Christian I mean if you if you try to somewhat live your life like Jesus it's hard to go wrong you go wrong yeah I mean even if someone doesn't believe in I would tell people I'm like look regardless of what you believe you can't say that that guy is a bad example of a role model but no one says Jesus was a dick yeah help help people Jesus was a dick you know as someone who's been listening to your podcast for a long time actually that's something that's I what you just said is something that I've noticed a change in actually over the years you know going back and listening to some of some of the older ones where I think you were a lot more how would I put it not aggressive but a lot less of say like religion and religious viewpoints yeah guilty as charged yeah yeah and I think more recent you know more recently over the years it's been like okay I can I can get where that's coming from and and what the value is and what not well I can see a great benefit from this podcast yeah I know other people benefit from it but I've experienced a great benefit and that I've been exposed to a lot of different points of view different personalities different intellects and different brilliant human beings that have very different ideologies and I've met brilliant people that I love and respect that have polar opposite ideas on how the world works yeah on both sides I mean it's and through that I've developed a sort of an understanding of the various mechanisms that are at play with why people believe what they believe and how they benefit from believing that and what's the pros and cons and then I've just sort of opened my mind up much more to various viewpoints financial viewpoints political viewpoints and I've developed a much greater appreciation for the variety of opinions and ideas yeah yeah yeah I know this baby has been awesome to see like I've noticed it myself and been like ah that's that's cool I realized how dumb I am about I mean if I had lived my life like I'm being honest if I had live my life without doing this podcast I would probably be a far more ignorant person right now in the same place I feel like I've gotten not just great conversations and met great people like yourself and had a great time but also I've been very privileged to have a tremendous education yeah through all these people and for for many of their books and and right after you right now and the other grass Tysons coming on that's also I'm fucking pumped meet him he's in the green room oh yeah awesome so it's like having these incredible people to share their knowledge and a lifetime of learning you know they can fill in blanks and educate you and point you in the right direction and also you can see the way their mind works and then there's guys like you know like David Goggins oh yeah who just he realized like oh okay there's levels to everything this fucking dude you know he will he will make you realize that you have more in the tank you know he will make you realize you can do more you can push more he fucking sends me text messages all the time like he's sent in one yesterday and they just come out of the blue and like there's no rhyme or reason there's nothing going on no need to respond hope all's well brother continue to live in the grip of life as you know nothing gets done by being a bitch stay hard brother and I get on my fucking hands tight sweat I'm not a bitch I'm gonna run fucking left what's crazy dudes like I said I mean it's all about potential man and I I love and I'm drawn to anybody who promotes potential and being and becoming your best I think that's part of why what you do here has been so successful in so inspirational to people all over the world because you promote that you promote being being your best you can be better you can be smarter you can learn more you can be stronger you can be wiser all of that it's the same thing with them guys like Jordan Peterson I think so much of his success is it's like look you've got this potential you can you can do this man you know and that's the same message I've always tried to put out through my music and everything that I do I want to inspire people I want to motivate people so and I think it's so necessary right now is so necessary people are just floundering or spinning their wheels and just directionless and it's kind of it's sad to see and it's just like you know we can all do so much more it is sad to see but there's also a light at the end of the tunnel because there's people like you out there there's there's people that are searching to improve themselves and they're honest about where they are right now and they're honest about their failings and shortcomings and they're also telling other people about it which i think is so important because if someone sees you and you know you're a guy who's on the radio or television or maybe you're a rap star and you're killing it you're killing it they assume all this guy's just he just is there he's just a winner he's just there and then you know you could tell people about your trials and tribulations about your failings and shortcomings about your thoughts and insecurities about all the things that tripped you up and all the things that you learn that allowed you to advance and to be a better person yeah that's what it's all about like all the time every day it's about learning how to be a better person and there's no finish line doesn't mean even the fucking Dalai Lama pay attention but he got cancelled recently and you know the Dalai Lama oh yeah I said some slightly section 80 year old man who was picked to be the Dalai Lama was gonna be a female they need to attract him no one wants to no one wants to look at an ugly faces ugly face like dude he's an 80 year old human being that's what he is and he's also a guy with he's never had a real job he's never had to perform and I mean there's there's a lot of people up there that can do better and they know they can do better and they just lack the tools and they lack the understanding and I think a person like yourself or hopefully me and then certainly a lot of the people that I've had on the podcast they can give people an example yeah and they can say oh this guy used to be a loser and he figured out how to not be I can do like you look at Goggins used to be 300 pounds of fat and eatin milkshakes and then it becomes as fucking maniac who runs 100 mile races day after day you know you you can do something extraordinary with your life and you don't have to be the guy who pushes himself physically to you're almost dead and you don't have to be the guy that writes the most books you mean yeah but you could find your thing whatever your thing is whether it's just being a better father or a husband or a friend or a bit better at your job or better at your craft whatever it is man we can all be better you can all be better and that's how you make society better world better right that's it to be your good man thank you sir thank you so much man and everybody
