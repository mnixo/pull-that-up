hello freak bitches isn't it amazing that I mean that we even have what's legal and what's not legal I mean what does that mean wrote it down on paper we all agreed I mean think about the shit that isn't isn't legal and what the fact of war is on that list at all I like laws do you yeah like what ones did you can't beat the shit out of machine can't come into my house and take my stuff what am I going to do what am I honestly going to do about it I was thinking about that when I was watching the UFC this past weekend I was watching this uh frightful beating that Alexander Gustafsson put on Glover Teixeira and it was just a ruthless knockout just fucking vicious beat down and then eventually stopped him and I was thinking it's kind of crazy that these guys agree to do this they agreed to do this everybody signs away and then you go do something that anywhere else in the world you would get locked there get arrested that happens in hockey every once in a while where somebody goes too far and then the government gets involved really yeah like what do they do if you hit somebody in the head with a stick that goes outside the boundaries of setting the tone that seems like a pussy move though hit it with a stick you're supposed to punish bug it's so weird when you got this stick in your hand you know it's just the shit that you sometimes think of doing it I like their each other in the balls they fucking whack at the bet like there's no padding behind your legs and smash and I just taken a wood stick it just uh with NHL level strength and just given someone a two hander the back leg they break people stink across women's took somebody's finger off this year if they get too far look if it gets really if they just open the rules up a little bit you know it's going to happen they going to bring in figure skaters they're going to teach them Taekwondo I'm going to cut people's fucking heads off of this case well dude you're definitely okay man if you ever learned how to skate you'd be fucking dangerous if you ever did that with skates on that would be it that's what I'm saying if you teach that to somebody teach that to somebody with skates I mean if you could hit someone with a hockey stick why can't you hit them escape we're working on the line you can't hit him with it's like they do it somebody does it to you now they slash and they do stuff like that you can't Club somebody over them and even slashing so okay I'll just slash your leg out what would you rather have would you rather take a get hit by a piece of wood and you know and have a bruise there or have somebody slash you with this skate I would absolutely rather get hit by the piece of wood but I shouldn't get hit by the piece of wood I don't I don't play hockey but if I did play hockey I'd be pretty pissed if somebody hit me with a stick I do like you fucking pussy and I'd want to hit would be like the second coming of tide oh me your exact same build he's a fucking guy who somehow was like my height and was considered a heavyweight fighter and he's the guy according to him he came up with the grab him by right right underneath your collar and then turn all the way sideways because he didn't have the reach advantage and then he would he would wait for them to throw he duck under and then come over the top and dude I I met him one time great fucking guy and he he's got legs has like your hands you know your hands you make like that it turns into a hammer it's the same thing he has like these inexplicable like bare fucking paws and I might be a little taller than him what and I remember when he tried to show me when he grabbed the front of my shirt to show me like I literally felt like an adrenaline rush back I hope this guy doesn't snap now he's one of the like he's one of the toughest guys that ever ever played there's some girls in Portland that are taking a rash of shit because they're selling burritos and they're white they made a burrito truck and people are going crazy trying to shut them down shot damp down because they're not Mexican and I'm selling burrito like they're not you know they're not pretending they're not like putting shoe polish on and pretending and not putting brown face on they're just fucking selling burritos like it's so crazy now you said there did is critics saying that clothes white women's Portland burrito stand for cultural theft what the fuck man they're burritos the assholes Mexicans don't even eat burritos yes they do clearly when you had a message out how did you eat burritos I've eaten burritos in DL Mexican food yes come on I have had a real chicken burrito in Mexico it was quite delicious I love Mexico I just don't understand why anybody thinks that there's something wrong with learning a style of cooking it's like I think if you have cultural appropriation if you have like a person who's pretending they're from Laos and they start talking with the fake accent and you know and you go hey man you're from fucking Cleveland you're not even you know you have Laos descent like you do it 23andme on you and you find out like your family's from Finland like the fuck is wrong with you like but there are people that do that and that is crazy right but that's just deceptive this is not deceptive to someone who likes making burritos they're making burritos and then these goofy white kids are fucking closing them down and that's what it is the cultural appropriation heroes shouting out from the rooftop that you're wrong right you're right it's like you said we're just always looking for who to blame who to be mad at who to make sort of the the persecutor of our South's wrongness it's that same issue Wow we premiered last night and it will air this Sunday and Jim Carrey said some amazing things man yeah that's our cast photo that one that you click that one yeah did it feel weird to be on that I mean it must have been like I can tell you from the bottom of my honest heart it was the most important thing I've done so far Wow dude I mean we were paying homage to the world that that we love and respect so much and it was a big effort on Jim's part in his producing partner Michael Aguilar to like tell real stories a lot of stories that people will see if you watch the show and I hope you do come from Jim's real life to dudes from Boston move they live in a fucking dudes claws in West Hollywood and they used to be a guy that would jerk off and watch Jim change nothing Jim put that story in the show man he wanted all these little great kid but there's a great moment about joke stealing in there and a fucking huge fist fight that breaks out that was real from Jim's personal life about guys used to come in from the fucking radio from talk radio in them you know in the morning they come to the club at night come to the store steal shit the next morning comics would fucking hear it yeah that's a real common thing and that was always going on you know what else was going on a big one was writers for sitcoms would come yep same shit and they would watch people do sets and then they would wind up putting their their bits in like even in fucking Seinfeld Ken why Kevin James signature bits got used on Seinfeld after he had a bunch of meetings and then they came to see him perform a bunch of like top writers came to see him perform in an NBC showcase it was like when Kevin was getting a development deal and they came down and watched him and then like the next season his muffin bit was on a Seinfeld yeah it was like what the fuck man well nowadays they fucking they're blatant they tell you like I I tested for Saturday Night Live and you sign a form that says these characters can be used after the audition whoa and this is crazy I'm not calling out anybody or saying anything but they did there was a character ended up on the show that Vanessa Bayer did fucking hilariously that I did something similar in my audition I was like damn that was really good to me so you Q auditioned you have a character your audition with yeah I did this character this fake they can or seal that they own that now yes you are dish when you audition you surrender the character thank you man yeah you sign a piece of paper that's crazy they're not even giving you money and they're stealing your idea they do yeah when you get that that's the respect that SNL has earned them in my community you you don't you don't have that respect it's crazy that's stealing your stealing well I signed the form man oh my god dude that's so awful I joined that GI because in America you can almost taste it you know they're making you sign something saying we're going to steal from you totally so there was a instance where a faculty member accused those that were challenging any of these equity proposals as being part of a racist backlash and she was clearly talking about me because I'm the most the most prominent person objectives faculty member a white person No so anyway she says in a faculty meeting that this is a racist backlash and I said to her in front of this faculty meeting I said somebody might want to check on the question of whether or not I'm actually a racist because if you do check on it you will discover I'm not and if you don't this is going to blow up on you and the chair of the faculty told me that the faculty meeting was not the place to defend myself against accusations of racism I said to her that's fine where is oh not the place to lovely yeah right to level the accusations but I said where is the place and then the faculty member who had made the accusations said you should not expect there to be a venue in which to defend yourself you should just get used to these accusations separate case I was quiet who said that why Kyra it's the same faculty member who made the accusation wait a minute the person said that you should just accept these untrue accusations yes yeah it was your reaction to that that this is not a place for you to defend yourself against racist accusations this is a place for you to just eat shit right you just have to accept you values on a separate occasion we were also told that that to question an allegation of racism is racist oh so convenient around that one to question an accusation of racism is racist I we have an obligation to believe I know [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
