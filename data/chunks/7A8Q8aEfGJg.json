four three two one yes my quest we are live finally are you ready I am ready let's do it do you're getting a lot of heat online from all these it's all the Flat Earth people and the chemtrail people those are the people that are mad at you the most yeah that's my specialty chemtrails and flooded us yeah well that's I ask people just this is hilarious I asked people online I said my quest for meta bunk is gonna be here what would you like me to debunk and one of the first ones was chemtrails because you cannot debunk it it's real dun-dun-duh I would I would say this to anybody who thinks that that has got to be the most ineffective government program of all time like you ask people what they're doing by smearing things in the sky and the number one thing they'll say is like weather control weather controls one well they don't have any fucking control the weather because if they did they make it rain all over Santa Barbara and stop these fires yeah I mean there's hundreds of millions of dollars where the damage going on right now there's a fire that's bigger than the city of Washington DC they think they're making this fires they think that that's part of the conspiracy anything that happens is always part of the conspiracy what do you think it is like what is what is it with conspiracies like why are they so attractive to people there's something going on with people right yeah I think yeah I've been looking into this a lot and you have especially since your government show well I'm doing research with a book I'm writing every school escaping the rabbit hole and it's about how people get into the rabbit hole and how people get out of the rabbit hole so the whole thing is about the rabbit hole which is something basically people get sucked into and I think people do a lot of research into the reasons behind people getting into conspiracy theories like the psychological reasons and the personality reasons and things like that but I think most conspiracy theorists are just regular people they're just ordinary people who get sucked into something and why do you think that is just from talking to them they tell me like they're their origin stories the origin story is essentially and they tell me what happened to them when they got into conspiracy theories and it nearly always starts with them looking at some video and now now yes it starts with them looking at some video and then they just get sucked in yeah and then they start looking at another video in another video in another video and Facebook and YouTube is feeding them these videos because once you start going down that road you just can't you can't change your trajectory right it's it's hard to train in YouTube what since they instigated this autoplay thing or instituted this autoplay thing or the next video plays immediately and they're all related yeah I think that's definitely been a thing with people and also like the suggestions on the right hand side if you're watching one video on particular subject yeah I was doing some experiments with that I said of like a completely blank YouTube account and our just go in there and type in one thing like contrails mm-hmm and of course when you look at contrails on YouTube like half the videos you can get it going to be chemtrail videos right and so if the first video you click on is a chemtrail video then they just set you down that road well I remember this was in the days I think before YouTube this is in the days when maybe YouTube was around but it just wasn't that popular I remember me and my friend Eddie were high as fuck and we're talking to my neighbor and there was some plane that was flying over and we were wondering why the clouds coming from behind this plane stood so long so I asked him I said this neighbor I just call him bling-bling cuz bling-bling was incapable of talking about anything other than objects like all we talked about that was nice cars out a new car where'd you get that watch like that was bling bling all bling-bling wanted to talk about is like material possessions so so he were parked in front of his I was saying hide woman and I said hey man do you remember clouds look stick it around in the sky not long and he's like no I don't know is that a new truck I'm like remember how ironic it was cuz I had told Eddie about bling-bling you know they're like this is all this guy cares about and wants to talk about and then he did that while we're out there but I remember thinking man how weird would it be if all the sudden clouds from jet engines started appearing and it just appeared right before our eyes and we hadn't noticed it but I wasn't sold it didn't make any sense to me because my thought on it was the amount of people that had to be involved you're talking about all these different airplanes get all these people to keep their mouths shut these are their pilots right so no they're not making shit tons of money and they live here too that's the other thing like if there's actually spraying something in the sky mm-hm they live here too like what do they spray in themselves well the ferry now is that it's basically the power elite in the country is doing these chemtrails as a kind of latched last-ditch attempt to maintain power before the entire world collapses into chaos so they think it's kind of like a desperate situation a power grab mmm exactly it's is that they're hanging on to have their kind of last hurrah really the they feel like the end of the world is nigh like you know there's about to be this environmental disaster and the chemtrails are the only thing that is holding everything together that's the thing that you get if you go to like you know geo and geoengineering watch that Dane Wigington go mm-hmm he he's basically a an apocalyptic prophet now he's basically preaching about how everything is going to end soon and the the chemtrails are the only thing that's stopping it they're also making it worse so he's kind of saying like you know the chemtrails are helping but we got to stop them otherwise they'll make it even worse but we're pretty much all gonna die either way yeah there's a lot of money and we're gonna die there's a lot of people that love that that that trope it's just like something that gets carted out constantly throughout history because it's true you are going to die it's like when are you gonna die you don't know so because you don't know you're freaking out like is it gonna be a car accident is it gonna be a fire it's gonna be an earthquake it's gonna be a slow aging death or is it gonna be the chemtrails taint don't down yeah I think that type of thing like fear of dying is one of those fundamental things right so you know every human is hardwired with certain things that they're they that happens in their brain without them thinking about and fear of dying and fear of other things fear of leena life mmm fear of wolves or whatever something is hardwired and that's the tie the thing that leads to different types of thinking that you know you end up being a conspiracy theorist in part because your brain is is wired that way you had a great quote about chemtrails when we did that television show together you said chemtrails are like the training wheels for conspiracy theorists yeah because they're like they're they're right above your head and you just like you see them right there for people don't understand why jets produce clouds please explain that because it's very simple it is very simple jet engines have water water in their exhaust if you look at a car on a cold day and you see the exhaust coming out the tailpipe you'll see like a cloud of condensation sometimes and you'll see some water coming out and when the exact same thing happens with jet engines and when that exhaust hits the cold air it condenses it freezes it makes a cloud and contrails are essentially clouds they're exactly the same physically as a regular cirrus cloud and it's dependent upon the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and you can actually monitor it online NASA actually has a website that will show you and I believe it's set up for pilots right is that what the air traffic people NASA actually has a contrail forecasting site right isn't really for anything it's just part of that control research but yeah they have a site where it all projects like well contrails are gonna be but you can do it yourself you just go look up the relative humidity at a certain altitude there's lots of different sites you can go to I've got a whole bunch of them listed on that a bunk and just like the clouds vary in the sky or the amount of moisture varies as well which is one of the reasons why you will see a jet pass through one area and you'll see a contrail and then it almost looks like they shut the the contrail jets off and then you see it pick up maybe a couple hundred yards later yeah and that's you say like a cloud is really exactly the same as a cloud if you look at any picture of a cloudy day and then just remove all the clouds but they're still there as invisible clouds then when the plane comes along it's almost like the plane is this magic pen revealing these invisible clouds because all the cloud is is a region of the sky where the humidity is above level so you know that the humidity is pretty patchy across the sky cause like there's a cloud here and right next to it there's no cloud so where the cloud is it's high humidity where the cloud isn't it's low humidity but if both of those were just lowered like 10% then you get no clouds at all then a plane comes along it raises the humidity in the cloud area and in the known cloud area but this area because it was a bit higher you get a trail forming in this area getting a trail forming so it's exactly the same as invisible clouds yeah and for people that are watching in your looking up you think they're spraying something if you're conspiracy minded and because of a lot of the videos that are out there a particular two that were recommended to me are what in the hell are they spraying right so I got to meet with that guy that made those documentaries and right away I knew something was wrong like he's either on adderall or something he's just like real real edgy and speeded up and just just an odd guy which is like a lot of people that are conspiracy conspiratorial II minded they seem to be like very they're nervous and agitated and and when we went over like why he think one of the things that was talking about was the soil samples and water samples and that they've detected all this aluminum and barium in water and particularly aluminum and he's like showing me all these results that he had but even on the very results that he showed me it said sludge like he had sent them out for testing and I said well what did you send in his egos well I sent some water from these you know ponds and I said but it says sludge on your testing and he said nobody was water I go okay but the lab said it's sludge I go what is sludge she goes water I don't know what sludge is exactly I go well let's look sludge is a combination of water and dirt okay so you sent water and dirt so do you know that aluminum is one of the most common metals on earth and you could basically scoop up a patch of dirt pretty much anywhere and find a bunch of aluminum in it it's really really common in trace amounts I go so what you did is you tested dirt and it tested positive for being dirt musically that's exactly what it is and the guy was kind of freaking out I'm like how did you how did you not put this together yourself like if you're the guy who's making this video and you're trying to find a reason why you could you know some facts that you could throw at people we could say hey look the government is definitely spraying things in the sky they're spraying aluminum look we found the aluminum and we found it in the water it's in your water supply it's gonna get in your body it's gonna poison you look we found in the water how did he how the fuck did he not look at it himself is what I was thinking and me when me and him were having this conversation I realize like you have these people that go down us they're not open-minded in regards to these subjects they go down a very narrow road and that road is the government is doing something to me I need to find out what it is yeah and they're really motivated to actually find evidence yes so that they're trying to find something and you know actually trying to find an alternative explanation isn't really that attractive to them so they find aluminum in the water or in the soil or whatever and then they glom onto that as being you know evidence of geoengineering and that's great for them because they can just find loads and loads of samples of soil and that's something that gets repeated online that very fact over and over again the aluminum that they found in the water it's one of like the core tenets it's not one of the pillars of the chemtrail thing there's a there's like four or five different things like in every conspiracy theory there are these core beliefs right that the 99% of the people who believe in the theory one core belief is that you work for the government yeah that is a core belief nick is a retired video game creator you could find that out made video games right Tony Hawk yeah made shit ton of money and decided to to debunk dorks yeah I didn't it didn't start out and I wouldn't refer to them as dork but yeah they're dorks if they don't believe this is the problem you're not a dork if you fall for something you're a dork if you fall for something you don't believe the science that shows that it's impossible but it's not real that if you are spraying aluminum in the sky folks it would look like aluminum you dummy it wouldn't look like a cloud it wouldn't dissipate it would look like a thin mist essentially yeah and metal is not it's heavier than fucking air and vapor it's not it's not gonna just sit up there like that it would it would be a very different experience if it's slowly settled to the ground and wouldn't look like a cloud and there's no reason to do it there's no benefit whatsoever there's no scientific evidence but ever uncovered ever that there's any benefit for anybody of spraying aluminum over people it's just it's just it's a waste of alumina thing even with the the whole geoengineering field it's really no solid evidence that it will work we don't know what the side effects will be we don't know how much we're gonna we would need to spray and we don't know like you know if if you know when we stop doing it will the world bounce back in a terrible way and it'll be a big disaster well that's an interesting thing because one of the reasons why contrails are interesting to study is because they actually do have an effect on the temperature of the earth and this is something that we found out after 9/11 when September 11th happened in 2001 it was the the big disaster there was a shutdown on all flights in the United States and when they did that the temperature changed yeah because there's clouds literally do provide like a cover and is it does do they act as an insulator or an escalator they essentially act as an insulator they block radiation incoming radiation during the day and they block outgoing radiation at night that the net effect is that they actually block more outgoing radiation than they do incoming radiation hmm so if planes didn't fly at night then you would you would cool the earth dam hmm you'd have to stop flying you know quite a bit before nighttime so if all the flights in the world were between like 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. local time then you could actually cool the world down by just not having any flights at night because if the night flights that have this really big kind of blanketing effect that stop the outgoing radiation so the night of flights actually heat the world up yes they do they act like a like a blanket hmm you know how it's it's warmer on a well in a cloudy day like he doesn't get his cold at night here deserts get really cold at night because there's nothing over them they don't have any any cover well it's one of the reasons but yeah they the contrails will actually warm the planet because the the amount of outgoing radiation they block is just way high I just go to the wavelengths and the size of the particles and whatnot so that that's something to be concerned about that's something that people are legitimately monitoring what people need to understand is just because you feel like when you look up in the sky see this crisscross patterns that they're spraying you mm-hmm no-one's spraying you know this is just a natural reaction to jet engines and condensation in the atmosphere and the heat and the moisture of the jet engine that's all it is their it they are actually talking about a way of using contrails for a kind of geoengineering and this is something that people often get confused about because you you see these two words together contrails and geoengineering and they think oh that's chemtrails but what they're trying to do is use air traffic control and computers and weather forecasting to make it so the planes don't fly through the contrail forming areas when they would make contrails at night and make it so they do fly through contrail forming areas what do you make with my controls during the day so this is a conversation they're having or something that's actually being it's not something that they're they've actually done right it's something that they can research fairly easily so if they were considering trying to heat up the atmosphere heat up the earth at night they would just fly over these moisture rich areas and if they weren't they would avoid them yeah but the goal obviously is to combat like climate change global warming right and cool the earth down so the a relatively cheap way of doing that to a degree is to have these planes be controlled by computers and it increases fuel costs for the airline by about two or three percent because they had to make very deviations sometimes in height and sometimes in direction but it could actually have a significant effect on the Earth's climate if we had the entire world's airline fleets all in this program where they would fly making contrails where they were needed and not making controls where they were not needed and how exactly they're monitoring the moisture content in the atmosphere like what are they using to do that satellites yeah it's a combination of things the sounding balloons which of these weather balloons basically which mistaken for UFOs quite a lot and they used satellites and they use planes sensing the environment when they're flying through it and they use all these inputs and it goes into a big computer model which basically predicts where what their what the humidity will be at any particular point it's basically a big weather forecast for the upper atmosphere now Jamie Google CIA admits geoengineering because this is one that this does chemtrail believers constantly bring up it was a conversation that some guy in the CIA had at some meeting where they were discussing potential future ways to use geoengineering like let's play with this guy's has CI director John Brennan collectively as geoengineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or s AI a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat and much the same way that volcanic eruptions do an essay I program could limit global temperature increases reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the wires that gonna me freaking out with the image keep changing back to so YouTube glitch I have to refresh the page I didn't want to restart oh this guy have epilepsy yeah burek go ahead just take it from where he left it and here whatever what else he has to say it's all injection or s AI a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do an essay I program could limit global temperature increases reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels this process is also relatively inexpensive the national research Research Council estimates that a fully deployed si I program would cost about ten billion dollars yearly as promising as it may be moving forward on si I would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community on the technical side greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany s AI to address other climate change effects such as ocean acidification because si I alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on the geopolitical side the technologies potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations others might seize on si eyes benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions and as with other breakthrough technologies global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation of Si I we get it so this guy is talking about an idea of spraying things in the atmosphere to do something yeah he's talking about geoengineering spraying stuff from planes was talking about he's talking about reflective particles right isn't it yeah the you spray sulfur dioxide which isn't exactly a reflective particle but it acts as a I can youkilis for upper atmosphere clouds and things like that it's basically like he said the same thing of volcano does when one of volcano erupts it spews a whole bunch of sulfur dioxide and various other things into the upper atmosphere and that creates haze basically which which blocks the incoming radiation and cools things down every time a big volcano goes off you see a little dip in the earth's temperature because of this this blocking effect right and so the theory is that you could do something similar and you could do both spraying things out of planes but he's talking about things that we might do in the future you see every every uses the future tense like we could do this in mind they may do this the effects might be this and he's talking about the possible geopolitical impacts of it which are very significant like if one country is going to be spraying something would cause the Satan monsoons to double in intensity or to half in intensity in India that could cause the deaths of millions of people from famine and flooding and this is what people think has happened with the big hurricanes in the United States they do think that yeah there's no evidence of that actually happening at the pattern of hurricanes is pretty much the same as it's been for a long time when you look at the statistical variations there's you know maybe a bit more intense because the oceans are a bit warmer but it's not you know people think that hurricanes have been steered yeah yeah through half but yeah that doesn't make any sense but there is there are ways that do make sense which are cloud seeding they keep you do lots of seeding of the hurricane on one side you could perhaps like reduce the amount of humidity a moisture on that side and so it looking a little bit more and move over to one side so there are ways that you might work and they did actually experiment with this I think back in the 70s or so there was one experiment where they tried seeding a hurricane but he ended up going somewhere else other than weather where they intended it and it destroyed a whole bunch of houses the problem with having a video like this is that this guy is admitting that they have looked into potentially spraying things no one has ever denied that we've been looking into geoengineering for decades it's been proposed like in in in some sense for over a hundred years the other problem serious and since the 70s the other problem is he cave it he gave it initials s AI that's a problem people love initials they love it is super excited not even but most people use the SRM which is the solar radiation management that's good one - yeah SR and si I CIA DEA Jake aerosol injection yeah but it would have to be studies and recipes there are there are lots of studies going on right now though people are studying geoengineering there actually lots of people who specialized in to your engineering well I was gonna say is they'll studies would have to be available for people to understand but nobody wants to do that nobody wants to go and you wanted to look up and see the thing behind the jet and go they started it they're spraying this patchwork look this haze all over us which it does happen you could have a clear sky and you have the right conditions in a bunch of jets flyover and also it's very hazy it does it doesn't that's the type of thing that's being reported since the second world war written even earlier the first contrails that were spreading out into clouds were reported in like the 1920s yeah why I took some of these photos and I put them up I think the last time we had this conversation where you could see him from World War two these jets and you see the contrails behind the Jets and the but some people that's the other thing it's like contrails dissipate but chemtrails stay well that's not you misunderstand what happens yeah the contrails stay if there's more moisture you know if the conditions are correct they stay and if the conditions are barely enough to make a contrail they dissipate fairly rapidly with that thing they kind of use circular logic if you ask them why do you think that contrails dissipate in chemtrails stay and say because I can see it if you look up you look at the chemtrails and they're staying and the contrails are dissipating is that how do you know which is which well the contrails are the ones that dissipate yeah so they they don't have any basis for their belief and yeah the one thing I do which you've probably seen is that video where I go through all my old books on on the weather and I look up and each one of them the section on contrails and I read the bit in it that says like contrails persist for hours sometimes a contrails sometimes spread out to cover the sky contrails light lasts a long time and I go back from these books from the 1990s all the way back to the 1950s and I've got books in the 1940s and if you show people these actual books it's a really powerful way of like getting through to them because they're just assumed the contrails can't persist right and they've assumed that this is a recent phenomenon because they don't remember it weren't paying attention yeah well the people don't notice them until ninety percent of the people don't notice contrails until they hear about the chemtrail Jerzy theory a lot of people they will hear about it and then the same day they will go outside and look at the sky and then that's the first time they've ever noticed these contrails even the people who like me and they're high ups in the in that they're in the the chemtrail movement they only notice them when they hear about the theory there's a guy I can't remember his name now but he lives in San Diego and he never noticed them until like 2014 and he lived there all his life and now he's publishing scientific papers J Marvin Herndon is his name he's publishing these scientific papers about how the spraying coal ash and I'd the waste products of you know burning coal in power stations for spraying that in the upper atmosphere he's actually got like three or four papers published in these kind of pay to publish scientific journals and that's kind of becoming a bit of a problem like like this this thing with Brennan the CAA guy people bring that up all the time all the time all the time I mean you just have to explain it to them again he's talking about the future use and then this guy is talking about possible solutions for for global warming yeah now the problem with it is when he's talking about possible solutions and then people look up and they see these actual clouds that are created by jets they assumed this is already begun that the government would not tell us about it right that's because they don't understand contrails the difference between contrails and what this stuff would look like yeah yeah and just the fact that contrails look like this they've heard that contrails shouldn't persist well what's another thing that drove me crazy is like if you really want to worry about health consequences of these things that you see in the sky there's there's a reality to it and the reality is they're burning jet fuel oh yeah and all the people that live around the airports get sick like it's there's there's high levels of respiratory illness that are associated with living within a certain distance of airplanes or airports if you are in a congested hub like LAX don't buy a house yeah like a block away it's not good for your health they're burning jet fuel that's gonna get in the air pollution lets pollution from cars yeah but it's even more intense because there have been thousands and thousands of giant planes mmm even lay small airports like santa monica they have problems with that like if you look at the houses just at the end of santa monica runway which is right next to the end of the runway there's these houses they did tests were freely various metal particulates and stuff and the ones right by the end of the runway you know they get the air pollution of course it's very real problems that's the real problem you know and that's a real one now imagine if that was something that the government was engineering if they really were engineering spraying things to give people respiratory illness so that the hospital industry could profit and whatever the reason was right that would be you know something that people could be concerned with like look there's a real connection between airplanes and illnesses but it's not spraying stuff in the sky that's not real i understand people love these things and i understand people don't trust the government those things completely make sense to me but you got to pay attention to what's real and what's not real because as soon as you don't do that then all the real stuff that the government does all the real stuff the government does like these fucking roads they're gonna build in alaska right now through dangerous areas where they have salmon rivers but they're gonna they're gonna start doing mining i think what is the Pebble Beach is that the no what is the the big mining issue in Alaska that is going on right now still Bay Bristol Bay that's it why don't people in Bristol I don't know how I got those two confused I don't mine Pebble Mine it that's what it is and they want they want to do this and it's near a major salmon area where these salmon use this river and they're people that live there terrified that they're gonna do this this is a real for-profit thing where they're putting the environment at risk that's real so this is something that people should be concerned about but they're not they don't get concerned about those kind of things you know environmentalists do and you know conservationists do but the conspiracy theorists don't they don't look at that and go hey here's clear evidence of the the government being in bed with enormous business that stand a prophet spectacular amounts of money from risking the environment and risking these very delicate salmon fisheries yeah that type of thing is the exact reason why I still spend so much time debunking stuff like conspiracy theories because I think that so much of conspiracy theories the results of confident the effect of conspiracy theories is distracting people from real issues from real issue yeah yes I agree like if you like you say with the the airplane stuff like if people are thinking that spraying chemicals out of the butt of the air like at the airplanes that is not going to be worried about regular pollution and if they think that they're controlling the climate already they're not going to worry about but yeah any type of global warming so let's find one that we disagree on yeah I think you believe the official story of the JFK assassination do you more or less yeah more or less yes my belief and this is this changes over time I think that Lee Harvey Oswald was in on it I think he was a part of it but I think there were multiple people that were in on it that's what I believe do you think that multiple shooters yes and one of the reasons why I believe that is because the formation of the single Bullet theory and the single Bullet theory was formed because the fact that they had to account for one bullet that hit the underpass ricocheted off and puts a man in the hospital and that before that they did not have an explanation for why all of these bullets bullet holes all these wounds were in all these different people's bodies the other reason why I'm inclined to believe there's a conspiracy was the fact that they found that bullet on Connolly's gurney when they brought him into the hospital it's too convenient and the bullet itself is fairly pristine now knowing as much as I know about bullets from personal experience of hunting you can't hit anything with a book I pulled a lot of bullets out of animals when you shoot an animal and you hit bone those bullets they distort brutally I mean they don't look like that if they go through two people and hit all sorts of bone that's the bullet that came out of Connolly's body or what Connolly's gurney excuse me and that's the bullet that they're attributing to this single Bullet theory if you look at the path of the bullet that goes through Connally or goes through Kennedy and then goes through Connally that to me is not unbelievable it's not unbelievable that one is hey you gotta look at the other one but even that one but no no see what I'm saying even that one is not unbelievable it is believable to me because I know that bullets do strange things when they hit things right but you got to combine that with the fact that the bullet came out fairly pristine which mean it didn't actually go through a kind of a bouncy path like that right it went out a straight path this diagram is from conspiracy theorists but essentially yes the diagrams that will share the actual path with him like you know they've got them the butts they're on the same level and you know that Kennedy was actually sitting he was elevated yes so see if we can find one that has the actual seating arrangement or more accurate seating although one right there with the red line in the right hand side the one the right hand side that's a more accurate from above yeah from above yeah there's there's also the the fact that there was particles there was more metallic particles from the bullets more fragments from the bullet in Conley's body than we're missing from the bullet I do not believe that was the bullet and I think that that is a very reasonable assumption well you know what you should do you should get one of those guns get the same bullets okay some ballistic dummies with some bones inside and start shooting they've already done that yeah they Penn & Teller did that yeah but some people have done it and they have found pretty close to what actually happens no they did within within the ground no no no every bullet that hit bone got distorted that's just what happens the you and you shoot those bullets into water or you shoot those bullets into like fluff or something like that that doesn't have a lot of impact to slow the bullet down then you get a bullet that looks like that if you shoot a bullet into bone they distort wildly where the bone was the last thing that it hit but it doesn't matter it's still hitting bone but he stopped at that point yeah but I mean didn't it hit bone and in Kennedy's body as well mmm went through his neck and it so the odds of it hitting only soft tissue and it's gonna go through his neck and it came out here they're gonna clip one of his vertebrae or something like that I don't think that's real yeah I think also there's a difference and this is fact from David Lifton's book best evidence which was a book by an accountant to win over the Warren Commission report and found all these factual inaccuracies and all these contradictions he found that there was a difference in the autopsy report at Bethesda Maryland the Bethesda Naval Hospital versus the what they had reported on the scene in Dallas the first doctors that got a hold of Kennedy's body in Dallas before they flew him to Bethesda said that the hole in his neck was an entry wound when they got to Maryland they changed that to a tracheotomy hole they changed the the impact and they said that it was they said that this was not an impact from a bullet that it was from something else yeah someone said they enlarged the hole you know insert a trach tube yeah well I think well there was a there's also a lot of pressure on these people to try to wrap this up nice and tight and say that Lee Harvey Oswald was the shooter there was you yeah yeah there's this big thing about the CIA the CIA inventing the another the FBI FBI well inventing the term conspiracy theory was a CIA thing the thing was the CIA yeah and this was a couple of years after the assassination they there was a memo that went out where they were concerned about all these conspiracy theories that were coming out and they used the term conspiracy theories and they said they should try to basically debunk them and you know make the people who spread them around look like conspiracy theorists basically the theory is that the term conspiracy theory came from that particular memo but that memo never actually encouraged people to use the term but yet there was a huge concern from the CIA that they would be they would lose the trust of the public if people everybody started believing there was a conspiracy theory yeah at least that's what they said I mean it may be there is a conspiracy and maybe they're just trying to cover it up but did you see the most recent dump of information on the Kennedy assassination that Jack Ruby had stated to people that before the day of the Kennedy assassination keep an eye out today that's gonna be fireworks I didn't say that yeah those Jack Ruby who eventually wound up shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in front of the police officers yeah you know something like that you know there's no he's dead obviously so you can't ask him what he actually meant and things like that take on a special significance after an event true whereas he could be just talking about it like he was gonna go visit his next wife or something or he was gonna write at the bar or he was looking forward to shouting at the parade or whatever but it could have been nothing yet people say things and you know after something happens people go back and they look at everything that happened and then they say well that sounds like something significant right like with the Vegas shooting there was a woman walking around the crowd in the Vegas shooting saying you're all gonna die this is what some people said and this was like half an hour before the actual shooting itself so people take that event and then yeah since a lot of people did die they think that this woman actually knew what was going to happen and she was trying to warn people right but you also get crazy people wandering around saying things all the time especially in Vegas yeah and the problem with you're all going to die is that that's a common one some guy was yelling that we took pictures of them when we were in Vegas long before the shooting it was a few months ago we were standing no we were in a car he was standing on the corner and he had a stack of signs I put it up on my Instagram I know I did because there was many there was stacks of signs he had not just one sign he had like a long totem pole of signs with all these different things and I was taking photos of it and the guy was yelling out everyone's going to die I mean he was yelling it out that you know God's wrath and all this you know crazy religious stuff that's a common thing for crazy people to shout yes and what they do show it's not like this woman was saying specifically someone is going to shoot everyone at this concert get out of here this is a dangerous area if she was trying to warn them he would have a bit more specific yes very specific right if she knew something do you see do you find it no it's I know I put it up there because we were mocking it maybe I put it on my Instagram story and it went away I don't think so though I think it's it's there from I want to say I want to say it was at least six months ago but we were mocking this guy because I like this guy's got a lot of fuckin signs like one signs not enough I goes this is the guy this is the reason why Twitter only has 140 characters motherfuckers like this I think I remember it's like July because there's like 120 degrees out too wasn't it yes it was very hot this goofy asshole had this giant stack of signs so the back to the Kennedy thing what do you think happened do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald probably acted alone I think he probably acted alone I think like the physics of what happened like is fairly consistent with the single shooter theory now admittedly the Magic Bullet is a bit strange but I don't think it's out of the bounds of possibilities I do because of the fact the metal particles there's more bullet fragments in Connolly's body than we're missing from that almost pristine bullet and even though the fact that it hit Connally at the very end if it went through all that flesh and it didn't hit any bone until it hit his wrists then it would not have been compromised very much ballistically it would still be going credibly fast it still would have smashed into that bone it did enough to break his wrist and it would have distorted the bullet and that's just what happens with bullets see unfortunately I don't really follow JFK conspiracy very much and the reason I don't is that there are already like I think literally over a thousand books mm-hmm okay I've read a few um I got into case closed that was a Vincent Bugliosi book as out who it was but I was like this guy's got an agenda it just didn't it there's there's many books that you could read about the Kennedy assassination and some of them favor the conspiracy and some of them favor the assassination I think they have a lot of them have merit on both sides one thing that drives me crazy was people say that you could never make that shot that's fuckin bullshit that's bullshit this is why I know it's bullshit because it was only like a couple hundred yards like a couple hundred yards shooting it something the size of a person's head is easy what about Jesse Ventura trying to do the you know three three shots again three shots off he didn't know what he's doing look I mean first of all you would if you were used to that rifle and you practice that reason someone said oh the scope was off I think that's bullshit too the reason why I think that's bullshit is cuz it's easy to knock a scope off you have to have a direct chain of evidence between the time Lee Harvey Oswald had that scope shooting that rifle the moment he shot that rifle and then you have to hand it off to someone who checks the scope right then because if you drop a rifle the scope goes off just drop it I've done that before I dropped a rifle once when I was hunting in Wisconsin and my scope was off by six inches at a hundred yards just dropping it so the idea that he could have never made that shot cuz the scope is off scopes get adjusted that's what happens when you drop a scope they move that's that's a whole thing about ballistics you have to check them you go to the range you set up a lead sled you lay the the rifle down so it's perfectly stable you squeeze off a shot you use the binoculars you find out where the shot hit on the target and then you adjust the scope they're adjustable so the idea that his scope was no good is crazy the idea that that shot was too far to make insane it was only I think it was less than a hundred yards when they think he made the first shot which is a chip shot that's a shot that he would make without even a rest now he's making this shot resting on the window so he's perfectly steady the idea that that was impossible is crazy the idea that no one can do that in three shots that's been disproven someone can do it someone who's really good at reloading and loading can do it just cuz Jesse Ventura couldn't do it but Jesse's super conspiracy mind is like he goes all in with the conspiracy theory that's the motivated reasoning thought of yes I don't know if it's doing it yeah it's just very show or because he really believes it I worked with the same people that did his show the same people that did his show the reason why I did Joe Rogan questions everything is they wanted me to take over Jesse's show after what I've done and I was uninterested I was like I'm knocking I'm not that guy I'm not like the I believe every conspiracy guy I go I think there's people I think people have a real weird vested interest and proving that things are a conspiracy I'm interested in finding out what things really are like legitimately what they really are yeah and even if I'm wrong like I have I'm not interested in reinforcing things I've already said if I find out that what I said was wrong I'm interested in repeating and I was wrong as many times as I can to get it out to as many people as I can yeah I'm with you because I think it's important so this is this JFK thing there's bullshit on both sides of it but the idea that this guy who went over to Russia married a Russian citizen came back here was I mean he was absolutely involved in some shady weird shit with Cuba he's a fucking weird guy Lee Harvey Oswald was a weird guy the idea that he was completely innocent I'm not buying that either I didn't yeah I did you know by the idea that it's proven that he acted entirely alone it's entirely possible that the other people who were like helping him or motivating him or giving him instructions even yeah the thing I don't think it's really proven is the the additional shooter theory it's not proven and there have been people that said they heard things from behind them the problem with that is chaos when you have gunshots first of all gunshots in an area like a Dealey Plaza the echoes yeah echoes ring out and people claim to see things and hear things they even believe themselves if you tell someone that you heard something in the bushes and then you run away that person will say I heard something in the bushes and then other people were repeated it becomes the narrative and that just gets it's real hard creates memories yes you can't you can't you can't point to somebody and say there was somebody there and they'll think there's somebody like that because they yeah the brain is so chaotically working it forms memories in a very weird way especially when it comes to something that's so significant like the president getting shot or any sort of violent thing now this is something that gets repeated ad nauseam about 9/11 it's something that people point to where they think that when the planes hit those buildings that there was detonations that caused Tower 1 and Tower 2 to fall there's no way they would have fallen like that like when people say you know they heard things in the buildings they heard explosions people always say shit like that and on top of that if you're dealing with a building collapsing like that you're gonna hear a lot of crazy shit yeah yeah you get a they're all going to be explosions yes things are falling you know there's the mean there were people falling off the buildings which goes to tower seven that's another one yes coming up see if you can find the video Jamie there's a the video that shows what really happened in Tower seven there's a guy who was a conspiracy guy he was really deep into conspiracies and then the more he started looking into Tower seven the more he realized that everyone is just showing the very final video where Tower seven collapses like a controlled demolition and it looks exactly like a controlled demolition however if you find the full video you see that the interior had collapsed moments before like quite a bit before Edward current I think is that's exactly what is seeming you find that gentleman's video but he shows how the top of it you could see the top of tower seven give in which is consistent with this idea that the diesel fuel that they had in the basement had created wasn't it like diesel tanks yeah that was an early theory at the diesel fuel that that was actually fueling the fire but they never found any evidence that actually the diesel fuel contributed to the fires it was just regular office fires which is what everybody finds so suspicious the diesel never caught fire they might have been after to collapse I think they recovered one of the tanks with some days are still in it so series of diesel likely fed by a series of diesel generators locating the lower floors which is where most of the fires were concentrated so at least one of the diesel Tower of diesel tanks didn't light up is that we're saying yeah the the theory like this theory is that the diesel had nothing to do with it okay so NIST which if you are a conspiracy theory person they get really angry when you bring up nest is that the government the government man so I think this is an older video yeah this isn't the video jam there's one by Edward current yeah and what it does is it shows the top of the building cave-in first quite a bit before the rest of the building so this idea that it all cave-in like a controlled demolition because they detonated all those things so dududududu is that air we're current yeah I gotta find a good spot of the video to show its mm-hmm okay you know yeah so what happened what they think was that the fire this is shitty design of a building and the fire caused internal damage to all the floors well you see that the World Trade Center one fell basically against the side of of seven you know that the building was all kind of like all the windows were broken on the backside there was one column in the middle of the back that was missing and a big chunk of the lower west side was gonna gouge it out right so this idea that it was just a fire yeah it wasn't just a fire yeah the fire is what triggered the collapse eventually but the fact that all the windows were missing from the south side contributed a lot to that because you got a lot of wind flow through see if he's got the the I don't know maybe this is a bad thing to do while you're actually doing the show so this is what the idea is the NIST computer models that all these floors had collapsed outside collapsed - yeah but what this guy Edward current had showed in his video I think it was him was he showed that the top part that press yeah the top penthouse had collapsed first there it is see if you see the penthouse collapsing see you sinking it up but with the two the two videos the simulation so it's sitting up there and then boom you see it collapse and some windows breaking right other down exactly and that's something that no one ever shows and then it gives in right so this is not a quick thing like a controlled demolition all those windows giving in is indicative of all those floors collapsing probably more than it is the idea of you know the people that want to see conspiracy think that those bombs were going off there and that as those detonations or explosions were going off that that's what caused all those floors to collapse on top of each other yeah I think like that's talking about with the core beliefs of the conspiracy theories with 9/11 this this fact that World Trade Center 7 looks like controlled demolition that's right is it core belief but when you actually get into something and describe what's actually happening you have to go through a much more complicated conspiracy theory and a much more complicated way of looking at what actually happened and now they're trying to do a complicated study of World Trade Center 7 at the University of Alaska this is something paid for by architects and engineers for 9/11 truth they're trying to actually figure out how they can reconcile controlled demolition with the fact that it collapsed the way it did right so they're trying to actually explain something which doesn't really need explaining because the explanation has been done by NIST already so what they're trying to do is find something that reinforces their initial idea instead of just look at the facts itself saying oh yeah you look at the top of the penthouses collapsing that's not indicative of a controlled demolition that's indicative of the model that NIST described which is a slow burn inside extremely hot deterioration of all the internal structure everything starts to collapse inside and then the outside collapses to yeah well some of them will say that that is actually how controlled demolitions are done you blow up the interior of the building first and then you blow up the exterior at the building but the problem is that none of the exterior columns were cut there was no explosion seen on the exterior columns if you look at the World Trade Center one and two coming down you know you can kind of imagine their explosions going all the way down because the things that look like explosions from the falling floors but in seven you just see the building kind of just kind of crumpled down so they have to kind of explain that so they come up with this study that they fund it it's cost them like nearly four hundred thousand dollars and they're trying to come up with an explanation that doesn't involve fire so they're saying like if if it was controlled demolition and the way they would have done it is blowing up these interior columns and it would have pulled in the exterior and collapsed the way we see in the video and I think that some of them say that the penthouse thing was a separate thing because they wanted to have a neat demolition so they first of all blew up a few floors just underneath the penthouse so it neatly collapsed inside the building and then they blew up some floors at the bottom so it's all fairly now itself without damaging the surrounding buildings too much so they've got this comp Lexx theory and it's based on confirmation bias it's based on confirming this idea that this is a controlled demolition not on examining the whole thing as it is and going okay is it possible that the NIST model is correct and that these files look the thing that I bring up to people all the time when they want to talk about conspiracies there's a real conspiracy in 911 and that's the fact that it happened the fact that they did fly planes into buildings that's a conspiracy and they pulled it off that actually did happen people don't want that to be it they want it to be a much broader conspiracy involving world governments that are trying to close in on you know all our rights and this is the way to do it and yeah there's proportionality people want something to be in proportion to the size of the event when they think just like a bunch of Arabs with knives isn't a big enough cause so they think that it has to be something you're more significant and even like with the physics of it they think near the plane flew into the building and he didn't collapse so why would it why would it collapse some of them some people don't think that a the plane we even have that's my thing all they think he would have bounced off Oh who the fuck thinks that or some of them think that the tower would have been knocked over really yeah but these are people who have really no conception whatsoever of physics there's a minority of people but you'll find people who who don't understand how aluminum can cut through steel you know the columns of the exterior of the World Trade Center were made of steel very strong steel and planes are made of mostly aluminum so they don't understand how a plane made of aluminum which is soft can go through steel which is very hard and strong and the example I always give to them is the ping-pong ball going through a ping-pong paddle if you make it go fast enough this is something I think myth busters do and various other people have done you you send a regular ping-pong ball five hundred miles an hour into a ping-pong paddle it just goes straight through it leaves a ping-pong ball hole in the middle of it and that's just what happened on 9/11 the planes were going at 500 miles an hour I didn't know you could do that with a ping-pong ball you can Wow that makes sense it's just matter well for the to the amount of mass you're dealing with to in the speed it's 500 miles an hour yeah and maybe isn't name to me doesn't even need to be relatively that much mass you think a ping-pong ball it weighs like not one gram and a paddle weighs like near 200 grams or something sir and you wouldn't think you've seen you've seen ping pong paddles they're this laminated wood and rubber and you got this flimsy little ball it's how on earth is that gonna go through this week it's unintuitive so you can understand how people would be confused about why the planes let these little roadrunner holes see if you find that you have the Mythbusters thing I want to see that I here it is wow that was a hole so they have some crazy air cannon yep blows all okay here's the problem with that though here's the problem with that they're doing that right in front of that they have to do that with a ping-pong ball because it would slow down but I understand but you're also dealing with the actual air yeah it's the it's what it is the ping-pong you can see it in slow motion yeah because what I was gonna bring up was a guy killed himself once accidentally on a movie set because he took an unloaded gun and he shot it into his temple and it blew his brains out yeah I was blank but the the fact that it was a blank didn't stop that air from blowing through there's a thing that people do when they hunt in Alaska and in incredibly moist climates and places where there's a lot of dirt and debris they will put tape over the top of the rifle the over the end of the barrel where the bullet comes over or they even use a condom and it has no effect whatsoever on the accuracy of the bullet because the air coming out of the rifle barrel from the explosion blows that tape out before the bullet even gets to it yeah yeah but you know the only reason they have to have that thing right at the end of the barrel is the ping pong ball with slow downs yeah that makes is in the act right you know if you shot something a little bit heavier but still pretty small it will go through it yeah I know it makes sense and you think you got to scale it up like you know imagine like a beer barrel mm-hmm made out of steel or aluminum thing it's like weighs like like 100 pounds or whatever when it's full and you imagine that's slamming into something about now the ping-pong ball can do something at 500 miles an hour a beer barrel at 500 miles an hour can do it normal amount in damage probably go right through a building yeah and then you scale up from like a beer barrel to a 200 ton plane yeah and 200 tons hitting something at 500 miles an hour it doesn't matter that it's you know it's made of aluminum it's still 200 tons or something if it was just you know a big bag of water hitting something at 500 miles an hour it would still make a hole in the side of the door I think this is a problem with a lot of these theories is that a lot of the people that are involved in these theories are either not educated in what they're talking about because there are some various nuances to things like this ping-pong ball trick or they don't they don't want to be like they don't want to look at anything that takes away from this conspiracy they don't want to look at anything that debunks or disproves they just want confirmation of their initial idea that this is some big grand conspiracy that someone is in on it and it's happening right before our eyes yeah yeah it's quite hard to even get one point passed a lot of people you know if someone starts out with that that theory that you know aluminum cannot cut steel then that just becomes like near the the gatekeeping obstacle that you hadn't get past if you can't disprove that one thing it doesn't nothing else matters really for them because the other plane couldn't have entered the building therefore everything is a conspiracy so you cannot have to address these things yeah you have to and it's um it's important for people before they decide that this is you know the government spraying things in the sky or that the world is flat or whatever whatever these things are it's important to look at all the evidence these YouTube videos one of the real problems with them is that they get to play out without being interrupted much like a podcast unfortunately but they get to have these grand statements without anyone who's an expert stepping in and stopping them and saying well that's not true and here's why it's not true and here's why you can prove that it's not true which would just do most of these conspiracy theories really quickly yeah and that's that's kind of the brainwashing aspect of these videos people people watch these three hour videos yeah it kind of surprised me at first I was surprised that people would you know listen to a three-hour podcast the you know once you get going in something you know the first time I was on your podcast at the time went by like way nothing yeah and if you're into something and you get sucked into it and you've got this really interesting theory and it's like all these revelations like oh my god I'm I'm getting the the real skinny on the world Wow yeah you just you you just get sucked in and then when it's finished you're on kind of a dopamine high and you want to do more and you also feel like you're in on something that people don't know and you want to tell them about oh yeah and I've been there I've been there I've always tell people the dumbest one I ever believed in was those stupid tubes that fly through the air rocks yeah I was hook line and sinker I would go outside and I would try to find those things streaking across the sky what it was was that there was a video that was made called roswell rods and it was trying to say that there was these bugs like things that looked like jellyfish that were flying through the air so fast the naked eye couldn't see them but they were catch them on video cameras mm-hmm and then finally someone figured out that what it really was was you could have an HD camera right next to a standard definition camera and the standard see those things flying across the sky what it's just a video artifact when the camera cannot pick up those those bugs it elongates them and streaks them across the camera Shambala yeah its motion blur and this guy this guy came to one of my UFC q and a's once and he waited in line and yelled out you're wrong about the rods the rods are real I can prove it silly fella but these this that was a monster quest had proven that on television they'd set up two cameras yeah it's so hard when the is actually being proven and you got this yeah yeah conclusive proof and yet there are still loads and loads of people who believe in in rods look how it lo look at how he was describing that it looks like some kind of alien jellyfish that's so fast it flies through the air faster than you can see yeah I mean the problem is these guys have a vested interest in it being real he's motivated and not necessarily by money they're just motivated because once they believe something they feel like they're privy to this special knowledge it's just gonna be such a letdown if they're wrong I think it's that end money I mean he said he sold a bunch of videos I bought him about two of those bitches I just try to start out with the assumption that people are not you know they're basically good people rather than not trying to make money right well I think they also get caught up in the business of whatever it is you know what if you're in the UFO business and then someone comes along and shuts down your business you're gonna try to well then be sort of they're not gonna look at it objectively they're gonna go I want to keep my business alive protect my business yeah it's like architects and engineers for 9/11 truth they're there are like half million dollar a year business they taking between 400 and 800 thousand dollars a year and the precedents of the the architects and engineers he gets paid a salary of like eighty-five thousand dollars a year and he gets his expenses paid now that doesn't mean that he doesn't believe in what is doing he sure started out as like a you know hardcore believer in 9/11 truth but over the last you know 10 years this has become his life and his livelihood so even if he really believes it he still has this additional level of motivation to not disprove things how many people are in architects and engineers for 9/11 truth no it depends how you count it like they they say they have like thousands of architects and engineers actually signing the petition I think they have like maybe a few hundred working structural engineers what do you think of their take on it their take is kind of like the standard of 9/11 truth they think that it's controlled demolition and I think they have all this evidence of a controlled demolition but it's not very good evidence is one of the experts as a high school physics teacher and he's probably good at high school physics but he just makes some very simple mistakes about physics of the the falling towers and they repeat this on their website unquestioningly there's another guy who's like the expert on the nano thermite residue that was found you know they think that these red and grape specks of what looks like paint and rust was actually nano thermite since he's now like an expert on their site he gets to say whatever he likes and he's got this one theory about how the bits of steel that flew out of the building had these nano thermite rockets attached to them which is why they were leaving these trails of smoke behind when they fell down and these are things that are just pretty ridiculous and you can kind of debunk them with physics that they'll have none of it because they've got their experts saying something and you can't you can't deny the fact that you can't deny that you can't debunk their experts because they're experts you know why would you know more about a high school physics teacher of our physics why would you know more about nano thermite then this guy who was an expert in nano thermite mm-hmm so they've got all this supposed expertise making these mistakes about 911 like this here the the precedent has this ridiculous demonstration that he does where he holds up two cardboard boxes underneath one of them there's empty space underneath the other one there's a tower and he drops them and the this one falls to the ground and this one bounces off the cardboard box and he's basically saying this is what should have happened this upper portion should have stopped on the way down and he's using these cardboard boxes and as a demonstration but the ridiculous oversimplifications or what actually happened you know I don't know too much about the engineers take on things you know from architects and engineers I'd really didn't bother getting into it too much but I just do know that it's several hundred people if not over a thousand and they're all over the world but how many people have studied it that disagree with them like how many and how years that are in our canal OTT of architects and a lot of engineers in this world yeah that they recently tried to get a motion passed at the American Institute of Architects which was basically a reopened World Trade Center seven and they went to the convention and they stood up and they gave their speeches and okay they're all their evidence about why you know will the building seven investigation should have been reopened and they took a vote and I think it was about something like 97 so 3% against doing this so of the architects who were actually there are these professional architects 97 percent I can't remember the exact figures but it's around that voted against this so even though there's even that there are thousands of signatures to the a 911 petition who are actually architects when you actually you know look at the actual millions of Architects that are out there in the world is a very small fraction of that right but how many of those millions have studied it that's a problem I would like to see someone who's like a real legitimate top of the food chain architect from the deep debunking side view it from someone who is absolutely yeah in a peaceful lots of people have done various studies on 9/11 the clutches of the building there was a book by a guy from London I think he's called Fang foo Chinese guy from London who wrote a book on progressive collapses in large buildings came out last year 2016 and they discusses like why building 7 collapse why the World Trade Center towers collapsed amongst a whole bunch of other buildings why the collapse or didn't so there are lots of people who do actually study it and within a e-911 architects and engineers for 9/11 they the vast majority of them have not studied it if you look at the position statements if you look they act who is it like writes a little statement which goes on the website they'll say things like I watched loose change and that opens my oh yeah it looked weird to me that's like the the real common thing you know when I saw the Towers fall I knew it wasn't you know it wasn't it wasn't a regular collapse it looked weird to me as my favorite run it did but it did look wait it looks weird to me yeah so yeah then an architect's saying it looked worked at them yeah look what to everybody right and no one has seen anything like that before it was unprecedented you know the Saturn 5 rocket taking off looks weird because it hadn't happened before yeah there's a lot of things that look weird what other things do you think that you and I disagree on I think maybe the Morgellons or Morgellons thing oh yeah you're more prone to think that it's a real thing because you went to the Morgellons conference not that it's a real thing that there's real fibers growing out of people but that there's neurotoxic this is what I got from a doctor the doctor who had more gel ins was at the clinic who's a very reasonable guy William coffee I think he has Lyme disease and he said the vast majority of the people that have more Jones also have Lyme disease right and he believes that there is a neurotoxic quality to Lyme disease that affects the way you see things and even causes hallucinations and he witnessed it himself he said I hallucinate it and saw something crawling across the surface of my eyeball in the mirror but it wasn't a real thing I couldn't see it after you know I looked at it again it was it was gone but I did see it for a moment and he's convinced that Lyme disease when you catch Lyme disease you're not necessarily catching it's not like you know you have tylenol you know something that's isolated it's very specific when you get tylenol you're getting tylenol he's like when you get bit by a tick that has Lyme disease you could get a host of pathogens and there's you know the what would test positive for Lyme disease it's very tricky to find someone to have it this doctor it's when one guy William Harvey Leahy he's a guy who thinks he has Morgellons or he thinks he has chronic Lyme well he definitely has chronic Lyme and he thinks that what more Jones is is a side effect of line where people start thinking there's fibers growing another skin right and so they think that fibers that come from their clothes or carpets they get stuck to someplace they've been itching because they open a wound and that they start misinterpreting that as being something that's grown out of their skin yeah well I would agree without part of it yeah but that's what he thinks yeah so really he's not really a Morgellons guy he's a chronic Lyme guy yes he is he's a more Jones guy in the fact that he has seen the hallucinations but because of the fact that he's a doctor and scientifically minded he believes that he's watching his own mind play tricks on him and he thinks there's neurotoxic qualities to whatever the pathogens are in Lyme disease are yeah yeah well I guess I don't disagree with you too much then I would describe you chronic Lyme but I think you probably know more about it than I do from what I've seen like most doctors don't think chronic Lyme is a real thing it depends on how long you have it for before you get it treated that's the real issue is lyme syndrome and chronic Lyme but yes some people think was a chronic infection and other people think there's just chronic effects left over from having the Lyme disease for a long time I think there's a lot of variabilities I think one I mean I think we'd probably have to really consult an actual line just on this not my area of expertise nor mine but I do have friends that have gotten Lyme disease and I know some people that are suffering from it to this day that have like real real terrible issues with it my friend Jim Miller who's a fighter in the UFC it's come and go with him in a terrible way it affects greatly affects his joints and and you know he's had to take various medications try to get a handle on it it depends I think on the person there's a lot of a lot of variables depends of the person depends on how quickly they detect the Lyme disease my friend brought his son to the doctor his son had Lyme disease he brought his son to the doctor the doctor didn't believe he had Lyme disease because that you know the the bullseye ring around the bite had gone away which does sometimes happen they they said no it's probably nothing and then the kid developed Bell's palsy and then they said okay this is serious and then they realized that he'd actually done have Lyme disease and pista the doctor didn't take him seriously he had the Lyme disease as well he had to go on some serious intravenous antibiotics for months right it was like really heavy stuff so he did actually have Lyme disease and it devastated him for months yeah for months he wasn't the same I think a problem with a lot of these medical conditions is that their clinical diagnosis which means that the diagnose not with tests that you can do a blood and things like that but it's based on the symptoms yes and a lot of the times people they they like to attribute their problems to something and give it a name so we've got a lot of things now like fibromyalgia where we don't have we can't do a like a blood test usually for something like fibromyalgia he have elevated immune responses and things like that but you can't like say for sure this is fibromyalgia it could be just a symptom of something else but people like to put a name on things so if people have they're getting aches and pains or whatever they say it's fibromyalgia they convince themselves fibromyalgia with them self diagnosis yeah and with Morgellons that happens a lot yeah people people get old you know and your joints start to ache your hair starts to fall out and your eyes start to you know you're losing your vision your focus and people think what's wrong with me and they don't realize they're just getting old and they they look it up and they think they have Morgellons or they think they have chronic Lyme people just if they're getting ill for some reason they like to attribute their chronic condition to something and so they might tag on to a particular thing like chronic Lyme if something if they got bit by a tick like you know last summer and then this summer now they have all these problems they might self diagnosis having chronic Lyme it is possible but you do realize there's a tremendous amount of Lyme disease in the Northeast and Lyme disease is very real it's horrible horrible condition and the people that do get it I mean they're pretty uniform and the fact that it sucks it's a terror and it's really scary because it really didn't kind of exist just a few hundred years ago I mean I don't know where it came from yeah I just kind of I don't know or maybe they didn't know what it was people got it and no one had idea what it was yeah it could be it was discovered in that village lime yeah where it's named after it reminds me of the Cuban embassy thing with a song anyway yeah what do you think about that thing I think it's I don't think it's there is any sonic weapon why do you think that I because the it's the same type of thing people are reporting a bunch of symptoms they haven't really done any date physical diagnosis of people people were getting ill people were reporting hearing noises but the noise is kind of sound like cicadas and so it could have been like one guy waits over the middle of the night this is cicada in his room jumps out of bed Sogeti goes quiet and have you ever tried tracking a cicada in your yard you know you get close to them and they go quiet so you gotta start moving he gets back into bed cicada starts buzzing again so this happens to one guy say he tells this story to someone he gets ill later there's some unrelated thing and other people say like you know well I don't feel very well either or and then at some point people sort of make a false connection and they start thinking that something actually happened and so they start asking people how are you feeling he feeling all right how is he hearing and people say well my hearings not as good as it used to be my eyesight's not as good as it used to be I mean having these balance problems but it's just people just having normal normal life problems that are getting old or the new sickness so they've moved moved away pull up pull up evidence of sonic weapon in Cuba because I don't I don't agree with you on this one the u.s. releases recordings of sonic weapon attack used against diplomats in Cuba play this it sounds a bit like a cicada to me at least 22 people have been hurt by the mysterious high-pitched sound have they tha have they 22 people is sick they talk to the doctors and they told them but these symptoms of the happy boys the dike that Pecos people with brain damage but it's a clinical diagnosis but you know that they have sonic weapons right yes is something that have been researched and it's real yeah and you don't think it's entirely possible that this is a sonic weapon I don't see any evidence this long anyway have you looked into this a lot yeah yeah it seems to me that if they're broadcasting it and this is something that you know the government's talking about it they're investigating and all these different people are investigating it it seems like there's enough evidence that they're concerned if everyone's reporting different things hmm stressful conditions on weapon ii US diplomats cuba panel certs yeah we can't keep it like they've got an interest in figuring it out they don't want to get the finger yeah of course yeah it's probably not cuba doing it if it was somebody look at this after a nine-month probe hampered by a lack of success a lack of access to medical records a panel of Cuban scientists today declared US diplomats here likely suffered a collective psycho genetic psychogenic psychogenic disorder huh not deliver SMS hysteria essentially so see if what evidence there is that is Pro i typed in evidence this is the latest thing is that see if there's any other articles that contradict there is no there is a lighter thing than this worth has been they say the detected changes in the white matter of the brain of some people hmm which is a bit vague and they did white matter of the brain yeah there's an fMRI what are they using to find them I don't know how they do it but I can't even figure out CTE employers yeah it's but who knows what caused this and how many people actually had it you know if one guy has changes in the white matter of his brain who knows what that's actually due to doctors treating victims in the cat attack though I've found visible perceptible damage to the patients reigns marking the first solid Evans that sophisticated weapon described by embassy staff is entirely real the associate Associated Press reports says The Associated Press based on work based on someone at the State Department saying we have found some damage somewhere you know the State Department is covering their ass the State Department expelled Cuban diplomats because of this they did yeah meanwhile the Cuban diplomats are mine we did nothing yeah go back up there please because the top they took some Americans away from the embassy because they were sick and so they said the Cubans didn't protect the Americans well I know so you're gonna have to send six people back as well see it says the State Department the FBI officials oh it's so unlike anything the State Department the FBI officials have ever seen that the Cuban government's claim the high-pitched whirring sounds reported by the US embassy staff are just cicadas seems almost plausible click on that link that says they're just cicadas up at the top that'd be the same one we would just saw I think is that it yeah playing the noise hmm similar attack happen to somebody else in Uzbekistan is that Bush oh really yeah old school bush why they have a picture he's being attacked by yeah yeah it's a weird sound for sure but I would think that something that would be that you that could damage you would be a frequency that would be audible yeah well some of them reported hearing things but yeah people some people didn't report hearing things some people had a high-pitched whine that disappeared some people had a long lasting rumbling noise some people has my feet not be sonic vision changes all kinds of different yeah just the irregular Morgellons chronic fatigue getting old type symptoms hmm so you think that someone started talking about this being an issue that they're being attacked I never started freaking out yeah that's possible yeah and I think probably something happened like you know some guy heard something and jumped out of bed and it stopped and then got back into bed inside again and someone else had something similar happened that's funny because if you were in Cuba and they didn't want you there and you heard weird noises the only con damnit they're attacking me with a sound ray and people are being the people are being harassed in Cuba like you can work at the American Embassy you get harassed new sonic attack against American diplomats suggest Russian involvement pomf pomf pomf the russians did it through twitter bots when you click on the Twitter BOTS they send sound through your earbuds yeah but people are saying like you know linking the cicadas causing the hearing loss but no one's actually saying the cicadas are causing people to lose their hearing they're just saying that you know people sometimes get reductions in their hearing as they get older and maybe they're noticing it because they're focusing on it so much right all these diseases people think I'm sick and then they focus on something like if you feel like you're itching a bit and you think you've got some kind of weird pathogen under your skin you're just gonna itch more and more you're gonna feel more and more itching right so if people weren't really paying attention like you know I have like mild tinnitus like ringing in the ears from video games or something I don't know Hans this is awesome yeah could be a stirrer but you know if people get it as they get older for no reason some people you're going to allow concerts or whatever right most the time I don't even think about it it might have I might have never even noticed it but if I stop and listen to my you know what's going on in my ears I can hear their tinnitus this noise in my ear very very quick very quietly hmm so if someone said I think we're being bombarded by sonic weapons like yeah can you hear any like ringing in your ear or anything like that and then you go quiet and you listen and you start noticing these things hmm right that make sense dude people are very susceptible you know psychosomatic illnesses are absolutely very real and there's a thing called sick sick building syndrome which is possibly a real thing and possibly a psychic anything but a lot of people think that a sick building syndrome a lot of the times when it happens it's like when lots of people working in the same place get similar symptoms it's happening because of this mass psychogenic illness one person says I feel sick and everyone kind of assumes it's something in the environment around them that's causing that and so they kind of feel sick as well there's a disease that I've heard of someone was talking about this one's called Aleph Renea I believe and that it's when people go to V visit people who have schizophrenia only if they hang out with those people they start developing very bizarre behavior of their own and sometimes they have to be monitored that's gonna weird yeah thats um well we all know that some people are way more susceptible to suggestion way more susceptible to know have you ever been hypnotized no I haven't I have it's fascinating yeah I I feel like I wouldn't be hypnotizable I'm saying everybody thinks that yeah I thought that too but I did it with a friend my friend Vinnie Sherman did it to me so I trusted him and I just led and he's registered licensed hypnotist and he works with a lot of athletes a lot of fighters in particular and basically just puts you in a very bizarre state of mind but you're aware of it the whole time it's not like you know some Manchurian Candidate thing where they're gonna wake up Mick now you're an assassin for the government and you like to run out the door and your underwear like Captain Underpants do you know Captain Underpants is do you have kids no but I do know how to catch under fences yeah kids love captain under freedom I told me I should try hypnotizing my wife what he didn't specify exactly is the way he keeps his relationship going yeah like every couple of nights he hypnotizes his wife and just tell what happens he's out he didn't really specify but he highly recommended him advising my wife Wow that guy sounds like a creep he's doing some weird shit to his wife he's a nice guy but maybe not when he's got that that stopwatch hang the string why was it was always a watch right followed Oh watch me - you're kidding - EP yeah that's real hypnosis is real I was wondering I was like oh I was like what is this like this is the bullshit but it really does put you in a very unusual state and when you get out of it there you know you can go through a lot of stuff that you have like maybe cluttering around it's your mind and reorganize after a hypnotic session pretty interesting there's a reason why people use it for like you know quitting smoking and those lines yeah well it just shows how malleable the human brain is yeah and you know it goes back to that whole thing with being brainwashed by YouTube you know people make documentaries in a way to hypnotize people yeah they they structure it in a way that you get these images coming at you and these ideas and this reinforcement of things in a way that will actually just embed this idea in your brain without you even really realizing it yeah and I'll say things like you are being lied to well the thing that kills me too is that they use oftentimes a hypnotic voice like that Eric Dubay guy who does those flat earth videos he talks in a very hypnotic manner it's like very calm and yes yeah I think so the 911 videos do as well is this nice woman dictating it the buildings could not possibly have fallen the way they did physics proves it it looks like we're gonna have Eric Dubay he said he's agreed to do it talk with Neil deGrasse Tyson what we're gonna he's gonna Skype in from Thailand or wherever the fuck he is yeah I think it's in Thailand I don't know how he gets there with Flat Earth how do you hear that's still in the northern hemisphere I think Thailand and scoop over there shoot over there and avoid the ice wall but he doesn't believe in dinosaurs either yeah he's gonna be crazy Kerry no way you think he doesn't believe instead I don't know if he believes in satellites but I don't think he believes in nuclear bombs anti-semites as well I think yeah that's a whole kind of unfortunate subculture in the movement of nerds yeah Nazis type people well the conspiracy theory goes back to you know the Rothschilds running the world right and so they think it's these you know this certain sect of the Jewish race who are actually in control of everything and they're these are the people who are stopping you from the earth debate is not me saying this I've no knowledge whether or not you're I might well I don't chicken out it's pretty easy to verify he's like a bunch of videos like explaining his position on it my favorite thing is that he's my friend Eddie Bravo is kind of buying into some of his shit which torches me to no end but Eddie is one of the greatest jiu-jitsu coaches on planet earth it means an amazing jiu-jitsu coach and jiu-jitsu competitor and one of Eric today's biggest videos is about how jiu-jitsu is bullshit it just shows you it does isn't it about that it's like about wing chun kung fu defeats jiu-jitsu which is by the way not true don't try it unless you're like way bigger and the guy sucks at Jiu Jitsu I should get those guys in a room together and they can just spot it out yeah I don't think so they would just talk about conspiracies to the end of time any loves conspiracy I would like to talk to Eddie I have to get you some earplugs here tonight so to kick in he's interesting because he knows so much about them all oh man is really interested confuses me I'm like how much time do you have where do you have the time for this yeah he's spouting off this advanced physics references like Mickelson Morley and yeah Aires failure and things like that those are the flatter things yeah there's science experiments that especially proved the earth wasn't moving that one's hilarious to me because when I first brought it up to Eddie Jamie pulled this up and sent it to me the other day that I first brought it up to Eddie from like eight years ago on the podcast one of the really early podcasts when we still did it in my house on a couch and he's like what's the most ridiculous conspiracy theory hurt and I said Flat Earth he's like no people don't believe the earth is flat so he went from that to I don't think he's a hundred percent convinced that it's flat but he's definitely willing to listen he's down the rabbit hole I think got sucked in he loves it and it's probably like a lot of it it's just from him watching endless YouTube it's 100% what it is here it is right here and what's the worse that conspiracy day like the worst one flat earth there's people to know how I was flat to the young earth that's another bad one no no no like today people don't believe it yes yeah yeah as a percentage of the Christian population I went with young earth there for some fucking stranger we were all baked Oh probably unfortunately but that was that was when he found out about flatter for me and that was he started him down the Reverend thousand episodes ago what episode was that 54 so that was probably 2010 yeah yeah first year yeah yeah was even that big on the responsible for this whole thing well he and I used to watch UFO things forever but he got off at UFO see he goes in waves right Eddie goes in waves like we were both like really into UFOs and in particular zecharia sitchin that was the big one you know zecharia sitchin is i think you talked about unless he's the Sumerian text guy he wrote with the reason why tenth planet jujitsu is known 10th planet jujitsu I actually came up with the name and one of the reasons why I came up with the names cuz we were talking about zecharia sitchin and the idea is that this this came from another planet we actually came up with the name before Pluto had been changed from you know they did decided as a planetoid downgraded it so we decided that this jujitsu was coming from another planet like out there where the Anunnaki live but it was based on Zecharia Sitchin's book the 12th planet and his book was all about planet Nibiru and that the Sumerian texts were when you when you decipher them correctly they all describe this ancient race that came from this other planet that it has this elliptical orbit that comes in between Earth and the Mars and Jupiter somewhere somewhere it comes near Earth every 3,600 years and that this group of beings called the Anunnaki created human beings by coming down here and taking them and taking lower primates and injecting their DNA into him and blah blah blah we were we were balls deep into that that was a big one yeah Anunnaki type thing like the ancient aliens is something that's really at the far end of the conspiracy spectrum but you still get people who are like you know chemtrail believers who believe it one of the guys you interviewed Scott Stevens there's a meteorologist yes yeah he was like into like yeah he believed chemtrails 100% yeah yeah he also believed in aliens and then did he that type of yeah I don't know key like a wild something disbelieve in aliens what I disbelieve is people that are in contact with it rights yeah I think the idea you know the Fermi paradox right the the idea that there's so many planets and so many galaxies and so many solar systems that the odds of life being out there so high why why have we not been contacted that's interesting to me it is entirely possible in my estimation as a moron that we are the most advanced life-form in the universe it's entirely possible because we exist because we are the most advanced life-form on earth we know that right as far as we know as far as like communicating things that we've discovered in 2017 we are the most advanced it's entirely possible that we're the most advanced everyone no one has to be yes right it could be asked yeah people say like you know we're the odds but yeah what are the odds of us the first person you know who ever wins the lottery because by the odds but it happened to that person's right it doesn't mean that it's very unlikely it's not like we run lots of universes and see what happens well as also there's a direct that one progression that you could file like what are the odds of someone inventing the iPhone 10 and 2017 well I don't know but that's how long it took that's what happened that is exactly what happened yeah this is what we track it we can go back to the iPhone one ten years ago it's real simple yeah people people use the arguments like what is the probability right in weird ways like people say what is the probability of three planes falling from two free--free buildings falling from two planes hitting them as if that argument actually makes any sense shitty argument yeah but it brings up all the time it's like what are the odds you who get so lucky that you would have three planes free buildings on the same day yeah this doesn't make any sense no it doesn't but say things like and but again again it's to support confirmation bias so I think that it's entirely possible that we're the only advanced life-form in the universe or it's entirely possible that they're incredibly advanced life forms that really aren't interested in us yeah we're in quarantined yeah yes that's possible to look at our fucking president and we have a whacky president that just lies all the time I mean fucking mine I think it perfectly started crunching as a bit a bit earlier them yeah but I mean what would you cut what you would go these people don't know the fuck they're doing we need to figure out if they're gonna blow each other up and pay close attention to them see if they don't poison their water like figure out what they're gonna do first before we give them new technology I think if this people if this thing's out there it's probably machines well I think it's you look at the advances in AI and stuff was going on now I don't think there's many civilizations can really survive sink biological life has its time yeah because you know you people talk about like you know Terminator and Skynet and things like that and the robots taking over Cylons I think that's actually a real problem I think you know there are we've seen like these robots oh yeah yeah they're pretty crappy now but you've got to the stage where they can do backflips and things mm-hmm and not too much further along the line like a hundred years from now it's like a blink of the universe is I will have robots that can do everything that humans can do and more absolutely so they're indistinguishable to from sheep from people yeah and who they choose to be and but not just indistinguishable they will be humans plus they'll be like gods yeah they were way to do hundreds thousands or millions of times more powerful than humans in terms of their their processing power and years hundreds of times more powerful in terms of their strength and that's a hundred years from now yeah we're really close to that yeah it's gonna be an explosive thing that there's this thing in AI now called generative adaptive networks which is this way of doing AI where the robots special basically teach themselves yeah one robot who is judging things and there's a one robot that's creating things and the robot that's creating things teaches the robot that's judging things how to judge and the robots they're judging things teachers they're creating robot how to create and then they just go back and forth back and forth so the old way of doing AI was like you would teach a robot to do things and you correct it when it get wrong and you tweak the algorithm but now you've got these robots that are learning things incredibly incredibly rapidly by teaching themselves how to do things and the humans who were running these robots don't actually understand how this actually works you end up with this huge big matrix of numbers which you know one can actually decipher but the results come out of it they've got things like now where you you can you can take a scene in a video and you can turn night in today or you can turn a snow scene into a summer scene yeah because they can near the robots the AI know how to do these things and this issue the tip of the iceberg there's so much more coming down the line yeah I I saw something that was incredibly disturbing they said that when robots become sentient like when they have the ability to make up their own decisions and do things for themselves and the first thing you're going to do is improve on their own design yeah and they'll they'll we'll be able to have 10,000 years of human propel like if humans were evolving technology a robot or a sentient AI could do 10,000 years worth of technological advancement in two weeks yeah and is that real yeah because computers just run so much faster just think about that number two weeks so think about how long ago 10,000 years ago was our civilization it's probably a little bit optimistic in terms of like actual physical development because they can't make prototypes fast enough to try them out again they don't sleep and gone they will they'll have these little robots and enemy fire robot some can move so much faster this axe some scientists are saying that we should actually not we should put the brakes on this AI a lot of them right but it's funny thing that seems like we're like moving towards the edge of the cliff and everyone's gone hey we should probably hit the brakes soon it's also such a lucrative thing for people to do because if you get really good a I you can you can sell it right yeah and the army is gonna want robot soldiers yeah you've got these these these drones with guns mounted on them yeah if you imagine you got like your dad scares the shit out me what do you show me James I open up a hit play it's really fast it's sorting right back ripe tomatoes really quick it'll slow it down here in a second you can see how fast whoa how can I see the oh my god so it sees the green tomatoes and it just knocks them out yeah yeah what the fuck because the computer is essentially seeing what we're seeing now it's like hitting them so perfect that's insane so as they're coming down this ramp these computers are oh my god that's in real time holy shit dude so it's got this computer vision that's processing it and because computers are that fast enough to do this now oh my god we're far it's just gonna get faster it's so fucked that scares the shit out of me more than the backflipping robot but imagine the backflipping robot can move it's really fast yeah well that's what Ilana must said you won't be able to see them even a strobe light yeah and yeah they're gonna be like super accurate shooting things you take your eye out yeah they're not gonna have any trigger panic robots god damnit so that's that's real that's a real conspiracy put down the chemtrails walk away from the Flat Earth and understand that there's sentient robots what did you okay you you have a background in computers what did you what was your take on that whole thing when Google had to shut down these two computers communicating with each other because they started talking in a language that they didn't understand yeah I mean that's what I was talking about there with the generative adaptive networks they they didn't have to shut them down but they did you know a little freaked out oh the shutting down because they couldn't do anything with them right it was the to do computers talking to each other in gobbledygook so if it was something interesting they were to cut them and and start but I think that they knew what the computers are saying the computers knew what they're saying to each other no no it's just some kind of loop that they got stuck in it wasn't particularly intelligent or it's so much more ominous to say of a language they weren't like plotting to take over the world how do you know it's because the we aren't there yet well they would have already done it the first things computers do is sexually harass each other they send computer dick pics they like what's the AI gender gonna be has anyone decided or is it and talked about maybe that's what's going on with all this crazy push to accept 78 different gender pronouns and non-binary people and all the stuff that didn't exist in the past maybe we're maybe there's like a natural inclination in the human species to move towards a genderless prototype of the future we went into this in depth yesterday under the influence obviously we did a podcast we were talking about like what an alien is the archetype alien with the big head in the very thin body and you know the mouth it's like barely visible that I think that this is probably what we see ourselves becoming when we have some sort of a symbiotic relationship with technology with technology becomes a part of us when we have the ability to manipulate genes which is absolutely coming and then we have this in enormous head which let me look at our heads right it's not very practical than Norma's head was talking about this recent looking all over the place they were talking he was talking to Ray Kurzweil in a podcast that I was listening to Ray Kurzweil the futurist and they were talking about the size of a human head and that a human head could only get so big because of the mortality issue with the mother like that the mother could not give birth the head can only be so big and that it's also one of the reasons why holding over the goal and our heads are so big that we have to be born like almost helpless as opposed to like other animals that are born they're pretty pretty agile like right out of the box like a deer or a horse or something like that even primates like young primates have very little body fat on them and they're they're much stronger than a young human baby yeah and that the design of the vagina in the head like leaves like little room for advancement in the the state that we've got as far as it can go but if we move away I was thinking from China from vaginas not not as ladies that's not what I'm saying but what I'm saying is move towards some sort of you know a vat yeah something yeah there can put together in some sort of a new concoction some sort of a new artificial womb that doesn't have any size constraints why don't you in a big head though well if you don't give a fuck about what you look like the big head would allow you to see the future you'd have a massive cut like that that that's a freaky one well there's that version of the alien or there's the bodybuilder alien from Prometheus which seems less likely he's just a grunt I think oh you think so yeah yeah but I think like with the big head thing like I don't think you need to grow bigger brains be humans you could probably do a lot better by having some kind of implant right a silicon type thing in there a little computer running in your brain but what if you had a huge computer like a hundred iPhones you cover your bigger brains as well because there's a limit to a blood supply like your brain is already using like if you use that it wasn't so you can actually like oxygen tanks so stuck to your back to it what if we go away from all that stuff what if they figure out some sort of a fission way you know I just have like ah whoa what is this before there's a they put a lamb out and had it in an artificial womb and it survived for a few weeks at least I was growing up are we well like a few weeks I worked a little sort of science fiction now what yeah but I think that's entirely possible for the future and then the idea of human beings moving away from biological bodies if they figure out a way to download consciousness which is one of Kurzweil things right they figure out a way to get to a point where the consciousness is something that can be transferred yeah that's a freaky idea that freaky to me because of someone like kim jeong-hoon he makes a thousand of himself and you know fucking puts them all over the world why it's like what if like you know your consciousness gets taken out but it's it you actually die well and you just this robot fuck similarly of you is what continues what if you make two copies of yourself yeah do you guide Ivor the try out bull riding could if you had a book and she let someone's consciousness you can get you imagine if that's what you decided to do just do all reckless shit with one of your body if you started MMA fighting then would you download that experience back into your other buddy yeah I'll just die no you would download it you'd have the other body on steroids and you have the other body like working out the Olympic Training Center and turn the other body it's like a super athlete and then the one that you're skydiving and doing backflips with I think the Augmented brains are gonna come along before things like that I think you're right yeah it's something with AI is coming along is like BOTS chat BOTS on the internet actually creating content yes not just like creating like talking things like posts on YouTube they can create pictures like these yeah these networks I was talking about can actually create videos that look like real videos so I think you're gonna get actual content creators which are artificial intelligence like YouTube personalities that are actually artificial intelligence yes Jesus but some of them will be overt like you know there's Google's new BOTS you're posting on the internet going hey everybody I'm Google and then you'll get people you'll get AI is pretending to be real people and then you'll get these AI pretending to be real people in thousands if not millions of social media account trying to influence people Wow then you talk about like you know botnets and things but that just like people just posting shit like reposting memes and things what if you get actually getting artificial intelligence that can actually hold a conversation with someone and in artificial intelligence that's actually more intelligent than the person that you're holding that is holding the conversation with it will be able to manipulate that person and control them and since it's a computer doing it you could have thousands or millions of them and you could do all kinds of targeted like social media campaigns well don't they say that's going on right now yeah but they're not they're not actually like have it's not an artificial intelligence having a real conversation with people we're on the verge of that but they do have artificial bots that will go out and attack people yeah things are the simplistic things that's spamming things you can tell they're a bot fairly easily for now yeah yeah but we're getting to the stage where you won't be able to tell that it's a bot you'll be someone who would be yeah in in a few decades there'll be people there'll be artificial intelligences that will be just as intelligent as you or me and we'll be able to have the same conversations on social media that you and I can have on social media right now and people weren't we ought to tell the difference there's this big famous test in AI wish to the Turing test where the test is someone sits in a room with a typewriter and they talk to the computer in the other room and if you can tell it's a computer then it passes the Turing test and it's meant to be intelligent and they can't tell it's a computer yeah we can tell it's a computer yeah so there's been very limited successes with that if you like restrict the topics to just baseball or Britney Spears or something I think they have this very limited domains that they can talk about but if you get a general purpose AI that is actually intelligent again and has goals to change someone's mind about something like politics you could have a real problem well we were talking about Duncan and I yesterday we're saying think about someone creating an artificial version of him based on the hundreds of hours of his audio recordings yeah because he has so many podcasts as do i you know if somebody wanted to take a podcast like mine where there's a thousand episodes and take those thousand plus episodes and take my opinions and the way I describe things the way I talk which I mean like if you're talking to me in a podcast like this you're just talking to me this is what I talk like so and you get a bunch of variables right you get me excited me depressed me shocked me sad me happy you would have so much to choose from yeah you could look kinda material you could kind of like fill in the blanks and guess pretty accurately how I would react or respond to certain things one of the episodes of black Mira British TV show Joe yeah was about some woman whose husband had died but she had all this video of him oh there was a service that set up an AI version of him and it starts out small like it's someone who would post on social media as him and eventually it grew to business don't spoil alert me all right I just watched an episode of the other day it's a good Navin that one thank you thank you so good I watched one the other day about the video games that they put that thing in the back your head did you see that one it's in the new season it's also - god damn it's good that's a great show and come out a couple weeks ah it's a good show good good mrs. Rogan does not like it though freaked out it is a bit I think she hears too much that shit for me too you know she just gets freaked out on technology in the future yeah the possibilities but yeah like making a fake Jarek and it's something that you know it's it's possible - it's really easy right so now you can probably do something if they put enough resources in just yeah just euro good yeah they could have something because this type of you know the generative productive generative generative at the serial networks this thing where they've got one judge and one generator they'll have one AI that just tries to make Joe Rogan's and then they'll have another AI that an expert are detecting the real Joe Rogan they don't have all this real material to go by and then this will keep feeding things to this and you'll say oh that's not quite right he doesn't say like that he hears his eyes when he's confused and Wow and eventually it will come up with something that resembles you well then it becomes a thing of like how do you know you're you and how do you know you're talking to someone else that's them like here's the thing let's just say why'd you leave this Robert dick - sitting right here Chris Ryan gave me a rubber dick sorry I just noticed there they looked over how to comment say let's say if say your father died which is one of Ray Kurzweil's big things his one of his primary motivations is to recreate his father he lost his father when he was and he believes that through the advent of artificial intelligence and through the the data that he's collected or recordings of his father and the images that one day he will literally be able to communicate with his father again I don't know if that's real but I do know that someone like Duncan say if my friend Duncan died it's entirely possible that within the next 50 years they're gonna be able to create a version of Duncan and Duncan can come over and say hi dude I'm back hey crazy I was dead and and I won't even know I won't know if it's really Duncan you've gotta watch this episode a black mirror okay don't tell me no don't what is it for - remember where I found this I think it was an MPR episode might have been on radio lab a thing called dad bots mmm this guy made literally a text he'd used all of his dad's past text messages between himself and him and then made a bot he could chat with I think his brother can use it too yeah they can just send generic messages like hey how are you doing and he sends something that he would have sent back I mean oh he dad's like shut up faggot he just says rude shit - nothing dad was like you can probably tweak it a bit though yeah everything is coming they're like you know it's text now and it's not it's not like very good you'd be able to tell it's not a real person did you like ex machina was that the movie you never saw it oh yeah I did see it but I've I forget he's very quickly that's an amazing one it was it was a plot real quick the plot was there was like some surprise yeah somebody's in a house super scientists and lived in the middle of nowhere and they'd be flown into him and he had created that guy right there created an artificial intelligence and they went over the Turing test and everything in that - it's my one of my favorite movies that's per a small my top ten favorite movies of all time it hits so close to home and they were so little cut the shit in that movie you know I described movies based on the cut the shit scenes like some movies like what fuck it she cut the shit how'd that happen there was none of that in that movie to me that in that movie to me was like wow like this this could take place let's pay there with these you know these future robot things there's so much of it is just trying to make a robot that's just like a human mm-hmm well you know the robots are not gonna be like humans they're gonna be like Cylons gonna be you know more than humans yeah your command robots they're doing work they're not gonna really look like humans because it's not very practical there will be robots that look exactly like humans but that's just one aspect of it right so there's gonna be all kinds of much more impressive robots well like think of that tomato robot yeah it's knocking didn't have to look like a person just has to be functioning the way it for it to be functional is not to look like a person exactly it's to have these multiple fingers I can knock away these green tomatoes yeah like why build something around the limitations of the human body this is the same guy that isn't that black mayor episode 2 do you think they're gonna do a reboot or a sequel to ex machina I had heard they were going to sure why wouldn't I mean why wait man fucking made a better who's a really good movie made a bunch of money it was amazing they better I am worried about that I am worried and I'm also worried that by the fact that you know guys like Elon Musk are worried that when someone like that worries and starts talking about it and yeah I'm like well who is paying attention to this I mean how many people are really at the forefront and is it possible to pull that back because I'm aware of what the United States is up to in terms of like what gets printed in the news obviously I'm not really aware but when you get further than that like China Russia like we don't we have no idea what they're doing yeah and they must be doing this type of thing they must be and if you don't they will take those things you know something they don't need this huge physical infrastructure they don't need a big military or anything to do like cyber warfare with AI fuck so they could be developing all this artificial intelligence to do things like in infiltrate everybody's social media and make them vote for the different guy yeah or just infiltrate all our power stations and shut them all down that's one of the real problems that I have today with the conversations regarding politics regarding whether or not Russia hacked the election is because people are so concerned with painting out their party to be innocent and the other party to be guilty and describing all the the different things that the Russians did and the interference and all the you know the subterfuge is being used that we're I think we're missing out on this idea that you can electronically affect the way people think about things if you have enough resources to attack an idea with propaganda through BOTS yeah and this is something that you see all the time yeah a lot of the stuff that Russia did was posted in closed groups on Facebook so it's something that you really wouldn't be able to see happening like he fit you have to be a part of the group yeah so many little treats yeah they join these groups right and they have not bots so much but like you know workers they have these like you know sweatshops where all these people are typing away doing all kinds of stuff pushing out these stories and they go into these closed groups because it's harder for people to like figure out what's going on if you're in a closed group and they post all this stuff all these mew whatever anti-hillary memes or whatever right pro donald trump like pro bernie yes push a certain narrative one of them where the guy got busted because he accidentally had on his location and showed that he was in russia and you know who's some guy with make hashtag Magga you know American flag and his avatar and the whole deal yeah it's gonna be really hard to figure out exactly what happened there it's gonna be even harder in the future though because young people be covering the tracks a lot better they're learning yes what works but it's really hard to figure out what's real and what's not real right now yeah you know remember wag the dog what was that like 20 years ago yeah and that movie they described the possibility of faking these conflicts and having this fake video and having movie directors film everything and it would influence the way people thought about world conflicts and now we're getting to the age where that technology is a lot more more realistic yeah making videos you were pretty close there thinks we can take audio now and just basically sample audio and create anything that person might say yeah that was a radio lab podcast where they did it and it's still a little crude but like most things I mean you go back to the very first oculus rift which was only a few years ago and it was pixelated and clunky looking but if you look at the HTC vive now their virtual reality is pretty spectacular yeah you could still tell it's not real but man the experience is so much more immersive yeah I remember reading a book back in the 90s I think it's less than zero by Bret Easton Ellis yeah and there's a scene in that where they they map somebody's face on to like points Paul an actor and at the time I thought that was the most ridiculously stupid thing I've ever heard of because it would never possibly work and there's no way I'm getting you know that degree of accuracy and now I've got an app in my iPhone that actually does it to a reasonable degree where it's quite hard sometimes to see what's going on that's this thing called mug life which is yeah it's just a toy app where you take a picture of yourself and it instantly like Maps is on to a 3d face and you can do all these expressions and you can say these things you can it has these like meme generators and it's it's basically yeah it's that type of thing which I thought was ridiculous speculation like 20 years ago but now it's come to pass well there's an article that I tweeted today about gal gadot who is the woman from Wonder Woman they've take they'd use an algorithm and they tape her face onto a porn video yeah so they have her doing porn and it looks just like her you can kind of tell a little bit that it's not her but not much it's it's enough where you like whoa they're gonna get really good at this and then they'll be able to have you doing anything you could be a murderer they can have you outside murdering people and then put that in the news and then by the time they retract it you know they say oh my quest wasn't really out there just gunning people down it was someone else your neighbors don't trust you anymore you have to move the damage is done you know and that's not not that I support like a lot of the fucking hysterics and the craziness that Trump tweets and all the different ship that he tweets but occasionally they get things wrong and they make stories about him like like the CNN Russia story where they had a fire those three yeah well when they after they had fired those reporters who had made these erroneous connections and had this like flaw ridden piece they fired them but the story it already been written like this is yeah I guess there's a rush to get things out there and they're trying very hard but you got to be very careful because once something's out there that initial thing of being out there is so much more powerful than any retraction yeah it's really hard to get retractions out because the original thing just goes so much more than the retraction yeah especially if it's crazy by the Roy Moore thing she's going on right now is the election today there's a thing where they said his signature was fake because the ink on the image was like black on one side and blue on the other side mm-hmm and so they said oh this must have been faked cuz this half the other Roy is black and the Morrie's blue sir I was looking into that and I did some experiments where I did a signature and then held it at an angle and took photos of it and I found out that there's this type of chromatic aberration from the camera which just does that with ink mm-hmm and it's very easy to duplicate and you can show that this was actually what was going on in this image and then you can look at other images of the signature from different angles which show that it's all black so there's this one image on CNN that showed this blue and black ink and then I figured out that it was just this trick of the camera but even though it's been debunked and explained this people are still spreading the exact same thing around right that's not real and that can be a problem I could swing the election yeah and it's time limited that type of thing like you know it's done today after today doesn't really matter there was also something about him writing something in someone's yearbook yeah that was the the yearbook thing right was the decision the thing was they said that the woman had forged the entry to the yearbook but that's not the case right what she had done was written the date and the note yes all the chicory house yes but she didn't didn't Forge the actual words now she's but that's a that's a problem the probably the problem is that she did do it and she didn't say she did it as so many people want that to be true that it was forged right that if you can take something with it's like you know it's slightly problematic like her like not saying that she actually added this annotation afterwards yeah and then you can say that the yeah she admitted to it being forged right which is basically a lie that's it it will stick for long enough he doesn't really matter that it's a lie because you know in you know by the end of that today he doesn't really matter at all so all we had to do was get this story out there he had enough stuff in it to make it seem vaguely plausible to people who wanted to believe that she forged it did she Forge the date and did she try to say that that date was was written by him she I did a note underneath it had the date but he had also written the date above he wrote lighting it to a sweeter more darling girl I could never say Merry Christmas Roy Moore 77 and then underneath she had written Old Hickory house 1977 and did she tried a claim that he had written that originally it seemed like she was saying that he'd written the whole thing it and she she read out the inscription and she said Roy Moore I wrote this in my book blah blah blah blah blah and she read the the annotation at the end was the annotation at the end recent yeah at nothing Kathy she says she wrote it like afterwards like you know after she the same day oh so how the fuck could she even remember how do you remember what you wrote down for in 1977 that the handwriting is a bit different between them yeah it was fairly obvious that it wasn't the same the same handwriting that's like her today trying to frame him that seems more like she was just documenting it at the time and forgot if anything it makes it more realistic so if she was in a forge it she would afford to the whole thing what she's talking about something forty years ago yeah that's this this whole thing of trying to like someone saying that this definitely happened 40 years ago is to me so bonkers how the hell could you and this is a real problem with like the news there you know like one of the Al Franken accusers we were talking about yesterday claimed that al had grabbed her her waist and SQUOZE her fat in some sort of way when did she's talking about something 10 years ago like you absolutely remember what happened in something so inconsequential 10 years ago that seems insane to me now you add 30 years on to that and I'm just calling bullshit yeah you can't really remember that level of detail I mean even if I mean it would have to be something really significant but even then you know about Creative Memories yeah people's memories change over time yes a lot of people that claim they remember where they were when they heard about the Space Shuttle blowing up the worst one yeah they're people done extensive research into that like tracking people's stories over like a decade or so and they found that like a significant percentage of people changed their stories ten years later I'm sure that's about where they were so like two something you know like harassment or something like that it's entirely possible that the story could change does false praise just possible that it could change well it's just they're they're conveniently forgetting or ignoring that human memories insanely flawed and malleable and I think part of yeah that's why we have statute of limitations because like things like eyewitness testimony essentially degrades over time that's one of the things that I'm really hoping is going to be cured with technology I'm hoping we're gonna give up our bullshit biological memory for a fat SD card they stick in the back your head just pop that sucker in there and click and you'll have all of your memories entirely accurate like that was a black mirror because motherfuckers are on top of everything they know everything but I really think that that's entirely possible in the future that there's going to be some way we have a neural interface with some sort of a recording device it's far more Act and that we'll all agree to it well agree to it just like photographs like if Jamie is standing next to you and I say Jamie and Mick west were in the room together and take a picture it used to be that I could say well that's definite because I have this photo but now with Photoshop and video editing tools so even then so what am I talking about because even then your memories are gonna be able to create artificial intelligence use your brain and creating memories for you well that wasn't that like Total Recall right wasn't that part of the idea of Total Recall they could put you put like fake memories in your brain and have you have fake experiences there's a lot of experiences that I that were gigantic to me like all of my years of martial arts competition if you had asked me to like accurately depict some of the most significant memories of my life from like age 16 to 21 like all those martial arts fights that I had I wouldn't even be able to touch it I have zero I've scrapped I've like flashes yeah I'm starting to forget all the stuff I didn't ever soft fur when I was working on Sony Hawk like I just got interviewed for though they're doing a documentary about the making about the history of Neversoft and Tony Hawk and the guys interviewing me and I'm like I can't really remember yeah and he was like somebody's like 20 years ago but it's that type of thing that I thought I would never forget write that because it was such a significant part of my life but it's just kind of dropping away over the years I think that happens a lot with you know people are looking back on 9/11 and they're going by their memories of what happened that day and it changes you memory changes yeah IRA IRA there's a few things that I remember because they're like oh some significance to it like I remember the Space Shuttle thing because I was over at an ex-girlfriends house and it was one of the few times that we saw each other before we had completely stopped seeing each other like we had kind of broken up and then I drove it out to her house to visit her and then while I was over her house we saw the launch we're like holy shit we we actually saw the replay of it blowing up and we're whoa this is fucked see some people let's see the replay and then they remember that is seeing the actual event if so why and so they think this are alive so that becomes a memory I'm pretty pretty good at that I'm pretty I'm pretty good at going over my memories to make sure that I'm think you yeah you think maybe maybe go back and check some of these memories on TomTom find your ex-girlfriend and ask her if that really happened I remember very clearly where I was when Sam Kinison died hmm I'm definitely where I was when 9/11 happened yeah because I got some calls from friends and they woke me up like my phone kept ringing I remember that because I remember being in my house I remember turning on the TV that is that's 100% I was driving to work I was on the 405 so I remember that he seems to me very solidly but seems there are details around that like I remember I went to I went to Taco Bell on the way to get some food because I thought it might be a long day no is the forget day now I can't remember now I went to a gas station I think I went to Taco Bell dang yeah I'm starting to forget what happened on 9/11 I remember the day because I spent it with Eddie and Joey Diaz and a couple other friends of mine we went to they went to a burrito joint on Sunset in Hollywood and that we were just talking about how there's no flights look good as we'd heard the fight to end like look man you see a plane this guy is weird it felt weird we felt like we're stuck in California or is like the freedom of air travels it's something that if you don't fly a lot you don't think about but if you if you really do if they pull it away yeah if there's no more air trial be like what yeah we're stuck here Collins take to drive to Colorado do that 16 hours shit like you don't think about it going back in time in a way yes different time yeah well at least you have cars it's a the Train yeah so is there anything else that we we might disagree on mmm no may disagree on I don't know what I think we I think we agree on the Flat Earth stuff no you think the earth is round right what about my tune what about day long Matt yeah the the guy who from blink-182 Tom DeLonge oh he's out of his fucking mind bastard yeah he's um he's got some weird shit going on and and since that podcast a bunch of people pointed out to me that he is essentially had that there they're selling stock in a company yes yeah there's something stuck and also he gets a guaranteed payout yeah like I think $100,000 a year or something like that well whatever regardless of how much money they take a know what what they make if you get enough rubes to keep donating money to this you mean keep saying stay tuned things are gonna happen yeah I said there's gonna be some videos released yeah What did he say that like nearly a month ago I think dude when he was on the podcast he played some videos for us that we're like absolutely UFOs and I almost pissed my pants laughing they were so bad it was so bad one of them was so fucking bad I was like dude if that was in a movie I would want my money back I would be angry say like what you see a crazy guy or is he like a smart guy who's making money I do not know I think he must he must like this they see you and he loves so as it stayed flying and making money yeah but the conversation I look there's two ways to approach this and I tried to be district I tried to be respectful because I'm the host and he agreed to come here and he wanted to talk about this I tried to be respectful don't let this guy talk and what he was saying to me was so ridiculous I was like I don't even have to challenge him on this because it's so obviously ridiculous everyone is gonna see that it's ridiculous I was wrong there was a lot of people that listened to that podcast that I saw on Twitter that thought that what he was saying was mind-blowing yeah and this is real those are the people that are going to donate exactly right now is there a problem with that is there a problem with the Catholic Church and because they're full of shit - yeah you know I'm saying I mean again the church is essentially a money-making franchise and they don't have to pay taxes yeah at least he has to pay taxes I mean is there a is there a problem with conning rubes out of money there's loads of like Kickstarter's technology things that just could never sadly work like these like clear air Holograms they say you've got to play video games on the table in front of you oh yeah those fun Me's for people that don't have illnesses that yeah yeah there's like one with had a water bottle all that would magically take water out of the air I saw that one yeah but it won't actually work it would take like three days to fill the bottle if you were in a rainforest require a panel was like but they raised like you know two million dollars and what do they have to do with that money they lie to keep it they can keep it if they went Wow the Kickstarter I think its Kickstarter has this like open thing where you know it's you're developing a prototype so it doesn't actually have to work Wow so what happens with that so all those people's it says yeah no I think they might have like that's a go go though they might have been on a lot of different platforms yeah one of them is more more relaxed than the other in terms of what it will allow like one of them now you could have a working prototype the self filling water bottle yeah it's bullshit couple summers ago created it yeah a lot of these they're like Eastern European like scientist types who do things like this so they made it look this dude is just driving around and then there's this bar by myself pull it out of air and then he just pull it out of the tube and Wow look I've got water all of a sudden yeah it can't possibly work it it it uses a real technology these little electrical things actually cool things down and condense things and it will actually condense a little bit but hardly anything so we take a long-ass time for that to fill was basically a dehumidifier I don't know if you have like like a dehumidifier every human we fire because California's dry yeah he ever have a dehumidifier it will eventually fill up the container of the dehumidifier but this is this thing powered by plugging it into the wall and it's this big machine and it still takes all day to fill up the reservoir right so they're saying like a little water bottle this size with a little solar panel and this little condensing thing that's this big will fill it up in a few hours well maybe it's like that a physically impossible physical face technology swapping thing like 20 years ago was impossible but 20 years from now yeah we're playing the long game water bottle you can improve computers but you can't really improve the laws of physics you're gonna get so much water as possible so they would have to have some sort of better mechanism for extracting it than what they're doing yeah yeah there's I mean there's there's certainly a lot of scams out there I don't know if that's what he's doing when I talked to people that knew him from a long time ago he's been obsessed with UFOs forever so his obsession seems to be legitimate however when I was talking to him about all the events and I was like tell me what happened you got a guy contacted you well I can't say Who I can't say I can't say what it was I can't tell you that we can't get into that that's all bullshit yeah when someone starts talking like that the full of shit you know he definitely seemed to be a combination of deceptive and delusional well the the slides that he used in the talk to illustrate there was like a an event of some UFO buzzing a aircraft carrier and some fighter jets we're going after it and they couldn't find it and they put up some slides on the screen there which looked like a shiny silver penis flying around and it was actually something that a type of thing we do on Medibank is identify objects like that so we figured out what this was and it's actually a number one numerical helium balloon like the the digit one oh wow like someone's like from a party here and I found like a bunch of other shots of the same thing where you can see it rotating you can see it's fairly clear it's it's number one but it's on this this this conspiracy website let's thought it was a UFO so he got it off there and so this is the UFO took the image kind of degraded it a bit so you can't really tell where it was it was quite hard for me to track it down because it messed with it so much it was actually just this just helium balloon that was a white it was no a shiny what's disturbing to me is that he's got this business that you know claims to be some sort of aerospace business and he's involved in it with all these other people that's weird because the guy who's running that kinda member's name fortune or something like that is it's like a real guy who worked at Lockheed Martin or somewhere and the skunkworks name we started doing adderall started getting crazy what he's talking about it makes no sense whatsoever he says our mission is to take what the Science Division gives us and we'll turn that science into flying craft right but the science division does it doesn't really exist right they've got like a guy who's like one guy who was interested in like shooting things with lasers to make them go fast yeah that was one of the weird things yeah it's kind of a real technology you can use a laser to power power a craft yeah that's not what they're talking about they're talking about some kind of crap that warps the very nature of time and space itself yeah and kind of like write rides a wave of a wormhole or something like that yeah and this guy thinks that it's plausible and all they have to do is kind of like try really really hard if the old put their heads together and like this scientists do all this science a lot and then these builders do they're really good building based on these really good science they're gonna get then they'll they'll get this flying craft yeah it's nonsense no it's gonna happen Hasson having people donated some something like two million dollars goofy yes no how many fucking people have done that see if we can find that out two thousand two two thousand ninety two people of donate over two million dollars Wow so a thousand dollars each that's a lie rich that seems wrong I know that I'm the numbers have changed frequently well the numbers seemed really high in terms of the amount of donations like it's very odd you're gonna get 2,000 people to donate a thousand dollars each that doesn't seem right it could be a few very large donors they somehow convinced to donate via this there are a lot of really fucking crazy old people that believe in this shit and they might have a ton of money went what's that red line meant to represent kind of bro they're flying to the stars Academy of Arts and Science that's what kills me what kind of arts we doing fingerprint always tracking those numbers for a while never going up on proportionately if that's the correct word to say from each other the number was going up while the the dollar number was sort of staying the same so maybe he was calling these people if you double your off getting a lot of smoke get you on the first ship it's a minimum of 200 I think really yeah a small small print down there so some large donations it's amazing knowledge donated two million dollars to this wacky ass fucking company yeah and only all the company is required to do is paid along a hundred thousand dollars a year for the next seven years or something and that's it really the crazy thing too was that they he had been contacted by the government because they knew that he could go on shows like mine and talk about this then he would have a platform because he's a rockstar I was like what this is like some why didn't and stop him yeah this is like some bad movie shit like this narrative is like a bad movie is that people like say like they don't want to talk to me on the phone because they're afraid of the government tracking them down and assassinating them or or whatever it's like yeah I'm talking to you on Facebook well yeah if I really was like this you know agents of the government it wouldn't be very hard to just say yeah get rid of this guy that's a big one they like to pull on you because you debunk things you're an agent of the government yeah yeah and it's really hard one to get around I think my approach there is just to be as honest as possible all the time so I also tell them exactly who I am like that I made lots of money doing the Tony Hawk video games I'm just like British video game programmer and basically keep my life story yeah they don't buy it they don't buying it pal they don't but yeah I think some of them it helps telling them about about Tony Hawk yeah it's a lot of them actually a fans of turning off that's funny actually well it's it's one of those things where if you don't want to believe you're not going to you know like that's a likely cover story for a guy and then then they'll go super deep though the government is infiltrated video games in order to keep kids stupid they've created these games in order to mess with the kids minds and one reaction I get quite a bit is that I am stupid that yours do yeah a lot of people will say that I am really stupid there's there's people like who were in like you know the architects and engineers for 9/11 truth type thing who think that I'm really stupid and don't understand physics at all and so that they say that the but I'm not a government agent I'm just this really stupid dude who doesn't understand what actually happened on 9/11 useful idiot right yeah and not just a new useful idiot in that sense but a person who is just mistaken right so then they can dismiss my videos by laughing at them break I do lots of little videos where I do things like demonstrate how something buckles like a column buckling when you put a load on you could write or you think things like that just just physics videos and then they just say yeah you're an idiot we don't need to look at this video this is a way of getting round the problem and a lot of other people say that I'm so smart about chemtrails and things like that that I must be a government agent because I know so much about contrails so I get both sides of and why they're really smart government agent or I'm just a stupid useful idiot well it's just them looking at you and trying to find some way to dismiss what you're saying but you you really get a kick out of debunking shit I do it's fun like in the backyard science stuff there was a thing I did recently where yes some of the scientists were saying that the bits falling off the World Trade Center were leaving trails that must be from the rocket motors that are pushing them away from the World Trade Center so I said no it's probably just some dust on it and they say no I wouldn't do that he wouldn't leave a long trail so I got a big sledgehammer and I piled some some ashes on it from my fireplace and then I stood on top of a wall and I was throwing this sledgehammer with a big trail of dust coming from it for like half an hour videoing myself doing it until I got something that some representative videos of it it's just fun to do it is kind of fun you know one of the ones that kept coming up that I thought was the most ridiculous one about the Flat Earth was I had read this a couple places where people were talking about ships disappearing on the horizon yeah and then the ship disappeared but if you pulled out if you do this you zoom and you could still see the ship yeah and I was like well how come you can't see Mount Everest motherfucker why can't you look towards Japan where's Mount Kilimanjaro get up how come you can see the moon you can see the moon and if you get a good telescope you can see the moon really clearly take that telescope don't point at the moon point across the ocean where's the mountains see you know atmosphere yeah that's the the kind of advanced version you know I was talking about Howard not architects and engineers for 9/11 have to do this really advanced thing that because we've debunked the basic stuff so they're moving this advanced stuff same thing with flood earth people now they can you demonstrate how things actually do go over the horizon and writers do get obscured by the horizon and you have a sunsets and things like that and so they come up with a complicated explanation where there's this kind of giant refractive lens of atmosphere above the earth which is bending all the light from the Sun in such a way that the earth appears to be round even though it's actually flat it kind of begs the question like how do they actually know it's round if it looks how do they know it's flat if it looks round right so they've got like yeah things are disappearing over the horizon as if it looks round because of this refraction thing hmm but they think it's flat but if it looks round why are they thinking it's planet well the thing that killed me was that you could zoom in on it and that proved that the that it wasn't actually disappearing over the horizon I know a little bit about optics because of my fascination with the outdoors I have a bunch of binoculars spotting scopes various power and there's things you just cannot see but then you get a good spotting scope on them so with the naked eye like there's things you can't see with the naked eye you would swear they do not exist they're not there but then you get a great spotting scope on them and you can see it miles away and that's the thing with ships you get a large ship it goes far enough away you can't see it anymore and you'll be convinced that it's disappeared over the horizon when in fact it's only probably a couple inches lower on the horizon as far as like the curve of the earth but to the naked eye it's invisible yeah so when they zoom in on it they're convinced that aha there is no curvature of the earth see this looked like it went over the horizon but it's an optical illusion yeah the thinkers that have been shown this so many times exist actually happens there's so many videos now on YouTube that actually demonstrate this thing like this time lapses of ships going over the horizon like zooming all the way with them that p900 cameras which do like 83 times zoom as big as you can go yeah it's been demonstrated yes they just ignore it or they say it's okay they ignore it because it's not in their same YouTube cue you know if you look at the the you know you play in the Flat Earth video all it Q to the right is like Flat Earth exposed yeah some of those get hundreds of thousands of views this is one guy dr. Zak who's where he it's like a foreign guy who does the ocean yeah he does these these Flat Earth videos and they're all mathematically showing things in AutoCAD with drawing lines and stuff and he gets like 400,000 views it's amazing it's bizarre well it's just amazing that so many people get get into this and they buy into it do you see that one with that young man took a spirit ruler a spirit level on an airplane yes fly around airplanes Darryl Martin the guy's name he lives in a van does he yeah he has a bunch of videos on van life he's a cool guy he's a very nice guy but he's got this weird idea about the Flat Earth it's so like I've had a few like youtube battles with him about where like he puts up something about how the the moon is cooling things and he has this thermometer thing showing that the moon is actually making things cold then I put up a video explaining why you know it's just a reflection because these infrared thermometers don't work that way and then he puts another thing like debug this Mik West like I gave up at that point was a very short battle well the weird thing is that they see all these other planets as round but they decide that the earth is flat that it's some sort of a flat disk yeah they think it's that different yes there's I just like these tiny little bowls that are like two miles wide of something and they think the earth is really close to the Sun yeah they think it's about 4,000 miles away some think it's 34 miles away oh you fucking idiots but they think they think the distance to the Sun varies depending on the observer okay observer dependent Oh like where you are yeah if it's only four miles away imagine if every drive away just gets super small like what the fuck yeah I mean it makes no sense it's so ridiculous but it's just to me it's such a strange thing to concentrate on that this is like their their identity is wholly invested in improving this thing to be some sort of a massive conspiracy in a very very very strange it's love it you love it they love it you love it do you love debunking that's the thing it's like it's it's a rabbit hole for debunkers yeah there's a flat earth you just get sucked into it it's one of the best ones because it's so silly it is there's no and then here's the thing that people send me people like I don't know if they're trolling me or if they're serious they'll send me a picture of a glacier and I go there's your fucking your ice wall yeah they show you that the Ross Ice Shelf or something like that like an actual ice shelf yeah on top to go yeah you can look up that the pitch and see what it actually well and they think this is a government the government is like guarding the the ice wall all around so you can't get near it take pictures of it yeah the southern hemisphere is a huge problem for the flood earthers yeah because you can you can have like somebody standing on like the south of South America someone in Australia and they're both looking south which on a disc would be away right looking completely different directions and the both actually yeah because they're both fairly close to each other early they're looking at the same stars in the sky yeah and there's there's even like they're really complicated explanations for the Flat Earth don't explain that so that's like one of the the hard irrefutable proofs of around Earth well he also is a son constable they keep changing their story based on what gets debunked like the big one that Dube was saying forever every photograph of Earth from space is a composite well that's not true they have full scale full image high-resolution photographs from the Himawari 8 yeah those are fake then they decided that those are fake so first it was the they're composites yeah you know which there was some composites from lower satellites and then blue marble things that's how that got started is the famous issue of the famous image of the blue marble hmm which is a NASA very high-resolution image that they did back in like the 90s from composites because they wanted to get something which had all of the land mass without any clouds on right so they had to take loads and loads of pictures and just take the bits that had no clouds on and then stitch them all together right and then they created this thing and then they did a separate one that had just the clouds and then they could put them together and move them around and stuff how many different satellites are taking full Earth images probably around 30 or 40 long how many of those are run by government chills they're all run by government well Himawari eight is the Japanese one yeah that's a Russian one which is about the same as such a two Russian ones there's a European one meteos at the american high resolution one just went up a few months ago it's offline at the moment cuz they're moving it from one side of the United States to the other mmm damn they're moving it how long does that take a few days Jesus now yeah how the fuck we do that little little Jets oh yeah yeah you've seen gravity yeah that's how things move around it got things moving that was the direction and then sending them there anchor it that's part that is something that confuses people is how do Rockets work in space mmm they think that because there's no atmosphere in space there's nothing to push against right so how does a rocket actually work in space how does it its action and reaction if you throw something in that's this direction you will move in the opposite direction I say if you sit in your chair take a big bowling ball or something throw it in that direction really fast you'll move it back a bit right so if you get like an air hose and you pointed it in that direction and you're standing on ice or something you're moving the opposite direction it doesn't matter if there's air it's you throw something that way there has to be a reaction in the opposite direction okay that makes sense a lot of those guys don't even believe in satellites because how could they they think that they think that signals are bounced off the ionosphere there's no satellite yeah but you can you can see this out of lives yeah you can see you can see the station yeah you can see it fly overhead and I get emails whenever it's gonna fly overhead I go out and have a look and you can see I've taken pictures of it you can see the solar panels in the photographs that I've taken Wow and it always appears exactly where NASA says it's going to appear nowhere in the world that's here the problem with these people that don't believe in satellites is that how are we tracking the weather then how do we know exactly when the Hurricanes are coming in yeah weather balloons yeah it's it's my concern about all this in particular like the flatter stuff is young kids wasting their time on stupid shit when the world is filled with massive real mysteries and incredibly fascinating things you should be diving in and learning about I think there's a great opportunity for teaching kids with things like flat earth yes you can do real experiments to determine that the earth is not flat also maybe even more importantly teaching them about traps thinking trap yes they the mind can allow you to go down you can teach them how to debug yes a this guy is saying that ships should reappear when we zoom in how do we test this right and then they can go out and tested it yeah well that that's that was that one was so stunningly stupid to me and then I don't want to go into the flatterer thing anymore but it's the the thinking behind it that's the problem the thinking that every single airline pilot everyone involved in commercial shipping everyone involved in aerospace everyone who makes satellites everyone all those people are lying every cartographer everyone all the map makers everyone they're all full of shit everyone has agreed to not tell everyone else about the ice wall if the earth was flat there was an ice wall scientists would detail it and they would explain why the earth was flat and they would show you a working model of the earth being flat and that's what they would teach in school there would be no there's no benefit whatsoever to describing the earth in a shape that it doesn't exist in and it would be obvious that the earth was flat because you have to do like really simple tests yourself you can see boats not going over their horizon it's just so disturbing you would see the Sun get smaller as it gets further away yeah the Sun stays exactly the same size throughout the day yeah sunrise noon sunset all exactly the same size the moon does the same thing why does the moon look so much bigger though when it's on the horizon without optical illusion what is it it's a perspective issue yeah it's just yeah it's just like just the way your brain works it you take photographs of it like on the horizon and then another photograph of it when it's right up there and compare them side by side if you're the same same zoom settings it's exactly the same that's interesting because it really does look larger when it gets lower it's purely psychological mmm the Harvest Moon right yeah what is the Harvest Moon not that big a red moon or something that's the Blood Moon that's then Eclipse had the beaver moon to the Eva moon forgave him it was a big one I didn't know about a beaver moon I did until they said it was the super moon which is when the the moon is just very close to you what is the super moon how much closer is a super moon it's not much closer really the it actually only gets about 8% bigger than its smallest it's actually very hard to see that it's actually any big a people side by side that's a lot though but people yeah yeah you see these new stories about super moon go look at the super moon tonight mm-hmm well it's it's not that much difference oh wow that looks a little bit different that's the very smallest moon and the very largest moon most of the time it's gonna be somewhere in between that so you're not really gonna notice the difference mm-hmm all right anything else we should cover before we wrap this up yeah let me look at my list I have to write list because my memory is so bad now I've offloaded everything like you know you're a stand-up comedians that you could have mail to memorize all this stuff well not only that I have to memorize fights too of UFC information in my head and I have comedy information my head but if you ask me to do my act that I did from last year right like that I filmed for my Netflix special I wouldn't be able to do it you know looking at my listen we've kind of covered for me and most of the things they're on here we could go over some like 911 crap if you wanted to but think about it this stage of my life it's it seems when there's so many incredible things to pay attention to that are real you know I know this is what I feel like about all this stuff where people are looking into conspiracies that there's just nonsense it's like you chase they're chasing their tail they're trying to confirm something where there's so much evidence that it's not real that it just it really bothers me it drives me nuts and I just don't understand it and I don't I just I wish that it wasn't a problem I wish it wasn't an issue mm-hmm you know and it is and it's one of the reasons why I continue to talk about these things and I really want to shine as much light on them as possible so that there's there's a real pattern that you could fall into and you can waste a tremendous amount of time in your life if you start looking at things yeah incorrectly and Flat Earth to me is the best example of it it's the best example because it's so stupid I mean it's so utterly preposterous that everyone is lying and that there are no images at all of this Flat Earth but yet this one guy or a couple guys and I had heard that it it started all out as a as a troll on 4chan is that they they had started doing this like way back in you know like it could have been but the flood I think goes back to the agent right but the people look like reignited it yeah yeah just using that as a like you know shit posting when we talk about shit posting that people have always believed in the flight oh yeah yeah alright let's wrap it up my quest so meta bunk comm if anybody wants to go though org my upcoming book escaping the rabbit hole what is that coming out next September but have you finished it nearly done yeah really done yeah okay excellent all right Nick West everybody we'll be back tomorrow with UFC heavyweight champion Steve Bay Oh chick [Music] [Applause] [Music]
