excited about that I don't know about that it wasn't sparking joy as that woman says she says if you're doing thing in your life that is not sparking joy then fuck it who said that that lady that tells you to throw out your clothes that don't spark joy oh she like a minimalist lady I don't know she's on the Internet okay she's really helped me cuz I'm a hoarder they have me too a little bit yeah I'll buy this desk I got a lot of knickknacks and stuff I say yeah I uh but you were saying that stand-up wasn't sparking joy yeah well it was a sparking joy in the past yeah in the last few you know in a while because I'm so nervous it's like oh my god I get so nervous cuz I don't really know I don't really know anymore you know not really the funny moved I see what you're saying yeah yeah yeah yeah it does and um like I was saying I need a line one killer line one killer opening line that encapsulates the entire year I've just lived through right right I need that kind of a line or it's not gonna work for me you know Oh every no something happened sure yeah and I just don't talk about it that much beside call never a a bitch do you ever work with writers understand that stand-up writers yeah no I want to but all my friends are dead oh oh right comic friends are dead I'm sure Mota's role and became Chabad you know who would be great Tony Hinchcliffe who's that is that hilarious how all great comic he's 36 that's a good age yeah 35 36 he's really funny fantastic joke writer and he writes for roasts all the time rose riser roasts yeah I would love to connect you with I would love that help you would you know coal s your thoughts you know the comics are the the comics that like me you know push this mic up to you a little closer to you oh there we go the comics that like me everybody likes you well I know that comics do yeah the comics that well some don't like me well they're silly yeah well sums bitches and they're gonna they're looking for a fucking smackdown I said leave me when the day comes they will get their fucking Smackdown from me Joe and it will not be like no Smackdown they've ever had before in their privilege but in a little while this'll be you're gonna raise your kids on welfare when I'm done with your house same kind of thing because I was raised on welfare I was well oh yeah yeah well until we're like 1314 mm yeah did you get the government cheese we did we didn't get the government cheese my dad used to take that whole five-pound brick of cheese you know my dad was the greatest comic really yeah but crazy like never knowing when to stop because it stops being funny at a certain point right yeah but keep pushing it and pushing it till somebody slaps you down like yeah it's that DNA thing that comics have it's bad it is bad like my friend Sue Mengers remember her Joe Sue Mengers I do know the name yeah well she was of that kinder kinder whatever it was where they moved these Jewish children from Germany to England kinder sport or something and you know to save them and she was one of those and her dad was a comic in Germany and it's just so it's so weird how things go round and round and we'll get to what we're going to talk about today but her dad was a comic in Germany you know real funny real popular and Hitler came and took over and he kept on telling the jokes you know he was telling the jokes where everyone every little Club doing the jokes and he was warned don't you know switch up your joke man if you want to keep working switch that joke up to be you know not what you're saying you know and he wouldn't do it and she said he even got louder and he was arrested and of course murdered in Auschwitz but she lived and she said I said what what would you say to your dad now she said you know at a certain point it fucking stops being funny do something different you know don't be don't write it to the Destructo don't go all the fucking else way over you know try stay in the middle don't distract yourself for comedy isn't that the problem with some comics that like we don't really know where the line is until you cross it then you go oh I fucked up across the line but you're just trying to be funny and that's that's something that I think that non comics don't really understand when when a comic fucks up makes a mistake they're just trying to be funny they're not trying to be mean yeah and they just missed they missed and it happens all the time because you're creating you know you're living your you're basically improvising and that's a lot of what comedy is is improvising a line and trying to say something and in the moment you might think it's funny but if you had more time to think about it you might have said I shouldn't say it that way people are gonna get it wrong or maybe I should be correct myself but that's when you start being not funny cuz self-censorship that's how they want us to be they want us to like always be like should I say this or shouldn't and you know just like her dad they're in Germany you know should I say this or should I say that or instead of I guess the more intelligent of us go how can I say this and reach people yeah cuz you know the people are thinking just like you cuz they're people too but we're not ruled by people let's really get into it now okay let's get into it who we're ruled by artificial intelligence already uh-huh ships has been it's been an experiment for almost 700 years 700 yeah more did you see today Joe it was the biggest news I've ever seen in my life that and I didn't get a chance to vet it you know so I really okay I'm not gonna say it but I did better ourselves on the show okay I thought you know a lot of these Christians out there I mean they're really connected in with the whole Q thing have you noticed that Q and like you and ons are you saying yes you what is Q people what does that mean 17:17 like the letter Q uh-huh and that means eight and then you reduce that down to two and reduce it to 1 you know it's a mystical thing oh so it's like like numerology type yeah everything's numbers right and everything is like appreciating the numbers and like that's why I told you there's this whole process to just smoke in a cigar you don't just go like this you got it you have to sense it smell it mmm hold it I believe I'll have a light now Joe q dang I love cigars no one's gonna get mad at me for giving you a cigar are they no no you're okay with that yeah because you're on inhale okay yeah no I can't I just can't do cigarettes hmm but I'm gonna start on cigars cuz they last a hell a lot longer than a cigarette and they never go out you smoke about half a one per day when did you stop with the cigarettes cuz last time you were here you were chain-smoking three three packs you were smoking three packs a day and this was right after all the bull shit went down and yeah I needed a smoke screen between myself in the world that's what my psychic counselor said you're a psychic well it's my daughter but she's a psychic counselor I'm sorry noise and say so they say shit like that the youth Oh see there are another wave like a smoke screen or glasses like glasses kind of feel like that to me sometimes like if I sunglasses on I feel like I can like maneuver through crowds better of course you can cuz you're protecting your eyeballs cuz everything is ghosts or your eyes like those things those worms that they got now they go right for your eyes you know what I'm talking about right Oh Jamie does school you are in this well let's go back to the 700 year eh I think first I don't want to lose that we've been ruled by artificial intelligence for 700 years no probably longer it's just like Babylonia well it's Babylon it's all babylon babylon chant down Babylon you know it's Babylon well yeah that's like Iraq right sir mayor Mesopotamia that very part of the world well that it's not really part of the world so much as it's part of the brain in the memory now where was better that's changed now was it it's over there somewhere mmm in the Bible as they say right it's in the Bible I don't exactly know what part of the world it's the Middle East Iraq okay yeah and Iran what a crazy part of the world you know I mean what a amazing history that part of the world has and still it's happening yeah still is having as per my tweet which was miss characterized by people have low intellect is what I'm saying now and soon fucking-a to get motherfuckers I don't say that anymore out now I say those of lower intellect isn't you know what I think big part is about Iran and the people spite in Iran of which I so I'm so thrilled and supportive for the people the working people of Iran who want to overthrow their ruling class mullahs who you know control the way they think do and say in every aspect for Diglett for women and that's getting ready to go and I hope Trump helps push that a little bit further to because everybody wants freedom now hot from Hong Kong to Tehran the Hong Kong riots are insane there but I can't believe what's going on the strength of the human spirit it blows me away well they've been writing for so long now yeah I mean it's not slowing down at all 17 weeks of Ryan that is crazy hmm 17 mm-hmm everything everything so find out sooner it's just in the air Allah so is 11 did you ever notice that about 11:00 and every time you look at your clock it's something me 11 right I don't know it just is I don't know what it means just look at my watch and it's always like more times than not something 11 what does it mean to you though just hey there's a okay just like there's a pattern to this I don't know it's just there again right there it is it's like something synchronicity us synchronicity I hope think renessa it is now put it in the dictionary urban dictionary try to mark that that's the beautiful thing about urban dictionary right you can just like god I knew right and I love making up words me too I never have though I don't think I made one up but I like it when other people do I've fucked words up before but I never stuck with them synchronicities yeah that's legit thank you thank you so much my pleasure thank you that means a lot to me so 700 years of us being poor or what I mean the babylon thing the whole descent of babylon which is artifice artificial intelligence that's right and the Tower of Babel which is the jar of artificial intelligence where everybody was trying to go higher higher in the pyramid in the hierarchy where there's only like a certain percentage of people at the top and billions at the bottom and chains you know not that pyramid I mean it's getting over its tip now it's over it's not gonna work anymore because people got too damn smart and goddamn we I shouldn't say god damn you just say it oh god damn god damn smart and I'm so proud of them because I keep going keep going don't let nothing stop you this is the first time in the human history and and this guy told me this once I have talked to the most interesting people who have ever lived this guy he was the one that wired all of Mexico for Ted Turner or some shit some old big old parties I used to go to before I stayed too long but first they're fun but anyways anyways um I forgot what I was saying oh yeah he said we'd put these satellites this is the age of miracles to messages bouncing off satellites and appearing in billions of places at once at this faster than the speed of light and that this this would engender a new what do they call it Renaissance in art and everything that you know when art gets fucking cool everything gets cool buildings commerce everything gets creative and it's just a creative creative time is coming from after this particular time of like a deadening or something or we didn't think but now they can't hold it down this is the first time in history I said to him it seems to me like this might be the first time in history where no church or state can keep the facts from the people as you said yeah that's true that does feel like this and I mean that's gonna create the most cool shit yeah like cars that will fly or something I don't know how it will manifest but it's high thinking and it's good and the more we see the rock at the bottom which is everywhere now you just kind of keep looking up just keep looking up don't look down you know when you're on that tightrope that's what these hey never look down when you're walking a tightrope you just keep looking forward and up a little bit forward and up hmm you know and just keep going it's tough for people right now who and I know people are getting censored and what the hell you know what are we gonna do about it you you wanted to talk about that it's well terrible yeah for sure and we we were as we got here Jamie was informing me that there's some new YouTube policy that is uh saying what was the descriptions of our podcast number 13 57 got a human review with harmful or dangerous acts hmm we talked about we probably joked around about harmful or dangerous I yes I mean it's discussing it but I think I think that they're saying it's it's in the video of it like they're saying is this in your video and I would say no no I was discussing it so that's why I don't know so when we can we appeal that or is that it maybe they want to open a dialogue oh that's it that's it yeah through a deeper process right now and we'll wait to see what they say but this is a very new thing that just happened within the last two weeks on YouTube and we're probably one of the first channels to get it have we had one of our guys look at the video to see if they can find something that they think yeah you should research and find out it was broken into clips and pulling the clip channel and those were all allowed okay so I don't know if it was a different person yeah I have to say I'm rather staggered at what they allow and don't allow I am so glad I'm fucking old because I'll be passing away from this fucking realm soon enough please God nothing makes any fucking sense it does no sense but I think it's fascinating it's interesting to watch all these different people scrambling for control yeah is that what they're doing yeah they're scrambling for control they want to control the way people communicate and they also want to make a profit see part of this is they're they're incentivizing people to do shows that they can profit off of so if you have a show that has no bad language if a show that has no controversial topics those shows are more appealing to advertisers so for them as a business they'll look at someone like me and say well this is a limited advertiser option but I just think they're looking at it incorrectly you know if if you looked at the popularity of it you'd say well as a lot of people that are paying attention to this just find the right ads find ads for I don't know finance for shit that's a little bit more risky I don't know what that would be Corvette's whiskey I don't know whatever the fuck you want to sell but it's not like we're we're not we're not saying dangerous things like encouraging people who do harmful things or asking people to do illegal things you don't realize it I don't think so I think what it's more like is they've got very rigid ideas of what is or is not suitable for advertising and maybe this is coming down from the ad executives maybe this is coming down from the people that are at the top that have a much more progressive stance on things what we would call progressive more I would say like hard left like a more hard left stance answers yeah there's a lot of that and they think it's okay and they think it's predictable there's a lot of people that are getting censored that are not not just people that are on the right which I'm not on the right but people that are you know journalists I'm more of a I'm certainly more in the middle like like I can't escape from a gun right now that's who's getting it yes she's getting the axe or people in the middle because it is a war between those two far right and far right left yes and there's so so labor well the control the way people communicate and talk to it's just people like controlling people it's a natural thing people want other people to comply when you see all these riots and these protests where people are screaming at each other they want power I mean whether it makes any sense or not it's not like these people are in a position to actually do anything with that power but they want people to comply when they're yelling at someone they want people to decide that this person is good or this person is bad or they're right or they're wrong this is what a lot of it is it's a psychological game it's just a it's a social experiment I don't know if it's an experiment but it's the whole country's an experiment self-government right and this is an experiment in self-expression because this is the first time that anyone like Sally Montgomery whatever and pick a name this lady can start a YouTube channel and make a lot of sense start talking some shit and be funny and all of a sudden she's got 20 million subscribers and she's making a ton of loot but maybe she starts talking shit about things and maybe Sally likes to joke around about certain things and they'll just decide well this is not suitable for advertising or this is this is dangerous or harmful and what people decide is harmful and isn't harmful the problem is this is not First Amendment right and they in in their defense they're not keeping me from saying these things but they're incentivizing you to not say these things by costing you money now the question is are they doing this because they just want to maximize their profits and this is just how the deals that they have with advertisers or they're doing it because of their personal views on what you're saying and that's where things get squirrely right when a person tells you personally Roseanne I don't like the way you talk about the country or about liberals or about this or about that so we're gonna try to silence your voice there's a lot of that happening to the people like but there's also a lot of left-wing journalists that are getting silenced there's a lot of people that are independent journalists that are getting pushed out you know it's it's like Tulsi Gabbard his she's a she's a liberal she's a Democrat she's also a two-time she served overseas two two deployments and she's a six year veteran and she more than six year veteran six year congresswoman she's you know she's getting censured she's suing Google so it's they're not just going after people that are on the right obviously she's on the left she's running as a Democratic candidate for president she's suing them because they censored her search results allegedly I don't you know I don't know enough about all that there's no way I could well they also hold people's numbers of followers down they can flip a switch yeah they can shadow ban you yeah everybody shadow everyone I know idle band so uh Santino I'm sorry we are people doing it for the advertising my that's what I asked myself I don't don't make a dime and I've been out for twenty years I mean I don't make a dime in fact every time I open my mouth I cost myself someone you mean on social media yeah yeah and so of course I won't be on there anymore Roseann you need a goddamn podcast your party no Joe I'm trying to get it which people do not know what to tell me what to do well I can't told you I need someone to tell me what to do you're in the right place god damn it I really need to tell people what's going on and they don't even know but I know because I did the reading for this and I mean this is all just a social experiment to see how far they can push us listen each other away from any kind of possible power we could have to coalesce and go wait a minute you guys are not gonna take any more of our money for your fucking travels hey bitch bitch no you can't no you it was not in the public sphere when she said it was in the public well who is she Nancy Nancy Pelosi goddamn Nancy Oh Nancy what'd she do Nancy's on my last nerve was he insane up for ten years - Nancy are on my last nerve you've got a lot to answer for in San Francisco what you have allowed on the streets there - the homeless people it's disgusting I go up there and I am disgusted it's crazy right now I don't think most people know how bad people are living in shit and felt their children around drug addicts dying in this fucking streets of the richest financial district on the west coast you know where's that money going to you I just like and then Laura Loomer went up to two of Nancy's vineyard trying to find her it's like if you guys don't get yet that it don't matter who the president is it's all a fucking scam to put public money into private pockets and nothing else you're being robbed and nothing else and they're both doing it both parties both sides both up and down it's about the American people we have got to go to Washington you know that movie mrs. mr. Smith I think about we all need to be mr. Smith and all go to Washington because like this is our government that is our tax money and it will be audited as Trump has promised and as long as President Trump continues to make the moves to keep that promise to us I will be supportive of him because that needs to happen the Federal Reserve must be audited and we have to thank President Trump for going in that direction how much time do you spend thinking about this stuff 18 hours a day I can't say everyone's mad at me it makes no sense otherwise I mean you have to help me understand what I've done you need a co-host you need like a like a like someone's yeah yeah someone's gonna like sit sit whatever Dave McHenry who's that Tiffani mix Fitz Henry I can't remember his fits Henry he'll find yes TIFF I want her my co-host oh shit what did she do she can uncover anything okay she goes out but she's like oh here it is oh he was arrested in 1922 when he had this and that john bolton why Blash he gets it all all Declassified the government song shit do you have to make it up Freedom of Information Act the greatest story never told the story of this country it's phenomenal I'd like to see somebody make a movie on it talk to Oliver Stone he seems I have talked to him before did you he's so left I might kidnap a rat huh two left give her a rest started by BATS you're not gonna have your one fucking commie world just down bastards go away even race somebody's fuckin wage yeah pay your people decent for fuck's sake let's start there he hasn't pays people decent well I don't know that I'm just saying if he didn't that's true you know I'm saying I'm just sick of people say bakra see I understand just how people get their their fucking money back that belongs to them like public money that's for roads streets hospitals schools okay public money when they give it to private contractors to go to you know where they go you know move guns and shit all around the world that means like Eisenhower said that's one less high school for the kids come on we're going to be the kind of a country that leads the world we cannot we're not we cannot be imperialist one-world fascist we can't do it won't work we have to do something else so we can't be one world fascist you mean like one world government you know yeah leave people to fuck alone leave the tribal people in the Middle East to live where they live forever fuck you know you know and if you can't then separate them separate them yeah if they can't live together then don't force them to live like what people are talking about with the Palestinians and the Israelis like that kind of deal well in Israel the Arab population is very well integrated so I don't mean Israel but out of Israel they're not very well integrated you know because they're you just get their money from bullshit propaganda peddled by the left but the people on the ground are what I'm saying the people on the ground are the ones that matter to me and if you can live together then live together that's great and if you can't then don't nobody can force you to live with people who want you dead what is that that's are its are you shitting me not gonna live with people that want you dead I'm not sure what you're referring to though I prefer to the entire world the whole world the entire fucking world led by you know bad ideas man that haven't worked this far it's gonna have to be something new that actually works for the people in the world not just the people at the top like in the world of course I loved him but when I ran for president I had my solutions or solution well I have to tell you Joe when I was a little girl I made a promise to myself I guess or and the cosmos and God and everything that I was never I was not ever gonna I was gonna keep trying to no no matter why I was gonna keep trying to know and know something new know something new and different like what how to create a world where something like Auschwitz doesn't exist and even the thought of it doesn't exist but you really can't because I think when you read about Western society and all of that you're like maybe that was it you know that's where it leads well it seems like throughout history there's been evil governments there's been certain evil organizations that have done horrific things yeah like way back to as far as we know from Rome to the Inquisition to the Mongols - yeah you know I mean there's been horrific things done by human beings and one of the things about knowing about things like Auschwitz is it lets us know that even though things in this country right now are relatively great in comparison to the rest of the world relatively great comparison to some parts of the world that are war-torn and terrible right now it could go bad it could go bad because that's what humans are capable of humans are capable when they're led by the wrong ideology when they're there minded when they're all in there they can do some terrible awful things and we need to know that and it's one of the things about having something like Auschwitz in our history that we we know that that's possible well we know that you can make you can convince people of anything yes we know that yes for sure and if you like he said if if you tell a lie if you make it big enough and tell it often enough everybody will believe it well if you just keep talking one of the things that I think is really interesting about the internet today's you're seeing groups of people that are connected to groups of people and for sure this podcast is guilty of it in a certain way although it's unintentional but there there are people out there that are essentially running online cults yeah it's not hard to do no it's not it's people love a leader we have an inherent desire to be a part of a tribe right it's because we're a tribe yeah look I have a goddamn American flag behind me I mean there's a reason for that I love America I really do I love the idea of it the idea of freedom self-expression and this is one of the rare places on earth well you can come here with fuck-all and really make something out of yourself there's no caste system here we celebrate people that are poor that make it to become huge look at all the entertainment singers I believe that basically because you know basically I'm still like I always was people think oh you're no longer a socialist well I'm not going to call it socialism anymore you know I ran as a socialist candidate in 2012 what's changed spread the Peace and Freedom Party there's a peace and freedom party yeah who's opposing that that's a good move cars off the Peace and Freedom Party no I oppose Peace and Freedom well it was a party of the Black Panthers and it was really Cisco yeah and so that was very important for me to run on there like what's Dick Gregory he's the first comic that did it I loved he wasn't he was a mentor to me and so I did it cuz Dick Gregory did it and I wanted to be worthy of talking to dick Berggren yes great things and kind of glad he wasn't around I hope he wasn't around when they start calling me a racist you know he's the guy that brought the Kennedy assassination film to Geraldo Rivera yeah he brought the Zapruder film I No as a television that's mean he's a very important guy never when he was fat he was fat for a little bit yeah then it became like a vegetarian hmm I'm not a fruitarian or something oh he started having looked about Bahamian diet oh here's a his son there's his sons are good people and stay in touch a little bit I said I bet your dad's haunting you guys I can't see him being quiet up there they said things happen where they wonder if it isn't their dad he's one of those guys that I really feel sad that I didn't get a chance to meet him he had a mind like wow that was a two century looking at him was going back centuries you know just the storehouse of information he had in his brain of history no the kind of history we we never hear yes and now I feel sorry for the kids in school these days they don't hear any real history at all I'm almost it's almost like there's too much information at their fingertips that's true like there's a poverty of information because there's an overwhelming amount of stuff that's coming their way it's hard for them to figure out what's important like I don't think that school is the way that most people learn correctly because I think it's too rigid and limiting but one thing at least is school gives you a core set of a base of knowledge that you need to learn you need to learn some American history you need to learn some you know world history you need to learn some science that I think having that core foundation of information there's a lot of kids that are just really lacking that today if they're not paying attention in school they're just fucking off and there you know googling things on the internet and they go in one ear and out the other after the test is over they don't remember any of it not really and I'm like that me too I when I'm interested in things I retain them but when I don't give up like someone will say something to me and if I don't care it's gone like I couldn't for my life tell you what you just said thirty seconds neither I don't even remember remember what I said but if someone says something that's really significant to me it means a lot ever yeah I mean I can pull up like after this whole thing today what I'll remember us he said he liked my hair and you know I love you I love everything thank you so much I love you too thank you um when you look first of all you really could and should do a podcast and we can definitely help you I can connect you with people that'll make it a plug-and-play thing where it's real easily yeah okay are you staying here now are you in Hawaii wow that's the problems don't go back and forth cuz well kids make me come and babysit all the time but that's not hard you just get the back spot so I do it these days there's so much pot it's like it's hard to say with I'm not even know what bad pot isn't him well now that it's being sold on every street or out here it's like heaven the only issue is there's a guy named John Norris and he was he was working for the Department of Fish and Game as a game warden and he started stumbling upon these illegal cartel grow-ops and I heard about that apparently some crazy number like between 80 and 90% of all the illegal marijuana that's sold in this country is coming from cartel grow-ops or similar illegal grow-ops where they use dangerous pesticides so there's a movement right now for people to test marijuana and in fact my friend Todd is actually starting a business doing this where they want to check marijuana plants and check you you know make sure inspect the stuff that people are growing to make sure there's no harmful chemicals or pesticides because they're using this stuff to keep animals away to keep bugs from eating the leaves and then you can smoke that stuff and it's toxic yeah cuz that's what they're saying about fentanyl you know they're just bringing that in and like the drug people I can't get their drugs anymore because it's too expensive those prescription painkillers exactly it smells way stronger it's way smaller and it kills people so about a guy was telling me that cops where he works have to wear gloves when they're handling people that overdosed Helmer because they they're literally getting it through the pores of the skin of the people that are overdosing that's how potent this shit is so if you grab some sweaty guy who's overdosing and you're a cop and you have bare hands and that sweat gets you literally can get fucked up from now thank god is insane so there I don't know it's just an incredibly potent opiate made out of poppies I don't know I think that's completely synthetic it is I think it's completely synthetic and they're always releasing new and more potent versions of it the prot there's just a massive profit margin and making drugs that people like whether they're illegal drugs or illegal drugs I mean we make this big distinction about illegal or legal the good thing about the legal ones is they don't come with violence it doesn't come with cartels but it's still you're killing people people are dying left and right from legal drugs from an overuse overprescribed amount of legal drugs and there's so many legal drugs that could fucking kill you do I think everything's just a crime syndicate and basically it's just a distribution channel which means roads and trucks yeah and like Union you know yes reunions yeah but you know they probably don't really keep tabs on which comes in legal and which comes in illegal well maybe they do but they pray come on the same plane from Afghanistan that's what they say come on it's all like crime as a whole economy it's all fine I don't think there's anything people do to live that could be wrong I just think we could be really smart and organize it better like we can create a whole new thing since we have all these computers and intelligence open to us and available to us plus the thinkers that know how to program those and you know programmers and all those people that know about zero and one and one you know hmm just fucking invent something way better that helps people and I know people have the brains to do that in about an hour if somebody I'll be that leader I mean if that's called for somebody just has to tell them to do it I think I think people need to figure out a way to profit off helping people that's where things would get good the problems are I know but fuck that that's all gonna go there's not gonna be a more money we mean it's all gone it's not that I just don't think there's gonna be any more money you know thought this Google quantum computing shit yeah this Google quantum computing thing they think it's a huge threat to cryptocurrency yeah I don't I'm too stupid to understand whether or not they're right but I'm Way too uninformed to but what they're trying to say is that there's no way you would be able to encode or encrypt this information that would keep it from this insane computing power that they're developing yeah there is there's yeah there's a way to get around all of it and I I don't know why I'm like I mean I know I'm I'm on the autism spectrum spectrum yeah and you know a lot of us autistic people we we just started talking to each other on the internet quite a while ago about like hey let's try to envision solutions to everyday problems that actually people face and and then threaten them and see what we can come up with and so there's whole websites about it and I wish I had them but I I will post them after I do the fucking research so I can't get a goddamn assistant to do any goddamn research I can't you get a sister who's that journalist lady she was asking about did you find her tiffany tiffany who's it she had just actually tweeted about roseanne oh well she is my friend oh okay that make sense I was like now we've been friends for a number of different live she lives down there in the south and well I don't know she wants me to say well don't say south oh she might well she writes some good shit like did you see her story on George Clooney no I don't know anything about her so I and that's that that that billion dollar tequila he was selling with Randy Gerber they got they got it added up to being worth 1 billion dollars by that company that owns the most liquor stores in the world and roads and trucks and blah blah you know their distribution channel is a good one a billion dollars and and the stuff they make tequila with well you'll have to read the article it's for people who fancied themselves progressive and then when their eyes beheld what the left actually does with its invested money they're their eyes bug out and what is he doing with this tequila money well it's not what he did doing with it it's how they valued it it's like you just shows you how corrupt everything is everything is totally but it fucking scum I'm confused because it's just like a successful tequila business writers are something wrong with what the way they're doing it um in some way some people are saying you know that the the recipe it's grown in families for generations right and it's - they're it's like a Walmart kind of deal to their demise you know the products they used to produce the tequila's so they're like getting waylaid like in a Walmart shopping cart called George Clooney's company and these families who have lived for generations are getting the screwed end deals like they do when Walmart comes in the community okay I see what you're saying so some people who are progressive they need to know where all that one worldy crap goes mmm I don't think they know so what you're saying is that he is basically profiting off of the hard work of these people that are remaining poor and they're buying their formula and then using that formula to make that tequila and they're growing everything but they're making all the profits that were saying yeah I think it's about a Gavi which is a resource right and I think it's about growing that and the native people owning it rather than it being bought out from Andhra so yeah it's a whole one world issue Ron why it's got a great tequila company yeah you know Ron I I don't know him you don't know him no but I love that he smokes a cigar he's awesome I love my girl of you really he's a cool guy thank he's funny salt of the earth oh this is amazing I love him but he's got number one tequila he sells his own tequila it's really isn't it weird when you really get connected and understand that everything's connect to everything else a lot of things are connected yeah for sure so I just I'm kind of uh I mean I know I'm a weirdo I know I'm different than other people right you know thank God I don't know why I always tried to be normal and it just never worked nobody's funny as you is ever gonna be normal so I guess not thank you so much yeah I one time thought that but it's quite a lesson to get public censored mm-hmm yeah and it still goes on and is that show still in the air without you uh yeah how's it doing oh I don't know why don't you pay attention oh well I kind of do now but I don't know I mean not really I don't but I don't know some people called me and told me to look for something so I did yeah yeah um you could do a podcast very easily and I think if you did it would be awesome it would be awesome because you know what after they kicked me off TV and said I was a threat to America and everything they called you a threat to America well something like that that's right to Hollywood that's right everything's a threat to Hollywood right now I mean it seems to be crumbling at the foundations isn't it great it's horrible to so great well I love movies so I'm bummed out but the movies all suck well avatar - I'm very excited about my guitar I was pretty fucking on ah I that's my favorite John wick is my favorite movie with my awesome I was just at a Tarrant tactical today where they trained John wick we're doing the pistol course shit real yeah yeah yeah Kanto Reeves trained John wick they trained Keanu Reeves his pictures of him there yeah training I've seen videos of him training there - it's really cool how cool is he he's a really sweet guy he seems like the nicest guy of all time it just seems like so down to earth and normal like almost to normal you know that's why he can play John wick oh yeah you totally buy it I love how he does it without any emotion you're like my boyfriend said he'd rather die and be tortured to death and to watch anything Hollywood makes he hasn't seen a movie in years watch it on work I told him that because he's a he's a like animal activist naw he's real that guy right he's real like fucker lied to me he voted large you do Jill Stein phone he lied to me and tell me is one for Trump and now it says fucker lied but anyway disease meat no no meat at all he it's a little fish in fish but I said you would love John wick I'm telling you he got I go he kills everyone because they killed his dog and that's the greatest line of all time you killed and he goes what I could almost get into that Tiffany make fits Henry she's a screenwriter and writes uh you know movies like that with her partner and I'm like can't you make a killer granny script for me cuz I'm gonna have the gun you know like Death Wish with frozen yes right why not death away yes the Jewish word did not come into the house listen here young man whoa I'm already scared why grandma grandma curse based whoa whoa that father my grandma she didn't like my dad oh no he didn't like her neither really he said it's right here say hey call your grandma up in the winter he said go call your bubby up and tell her to come to the house and visit you kids and tell her to walk down the side where the icicles are so I could crawl out on the roof and fucking a hammer and it will fall down and pierce your brain whoa you heard this kind of shit when you were a kid yeah it was all about that was hilarious yes what was wrong with your grandma that he was so upset at her this is so I'm assuming that was his wife's mom yeah his wife's mom oh she was a bitch there was no big thing on her boss she a big bitch she owned her own apartment house had 12 units she controlled everyone's lives who lived within there whoa nobody would dare bark you know I like ladies like that when I don't have to be under their thumb yeah you know if I like he just know them I don't think it's fun she got a guy under her thumb this was I want to write this as it to a movie hold it brief one of her tenants was a guy at war golf shirt she'd never seen that before she's seen like one-legged fuckers in an army fatigues you know in America because this was in the ghetto where she had her apartment house and right by the bus station there that's how I grew up but uh you know got under her thumb oh yeah so he he's wearing these golf shirts she's like Tyler what shared thick Lithuanian accent Tyler waters in garbage I can't do it golf shots he's going to golf him it's a classy guy you know I see kind of guy classy customer so he made the mistake of thinking she was a warm person as many people make that mistake with all Jewish women thinking they're warm and loving people she wasn't well she was but there was a dark side there to die yeah so he tells her that he's a fugitive uh-oh and that was her favorite show at the time the fugitive the one with the guy had one leg or something one arm one arm when I'm right the few shit Eve that was our show so he told her tell her he was a few G so did she turn him in to the cops nope she moved him underneath her her apartment Oh under I mean she was under and she put him above and she hooked up a bail on a rope that went into his kitchen in her bed and if she goes ding ding ding he had a government run and give her a fuckin no no she was a Jewish woman are you kidding my garbage came to the street me I was hoping it was a positive and thank you to cut the grass I need you to go fix the toilet number 8 well once she finds out he's a fugitive he's fucked yeah yeah so she goes so anyway we're us kids was there he falls in love with my mother who looked like Elizabeth Taylor and so my mom you know he's thinking that all her daughter she'll help me out she's working me to death this old bag so my mom been that way too she gets in on it I need you to come over cut my grass and pretty soon his job was to sit at our dinner table between her and my dad and go hell and this is the most delicious roast I've ever tasted in my life that was his job yeah and my dad just sitting here like yeah it's good she's like I make my husband jealous too so it became psycho and it goes on and on well that's 12 but at the end of that summer he turned herself in couldn't do it anymore huh it was worse being into her prison yeah the two of them oh my god then they got in a family fight and tore at each other's hair over this guy whoa that was my upbringing good everything's funny on hell your mom looked like Elizabeth Taylor yeah she had a waist god damn it I wished I had a waist I got my dad's body he was a football player and they called him Jerry barn the boy built like a barrel barrel buddy I totally got it and so I thought why I was in Hollywood I would get like a girl body with some ass cheeks and a waist mm so I'm still trying to work on that well you mean like surgery wise don't ya like the Kardashian family god I idolized them they're out here you know they are out here yeah yes I've seen them have you ever looked at their ass right not up not tight pull that microphone have that's a problem with no headphones forget I'm sorry yeah yeah I've seen their ass firsthand in Beverly Hills I was I was through I never saw anything so incredible in my life is like the eighth wonder of the world it was completely up there was no sag whatsoever right and I'm like I see I just had like a crack in my back I never had I was asked us in an ask based economy and I was like oh my god but be like you're never gonna get in my parents both you're never gonna get a husband because you're too fat and you have you know thank you you have no ass you have no waist you need to work out you know whatever and you have a big mouth and no guy will ever like that obviously he was wrong well I proved him wrong three assholes I got a good one now you got a good one a good man that's good for 18 years beautiful he made it that's awesome I don't know how he did it he hung in there he's like god damn so ever since you went on that one antidepressant things have been a lot nicer around here what was the one you went on cymbalta is that the newest one no I'm yeah I've been on it for four years I think I'd you know with this whole thing I realized I go on too much I talk too much like all old women no you don't talk too much just the the the problem is not the talking the problem is the people reacting to you're talking I like to see people get lit yeah it makes them better water got on you it's off program right yeah eat it the problem is not what you're saying it isn't no it's how I promise people reacting to you that's the problem but absolutely yeah reaction yeah but they're fools though the ones who are freaking out and canceling this and firing that they're just fools didn't understand you it makes me think of that song which you know I said fuck it I don't care about it no more I'm going to become the rock story that I've always wanted to be and I'm gonna sing that song and here's a song I'm not gonna sing it right now but this was the song that refers to all that I'm just a soul whose intentions are good oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood cuz yeah life has its problems yeah I got my share that's a great quote isn't it that was great words on Eric Burdon what a great artist you know we talked about on the last podcast I think was really important that people understand you know I've been a fan of yours forever and I know your story and I know what happened to you when you were a little girl when you get hit by a car and you were in a mental institution for nine months in other words and how it completely affected the way think and behave and I don't think people knew that and this one it was a really important thing for me to talk about during the last podcast one of the reasons why I wanted to get you in as quick as we could people need to understand what's happening here what's happening there was a genius comic who's also on ambien smoking pot drinking Sen Alton and has legitimate brain injury I do yes and I have mental health issues I think a lot of that is from nigel genetics but your brain injury well I uh I the problem is people reacting to you they're reacting to you like you're you're calling for people to be assassinated or murdered or you're you're you're yelling racial slurs in the streets you're not doing any of those things you know you're not that person the reaction was so overblown and then ABC who got so wacky and and cancered you it was so foolish so foolhardy and to try to change who you were the reason why the goddamn show is successful is because of who you were and the fact that other people on the show didn't have your political ideology and he would argue with them and fight with him and it's like real life conflict like people know in their own homes that relatable aspect of your show was why I was number one so quickly and why the old show was so great your that's you and they tried to mold you to these woke times and foolishly reacted to the way you were talking as if you you were doing something that was like they change what you were doing and it made it this horrific terrible thing it's just it's all because I said that I like Trump as soon as they heard that you know a lot of cabal's here in Hollywood that's all they needed to hear it's like okay this joy she must be destroyed and I I did hear people say oh my god I'm afraid she's gonna try to humanize Trump yes the network I said yes I think that and it's like what you mean Trump voters is that who you're afraid is gonna get huge fucking country I know it's like such an elitist out-of-touch view of humans that it's always offended me it always offended me that they didn't like their audience and I liked the audience because I thought I'm from there and they're familiar to me and I vowed to myself I'm not going to disrespect the audience yeah and I never did and I never did sellout neither like so everybody you know there will come a day I believe when you know no there won't who knows what the fuck will happen who knows who knows what the fuck's in hell yeah inside my own head though I've I guess I've made peace with it it was like the worst horrible thing I've ever gone through my friend Tiffany she says she says that this might be the beginning of the valuing of an artist rather than the diva because it was the lowest point of ever devaluing an artist and an artist's work she says so maybe now it's turned around and and the artists will be you know better respected for what they bring I hope so because I mean they were even pulling years old show all the things yeah which is just fucking ridiculous that's kind of what killed the comedy thing for me is that I was also told that one more one more me getting in trouble one more time I wouldn't have my reruns in more and I live on that you know Jesus Christ so that's kind of what killed that so that kills Danny's idea of coming out and do I ask for I asked for it to be defined I said could I have a definition of what offensive means right to you right and I said you know what it means that I said could you would discuss it with my lawyers no you know what it means what does it mean I don't know know what this is the problem could mean you fart or something sometime I mean these people that think people are rude are the rudest fucking assholes on earth they're the most insensitive the people that think they're so sensitive they're instant yeah do you think they think they're doing the right thing I do too because I don't think they ever get to hear anybody like me say you're not doing the right thing I know that's why it's up to us to go you guys um think things through a little bit more I'm I'm not condemning anybody I'm not that kind of person I think we need more conversations absolutely we need the best dinner parties till all these self-righteous fuckin progressives ruined that starting with my own family on Passover when we were celebrating the Jews they've been fucking Egypt and I had this horrible cousin I can't even remember his name and he goes well maybe and he had long hair well maybe we should shouldn't be celebrating the death of all the Egyptians the stories about and then we'd have like fistfight fuck out you know and I'd always be the one going can we just get back to the story let's get back to the story always someone looking to be offended by some aspect of any story I'm offended every fucking day of my fucking life how goddamn stupid people are goddamn they can't be more offensive to me right now than ever has been before I'm about ready to get out there and tell people what in the fuck like that has hit me many times in my life there's been times I got out of my car to chase after a mother or two the way I seen her treating her kid I'd do it high boots on the ground I I'm not no I'm not I'm not a trifling sort trifling is a strong word for white person use I've only said that it's like it's a next-door neighbor to the N word like trifling no it's not Jews use it we use it - but it's like it seems when a guy uses it that's a white guy when I grew up we lived right next door to african-americans you know we we lived out where everybody lived together you know there wasn't any nobody I'd got to the suburbs yet we lived mid-city and we had all kind of people down there at the bus station where we lived triflin is just a great word it is a good word it should come back but it's just white people using it always sounds awkward but white women can pull it off for some exchange such a good word just great like I mean what would you say wallowing in filth maybe that's doesn't that what does it mean wad wallow and fill I think it more means like you're a fool you're like a moron living a stupid fuckin petty life right unimportant or trivial trivial you know that's the perfect trivial I told that wallowing in filth or pandering so much better than trivial a hand during - I love that word pandering is common amongst cowards there's a lot of cowards a lot of cowards today yeah they are they're cowards but you can't blame them cuz you know they got drugs dad some shit you don't want to be attacked no they don't and they have every right to be that way I mean I am like this is just before the Jewish holidays you are young people where I have to repent anyway what he repented for all the bad shit I did this last year that I enjoyed I don't repent for this shit I had to do right but the stuff I did cuz I enjoyed seeing somebody squirm what'd you do enjoyed seeing somebody squirm oh I had don't say anything I just had the last word in personal really that kind of shit and in the larger world - go for the yes I'm just trying to be a forgiving person and so I'll be forgiving and I do ask to be forgiven and I by apologizing I'm I am sorry that I made even one embarrassing day for anyone who gave me the chance to come on TV and make a number-one show and to all those who am i embarrassed I am very sorry and I I think that I think I owe that and and I feel it and I I I am sorry for you know allowing myself to become unwell mentally because I worked so hard I didn't look out for myself I didn't take the vitamins I didn't take the shots we talked about that too and your difficulty sleeping and then taking seeds I've been so rough ambien for since that happened fantastic yes that's excellent I take Melanie melatonin really good that's really good advice I mean really good news I'm very happy to hear that shit out of me

got to stop with the ambien tweets mother before you lose everything for us whoa that's hard for us worried I'll get even I get what my grandson's I'm like okay you guys I think this now and I thought this then you just need an advocate who understands you that's all you needed you needed it back then and you know I needed not to be totally drained of vitamin b12 because the side effect is psychosis that's a good so I I believe that I was in a psychosis because the doctor goes you have okay good news I go to this guy what is it Cedar sinai good news you have no vitamin you let it go too long because you know I'm in Hawaii I don't keep up with my infusions vitamins I have to take do you take IV infusions yeah yeah - II do that I take them about every three months because I can't process iron because of your stomach yeah yeah yeah that fucking operation yeah oh I'm glad I got it a ride way 902 pounds right now yeah those stomach operations they mess with your body's ability to absorb nutrients right yeah I can't absorb nothing is that the old way these two do it like do they have it better now better no no now they're just do a lap band right right right it's not just - Jennifer Hudson said I had the old one I don't know she think they shrink your stomach right they cut it I heard all I heard Beyonce got one - did you hear that she's never been fat well I wouldn't that what you heard I heard I heard all the stuff of who got why though he's got a perfect body I can't imagine I know she's gorgeous yeah I heard she had it I heard she had a yeah what do they call it that the laptop and I bet someone's hatin that's what I bet I bet someone's hatin I bet she never had anything actually said it all on the table I put it all on the table that someone's hatin oh yeah wait why would you be if you're a in great physical condition like she's always been she dances she does so much physical stuff that if she got a lap band it would fuck with her body that's what I think I think you don't believe it but they are saying that they who's the other one myself who are these people that are called a oh the lap band can be renewed at that ladies always at a perfect body she is so perfect when Vice what's that saw her voice isn't crazy but the dancing that song if you like it did you better put a ring remember that with all those girls dancing her body's insane it's always been saying she's got superior genetics yes she does oh my god she's so pretty to us but does that does no way she has a lap band I would it all my money fuck oh sure okay fuck you hi thank you okay I have to jam your wideness I just don't think she would why would she ever get that operation she was if she was like really big and then she got small that's when people get suspicious but she was never big well she was big when she was pregnant she is pregnant but a lot of people get baby when they get pregnant they shrink back down what's what's her name they're really hot blonde lady with a large Tatas Jessica Simpson she just lost 100 pounds she did yeah she got pregnant had a baby got real big got up to 240 whoa I was 240 hmm oh yeah you can you can do some damage at 2:40 oh you can fuck people up but now she's 140 good for her defer her battles good for her she had another baby yeah she did I think she just diet and exercise you know did it right no laughs god damn I hate hearing that lie counter it what is it what social Intel you just need the right people around you Rosanna god damn it that's all it is cause I have his Wildcats and Johnny well you got me Johnny Oh Marone Johnny talks to cats as he not only talks to them he knows what they're saying do you go that far no I don't think I know my cat saying Oh Johnny does yeah who knows what they're saying I think my cats ain't pet me come on bro give me a massage Johnny goes like this she's saying hi wolves and will you come with me please pinky we shall fish that's why we know she's not that's you that's not the cat's probably thinking that I'd like to get pet and have some fish yeah I think most cats think that either pretty simple creatures I think they think leave me the F alone there's a little bit of that yeah you ever see a kitten stalk like a bird yes it's crazy yeah they know right from the beginning that intelligence is its DNA they note I was watching a kid it's not something you get when you watch TV it's like there's no intelligence right you gotta be out there well it's their loss yeah cats know oh I'm a wuss oh us yeah you got to be out there you got to move around you can't be confined that human beings are products of experience and I think we need a lot of experiences I think we need experiences all the time I think you need to travel you talk to different people you need to try different things it's one the reason why I wanted to go to this gun range today I mean I've shot guns before but I don't really how to do it right oh you don't know no I would see that's what made all and Benjamin mad at me because I he's because I called him a name I shouldn't use that word but because you know he's doing all that farming stuff well I'm doing the farming too and I have farm vehicles okay and he does not have that or any rifles or anything so I kind of called him a post bag but he thinks I'm onto the microphone he thinks I may be mentioned for other reasons but no it's just like man if you're gonna go do this you got to get yourself you know one of these four-wheel-drive here's like I got with the rifle and you know if you're gonna do the job yeah why do you know rifle when you're farming over fur for killing wild pigs I told you I got nothing but wild pigs over there well you're in Hawaii yeah oh yeah my friend Shane started hunting because he was farming and the wild page destroy all of his vegetables yeah they do some of these fuckers are like Volkswagens oh they're crazy yeah it is crazy they don't have no limits I mean they're like politicians I've noticed the huh any limit like they want not only what they got but what you got to they don't stop you put barriers up to them and they keep pushing and going under around pigs are designed to survive I mean they're ruthless in terms of their ability to survive they they have many litters a year yeah a litter they have multiple piglets right and they can get pregnant as early and start breeding at six months I know six months in there having their own babies and then six months later their babies having babies that's exactly what there are millions and millions of minutes ago were taken out what was it 30 pigs a month but they're great eating oh I don't eat pigs I don't know I I don't eat animals either you know too much unless they're really cute if they're cute enough ah later oh that's a cute thing no I I don't know because I'm old and you know meat just sits there for a while so is it because of the stomach operation is well yeah I do better just come for me when Ralphie may had that operation he had the same sort of operation he couldn't eat meat it was crazy because Ralphy was an amazing cook and Ralphy would invite us over for barbecues and he couldn't eat it he had any vegetables like they wouldn't sit with him it really fucked with his stomach so these incredible ribs and brisket and everything like that we would all eat it and Ralphie couldn't eat it was creme but he loved cook yeah it sucked yeah I wrote a part for him in a show and his sweet guy he was wasn't he is it a comedy demon or a drug or alcohol demon or is it all the same this is a food you know I mean people have demons like everybody's got their own little weird thing what's your demon it's probably anger yeah me too I mean I grew up yeah involved in violence and and martial arts and stuff when I was really little I think I developed that way and I got good at figuring out how to channel that and then when you stop doing that the difficulty for a lot of people is figuring out how to turn it off you know that's that's that's the the demon and I think that is the whole thing right now it was like being able to control your temper when you're pushed but you are way way way way way way better at it wait it's like everything else like if you learn comedy in the beginning when you're an open mic oh you're terrible but then you're 20 years in you're a master right you know how to kill that's the same thing with being a person I got better at being a person I just think you get it just got to understand your own mind better I started meditating I spent a lot of time in the isolation tank I do a lot of yoga I smoke a lot of weed I mean all those things are good weed makes I don't know what it does to other people but for me it makes me nice it makes me friendly I want to hug people me too I want good things to happen to them it gives me a sense of community like it really means that that's what it means to me it opens some kind of channel in my head to where the big the big we comes in mm-hmm the big awesome all together yeah community it's not a drug that is an isolation drug like a drug that makes you want to look this is all for me the one and I'm the fucking man it's like the opposite it makes you humble I mean that's part of what people call paranoia the paranoia that you get from weed I think it's an understanding of your place in the universe that you're kind of denying most people are denying cuz they're so self focused they're focused on their own life and their own objectives and what they're trying to accomplish and how they want other people to look at them and then you smoke the pot and you're like oh my god this is crazy we're on a ball it's hurling through infinity there's a giant fireball in the sky like all this is nothing you live for a certain amount of time and nobody really figures out why they're here you're all just scrambling trying to find meaning and then it's over yeah then what happens then do you come back as a baby and try all over again as if some people believe some people Eve you go to another dimension you know some people believe that you know you live the exact same life over and over and over and over again until you get it right yeah I know I've heard all those I'm trying to get it right I would love that I would love for this be the one that I figure out but maybe I've lived a million of these lives and this life even though I still fuck up all the time I'd love for this one to be the life that I do my best in well it's not gonna be I'm sorry it's not gonna happen what did I do wrong because you didn't do nothing though it's not that you can't say you did anything wrong it's you know you're on your journey ah but how do you know that this isn't like the best version of you left Wow maybe you're better next time around but this this time I'd like to do my best I'd like to do better than the last time if that's a real thing I give if that's the way to look at life that you are living this exact same existence over and over and over again that's what deja vu is that's what all these intuitions that you have all these feelings that you have when you meet someone you know that person's supposed to be in your life you know this guy's a great friend you're just meeting them like you have weird feelings like that the universe sort of tells you certain things about certain people if you're if you're really paying attention and you're really honest and objective we all have fragments of memory yes that come and go yeah sometimes over Bambara you know I had Kat know who's how to chase after like well the cat is something in that cat's DNA we have that too we just have it in different ways we have it for our ability to understand what people are deceptive we have our ability to avoid insects and spiders and snakes and certain things that we know are dangerous like a meat like I that's why I believe people have when people have like arachnophobia when they have like an unnatural fear of spiders they probably have some distant memory in their DNA or either someone they know dying for themself almost dying or maybe their them even dying you know it might be a fragment of I think about this and talk about it all the time with friends you know it might be a fragment of a memory of when you were an iguana it might because we're always gonna go back to the connection you know that's our root I was the root chakra is an amoeba a single-cell organism right it's in our body and it just replicated a lot so each one of those things have the same kind of makeup that intelligence moves well you're a collection of things right yeah but not just all of ourselves and all of our DNA we all saw this weird bacteria floating around in our body and it's keeping us alive and keep it healthy and some people say that bacteria is telling us a story like yeah I know it's a big one because like okay maybe the loop that goes through in your mind which maybe this has something to do with me being on ambien and have being in a psychotic state when I tweeted yeah maybe it was just something something was playing that didn't make all that much sense at the time when you're taking all that stuff you're taking all that stuff orally right yeah and all that stuff is getting broken down in your gut yeah it's fucking with your personality it fucks with that yeah they say that your gut your microbiome actually affects your personality right because it's given you the thought yeah and it's informing your thoughts also sometimes people are inflamed and irritated and that changes their personnel right and to have a healthy body or a healthy microbiome and all that just a healthy system it affects your personality and probably I guess you're really healthy you're in a good mood all the time that's a good way of looking isn't that weird oh it's true though I'm always striving for that because you know I I'm in sometimes then I'm in a good mood I'd say most of the time I'm in a good mood these days but I don't ever want to fuck with the bad mood but you know when you're bipolar run bipolar amongst a million other fucking thing what is that mental illness and your average bear remember yogi the bear I do remember I got more mental illness and you can shake a stick at yo it was hard to live with it but look what does bipolar exactly mean well we use we used to call it Moody yes swinging manic states right yes we up and down yeah one minute you're this and next minute you're that but even more protracted as like well you're in a good mood for months and then it's that you know what they say that straw that broke the camel's back oh that's kind of Klu one that you might be bipolar a guy so in the back of the camel breaks and you just let our up if you can't control it anymore and things you didn't even think you were holding back come out you know if you don't have the right way of processing emotion you know it's such extremes and then you followed the extremes through with action like go in someplace and you know then have them to go with some other place it's terrifying mental illness is really terrifying I think maybe this whole thing is gonna move me to start talking more honestly about it because I think of all the conversations in America that's the most needed it's a very important conversation and it's also very important that we have empathy towards people with mental health because we have empathy towards people with other ailments right if someone has liver cancer we don't go oh fix your liver you fucking idiot yeah well you know why out here getting sick but if you have mental issues it affects the way communicate with people and we think it's your fault like if you have a bad knee no one says why can't you run up the hill you fucking moron yeah but but if you have something wrong with your brain we just assume it's your fault it's a real bad thing it's a bad habit that people have particularly people that don't have mental health they're such bullies well they don't understand that it could happen to you it could happen to anybody I mean I bet but the bullying the mentally ill is so much a part of what's going on in our culture right now too abandoning them and interests in the streets well that's a giant no no cher actually brought it up she was talking about I'm sure she was talking about them talking about immigration discussing immigration she goes that's fine and good but we have 60,000 mentally ill homeless people wandering through the streets of Los Angeles alone 60,000 I mean that's a good-sized small town and it's filled filled with drug addicts and people with psychotic breaks and all sorts of other mental illness yes I met a kid the other day I always talk to the mentally ill because you know it's partly that they're so uh oh I forget the words Louie uses it you know yeah well they're so disenfranchised and ignored then they become invisible yes and then they retreat totally into their psychosis yes and so they can't be reached so bright yeah I always do on my favor just to make eye contact and say have a nice day or well you're doing him a big healing favor but I met this kid he was about 20 and in his eyes L black that white of his eye and I'm like what happened your eye he goes I got it tattooed I go how did you possibly sit and let them put tattoo needle in the wider your eye nine hundred and fucking fifty thousand times and he goes because I have a deep fear of anything going in my eye I've always had that fear and so this was my way to overcome it I go dude you know cousin people when do they start tattooing their eyeballs well you know really obsessive compulsive English and you're trying to get over one fear by you know running through the fear and making it happen to you and a lot of us do that you know I guess I may be in my psychosis I might have had a fear of you know being a symbol of so much to so many I think it crumbled me they kept saying that they kept trying to make me be a symbol of something yeah and I guess I am I have anything I just want to be a symbol for you know good jokes there shouldn't be no censorship on good jokes do you think that like the pressure of and of stardom of stuff contributes to this feeling that you you know you you worry about the the role that you have you know you worry about people being upset at you you worry about it and almost like it comes out from that oh can I fuck yeah I'm celebrating sober October Roseanne so I'm very good can I have yours sure okay what sweet I don't wanna drag plenty of wheat here it's good Jamie's not celebrating sober October three years in a row I know I like it I think it's good it's good to cleanse out the old wipes every now and I'm sober for almost a year off pot yeah till recently wonder ones one drag is good that's the right amount gives just elevates you a little bit gives you a little lift but uh I tied one on the day before sober October with Sturgill Simpson and I I don't remember even what we were talking about while we were talking it's just some fun to talk and exchange ideas and feel that nobody's hanging over you to send you to fucking prison yes what the fuck is that that can't happen here we can't let that happen we can't let that happen but there's a progression right well we're gonna have to confront Google and YouTube obviously and I think they are getting confronted I think everybody's getting it don't you I think a lot of people are getting confronted about those kind of things and they need to hear me or you and thousands of us frankly say hey you guys bring it back little come on bring it back to the middle well or it makes common sense where it makes helmets yeah because this ain't no sense to this I think when Trump got elected a lot of people use that as an excuse like that it was like a green light for them to enforce their own ideology they're like look this is a bad thing we're deeply distraught like one of the CEOs of Google one of the main executives at Google was talking about that recently about how distraught they were at the election and that what a terrible result it was like and they were you know looking at their own role in elections because that is a thing that social media has now people that that openly discuss and porter candidate or deny kennedy and this is what tulsi gabbard suing for is that they denied her youtube searches they did something to censor her ability to get her message out well I think that people what they're doing is they're digging and they're going back to whose fund funding hoop right and I kind of support that because I don't think that I want to give my money to anybody who takes money from terrorists yes why would I want to pay for somebody to kill me of course Americans don't want that yeah could that make don't make no common sense no that doesn't make any sense why are they putting waste next to schools why why are companies burying waste next to public schools cuz they can get away with it where's the public yeah how come the public is factored out of all public life including where the tables were public money is apportioned there's not one public there that's why I ran cuz I want to be a John Q public I'll be that guy who was putting waste next to schools look it up yeah look it up in New York in New York that everybody gets a payoff Jill don't act like you're so fuckin like school yard everybody's getting a fucking pay off to fucking do whatever the hell they can get away with doing something they're not getting in trouble for it they're unpunished unindicted don't you look at it and what is this what what but everybody said you know I don't know anymore it's like how come they're getting away with this shit why are they getting away with lying any of them who's who's getting away with lying all of them who's them oh fucking world it's a lie it's a lie pieced together with fucking bullshit it doesn't make any sense cuz it's not supposed to make sense it's senseless and stupid well it's all people that's part of the problem is that human beings are seriously fucking flawed and there's nothing but human being in the world of humans it's all flawed people running around trying to make sense of this thing here's how it's got to go okay okay it's all about grandmother's take your power grandmothers yes every grandmother in this country is responsible I figure for between 15 to 100 people a woman who lives that long and keeps her family around her that's exactly what happens and it's the truth of it so I call that a community you know depending on where they are geographically for that community in the words of Malcolm X why I ran for president on that party it needs to create community health and community sovereignty and community what's the word work it just keeps going momentum and now it I can't think of the word but it's a kind of farming where it's just like it feeds itself itself generating do you know what I mean mmm the economy of that particular community is self generated good bread since the pineapples you grow you sell at you the market run or that kind of thing but the sustainable sustainable thank you I couldn't think of that word getting old sucks man bones the worry men you know you vented a good word what was it again synchronous synchronous HS yes we're gonna use that one that's we're doing that which I do that in Hawaii where we we create we create not an artificial economy but a barter economy and of course it's all based on land as is all wealth and because you can grow shit and feed people and that's what matters so the biggest problem facing us as humans is how do we get the food in front of the hungry kids that's our problem but we go to all this other shit rather than that so we need to start over get grandmother's in charge every grandmother there'll be a community grandmother's organization all based on the nation of Iroquois which was how the United States was actually founded because Benjamin Franklin was a fan of the Iroquois people and the way they ran their government which was run by a grandmother's council and that's what he invented the thirteenth you know they came up with the 13 colonies united because it was 13 tribes and the Iroquois were the judge but didn't you just get done telling us about how evil your grandmother was well she was good but she was like money hungry you know yes she is a really good person shit well I'm I'm kind of like well for America we mean get down here check out my shit oh no I'm not I think people should be paid fairly yes that's what I learned from that is like god damn you know he would have done all that and more if you had incentivized him yeah incentivized but it's true yeah he had a good heart and they ran him into the town that ain't good see that ain't self-sufficient right you got a stop for your own everything it ain't sustainable are you ruin it and keep it going so have you completely given up you man I know you're gonna go on tour with dice I did it already you did it how many dates you guys do to just that's it yeah you're done well well we're done for now hold no I can't take it no do you live here and Hawaii or do you just live in Hawaii I live here Hawaii and a few other places but when you're done constant why don't you come to the store the Comedy Store yeah you know I get so nervous about it and I mean I know these depends and they are not holding it back next level and then I will get so fucking nervous well me listen I'll take you in there I'd be happy to yeah yeah for sure well any time you want really yes I'm afraid of that audience no wonder they are they all progressives I hold a song I wanna bust a few fucking fistfight with most people are just people they're got my kids they're still progressive it fucking pissed me off so bad well they're probably good people they want to do the right thing and they think that's the way to do the right thing you know that's fuck the car footprint I'm old fucking I will you know what I mean fuck it I left a huge one I'm not gonna back off now the promised everything leaves a cardan foot carbon footprint including organic farming I know that's what I'm finding out in Hawaii every night's are just fuckin sell in my farm well I think as time goes on with solar power and batteries and battery life getting extended to technology they're gonna figure out better ways to do a lot of the things they're doing now but regenerative farming is really important you know if especially a place like where you have well you have control of the land you know there's a lot of methods that you could use to do all sorts of things to grow your own food out there the thing that's so great about Hawaii is it has so much oh Christ I kept diversity in the people and their crops yes and you know that keeps everything really healthy we have to yeah and we have so many we have you know so many Asian people that they really do have a unique it's not like my way at thinking it's kind of Jewish but then at the end it goes it's very utilitarian mmm I don't know I like the way they design things especially the new farming things that I'm seeing on the island well the vibe of the island and you're on the Big Island but I love all the islands but the vibe of Hawaii in general is just like this very interesting vibe because it's it's friendly and nice but proud and strong and they know they have a really beautiful unique place and they have a really incredible history yeah the people that were so bold that they got in these small handmade boats thousands of years ago and made their way through the goddamn ocean can you believe that I mean you know they had their balls in the water to find out which way the tide is going yes I mean yes that right there is so great yeah because that shows that men have a total purpose kill because I mean what is it telling them that they're what is it telling them well explain floating when this is no moment when there was no wind and there was no current or there was no visible waves they would put their balls in the water to which way the current was going because it will feel it on their balls that's why they did it that is so fucking helpful to the human race the other balls we got to Hawaii yeah I mean they got to the most beautiful place on earth and they did it people are mad in Hawaii over that movie Moana which is my favorite movie I've seen 10 times well some of them were mad the activist sort when they said is Wyatt no I know no he's uh he's uh he's Pacific Islander okay but anyway but I'm up in Hawaii right I can't remember the believe he did oh well whatever he's fuckin gorgeous and since Jason Mennella fuck Momoa yeah god damn it anyway so every I guess unreal that is pulchritude yeah that's male pulchritude right there some cheesecake at beefsteak at pulchritude it's like whoa would you like to see them bare naked have you been paying attention to the controversy about building that new telescope in Hawaii oh of course I prayed against it did you it came to me you know this is something that shouldn't be told so I'll tell it and I said don't worry about it sis I'm putting in the Jew the Jew two cents on this here you don't want them to build the telescope well not on the peoples holy place so I went out there and I done some prayers for direction and it stopped three days later and now it's back on but all the people went up there but I like to say to the people I'm glad you got the telescope I say this never hates me it's okay but I just have to say maybe maybe the telescope which will be the new eye to behold the entire universe which will create like such a different kind of a human mind forever maybe that should be there I don't know well that's in terms of where it sits in the world well it's where Pele is right that's where Pele was born and the Hawaiian people they say they believe that they came out of that man you know and that that's their gym that's that's their what do you call their their Genesis mm-hmm is that particular Mauna Kea mother mountain so they don't want anything built on that maybe there's some sort of a compromise because the the idea of that place is that it's in a very unique place on earth do view the cosmos have you been to the Keck Observatory I've never gone there because I you know I should it's amazing it's amazing the view up there my grandkid changes your your your place like your idea of your place in the world the first time I saw it we're so visual beings yes that you know what changed me are those round think the round films about the Wall of China seen that and those uh whatever those places are those theaters IMAX yeah oh I'm talking about yeah those gigantic theaters where everything's around you yeah you get to see it visually yeah well the Keck ii-i've been do it a few times but one time I caught it perfectly where there was no moon out and the sky was clear and it was unbelievably beautiful you see the whole Milky Way see all the stars the entire skies filled with stars it didn't even seem real and it just makes you feel like you're looking through the windshield of a spaceship flying oz balls well there's this app you can get to that will chart the Stars for you and it's so cool and if you hold your phone up which I felt my pool and you hold it and that you hold it up there and you look and it's like yeah yeah there's this yeah you know yeah I can't remember I had a similar app maybe it's the same there's this spot constellation yeah yeah yeah yeah no it's incredible it is incredible there's not there's nothing like seeing yet all of that pales when it comes to me thinking about me it's funny it's so incredible that's one of the things that helps people think about their place in the world when you see something as magnificent and enormous as the Milky Way and I do like all that you see the Milky Way so clear that it doesn't even look real I'm only caught it like that once the other two times that I want you to see cancel everything the other two times that I went it was still beautiful but not as stunning as the one time where I caught it one time I messed up and I got there on as a full moon it was a mess you couldn't hardly see anything when the other time was really cloudy it was hard to see but the one time I saw it it was just oh to this day I think back on it blows me away because it really shifted you know in a real tangible way the way I viewed people on a planet in space it just it's undeniable because it's so gorgeous and so epic centering your eye and expanding your whole mind yeah and that does something to your big-ass program DNA shit you know once the eye sees it and takes it in it's like the image once the image is digested you know the image you know they say where does it stop being that and become this Ryan you know all that integration that's the word integration yeah in the mind I think that lack of ability to see that is one of the things that's really screwed us up more than anything about modern civilization with all our lights our street lights and city lights you can't see the sky anymore when there's no lights at all then you see all the stars and then you realize like oh we're in space we're in space like this is just the nighttime I'm not just in Manhattan looking at the sky no the we're in space when you have a full blackout in a place like Manhattan and also you look at this guy like what is going on all these stars have been here the whole time but you could never see him light pollution it's a terrible I never heard of put like that light pollution is a terrible thing that we've done we've denied people the view of the most gorgeous thing and all of the universe the universe itself there's no say they put up those lights to help the homeless so you know they don't get raped and murdered that's a that's what San Francisco did sir San Francisco did to help the homeless there this just increased the lights thanks Nance I mean it really helped though you've gotta admit that really helps so many people the lights yeah not to get raped and stuff when they were living in a pile of shit yeah and a few broken needles there what am I getting you seen it I have what it's like it's like where was that place we used to always talk about in India oh yeah yeah Calcutta it's fucking fall on yeah and it goes four blocks and I just don't think that in California that should be allowed well it's way worse than it's ever been before and it keeps getting worse my friend what happened with those fires how come they don't have any water what was all that fire stuff well it was a perfect combination of wind and dry things and you know the long drought that we have is a lot of dead trees yeah burn through everything that was terrible that's bad land management don't you think there's certainly that but there's also lack of resources you know there's a lack of understanding that something like that can happen sometimes it takes something like that to happen maybe that was hidden bottom like Tiffany says and maybe now it's going to come back up that'd be good if it you know did the hourglass flip or so okay we hit the bottom now and now let's build back something good I'm better and stronger you know just by talking to each other more right because we could come up with solutions and in every community I I mean maybe I could do a podcast and try to unite people but there's so many things people could do to help their community right now that doesn't cost nothing and a lot of people my age you know well they have some free time I mean they're probably all babysitting their grandkids like we all are because their parents are working but if you ask them free time in this generation which happens to be the most educated and the most the richest of women that's ever been maybe maybe you could put some time towards doing something that help the children in your community yeah we could start that like in little pods all over the place you know and then we could all report to each other the data so we can make it bigger and more connected yeah I haven't seen anybody that has a real solution for the homeless problem in LA or even a solution I haven't heard one thing that makes any sense people are saying they're gonna do them Walmart's like that on the internet I saw it Walmart's yeah the mall marks are gonna house the homeless that's what I saw good so it's gonna be a crash and there's gonna be a lot of people losing their homes again they're gonna have to go to Walmart's and live live in Walmart's like Walmart and camps I can't what you mean yeah the whole thing the whole unit really yeah like you know where they put people who come here and they have to house a lot of people you know like they did after Katrina in the Super Bowl I mean that the house a lot of people after catastrophes okay I'm at catastrophe causes homelessness yes that has to be addressed right the future right like what about right now the problem the homeless problem right now how would anybody fix that sixty thousand people just in LA how do you fix that well a lot of people do this a lot of people that I know actually go and meet one homeless person and tried to help that one person and take them into their homes these are people who are wealthy and you know the aunt and they you know help them clean up and go to school and people are doing things like that individually and it works well the problem I think those mental illness and drug addiction and you know most people don't first they're gonna have to get off drugs right but most people don't have enough time to babysit another adult human being and try to guide them through this life well some of us like to stick our nose in other people's business and get involved too I'm wanted I'm an old Jew I love it and I love telling people just exactly what I think they should do to better themselves and you know what I've done it a lot and it's worked every time never had one failure you never I'd myself on that telling someone what to do you mean hell yes really yep you never had one to myself we told someone except myself so you about it giving yourself advice I'm going to other people yep I know exactly what should be done to help people turn their life around I've done it a lot and it's always worked some were just assholes oh right like Tom you know when you sober up a guy he's you know a sober asshole I mean a drunk asshole can sometimes become a sober asshole and there's not much difference and people should be very aware of that particularly women just being sober out on me shit it's what do they do don't matter to me like in my act I want to say good evening ladies and gentlemen you know who you are you know because I don't care what you look like or nothing that's what you do and how you act toward me have your night nice to me not gonna be nice to you how was the tour when you were touring with dice I know you you you went on stage with him in Vegas that's what I've heard about it you brought me back from the dead and as you plan on going up that night no no he told me to and I was like oh my god no and I I went in the bed and I had like 40 nervous breakdowns I called everyone I knew and you know hardly anyone takes my calls anymore really yeah cuz they're like stop you know cuz I obsess over and over and over and over should I go on I don't know if I should go on I don't I think I wouldn't be able to do it if I get really so you think I should go I don't think I could do it I can't go on yeah he talked to you like a big brother to me I love that guy I never had a big brother you know I was the big sister I said come down here you only have to do five and I'm gonna sit on the stage behind you so how much better can that get during his show oh yeah you can't go wrong and he worked it out to where it would look like it was just happening right we had rehearse at her for you diver we well received the people in the audience loved it and then this tour it was so wonderful it was a it was a fucking boatload of fun oh my god I had so much fun a lot of my friends came where she goes the audience was great we went somewhere in Long Island and somewhere in Atlantic City and the audience was great and they they were very kind to me and I had a blast I have to say I was I really got to unload all the shit of people I hate who I hate and why I own I did an hour oh wow usually I do 90 but you know we Sharon so I'm like good I'm happy to do an hour and and then dice came out and you know it was like that guy I didn't you know how he is just he's a fucking master at what he does fucking guy I can't believe it I mean the level of performance because I was I'm like this man was that I've had right I'm a bit okay but he's over there you know I he gets into it yeah like a rock star yeah and you know it was they loved him they you know it was a mostly man the couple jokes I had about feminism it was silent it was a silent because I have this one girl kit usually kills her I go I've talked about Caitlyn Jenner they got she got the you know she went full chest Bruce Jenner went full Chaz Bono and now he's Caitlyn Jenner she's Caitlyn Jenner and she she went full Chaz Bono Wow a little different I mean Chaz she had the added dictum II but about know that's the name and but it's way harder go from a man to a woman because of it they do they take in this room they tell you this table they come in there and they cut your pay in half and it wasn't one laughs not one they show laughed piss me off so you did too and that's it we did you and then dice goes okay well let's let's digest let's see you know after the winter is over if we want to do more or let's do more because neither of us wants to go anywhere in the winter we're both Jewish I suppose everyone to think he's Italian babies very Jewish Andy Andrew silverstein Saperstein silverstein I know it's a pristine is it yeah it's how pristine really yeah and you SAP okay yeah but who knows I could be wrong I can't remember anything yeah you could be right too though I think all right so he's he's a genius at performance level 490 fuckin minutes ya know I've always state of the art yeah so he's um he's like back he's great yes in here right he just moved to New York he's getting so much work oh really he actually took apartment in New York I'm like eh you better have two bedrooms and I might crash there because he's fun to do you know he's doing a lot of stand-up yeah his whole new thing about is the mature view of the same guy you know like datin the same girls as his sons and stuff that's good stuff that's funny that's awesome but I might move to New York too cuz you know if somebody's got a shake something up no and I feel like shaking something up and then I get very tired just go to Hawaii but you know I just the thing I must he want to shake up is comics be brave stick up for each other now if you guys had stock up more for me I think it would have stopped but you ignored it cuz you're like well she is hold bitch anyway she's done a lot of fucking stupid shit I think sometimes when the shit hits the fan with certain people other folks get nervous it's gonna come at them if they defend you of course but you know now they're starting it's real weird to see a turnaround like Piers Morgan you know he he was quick to call me a racist on his show he said she's absolutely a racist to have compared this and that and saying she looks like this but of course I never said that that's his interpretation of what I said which now he has a little bit more time away from so he's just called and said he would love to interview me and my publicist said well after calling her a race I'd doubt that will happen and he said well I'm very sorry and I want to apologize to her I reacted you know a knee-jerk reaction as I think he's also recognizing and he wrote some he did some stuff about it recently where he was on I think he was on the bench a pyro show where he was talking about it and there was a clip that guy retweeted the clip do I do beat down on that Ben Shapiro one of these days yep what cuz he needs it what does he need to be town for because he's a young man that's how I'm gonna talk to people now listen to me young man you may think you know what a thing or two about Judaism but you do not know as much as I know so you sit down and listen that's what I'll say well maybe he would just listen you don't have to do all that well I just did it anyway Pope has been talking a lot about how ridiculous this outrage culture is cancel culture yeah they call it that because of my show nobody else got cancelled you know what's your name called the president's Jewish daughter a see you or to see you next Tuesday and not an outing to her because she liked Hillary I mean it's just going to show it just was all partisan and our media SH is that belongs to the people the the airwaves are the people's air wave another way to show a private public money going into private hands through corporate maneuvering but the the airwaves are belong to the public so you can't use the public's airwaves I see it way I see it to to dumb down the public so they won't vote for you not putting poison in their community or their food it's all a scam from top to bottom it's all a scam every bit of it it's gonna implode it is imploding I don't think Society as long as people have love in their hearts for their children and their children's friends and each other community government you know collapse we keep trying this 700 years of artificial intelligence yeah well I just explained it for the last however long what I mean what do you mean by artificial intelligence how is artificial intelligence running everything it's MKULTRA mind control a mind control program that shoved down the fucking throats of a populace of a captive population like what is happening when you say MKULTRA mind control artificial intelligence like what is happening to us well we're being bred for certain things before bed well we were bred but we're being activated for certain things and I'm mostly talking about the mentally ill because I can see where you know all these things these several things that happened that was a mentally ill person who had mental health issues and that's why it needs to be talked about and mental health issues come in all colors sizes and preferences and it's time to seriously do something about it rather than just looking the other way as people die in filth on your fancy Street cinema of America we can't do this we have to have something else it can't be what it has been either it has to be a synthesis between all sorts of economic plans and like Johnny and I we talk about this 24/7 me and my boyfriend that's all we live for is to come up with a solution really and we talk about people ISM which is a hybrid it has to be a secret a synchronized hybrid of the use of money of making capitalism local and kind which we can't believe nobody's thought of it yet but this was part of my green plan for the peace and freedom parties of socialist in 2012 well I see that the okay zo solitude whatever name is or nacio saw AOC I can't marry well she took my green cross of course she took my green thing and fucked it up and I'm pissed because I did think I did put forth solutions in fact I before Trump I was the only politician running for any kind of office who came out with solutions and I thought that I influenced Trump because I ran my campaign totally on Twitter and self-financed and you know all those things and talking about a plan to make a to make our communities work for us the citizens are you in contact with him yeah a little bit yeah oh yeah it is like a fuckin Mick Jagger rock star bigger he's bigger than the Pope I mean he is and what happened today in the Vatican that's what I was gonna ask you today didn't you see you saw it right what did you see I haven't even looked at the net let's check in with conspiracy headquarters Jamie's not consuela I mean on the Internet Oh Jamie what does it say about Jamie's like the opposite of the Vatican mm-hmm finances really Oh finances it should be a lot of computers no no I'm fucking it no natis a lot of computers were taken oh no a lot of kid born yes there'll be a lot of horrible shit anyplace you look whether it's in the church or you know yeah but the Vatican's like uniquely gross in that regard I mean I think there's certain who lives in that city you know that it's its own nation once its own nation yeah yeah and there's 30 women in that nation see what does that tell ya hmm that can tell you somethin might think well when they were looking for that when they found bodies yeah kids come through there thousands of bones not a lot of a lot of teachers bring their students there to see history because it does have history that's what makes me mad as when it has a history of art and it's all fuckin art is totally fuckin compromised by church and state yeah so that the only way you can see it is by supporting their war on us something else is going to happen like Tiffany is talking about a new way of art you know it's kind of like crowdsource art I just like those ideas like what have we made a movie that way that'd be cool we Shammi what is the what's the rate about what to read and financial information and thought of it the computers yeah I think they're not really because it's being invested and it was at the moment it was the vatican police who did it that's what's so great because for a long time i've been saying or feeling like you know all the good people are coming together and leaving the bad people by the side of the way which that's what we have to do we cannot include those parts of our peoples who are bad anymore and that's how they work just for a couple of generations here but now we got to let our own bad people go and we're not we don't protect nothing bad we embrace good in every other all worldwide good comes to good and it even happened with the Vatican police the good because I always say like when I talk spirituality I know you don't care about astrology or any of those things that I meant to but I felt like the good was winning over the bad for a long long time now and tipping the balance and this was proof to me because it's like the good came together against the bad together that's what's gonna happen everywhere it is happening it's just really chilling and wonderful to think about the things that you know President Trump has done by jet by one or two actions he's taken like what well he's so nice to the Jewish people Joe he's the only president in the whole fucking Western world who ever liked us really yeah he liked us oh I almost didn't like the Jewish people are you kidding no no no no no no mmm in another hallway no he don't he he liked some he likes someone what else is Trump done that you really like well when his daughter is there she will light the Sabbath candles in the White House on Friday night Ivanka so you're just all about anything Jewish not anything but only they're good I don't like the bad I'm not going further good right the good is okay we have the ability to really fix some shit that's the best part we can travel deserts takes us 40 years to go three miles cuz we're so stupid but once we get it right you know we can keep building something that works for all of us and we can all like actually like each other and then I could as a grandmother I feel that I'm denied this to be able to travel freely in the world going to different cultures and sampling their wonderful foods you denied this yes well because you know you know there are some countries who don't welcome Jewish people okay but I like their food so I don't see why they can't have me over I was recently invited to Egypt though because I've pitched so much online about why do they know they like me everyone likes me I don't I'm not a mean person right you know I mean to the devil that's rebel I don't like that goddamn devil you think the devil's real the devil in my head is what's the devil in your head say what's the worst thing it's ever said said the worst things you could say but do you think it's really the devil or you oh yeah oh it's not me but do you think it's mental illness yeah that's my devil right and I like for a lot of us we do have that devil boys a lot of people do we got a devil voice well we're the you know were the ancestors of some pretty violent animals you think so I used to think that wait till this whole plan of the Apes thing Joe and now I'm gonna tell you exactly what I think about that I think apes evolved from humans so humans were first yeah and then well you know there's a whole fossil record right yeah they actually understand the understan well they do it by carbon isotope dating they hope I'm not in except you know not accepting that's why they call it a theory of evolution because it's not correct the carbon isotope dating or is a carbonized toast do you believe in honks yes early yeah have you looked around lately yeah I don't think it's perfect I think there's a problem with society that we let I mean it's a terrible thing to say but there's a lot of people that don't really have the best genetics or the best life experiences or the best things to offer and they're breeding and they're doing a terrible job of raising children I so agree I that's one thing I am really getting pissed at is how these women are raising their kids when I see them out I get so goddamn mad Joe I get so fucking irate a lot of terrible men out there too they seem more mean women to their kids than men there's a lot of mean men well there are usually main to the mom there's a lot the mourner usually mean to the women but the women take it out on the kid don't you think um I think men are mean to kids too yeah this is mean people and they were someone was mean to them and it's an imperfect cycle you know I think that's what I'm getting at it said evolution even if it is real there's a lot of people that are I mean it's not like the best versions of humans or all that's represented today in 2019 there's just want to make sure everyone gets mentioned so nobody because the thing I think that is the enemy of humans is self righteous indignation I think that's the devil and when that devil starts talking in my head that's always where it starts with the self righteous indignation which gives me the right to do any means you know right because I'm not with the other right the others are wrong they're the other you're the right one yeah and it's not gonna work just not gonna work Rosanna I hope you do a podcast I really do and if you really want to do I'm gonna help you I'm gonna connect you I'll connect you to someone who set it up plus I think I could really help a lot of people because I have learned to live with catastrophic mental illness I mean I fuck
