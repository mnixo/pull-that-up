here we go in five four three two one yes and all the fucking people that make me feel lazy in this world is - okay make me feel you in the rock you fuckers don't look like you ever sleep and I don't know no days off that's why I love is unattractive ass he's a he's a person that that motivates me inspires me in effect that we're we're coworkers were friends I think is I think it's like it's a blessing it's a blessing to be around that yeah because it truly it's it's uplifting you know it makes you it just makes you weed out the circle when you're around people that truly give you like give you some good serve a good value to you and your life you then look at those that don't and you can you can then push away so I'm big on I'm big on personality I'm big on energy I'm big on will and once I believe that is contagious so if you have a bunch of laziness and a bunch of bullshit around you naturally it's gonna feed off you're gonna find yourself becoming what's in your environment so I feel the exact same way and when I see I see that in you I see that in you I've seen avatar I see you I see you yeah but a guy like that like I always wonder like how much of that is look I've had sleep experts on the podcast to tell you like like there's real problems if you don't get enough sleep like you could you have a much higher risk of Alzheimer's well there's other serious issues but I see a guy like the rock I'm like how the fuck does he sleep what where's the room to for sleep you know that that's true I can't say that I'm that I've witnessed the sleep patterns but he's a he's a late ass so he does I know he's sleeping to some rest which is well-deserved but you know when you when you say you had these sleep experts and stuff on it's always a thing that I go back and forth about because what is enough sleep like I'm a person I function high off of six to seven hours yeah six seven hours I'm I'm functioning yeah five hours I'm great do I do the five hour thing all the time no but if I have to I'm fine I don't need the eight and the nine like that's too much for me like I'm I'm an early riser and now I'm getting older you know if I can get in that bed by 9:30 or 10:00 on an off workday I'm very happy with that but then I'm up at 5:30 I'm up at 5:00 so what is it enough sleep what do they tell you this really depends on the person there are people that have a gene where they can just sleep for hours at night I got gone oh my god I got that what is that gold what is that what does this means you got special gene goddamn right Amalia yeah that's um shit there are there are people that just don't need as much they can they can go a long time without sleep diagnosed me I'm one of those people you thought you might be I bet a lot of high functioning people are cuz your body tends to you get more efficient you know like you you're always going you're burning hard so your body's like when it's time to shut down it's like shut down get that five six hours in alright do you do well I will confess this I am an amazing cat Napper yeah I'm one of those guys if you stop talking to me long enough i'ma fall asleep right here it's something about silence real and just not doing anything and I just well it's probably probably going on momentum all the time you probably you're probably going on motivation and momentum okay then when your body has this break you've already here's a little sleeper that's just right I'm dead serious that's I know for sure that that's accurate cuz I'm how catnapping heartbeat do you feel like you've hit a good balance so this is what I was wonder about guys like you or guys like the rock when I look at your Instagram your social media and you're just constantly going like god damn do you ever feel like you do too much like maybe I just need to take a little break here do you ever feel like that I think perception definitely perceives reality you know what looks like so much isn't always so much because you have a schedule and you know within that schedule there's the things that mean the most that come in act is downtime you know me in my house is downtime even though it's still active and I gotta be dead and I'm with the kids and a wife in this conversation and I'm running around and I'm back for that still exes downtime for me like I'm shutting a work off so the phone is any office I'm not going back to get it until the morning and it's all conversation it's all TV it's all Taco Tuesdays it's couch and cuddling you know baby time whatever that's my downtime because I'm taking a step outside of the other shit that's wise that's that's what I think I do very well I can step outside the other shit I can separate it so I think when you're able to do that then you're you're managing your mental you don't mean like if it's if it's always one thing all the time that's how you fucking drive yourself crazy cuz you never you're never shutting it off yeah and I think I do a good job of shutting shutting this off and focusing on this like when I want my family I'm with my family nothing is nothing interjects or comes in between that's fantastic that's so important it's understand that's beautiful I doubt that's gigantic I think I figured it out that's it you mean you've got so much success it's all you have to be with that fucking phone all the time that's that that's the phone is the big one right well phone the phone is is the gift and the curse mm-hmm you know I think that we we shout out the gate and saw the gift oh my god it's it's it's community is connecting us we're able to share we're able to meet new people we're able to stay in communication with with all people find new people as entertainer I can engage with my fans and this is so dope and then after that you get hit with the the curse and the curses there's a there's a high level of negativity that's out there that's on that shit you know there's there's a lot of people that are you know not happy or going through things and they interject a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices these devices are the easiest way to touch everybody so when you're just consumed on that shit all day you start to see yourself being a part of the negative shit yeah so what I've learned to do is go I don't I don't need to see that I don't need to see that shit I don't I don't pay that any mind I don't read that shit for what it's not it's not helping me it's not making me better it's not it's not pushing me to new limits if anything is taken up just creative space by me literally spending time going and navigating through what I think is is a bunch of bullshit you know so I don't let the device beat me and at one point I definitely did at one point it was everything there was everything you know now I separate it I'm not embrace clear of it what when you realize what it is when you see when you see the bad you know when you see the bad side of it I thought the other day this is some real shit and it really made me think my phone died my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the fucking maps and I said shit what the fuck am I get to with I don't know where I'm going I said I was like you know how did we how did we get from point A to point B before the map shit what were we doing that I used to print out directions from Google Maps I remember that but then before that how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to get to I don't even remember remember Thomas guys do you remember Thomas Scott I did have a Thomas guy when I first moved to LA I did have a Thomas guy and I know look a hundred percent bill burr had one two a three years ago but it really fucked me up because I was like how do we don't even know how how to do the common yeah the the the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I literally had to to drive to store rocket buy a charger charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where the fuck I was going I had no idea how to get there I had no I didn't know no numbers by heart I didn't know who I was gonna call oh my god this is the moment where I was like what level of success have I reach I just pulled over and I said here and I was like how the fuck am I gonna get the widow's bear phone man I don't know what it were a backup phone it felt like the end of the world if it felt like it was over house like shit and that crazy I dependent you are but that's when the light bulb started to click yeah it started to click like how how do we function without I want to go backwards a little bit yeah it's still there I still need it I still think it's dope with all of the things that we can do want it but I still want to be able to put it down and step away from it my kids to be able to step away from it that's why when I come in the house my phone is up cuz I can't I can't bitch and get playing it's all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same thing right right so that time those conversations me wanting to know about your day you talking to me about your day your friends who you like who don't you like my daughter you what boy who what no ok my son yeah I like somebody who oh jesus here it comes it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know I think it's it's it's big to make sure that you prioritize that are you worried about what comes next hundred percent I'm worried that something's gonna be way more intrusive than that it'sit's what do you mean it's already happening yeah the biggest scare happened already with the the the FaceTime shit that happened where whatever whoa Apple on the iPhones it was like people could listen in to your oh yeah if you didn't need to pick up the FaceTime you could just yeah and you know that was the scariest shit ever because it's if it's that easy to have a bug like that what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about oh there's definitely government listen to us well hunter is it yeah 100 everything everybody says and then in case one day you do something wrong they go by your side mr. Hart we'd like you to sit down from NYU something hundred percent yeah so the fear is the next level of them are intrusive you know I think everything has become intrusive now like the toughest thing for me is that there is no there is no privacy outside my home right you know the the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on you know people to to be with me security to be on my home you know it's like they're there literally is no privacy and it's not a bit you complain about it because without the fans without the people that support me I wouldn't be where I am but there's no middle ground right you know there is no handshakes anymore it's it's how you doing right right right yeah a handshake is so much better right I get a moment like I'm we can talk if that's what you no no yo say it now weird cuz you you're doing this to me it's kind of weird to have a conversation so you're just starting to see yourself become a little older and wiser and uh just really see the times for what they are and see the direction that we're going in this people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground because I think right now that is it one yeah that's what I'm feeling now no I feel it too and I especially I mean what you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy but everyone's losing their privacy yes slowly but surely it's it's happening to you because you're very famous and because you do something that's in the public eye and people want to see you and they want to stick that camera in front of you but there's gonna come a point in time where what we're dealing with now which is like you have to turn your phone on you have to you know you have to reach out to somebody you have to put something up that's that steps gonna be out of the way who's gonna be people being able to act that's your life yeah pretty you know you know the bad here's what I said it's bad that really fucks with me I don't like that negativity is the the want you know like like the the thing that's popular is the failure the the fuck up you know the the fight that I can catch you know the hateful moment that I can catch and post like the bad is being highlighted and celebrated that's what fucks with me what the social media shit now what really bothers me is you know when you see these things online like you know a fight and there's a man hitting a woman and it's captured right that's bad the bad thing is that you watched that the the video was more important than the actual help right or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things where you're catching people do these things to kids and it's caught the moment of what you got and what you want to post and get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help yeah and that's that's the part that is just I just have a hard time processing I have a hard time processing what the likes mean to certain people well you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you anyway it means something to a regular person but you a regular person if they can catch some worldstar video and put it up they're like dude that's my video that's my video look my video got 5 million hits yeah my video has gone viral my videos everywhere for them it's like it's a point of excitement that's why when they see you look oh shit how often are they gonna run into Kevin Hart at you know Costco or wherever the fuck you were definitely running right it to me on uh you know I'm in a I'm in a bathroom restaurant and I go to the bathroom you know by the way that I went to the bathroom you could definitely tell I had to shit I was I was moving fast I was he knows one of those abrupt you know why you eatin yeah I'm eating bad so I didn't eat bad in a while my stomach immediately said that's not gonna happen today I get up and I go and literally like like three seconds I hear it as I'm walking or they go keV hard and as I'm walking by a guy gets up follows me in the bathroom he's like yo I gotta get a picture man and I said let me let me go to the bathroom when I'm done I'll take a picture with you I go to the bathroom this is a true story hannah bible hand on the Bible I assume the guys outside the bathroom cuz I as I'm going I see him and I say what I say I get done I go to the snake wash my hand he was just sitting behind a wall and he's like got his phone out I'm like he probably did he just take me while I was shitting dude put the phone over the thing like I'm about to be on oh my god it's over this is it this is my nightmare here we go they're about to put something up of me shittin is the bottom of my feet it's whatever yeah but he just waited and in that moment was so it was so important that he was in the bathroom and soon as I got a call on the second I said let's go outside the bathroom yeah let's take a picture it's a bathroom I said might am I going to I'm a nice guy man I'm gonna take the picture cuz I just don't want to lose you and I'm like there's not even a thought it's not even a thought about it's a bad price how weird is that Sebastin minutes this is a this is a pretty fucking weird moment man this is weird Halloween you will be the finish shit no no what you got on your phone right you're too big for me to ask to go through your phone or whatever you got you got but I had to go out and take the picture and I remember going back to the table just like what's happening that's not strange at this point what is happening yeah that didn't exist before I think if you were famous before people just wanted to get an autograph or shake your hand what Pat what passed an autograph stage was last time you get an autograph it's been a while I don't write it I was I think I would know what to put that it's been a minute man yeah and I don't want to make this very clear you know it's not I don't I don't know you know I understand like once again I want people to more importantly understand the fact that I welcome it yeah I welcome the moment that I can talk in and converse with the fame but it should be that like it's normal people the moments are better when they're real you know and after a real moment you you get a picture because you're like yo he was actually a nice guy or I know I did it that you would be this calm and cool you don't even get to see how genuine of a person I am because the first thing you do you you you stick the camera in the face you and that's when people think that you're an asshole because they they they they have the intrusive moment that then gets met with the can you keep please I'm sorry you're not the you look at my face you're gonna be like that they look for that now you get your moment yeah you you look for the negative moment when does it start getting weird for you but how many years in um I know it's been it's been pretty crazy I've been pretty crazy for like the last four to five the last four to five years and the last three you know if it's gotten insane because now you know you're you're on an international level its global and the following is is bigger and it's all ages which is which is really really good but I think you know for comedians it's a different thing because you feel like you know comedians you know you're laughing we're in your homes everything is met with warmth so when you see a comedian especially if you're a fan of a comedian you're associating everything with funny and you're just looking for the funny moment right you're you're looking past a normal moment you know it's like you you almost are frowned upon if you're normal if you just chill right right right because everybody wants the funny moment right they thought you were gonna be funny like I'm supposed to I suppose a pop lock right on the site you know yeah if it's 2:00 in the morning and you run into me and I say hey how you doing man that's not enough when work out your shit now mm-hmm I've seen you at the Comedy Store but only once where do you work out your shit I like to go to random comedy clubs you know I think I'll go to New York first New York has always been a home when it comes to building putting some structure within a set that you trying to figure out once I got a skeleton of what I want to do I'll just go to West Palm I love that comedy club The Improv down there and all the place is great I'll stay for two weeks Oh real and just go and run through some jokes I'll go to Utah I'll go to Denver who do two wise guys yeah yeah yeah I'll go to comedy clubs just random comedy clubs that you wouldn't expect to see me at but I'll do a hell of a run and the goal is to get out of there with just a foundation not to have a complete set I just want to get a foundation so when I'm done getting the foundation then I'll do a little comedy club run I'll do a full comedy club run where I'll just put two or three months in and it's comedy club comedy club comedy club and I'm doing seven shows a weekend and people are shocked that I'm there and then I'm doing it but you know that's my that's my gym that's how I work and I end up leaving that period of time with a complete set after the first three or four months that I spent now after that comedy club three or four months on that run then I take it to like a small theater I see what my laughter feels like in a small theater and I do a little run in small theaters and then when I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the the laughs consistently and the punchlines are working and I flipped it back frontwards forward every direction and my story is a real roller coaster and it has an ending where I feel like we get off the roller coaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there for an hour mmm is then when I go test it out in every nough and if the arena if the last er sounds the way it's supposed to then I say okay I'm ready if it doesn't then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again so not to that arena sounds the way it's supposed to do I say I'm going on tour so sometimes it takes me about a year a year and three months here in four months you know people don't say how hard it is to develop our of stand-up material people act like you just turn on a new hour it's it's an hour to get to an hour you're going through four to five hours of bullshit that you thought was funny yeah to come up to that hour that you finally say this is gonna be the representation of me this year yeah it's a lot for me to do that especially at this level you know well especially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a bunch of other stuff to stuff yourself yeah you don't take any breaks white or I actually you know when I'm touring if there's a movie I make the movie schedule around the torso my shooting days will go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday rap Thursday maybe ever show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday Friday Saturday sometimes no show Sunday sometimes show Sunday depending on what the work schedule and the workload for the following week would look like so I'm implementing that in so when I say I'm out I'm out I'm gone yeah so I've knocked that movie out in two months and then when I'm not that tour schedule shifts so the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday dedicated the family dedicated to an office everything then those weekends are torn but that's all last for a year and a half I mean this year we did 157 shows on my irresponsible tour Wow 157 show before you decided to put it on the Netflix special yeah we did the Netflix the taping I think I did it three weeks before we were done so we probably had 143 shows oh wow then I taped it and finish the tour did you always have this kind of structure like when did you how did you design this thought-out individual yeah I mean thought-out individual it's not random no everything is planned if you look at all my stand-up specials there's a two-year gap in between them so the two-year gap is because at the end of that second year my new special should be coming out when a new special should be coming out I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be so that first year is all development like right now I'm off I'm not touring but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked about a way that's now thrown out can't repeat it can't say it now it's talking about what the new version of myself is going to be what do I want the conversation to be and what's my thinking and just taking notes so eventually now I'm gonna start just popping up a random comedy clubs and trying to figure out what the next thing is so by mid mid 20 I'm probably doing comedy clubs by the end of 20 I have a full fledge concept of that new hour and by the beginning of 21 I should be ready to go out with my new hour hmm end of 21 film my new our mid 22 that hour will come out that seems like a schedule a lot of people are doing now the 2-year schedule it's a perfect get yeah that's hard dude I know louis c.k did a year every year and George Carlin did every year but I think even he said really wasn't the right way that's tough a year stuff yeah I mean that's a that's a shout-out to those that can't do it I think that's amazing [Music] I think just for everything that I have going on and all of the different things that my hands are in within the brand the business I need to make sure that I'm giving a hundred percent change those things so they have the highest opportunity to be successful right if I'm trying to cheat it then it's gonna show you know it's not gonna come out to the best of my ability and with that stand up you got a you got a fucking magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the biggest thing for an entertainer artists whatever your craft is is creation how you recreating yourself how are you constantly showing that you're growing for me the only way to do that is to talk about my life and the things that grow along with me the only thing that grows along with me my experiences my family my marriage my mistakes my UPS my downs those are the things that I can talk about further because as you get older things change it gets different it's all coming from my personal opinion of me my view on me and how I see Life you can't lose material in that state mmm that's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after a while for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should like what well politics I don't know joke in the politics I don't I don't joke and anything that has to do with the slander of others or other communities I don't do anything divisive good for you that's my that's my biggest thing and you know this past year was was one that got a little weird because I was like you know I've really dedicated myself to breaking people together like I'm I know that was my my goal that's my priority I damn sure thought that's what I was doing on a global scale everybody all races shapes sizes whoever you are whatever you are you can come to a Kevin Hart show I have a good time so when it came off as if I was a person that was divisive that was tough you talking about the Oscar Oscar shit yeah this is a time where people are just looking to be upset about things a hundred they're they're not looking to looking at you Kevin Hart as just a human being like what who is he who overall super positive they're not even concentrating on that I mean think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what nine years ago it was a it's a it's a wake up call of understanding the times but it more importantly you know for me it was okay I went through it I made sure that the people of the LGBTQ community really understand it hey guys I apologized before but I'm apologizing again I'm sorry I'm not that guy I don't want you to think I'm that guy then it just became the constant conversation there never happened that it just became the constant conversation and and now it is guys I'm not only sorry I don't condone anything that has to do with hate to anybody this is no longer conversation so guys I'm gonna stop talking about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into yes what not I I know I'm not the world and public should understand and know them not because over this time period I've shown that I'm not so the apology once again I'm sorry genuinely I'm sorry but then it just kept it just it never stopped and at that point I just made a decision and I'm like guys at this point I just I'm making a decision to not talk about it anymore that doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody that doesn't mean as I'm shutting down anything it means that for me I'm gonna stop talking about it because at this point I don't know what to do at this point I thought I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do I did it I made sure did you understand that I'm not a hateful person at Noga don't hate I did that I stepped down so I don't take attention off of that night knows people that are there to be celebrated I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me I step down everything I did was for the better of good I'm stepping away guys because I don't want this to be a negative night or a negative thing and then it still became a conversation so I waited for it to die down I went on my radio show gave another public apology make sure doesn't he understand it I'm sorry I hope these words didn't hurt anybody I once again apologized I don't condone hate to anyone I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes of oh so now I say if you don't understand it you don't believe it I don't know what else to give I don't know what else to do there's nothing else you can do that's very wise of you nothing it's very wise easy to step away like that because if you didn't they would probably pursue it forever but I mean it's it becomes a point of attention that's all it is it's decided that this is something they're gonna focus on what I had a I had a good talk and I'm gonna talk about this for a minute friend of mine Lee Daniels you know man Lee Daniels Lee called me told me where to talk to you know Lee Daniels is director producer the show empire's his biggest shows you know so he calls me he's like everyone talk to you and and I was talking he's like look this is a time where you could speak up and talk about you know the community that's been affected by hatred and you know hateful crimes you can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't stand with any type of hate or whatever you can take that stage and do that and I said Lee I said that's I understand what you're saying I said well why did you expect me to know what's been happening with in this community in regards to hate and crimes I said I I'm not aware I said some people can just not be aware I'm not even no I have no idea what's going on I have no idea yes within that community I have no idea right when you tell me this I'm now educated and I understand so it's easy to simply inform right information is key when people get information they process the information when you can process the information you go oh wait a minute that makes sense hey if you guys think that I can don't hate wait a minute I don't and anybody that does fuck you man that's bad you shouldn't I can say that but instead when this happened it was become an ally mmm become a voice you know and that's that's where there was just a miscommunication that's where a back and forth kind of was established that I think people just started to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation yes yeah when I'm trying my best to it was becoming tabloid bullshit as opposed to like a real discussion click me yeah click click me that's the problem there's so much bait out there because it's such an effective way to get people to pay attention to things because as you said people focus on failure and negative and anger that's what we want to see controversy that's what we want to see people don't want to see the anger yeah and and you know we think that is because it's just the times it's it's that's what's cool now always being negative you know how you always have some people it's a great example how you have people mean you can talk about a movie all right we can talk about Titanic wow it's authentic one of the biggest movies of all time fucking great movie yes it was great movie and why guy for no reason go I fucking hated it yeah why yeah like Titanic fucking bullshit why manga yeah I know what tell me why'd you hate it I got time talk about that the cool thing is just being different I wanna I wanna be completely opposite Denali Contreras how the people you know what no no that shit was ass what Wow Wow why was it ass we have people that just like to do this oh yeah for sure and and and what happens when one person does it another person for no reason all go yeah me too yeah she was ask man i hain't like it either did you see it what y'all talkin about you don't even know what they're talking about but you just want to hop on the negative train right because that's what's cool it's not cool to be positive it's not cool to be happy I don't know if it's a cool thing I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives 100% what's the that's the factual side to it I did a joke before was like do you think Michael Jordan leaves YouTube comments like people want to get mad and complain constantly about shit like that do you know what it takes to do this right here you know right here no tell you how I feel write in your comments section Joe Rogan you can kiss my you know what that takes what do you have going that you have the time to just simply be that negative and do it in this world you know someone's just a mismanagement of your time yeah it is so valuable and I don't think people understand how valuable they can be if they use their time correctly yes now have you always been like this always be sausages oh my fucking god man but always always really I find a light in every dark tunnel I will find a goddamn light man I hear at all you listen when I tell you to wait on my back it's so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine the reason why I'm fine is because I'm genuinely happy I'm happy and I'm not happy just because of the success success X is a bonus I'm happy because I truly know the definition and the feeling that comes with happiness I truly know it I felt it I felt it when I said yo what really makes me happy and I look at heaven and Hendrix and I look his oh I look at my wife I go yo I didn't have the family shit when I was coming up yeah I got one I got one look what I did look what I built these people depend on me I provide these people that makes me happy that makes me happy when my daughter comes up dad you're not only my dad you're my best friend no I'm happy that's my world so everything else from the outside that comes in your your your throwing shit at a at a at a bubble that can't be popped mmm it's a force field around me yeah there's a force field around me because what matters what really matters loves me wholeheartedly and when you had that and you understand that you're unbreakable so if you don't add to that force field if you don't make my force field stronger you don't you don't you don't get time for me my team heartbeat productions the people underneath my umbrella you're part of my force field you what I believe we all see the same things we want the same things so we march with the same beat you can't you can't shake that when you're an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that if you have no idea what that feels like then it's easy to shake you that's why some people are easily broken being broken is not a hard thing it's not a hard thing so those that do get broken those that do get down those that do get depressed I understand I understand I don't I don't knock people for it mmm I don't not anybody for it what I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value for those that may need a little push hmm that may need a little Amen pick your chin up it's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value it's so easy but some people choose to throw that aside and kick while you're down mmm I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever is out there you I don't know what it could do for somebody else but somebody else may just simply look at me say you know the way to he embraces his kids it makes me want to be a better father yo way to this man doesn't stop and await it every day he wakes up and he's just positive regardless of what's going on makes me realize that this shit ain't so bad the way that he gets up and says hey today is another day it's the morning let's all be better than we were yesterday somebody probably needed to hear that the more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out I'm doing my part because there's so many that thought the complete opposite yeah I don't want to be a part of that that's beautiful man that's and that's true I believe you it's not it's not forced right it's not phony yeah it's not fake this shit every day I hear shit every day it's very contagious too I had a lady I heard a lady right [Laughter] lady rolled out a window when you gonna make a good movie again did you see the upside was good what's that oh shit it's a movie it's one of my movies that's how us think I think it's a good movie I see that all right ma'am you have a beautiful day that's with such conviction like literally yeah I could have said a lot of shit like she rolled a window down you could tell she still had the crank things that I could say to you ma'am when you gonna make a good movie it's napping I got one out the upside you see the outside what's that oh it's a movie so it's out now amazing it that's how she chose to come out here I see it I'm Jesus to come at you with a negative I get it every day when you'll be funny again trying my best but trying my best if it's not working for you hopefully I do better soon what do you what what am I gonna feed into that and add water right why why for what yeah for what it seems to have been working thus far are you getting this positive attitude towards life from life experience are you getting it from books did someone teach you how to find this I'm getting it from the experiences and from the the real understanding of perfection doesn't exist don't exist Oh mmm we're in a time right now where people expect perfection you expect perfection I don't know where dust came from I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for living my true understanding is all right you got one life and then one life the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability from the beginning so what said the end in the middle in the beginning middle you're gonna do things you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna fuck up you're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward life may get better it may not but somewhere along the lines is gonna click and everything that I went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here I'm able to go ahead with such a high level of knowledge and I can make other people better I can make myself better I could do more for my family something happens my dad is the prime example crazy drug addict in and out of jail life was very bad very fucking bad my dad son got successful son then took money gave it to his dad here's your house here's your truck here's your monthly at this age I want you to live your life you know made mistakes you can't rebuild and correct the things you've done I'm your son I love you you can't go back in and redo you can't try to keep going backwards ain't about me you got grandkids mmm gonna be the best grand pop you could be for these grandkids that's your focus now where's this energy devoted to being a grand pop for the grandkids don't worry about me but something happened in your life something happened that took you in the direction to reap the benefits of your son's happiness and success my energy is now contagious nothing I hand it to you so now you're able to give that off to all these other people that you're around something happens and that's in every single life in every life I understand that there's a payoff for bad eventually there's a payoff it can't be bad but for so long if you got the strength and the understanding to realize that shit will change it will change it's impossible just like poker I don't know if you play poker or not I don't you play poker you can run bad forever but it will eventually turn around once you grasp the understanding of the game eventually it's gonna turn around blackjack you're never gonna be the casino but eventually you're gonna have a good run if you catch you run you'll do good get the fuck out of there you waited long enough for it to happen here come catch it leave anything in life will eventually turn good no but this is coming just from your own personal experience have any role models that I'm up to you this way Nancy art did she speak to you like this about positivity and about my mom reinforced knowledge my mom reinforced you don't start things and not finish them you don't quit there's nothing that comes out of quitting besides knowing that you didn't finish we finish everything you started finish it if you're gonna do it do it to try and be the best not be better than other people be the best for you if you're in school and you're going to class I'm not asking you to get straight A's I'm asking you to get the best grade that you can possibly get give me a hundred percent all the time and I'm a happy mother when you half-ass me I'm on yes mom I want to do this I wanna I want to play baseball well then you gonna play my mom like that no more then why'd you start the season because I thought I wanted to do it then you gonna finish the season you don't quit there's other people that invested time and energy into you you don't just quit on people but I don't want to do it finish the season mom I want to swim then you gonna finish swim it didn't matter what I did I was never allowed to quit so now in anything I do when I pick it up a say i'ma start it I got to finish it it all don't work it all ate the best hmm it all ain't knocked out the park but I walk away saying I finished it I did it I did it right now I've been boxing I saw I saw you working out with Rico Verhoeven I'm fuckin first of all very strong kicker huge man okay he's a big guy too man good guy but I started in jeans I started it and I said why am I doing this I'm not gonna be a professional fighter I'm not trying to be a amateur fighter I'm doing the guiness shape alright then I start getting shaped I said you know so much that I don't know about the sport I at least want to make sure that I'm paying homage to the people that do this for a living by really understanding and learning it you know what I'm gonna get a real trainer I'm getting some real people to show me everything so when it's all said and done and I look back after my training I can go I gave it 100% and look at how good I got look at what I'm a product of a spar I go getting really yeah yeah just to feel it so I can say it you know well sparse Bryan Callen is this serious no it's me yeah that's me come on that's me dude that's me it's getting it to look at this who is teaching him uh his name is Biggs he's in Atlanta that's me learn I had a turtle shell within punches but you know he's a former Golden Glove guy really good to you were in a cup and everything when I was at the sparring session when I'm I grow tired damn yeah I got touched I got my ass whipped and every couple times I go guys worried about that all good I don't go crazy we had gear and but I'm not in there with guys that are trying to hurt yes I'm not in there was touching guys that have no concept of reality yeah or control like they're they're just helping me understand right here's why you have to keep yeah that is a problem with celebrities trying to spar like if you try to like you know that's why Mickey Rourke started getting all that facial surgery I'm serious he's part of James Toney Jesus lashes she's not a smart right here that's James Tony's a mean man and it's just not you can't like I don't I don't go in that space have you ever seen James Tony talk shit boys bars and there's some of the most entertaining thing you'll ever find on YouTube he's just he just won't shut the fuck up beating your ass he's talking shit that's that's bitch bitch that's her and he's one of the best defensive fighters ever so he's really difficult to hit he's got that smells fresh and a in the world yeah I had a guy who's got any Mikey I'm sparring with Mikey Mikey hit me with three punches I thought I thought Mikey literally had like six arms this is the true story this I said I don't know what just happened but I thought I had my hands up in no matter where I put him he just tapped me he lets me feel it but not to where I might getting knocked out but I understand now movement I understand pivots I understand shoulder protection and that's my goal my goal is just understand cuz I can't do anything halfway okay if you try to fight somebody nope right nope I just want to say that I did it and I learn and I can move and I look the part cuz I put time into it well as you learn it too as you watch and you start get trained then you start to look at a guy like Terence Crawford or lumen Co and you go oh now I appreciate what you're doing because before you'd see like oh yeah I beat that guy up oh yeah he knocked that guy out but then you see like how he ducks under the left and fires back with the right you know Jesus this is precision it's insane yeah the the respect that I have for people that do that on a day to day is through the roof yeah and people that fight are in the most amazing shape in the universe yeah you're in the most amazing shape ever to move get hit for three to five minutes around come back do it come back do it and these fights go on and on and on I take my hat off to you yeah you get three rounds out of me I'm breathing out my butt I don't know where the air is coming from I'm searching for it it's a crazy way to make a living to money in your brain thank God I don't I didn't have to go down that route and you know to those that do just make sure you just put your body first like you said it's a it's hurtful when you see the damage that it can call us yeah we were talking about that earlier like seeing guys as they start to deteriorate and it's hard because nobody wants to tell him that either every I want to tell them they got one more good fighting them and let's uh maybe at the end of the year then we'll decide but right now we're gonna train hard and my stuff it's hard to cuz there's no option so they don't once you've established yourself as a professional fighter and you don't have an exit strategy you don't know what to do you know now at least thankfully because of the internet guys are getting podcasts and they're starting doing commentary shows they're talking about fighting and it's the positive you just found the positive that's the positive within the internet that is positive you just don't you just don't hear it celebrate it as much well the Internet's very positive for me I mean this is the show we do on the Internet I mean all not just podcast but YouTube videos and also information I know more because of the internet than I ever would have without it there's not a not doubt in my mind a more educated more aware person I want just the Internet yeah you get the things that you're able to find and search and I mean like you said you're you're able to self-educate yeah at a very high level these are the goods yeah we're talking about the goods so when you talk about positive Kevin how have you been yeah are you always like that it's this it's the things that I look at that are so easy you're not just positive though you're look crazy ambitious that's the thing that gets me about you in the rock for sure it's like the ambitions off the charts like I know your riches fuck like when when do you think you got enough you don't have enough there's no doesn't know enough I don't have enough because it's not over it's all over it's not over so you know when when you put a cap on it you're putting a punctuation to it mm-hmm and the the the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained you know when you see what's out there like what can you mean physical things like well you see what's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth and knowledge from okay the business relationships that you're able to acquire the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things different revenue streams what I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge we don't know debt debt is welcomed because it's celebrated that's all we know and I'm get that credit card oh my fuck that credit card up and it is what it is they gotta figure that out I ain't got it after that yeah well you know what I'm getting student loans they gave it to me then after that shit is I'm figured out I put a cable bill in your name you put it in my name we can switch it up whatever they do it there let's just put it in someone else name its welcome the Hustle is welcome the knowledge of banks and what you can do it can't do is it's fucking you don't even get it cuz you go to check cashing places reason like go check cash place because I don't want go through that ship the banks I'll trust that go right there to check heads please let me get mine let me get mine now take $30 whatever let me get it the knowledge is given so it's not to you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go oh shit oh this is why you put money up oh this is this is how you increase versus decrease oh this is how you earn on your money oh wow I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is what how many people partake in a stock world and is there a part that isn't necessarily gambling is there a low-risk part these that's not the information isn't there so it's not so I got to a certain level and a certain group of people where I got it and now that I got it I want to give it so now I'm going to give it I'm gonna give it to the people that I know need it most and for me that younger generation of black people that don't understand the cool thing is in financial longevity not in a now it's not in the moment for jewelry not in the moment for the car it's in the longevity it's in building so at the end of the day you can say look at what I have look at what I worked for look at what I have that's mine monopoly is real but you have to have the financial understanding and I teamed up I got chased I never done something called financial fitness where's just about me educating people on money how to manage money how to how to be smart with your money but it's coming from a person that fucked that money I didn't always understand it I hold in taxes before because I didn't understand it in the beginning I've had bad credit credit cards wouldn't take me because I maxed out whatever I've been there I've done it thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and now that I have the knowledge I want to give it could simply don't know so when you say the end game the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family wealth when it's all said and done the last-named heart is gonna mean just more a lot more than just Kevin Hart and comedy heart beat production it's got heartbeat digital your heartbeat ventures your heartbeat real estate there's so many things that the last-named heart will be attached to you real estate Kevin Hardin sell real estate a Bible stand by it but the reason why is because investment investment but but as you get older you learn this you learn it and and you know it's such a thing where you talk about black versus white you know a lot of people do that and and I flee so like there is racism racism exists I'm not unaware of that but there is a high volume of it that's that's non-existent people had a good people and when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you see that these good successful people have taken you then become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be it so for me I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all this knowledge and take it back to the people that need it most I like to share I don't want it all by myself now are you doing this and the financial stuff you're doing this in videos you like releasing videos no we're gonna start we're gonna start financial fitness like I said with chase JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon very good guy to Shanda is well they're there helped leading in charge of saying how can we get to the people that we feel need the financial information of most so I said put me out there like let's let's go directly to the consumer so from colleges from high schools senior classes junior classes going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their life a lot of things that you should know so you're gonna speak to them and just share personal information are you gonna put this stuff online as well yeah yeah you'll be able to track and find content from it but I'm authentic so I said the best way to really do it is to put me in a position to be heard right I want to be heard like like it's a different story what I explained to the the people of JPMorgan Chase just when we were talking about this and as an amazing board of people that are just figuring this out and the best way to go and do it and I said you can't have the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are you can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not listening to you from the gate because you don't relate I don't relate to you but throwing somebody in a situation that's lived it that's been in it that's been fucked up in it made it out of it and is now coming back to help run it's a different ballgame and that's what I want to be and you know we have other voices outside of myself very powerful voices that are going to do it as well but the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be a part of the action and in doing it you'll also be able to understand my drive you'll get why I do so much you'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it and the question should be why not yeah the question shouldn't be yo why is he doing everything he should be why aren't you why aren't you trying to do everything why not well that's the thing about a guy like you that becomes contagious like what you were saying about surrounding yourself with positive people and people that are constantly ambitious and that that there's fuel to that you feel good about that that's what you're doing I can I can say seeing you here right we walked around you show me a facility loved it beautiful facility you talk to me about how your podcast is grown to where you are now the success behind it I don't leave here and go yo that's dope of shit I go hey I need to do more work on my radio station laugh out loud radio I own it it's mine I got a show on there but you know a Joe fucking motivated me to do more I want to make sure that we understand really what's out here within his radio world because I just saw my guy in his space and I saw happy he is what success he has I don't want to be you or beat you I want to take this energy and apply it to myself that's the purpose of seeing yeah that's the purpose of being smart with your eyeballs you should be a sponge so I'm a sponge so I come here and I look at how you maneuver I look at your setup I not only bow down and congratulate you I leave and I said yo man I'm inspired dude that's dope as hell John can't wait in two years you gonna call me you gonna see my shit you remember I said I was inspired but you're gonna see what I let it grow into that's the proper way to get encouraged in motivating right as opposed to being a hater a hater and in competitive yeah i'ma beat you it's not a competition yeah I'm not interested in that either and I share the exact same feelings it's not a competition at all yeah so if you don't have people like that that are inspiring around you you might not know how positive it is and how it how powerful it is if you see someone that's on television or on social media and you see them it's hard to be inspired you don't know them but you're I can say look at your circle right and in your circle if the conversation is all about what we hate I can't stay in that song you see the new fuckin car came out okay this shit is ass I can't stand that fucking car yo man I can't stay in this city what fuck we even in the city what we eatin I hate that place it's so easy if you people don't even listen to it it's so easy to be the smallest shit in the world the smaller shit but if it's always hate can't stand these fucking headphones why we got these headphones ladies like a horrible day why the buzz here fuck that Stan it's hard whatever hate harwood how could you get a private table fucking hate this shit fucking chairs you're got better chairs I hate these chips it's so easy right so easy it's so easy to talk about yeah yeah and so many people don't realize that in a group you do it you ping-pong hate off on them yeah unless it's funny it can be funny just between yourselves trees yeah Patrice was it was one of the best funny one of the best 20 haters okay okay you bring up a good point comedic hate McConaughey yeah communicate one of the not one of the probably the best Patrice Patrice I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something you just hear what would you tell buddies what what are you talking about you like just the way you talk but what your voice everything about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the face we talking about when he would go after you - it kind of made you feel good - like if you're a comments especially if your comic like I called Opie and Anthony once I was talking them and Anthony anything he always has a gun on him Harry's a gun everywhere like he has a concealed carry permit and shit and I said to him I said do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you because you're constantly dwelling on it you always have this gun and Patrice goes don't believe in magic don't believe me conjuring up the world he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I don't know but he got bill burr so Marilyn Oh bill used to get so fucking mad beautiful thing about Bill Barbara would be snap at bill bill is the guy that's not funny where's the punch line in it there's no punch line he was so fucking mad we the Comedy Cellar the days that we had there man bill burr Patrice O'Neal Keith Robinson Jim Norton Colin Quinn myself when I say we would sit at this table we would set this table for four to five hours and it would be nothing but beautiful trash ins to one another when I say they used to give me so much shit that's probably why it's so hard to bother me now the trash ins that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was I had a joke I had a joke where to begin into my career cuz at the times let me preface this this was way in the beginning of my career this was a joke that I had about about little people midgets at the time and it's you know it was so bad cause I got robbed by a cross-eyed Mitch and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me because I was with somebody else so he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me it was like a play on being crisis very very awful joke I remember telling his joke in a phone book comes flying on the stage put trees through a fucking phone book at me I told him this isn't where the Boston comedy club people in a crowd tiny little place all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I said and Patrice said read it it's better material in it than what you're saying that crawls does laughs oh he's uh they all might say they used to trash me so bad so bad man do you alleged a retreat some news story a corporate trees jerking off at my house before this is I moved to LA I'm saying the two double partment I just got there Patrice coming out I said yo you need place ass I got two bedrooms you can come near it's my ex-wife at the time you know I come home it's like afternoon like Patrice mi yo you all but tres but race I go out in the bag open up the door I said his big-ass computer oh I see is his back hunched over so baby oil right and I come in on my door he'll get out get out get out [Laughter] he's so sick he's so sick that he didn't stop he was so concerned with finishing then he didn't even break stride and turn around and not really nothing he get out yeah you just saw his back hunched he came out like seven minutes late it was like my bad i may use come home fucking for treatment I love him to death love him to death yeah he had the most don't give a fuck of any time I ever met it was most 100% yeah good and bad yeah you know there yeah there was a good to it and there was also some bad you know a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrese probably could have happened but I think the the level of not give a fuck yeah prevented some of those things well he was almost too authentic yes like his like gypsy that was it Charlie Sheen's roast whose roast was it that he did what he just torture everybody else on the roast and then he got up there and you guys the fuck is this bitch who is this bitch oh my god Patrice has so many of those things yeah so many of things one of one of the best to do it if you if you are listening you're not educated I'm Patrice O'Neal just I ask did you just watch Elvin in the room one of his specials yeah some of that some of the funniest shit ever man and so insightful mmm-hmm he was so why the way people thought and behaved he would say shit like one of the things that he said that I I tell people all the time it's a it's a brilliant thing that he said it was forget what controversy it was but he was on television with some woman who was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things you know and they were they were getting mad at someone I think it was Opie and Anthony about a joke and he said you gotta understand that all jokes come from the same place the ones you like and the ones you don't like the ones that make you laugh and the ones that make you mad they all come from the same place someone's just trying to be funny yeah like sometimes they just don't work I had a talk I had a talk with the I forgot her name I got I forgot her name but it was when I was doing all the promo for upside and they kept trying to break down you know where where where the jokes come from you know Kevin these insensitive jokes in that you told back then why what what makes you why would you even say those things and the hardest thing for me to explain I was like do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're not going to be funny everything that you think of in a joke form you're thinking of it because you think you're gonna get a laugh behind it yeah the gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab don't get the laughs the joke was not funny if I get a laugh then I guess I'm on to something there isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think may be great bits yeah I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it I said I don't especially at that time my career I just thought it would be funny the same way that some people think sir jokes funny the offer it's a thought comedians are constantly throwing shit out there yeah you're constantly rolling a dice and Thor shit out there had to shit you roll and good right it's not gonna be good the other hatten maybe all right maybe kind of good but it's all with the intent of entertaining it's not with the intent of being malicious it's not with the intent of sparking hatred it's all trying to make you laugh yeah that's it like it's it's literally that simple from a thought within the comedian's mind yeah nothing nothing else they kept trying to look for this like hard definition of why and it's like I don't have it I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny and it wasn't that's the downfall that's it that's it it's it's and the thing is about this art form is that up until ten fifteen years ago there was never any discussion like this it wasn't so so when we developed and when we were coming up there was no it was just like and there was always guys that would push the envelope way too far I believe Jesus Christ you see his new bid what the fuck yeah and you'd be laughing yeah you tell it to each other and yeah and it didn't matter what it was joke about murder or rape or what some people just use those dark subjects like they're trying to make us laugh yeah in the meetings the comedian's comedian there's always gonna be though well you just innovate you all do you know Brian Holtzman 100% yeah but in Holtzman's that guy 100% my funniest dudes and and and there's no way that I could say no some of the stuff that I heard me say remember Susan Smith that lady who drowned her kids I I know I know who you're talking about her and I know the moment but I'm not familiar with all all that involved Holtzman was on stage that week and he's like I heard those kids were bad I heard they set that close to the TV they never put away their blocks there we spilt their milk those kids will not be missed yeah and you were just like oh I in the fuck like 9/11 when 9/11 happened they wouldn't let him on stage well Mitzi shore would not let him on stage four months after 9/11 she's like no way keep him off the stage I mean do you have you have the people just Sartre did they go for that they go for because they want to hear you howl and get back to the room do you know that like if it's you know comics are there in the back of the room they're gonna laugh their fucking ass off at that chair and and you know it's weird because right now within a times I'm the comedian that chooses to be sensitive to the times you know I've made the choice to say I understand I get why you shouldn't say certain things why you should avoid this that or this I I understand and I am but then there's other comedians that go you know what I'm more staged I'm gonna be me and I'm not gonna do that because people are telling me that this is what I I'm gonna go harder yeah and do that that's yeah that just exists it just exists but I think it's easier to just say I'm not a fan that comedy isn't for me right you know what I don't I don't like the taste of this particular comedian so I'm not going to support a watch that comedian I'm gonna find another comedian there's more to my liking I'm going to go and just turn my head like I want us to get back to just understanding that you just don't have to support it yeah that's it well there's a lot of fucking option it's very I mean there's so many today yeah there's never been more never been more comics I think about how many people were doing Netflix specials so many's never been more it's something so easy so I don't understand why there's a push to destroy which you just don't have to support it like I think it's just a bunch of people that have an ability to influence things now that didn't have an ability before and it's like they see a window and they want to throw a rock it's right there makes sense I think there's something that but I also think mm-hmm for us like meat for me in particular I really like fucked up comedy it's one

injuries I've seen too many people get hurt it's not for you yeah especially old dudes fallen down hitting their head on Mike I start thinking about brain trauma and CTE long-term repercussions I'm near I'm right there with you it's probably better I'm right there with you there's the one that's going on today of this dude trying to come up the stairs on this other dude did you see that one the guy stomped them and set him flying like all I could think of is we don't see it in the video but that guy's head it's got to be smithereens oh my god he he had hit his head the way he fell back yeah you ever seen one of the guy who slipped and fell down a bunch of steps at the museum and falls in the water yeah he's going it goes in water Dumbo right you can't you can't beat that there's this dude this goes walking up the stairs and this dude's legs get the fuck off my porch stop leave me alone and he keeps coming he's like don't do it don't do it and he got boom smack the way he fell back you know hands behind him that's all head that's all head first of all to not see that kick coming yeah from a guy that says it's sad but you also have to realize a guy that size is carrying all that weight of a donkey kick yes that's just caved in my got stomped but to not see it once again I always thought that about fat people but if you really really fat imagine how strong your fucking legs must be strongly should ever yeah if you really get some power behind that kick and also if you've lost the weight you'd have these incredible legs that's a that's always a theory just it's Anthony but I was wonder if their needs are gonna shrink it wait what because you see someone from behind they're like 500 pounds like their knees are that wide I'm like okay is that the bone like is that fat around the bone like has the bone grown really wide too cuz your body does your bones do get denser if you do like heavy weight mmm like this if you look at like power lifter dudes they're do they're dense well part of it is not just their frame it's that they're constantly lifting heavy things so your body thickens up did you as you go but you know when when you know people that are larger make the the dedication to actually losing the weight and they stay away from like the weights and stuff and just do cardio it sheds off so fast yeah but he can't like I know I know a couple of friends of mine and lost like 130 140 pounds and like if now just fallen in love with fitness to the point where it's unbelievable like how their body is transformed and taking a liking to the new the new process that they're now in pretty yeah they get addicted instead of food they get addicted to being healthy exactly it's totally possible totally possible I've had I don't know how many people come up to me and said they've lost a hundred pounds plus because of listening to my show and having fitness experts on and diet experts and and just talking about staying the fuck away from sugar say don't eat late at night yes that's eating stop eating in a certain time and give yourself more than enough time to digest Cal your calories start exercising well with me I think the thing with me that helps me so much as I'm not a foodie you're not I'm not a foodie man I'm just not you know it's boring gotta go eat with I'm just making a Turk that's it I'm literally just what is that yeah that's fine let me give that this baked chicken some brown rice that's fine I'm good you don't worry about eating healthy I'm a healthy eater because I'm not a foodie so it's not like it doesn't doesn't matter like I don't have the will or want to eat the bad shit so if you're passing by in-n-out burger nothing no nothing nah man I'm black fried chicken fried chicken you showed me a process Popeyes

finish that meal that's in crud that's how good Popeyes is 100% so that's my cheat my cheat is Popeyes all day other than that I'm a consistory thurr I'm healthy guy so Dee take vitamins or supplements or anything I used to take multivitamins which inspired me to start doing my home like right now we got bicycle okay I'm starting my own supplement line vitae hustle love to vitamin that we put out but let me tell you why doe I'm gonna tell you why I'm even getting into this space so when I look at physical fitness and I look at this world I noticed that you know you have a you have a great one in need to look like everything around you that you see like everybody like everybody that's a part of this world they look so fucking great and fit when they're talking about these products and the things they can do and I said you know what what I'm able to do and what I've done in my past I'm always bringing people together of all like in whole like there is nobody's alienated you know when I did my runs with Nike and before I got signed by Nike it was about bringing a bunch of people that never ran before and getting you guys to get up just come run with me just try it and you notice I got people out that never thought they were fucking do it and we doing five miles we don't ten miles whatever it's just a group run something to say we did I said how can I create a product where I'm putting people in a position to understand there's a hustle in all of us that's what my multivitamin is about it's the energy is the recharge it's the ability to focus is to approach your day with all of the tools that you basically need it's not just about the physical fitness aspect it's about the health so if I can actually motivate people to take the step in the right direction of health with a line of supplements that are driven for the everyday individual that may not know or be aware but wants to engage but you're not in it to look like all these different people you're in it to be the best version of yourself how can I do that teamed up with a great group of people to create the best possible products that I want to do and I said I want to be patient so it took me for you four years to create about us and how many different products you go right now just by dose vitae Hustle is my only one right now so it's just a vitamin just a multivitamin but it's an amazing multivitamin is it a single pill or is it a packet but no it's a it's a jar I should have fucking bought one good job a jar Jesus Christ so you like mix it in some stuff no it's a jar full like all pills yes pills okay um I'm gonna tell you the dope stuff this that's in it cuz I don't want to not say anything in and have it to where it's wrong so I always got it up on the screen man good Jesus Christ I get it hey you guys see it yep that's why you here we're gonna save that on my phone blueberry fruit extract scroll scroll back up there boron biotin beta-carotene vitamin A mmm-hmm what's all good shit it's all good shit it's more than a multivitamin I'll plan him in a it's good II what does that stuff Toco Toco trend all teletran out talk--i channels vitamin E family mm-hmm-hmm you ever heard of that Jim vitamin K look it up alright look it up it's a good thing too is that everything that's in it you know it's not only is it researchable but you'll see why like my biggest thing like as a guy that's not as familiar with the space I said who are the people that are they do it at a high level that I can incorporate into helping me build this product so I feel like you're never gonna do it by yourself you shouldn't try to do by yourself and you don't cut corners you don't go to cheap route you don't you don't do it wrong something you have to go back to do it again Brian so I went and I looked at the people that were involved with creating the quote-unquote best markets the best things on the market and I put that team together I put up a team like four to five I'm gonna tell you for years spent a lot of money developing this shit because it wasn't right in the beginning had to go back had to do it again wasn't right had to go back find out the other things they made other things better of things great had to go right go get it again go try it go do it again not right what else is out there what are we compared to until I felt that now when I launch there's going to be a place for my product in the market where people will understand that is exactly what I said it was there's no lying there is no you know false presentation behind the product Kevin Hartz multivitamins much more than multivitamin but more importantly it's something for everybody and more importantly it's to spark the hustle within all of us and it's the first there will be more but it'll be after I've mastered and done this at the highest level then I moved to product number two then I moved to product number three before you know it you want to see a fucking whole line that Kevin Hart is slowly developed and that people can actually believe in because I'ma be a product of my own product that's the best thing in the world when you're a product of your product has to work for me before I say it's gonna work for everybody else so you take this stuff goddamn right I take it how long am I taking it I spent all this fucking money I better take it I've been taking the the one that's launching now for about five to six months nice I've been taking this one I'm very happy because I actually feel the difference and the difference is just in the energy that you have with him day it's not an energy fucking pill but I do feel a difference in my in my ability to last throughout my day like I'm I do a lot man I do it fucking light so I told you I'm starting at that final 5:30 and I'm not shutting down to let 9 10 I saw a video once where you were taking a video of your your trainer passed out yeah like this lifestyle everybody very unattractive sleeper by the way shots out to Tim boss Ronald over line and one of the worst sleepers you have a seat so you take him with you everywhere yeah my trainers let me everywhere Wow everywhere so you train every day every day Wow every day Sunday's are light days like cardio maintenance is what we call it not doing the same thing all the time we switch it up love switching about love finding new things within Fitness to make it fun you never want to get bored within it so your your whole purpose is just to keep your vitality up keep your energy up just to keep it it's if I don't do it then there's a lag I need to train I need to do it because I I'm mentally so invested in it now that when I don't do it I feel like I've cheated myself in a in a day or a week that I've taken off I feel like yo man I'm not myself because when I am doing it I feel like I'm always I'm committed I'm committed to constantly building and reshaping and molding I'm working on me so when I'm not working on me I don't feel like my day that's supposed to be about me it's starting off with the biggest bang right this is my advantage to starting off like nobody else my day starts off before fucking worms and birds get up I'm we're time to get up five five and that's when you start working out Jim 5:15 5:20 really 5:15 5:20 no food I don't eat I don't need before workout yeah I'm not I'm not I eat it before I workout never had didn't know what I am now because I'm getting older I'm more conscious of my body so I'm big with sports massages I'm big with you know making sure that I'm not putting myself in a position to get injured and overwork right so getting stretched you know trying to to do as much movement that as I possibly can like when I say I'm a little walking muscle I really AM so my flexibility is limited so right now that's my biggest focus so I'm about to start yoga trying to do that things that can just kind of keep me in a position to to not tighten up so I don't pull anything cuz I do so much are you gonna do hot yoga yeah do that shit all the time do you roll it love it amazing do it every week yeah only thing that's kept me from doing it is the smell and it's possibly you never that's the only thing that's kept me out of it I was like you gotta move past that yeah blessa I hear I get pretty bad sometimes it can yeah the place I go to is nice you just gotta make sure that the people take care of themselves well you know he'll be around smelly people I'll be honest I'm worried about myself I don't know what I'm gonna get especially if you get there early in the morning you know eat you won't worry about farting yeah but the people that eat breakfast yeah go they are letting off and everything I'll explain that the killer Mikey was talking to me about farting in yoga class I'm the guy can't be eating no can't be eating before that early are you going I like to go either 6:00 a.m. which is rare most of time 8:00 8:00 8:30 depends on where which place I go to - but you love it though yeah it's great for your head - it's 90 minutes of suffering you know it's hot it's fuck you hundred five degrees hundred four degrees when you get out of there you feel like you did something really yeah and it just changes the way your body feels - in terms of your range of motion your flexibility all those weird connecting knots and everything just get opened up and you know my question is when you when you're just starting no yeah like like I will be is it extremely tough and a beginning again you just just gotta bring a lot of ice water just bring a big ol fucking 64 ounce one of those of you know thermal flasks of ice water make sure you have enough water and drink enough water before it I'm talking put me in a bag yeah just start now I don't need to be what people could see me just we got like a section in the back yeah well you turn left you turn right everyone's gonna see you yes I'm saying can I be in a place where they go see me in the beginning like I don't want anybody to see you're athletic man you're gonna be fine you're gonna be tight it's gonna be difficult for you to pull off certain poses but you'll be fine I'm definitely gonna do it I'm definitely realize it's a challenge I'm definitely 100% gonna try your fuck would you do too no that's next yeah that's next Justin I'm just on here listen this is where Rico was laughing because I say oh man don't laugh annotators I've never thrown a kick as I said whatever you show me right now is my first time doing it I don't I don't kick I don't know how to kick right so whatever you show me this is this will be me processing it for the first time and that day we did it we worked on and I think I threw a couple good kicks a couple good front kick and I said I said look after I'm done with boxing I said this will be my next test to learn how to probably throw some kicks and to move with my bottom half now that I've worked on my top that's my next hobby that's your next time you know jiu-jitsu is like that's the tough one in choice and you want to do that too I'm just this stuff as you get older you have to find shit to do right if you don't find shit to do you won't lose your mind you would get addicted to that I just wanna learn shit you would like it because there's so much to learn that's the thing about it it's a long long never ending never ending never ending journey of shit there's also there's so many different variations of each different individual move and entries into new moves and defense and then the structure of it is it's it gets so crazy it's it's super complicated my son my son does a my son is heavy into boxing in karate I got him meant to those so he he does them both so the reason why I want to do I just like to keep up with him so we can you know do things together I have trainers come to the house and we'll work out together he loves it so I just don't want to get left behind that you know we get 1718 which we'll say Dave I don't want that but we better back up when they start getting that much confidence I just want to be able to keep up and maintain so that's why I like to do it with them well it's good for a kid to to have that in your head which is not a defense confidence yeah you need that for confident it'll help you avoid things too well I tell my kids you know your last name puts a target on your back that you didn't ask for and we don't go and create problems but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur and if they do I just want you guys to know how to defend yourself so the things that I have my kids doing it just have the knowledge and understanding the worst thing is just not knowing you know they're growing up completely different than I grew up where I grew up you had no choice but to know if you ain't know how to fight that's your ass cuz you're gonna get tested there's no way around it you're gonna get tried you're gonna get robbed you're gonna get your bookbag take it it's am I gonna try to take snakes like it's the reality it's not a false reality that's real so if you're not prepared for it if you don't have any type of heart you won't last from where I grew up heart was everything and heart was sometimes saying I don't care if I get my ass whooped I'm not gonna be a bitch I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie y'all to think that this can't happen so I'm gonna lose today but tomorrow I'm gonna complain and imma firin you imma talk whatever that moment was it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect the eventually turned into friendship from all so my kids don't know what that world is like they're never gonna have it so as a parent I just have to make sure that you have all the tools that I can possibly equip you with because my president have the ability to provide me with it they weren't a financial space to to take me here and have this extra curricular activity or this extra curricular activity or learn it learn it then exist that is the big conundrum of successful Hebert can actually when successful people have kids the what made them successful is dry I grew up poor too we were on welfare and food stamps the whole deal when I was a little kid and that always stuck in my head this thought like we might not have enough food like I remember thinking that when I was a little like what if we don't have any food what if we run out of food my kids will never feel that they don't understand what that is and everybody that I've ever met that's interest came from some crazy struggle yeah when they were young yeah and that's the thing of your you and I and most people that are doing well in life you're raising your kids in a completely different way then literally what brought you to the dance and the first that's the hunger of not being one of those people that's left behind is what makes you successful in the first place and it's scary it's scared because you know my wife my wife told me she was like you know I love that you're not hard on your kids but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation like I don't yell I'll yell at my kids nothing's gonna register when I'm yelling so I tried my best to talk to you everyone I met my angriest I'm gonna talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's the problem you need understand what's wrong and what I had to really realize is they didn't ask to be born into this yeah you know I mean like that it's not their fault right that they're coming up completely different than how we were raised right and we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them because they got it so much better than what we had how do we make sure to be passed down to proper lessons so that they appreciate and understand and not take for granted right they have right for me it's tough because good kids good students their plot themselves in school they listen they don't do dumb shit yeah they want to play video games and stay up like any other kid there's no signs of a bad or crazy yeah and the fear and panic is that you got a note it bad and crazy exists right this fairy tale day we're in isn't real and at some point when I'm not around when your mother's not around when you have friends or other family on around you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen right so I gotta prepare you for the shit that you don't know exists I gotta take you to Philadelphia so you can see I try to show my kids where I grew up thinking that's going be like oh my goodness backfired it's so cool can we live here shut up fuck you told my everybody here the car right now around you talk like this move your back this does not go well supposed to oh my gosh so cool dad is so different oh my goodness walked him around a neighborhood and it's like it's it's it's not a reality you didn't have grass and that's dad oh that's great would you play why were you here yeah when you hear these things it's so different man these were your steps the steps are broken how did you even play oh my god dad so wait we're weird was yours we lived on the top floor not the whole thing no it's this is three separate units so the top floor was me and grandmom's the middle that was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs or somebody else three different people lived in this one thing together y'all with strangers my own hands I don't know I don't know what's say it this part yeah right in the car but but when you see that that's the reality that you get hit with of I gotta make sure that I'm talking I gotta make sure that I'm constantly teaching yeah if I'm not and I'm not doing my part I'm failing you know took them to the neighborhood and showed them how stores are in the neighborhood it's what we got candy from here's here's what we would get little sandwiches from y'all walk we don't have no stores like this we can't walk this stuff it's a completely different world well it's a completely different world see people stand on the street corners what they doing they're big they selling drugs that's that's tough right there those are people that your dad still knows they've been there forever that's what you don't want to do but they're forced with these decisions just because of what they have to do you just need to see this dad is taking you here to see this drove them all around all around North Philadelphia all around South Philadelphia made sure they could see yeah physically see we go out the country we go to these resorts and islands before we go they're gonna drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this this is why we have to be good people this is why we treat everybody with respect this is why your dad likes to give everybody doesn't have I'm constantly beating my kids with that information because if you assume that everybody does you come off like such an asshole when you're around people that don't yeah like how did you you don't also the advantage that they had growing up the way they are now it's such a rare thing and they don't understand it there's no way there's a small percentage yeah a very small percentage and that's something that I never want to let go of either so I was in the back of my head are you talking about how you know are we gonna have enough food you were coming up Chris Rock's joke is so great that he used to tell the hi he keeps a bag packed at the front door cuz he don't believe that this shit is his I truly believe you thin at any point somebody gonna go gotcha you thought you lived here did you visit joy and I was like it's so real because even though you have it you can't lose the sight a reality of where you once was yeah do you are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts like this is this real because you you're at this stratosphere of Fame and success that's it's rare amongst the rare hmm you know it's like David Goggin says you are uncommon amongst uncommon men I will be a hundred percent honest and say I'm comfortable with the understanding of hard work brings great rewards this is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything that I've done I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go back that doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city that doesn't mean I'm gonna go back to the people that means I don't want to go back to living like I once was I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna help I want to inspire what a motivate I want to show people that there is a way out that there is a way to do more to get more to obtain more but I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get so I need to make sure that I do everything to keep it so I can't be content mmm so there is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of so even if you like even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life that's not what it's about it's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and moving forward in a positive way and the only way you can do that is to stay active it's the story man yeah you know we're we're all writing a book what's your book look like mmm what is your fucking book look like like your life is a bulk you got a bunch of chapters in your book but when they closed that book how good was the book how good was your book what was the ending to your book if the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done the money all that was accomplished the first to do the man that did this he caused a merger between this because of his commitment and growth to this the communities were then given this made education this changed the way the schooling was Baba Baba gave books gave computers gave all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence become a part of the chapters in your book so my drive is about my book I was a New York Times number-one bestseller people will be done they did it I'm writing another book you ready to vote right now yeah what's it happened what happens if you are to Tom New York Times number-one bestseller if you get the two what happens if you get the three hey man how do books become successful who publishes them I want to start a publishing company heartbeat publishing why not mmm that's the thing all I'm doing is sparking the awareness and others to go why might why can't I create why can't I start why can't I be a business why can't I be a CEO why can't I be a tech guru why can't I fucking create cooking products lotions since there's so much that some people just don't understand they can do let me be a spot to show how much how many different you don't have to do just one thing when it's all said and done my book is gonna be full of all this shit that Kevin Hart did cuz I never was content with doing just one two or three why not Kevin why are you creating fucking health and wellness products why not I'm big on health and wellness why can't I why can't I try to create something that I filled is fucking great and jump into a space that I'm already in I already give a hundred percent of me in this space why not why can't I talk about financial wealth why can't I go back and educate those that don't know why not you got time I make time well you certainly can but it's just so unusual that someone dedicates that much energy and time to giving back and getting involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as well as be super ambitious with your own career it makes me happy yeah I could tell I'm genuinely happy discovery makes me happy like when you find different things to be excited about it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks and schooldays to tell you all the time information is key read these books there's so much knowledge fuck that book time to read that book I want to go home goddamn Sonic the Hedgehog I want to play I'm at level 3 I got something to read this book the information is stuff there it was forced down your throat at a certain age you just you just may not be receiving it correctly but then it clicks you may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up to you but people people have different roles they can go down the education wasn't my pick of choice it didn't do it for me but the knowledge in the common sense that I have naturally allowed me to gain information apply it differently it allowed me to grow smarts in so many different avenues to where I said oh my god I found my niche I found my talent and now there's other things that my talent can take me to I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness but I can allow myself people to do that can teach me because now guess what learning is cool ya know what happened you don't have to do it anymore right it's its own you're a kid they force you into this school you don't want to learn but then when you get out and you realize like oh this actually benefits me does it make me a better person this makes me wiser it's 100 percent dirty and it's weird how it happens but when you go oh my god learning and knowledge is power mmm fuck they used to tell me this when I was 10 my quads yes mom sons 10 11 years old I heard that shit all the time now I finally get it damn I'm about to be 40 took me all this time to get the goddamn code but I got it yeah it hits you at a different time mm-hmm and when it does be excited about it man you excited I'm excited about what 50 years I'm just now getting to 40 do you read books I don't read a lot of books do you listen to books on tape I have listened to books you know what let's do what Tony Robbins he's great Tony's a like I like his approach to giving information mm-hmm I like his attitude in general I like podcasts I like things that are real and out of presented in front of me I like information that I can go to the source and and touch and talk so I'm I and I'm reading a book it's a book that was recommended by such-and-such and the person who gave it to me and that's reading that book I learn more about the individual that I thought I already knew and now I gain more Michelle Obama's book great book great fucking book I met her I talked to her I've been in the same rooms I've seen her success what is her book gonna be about mmm or read a book Wow I get it I get wise moving all the units that it's moving I get why women are reading his book and walking away feeling better feeling like they can't I get it oh wow hmm certain friends Dwyane Wade wrote a book focused on being a father his road to becoming a better father what he went through with his kids mother he developed a relationship than a bond with his sons like nobody else Wow didn't know that day that's dope I love how you put it on page there's certain things that you just want to know certain books help I understand why people read books I get what the information does you know the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you my whole book is about you battling yourself people to understand is you against you the only person that gets in your way is you nobody else is you now when you write a book like this and especially about something like this this is like the way you've managed to navigate through life mm-hmm are do you do you write it out in essays do you do you do you have like bullet points that you you think about and then once you have those bullet points you had then you write on those how do you do it get on your phone it's all all voice notes and transcripts okay so because of your time you don't have you don't have the the time to sit and actually write mm-hmm so you need somebody that you can talk to for hours hours hours on it hey I need a hour but I gotta holler for me I got some stuff we want to talk to you about keV what what's that all right book title ideas subtitle ideas my dedication is my introductions within my introductions these are all powerful paragraphs and things that I was just said that are now transcript I get to go back and read it come see here there's no conversation at all every one of them um no conversation all and that's what the Internet has allowed people to do Internet has allowed people to skip steps 1 through 30 as a lot of people to jump straight to 100 fuck you good job off take them down you should be dead oh god fucking can't stand this whatever the hater the anger is when listen when listen ok when I listen and I can change I'm not that guy we're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and think through what I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm thinking about myself making myself better puts me in a position to make others better be the example not the problem the best way to take away the problem is to a lien 8 yourself from it these are business thoughts oh it's fucking thought I can go through and just read this is a so you just have these philosophies of your life and you just just speak it listen just speak it dance so now this is all chance capable Columbus's that's incredible there's all fuckin transcript this is all Sarge's go back throughout the day and I read it and I say this is great this makes sense this didn't let me reword this I mean make sure that it's all flowing together and at the end of the day what's my reason for the book my reason for the book is make you better my reason for the book is to make people understand yeah we all agree we all should think that we're great there's no reason for you to not think that you're great if you don't think you're great ask yourself why why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do people have no no choice but to follow suit mmm you had no choice but to follow suit a lot of people they base it on their past they base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you better yeah it does make you back you better make you smarter yeah unless you say it yeah man that's what's interesting about it that's what's interesting about life you can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before I had a 585 on my SAT confessions I didn't take money confession they give you 404 put your name on a paper it's true story Wow I guessed a BAC a da I did abracadabra true story swear to God hand on my mother's grave a BAC a da I didn't care because there was a class trip that same day I wanted to go great adventure I was told they're not taking my SAT seriously but prohibit me from furthering myself in life that's what I was told at the moment I said damn maybe I should have maybe I should've applied myself maybe I should have been different when I saw my friends get their test scores back and they were ecstatic 800-900 960s everybody's going to college I felt like the biggest idiot in the fucking world the biggest idiot in the fucking world because the same people that I want to rush to go to great adventure with they had taken an SAT a week before they already got their work done mmm they did everything they were supposed to do so that moment of fun was real fun for them I was the only dumbass that didn't prioritize and take care of my shit so I'm the only one going to Community College everybody's else off to Villanova Temple University Drexel University god damn I just got left behind why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before how come you only tell me that we was serious about the college shit you ain't tell me I was trying to go to simple or Drexel all wait it's because my life isn't their life they're focused on themselves wow that they're doing what they're supposed to do hey jackass go sit by yourself and figure it out cuz that's where you should be lesson learn any opportunity given should be taking series from this point on because if not you can find yourself feeling just like this it's not I get down on myself a fucking moment I learn from it I learned from it now I got to take a goddamn test you best believe I'm studying for that fucking test cuz I don't want to feeling like I'm the guy mmm that didn't prepare now I got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in class that didn't prepare that's got the words great when they give all those grades back but it's because of my experience I don't look down on those moments you take those moments you make the best of them because their life lessons it's that simple you're saying it's positive but it's really just simplicity that's real real it's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons 100% but the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about it like that that's where it makes it really powerful because it's not just something that you learn from but now other people can learn from your past too that's what I'm hoping they'll look at themselves and they realize like we all start from a different spot you're not saying yeah this is why I'm so candid I'm so candid I'm so open they're there there is no like guys I'm fine with being an open book I'm fine with the good the bad ugly I'm fine being flawed I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed I'm fine with it all I don't hide from it I don't run from it I don't I don't avoid any of it I'm fine it's all right it's a bed that I made for myself I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out moving forward son don't stop for nobody man son don't fucking stop so I'm gonna be up in the morning regardless that son is gonna be up in the
