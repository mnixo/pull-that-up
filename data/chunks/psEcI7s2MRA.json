hello freak bitches why do these patterns repeat themselves what is it about human beings well we like things simple we like things simple so-so and then you often like a simple explanation is a good explanation unless it's too simple but distinguishing between simple and too simple is no easy matter we like we like to know who's our friend and who's our enemy and we like the feeling of unearned moral superiority and unearned moral scatter yeah that's that's the boy your niche and especially when there's no such thing as earning anyways so and then I mean there's deeper and darker things that are underneath that it's like the human proclivity to pull down those who have more than you it's like these kids on the campuses who are claiming identity with the oppressed you know what some are like Yale it's like how in the world you can speak of oppression if you happen to be at Yale is beyond me I mean first of all your North American which puts you in the top one percent and then of North Americans you're in the top 1% to in the top 1% of 1% but yet you you want that you want to have all the power that goes along with that and you want to have the moral superiority that comes from being a representative of the oppressed so that's exactly what you want you want all the power and you want all the victimization at the same time well years Yale is a great example because Yale was one of the what happened with the Halloween costume debacle at Yale was one of the first videos that was released that made people horrified where they couldn't believe how students were communicating with professors yeah well though a student who screamed up a storm about about that the male professor who was the husband of the woman who wrote that Pro Halloween costume letter it turned out she was on the bloody hiring committee that hired him one of the things she screamed was who hired you was like well it turned out it was you because you were on the committee just a few years before I know when they took it like yeah that was absolutely all the people that don't know what what the hell were talking about well explain this debacle because it really was about questionable Halloween costumes well it was about questioning Halloween costumes Halloween costumes are part of the whole point of Halloween is to have questionable costumes right you play with death for example and decay and and horror and and it's it's a time when the norms with regards to the expression of things that are outside of our normal behavior are suspended so that everybody can can have a little celebration as it turns out well you know campuses have got all upset about things like cultural appropriation at Queen's University in Canada just the other week they were going after students who were dressing up as Vietcong for example or Mexicans it's like I just don't see what the hell's racist about dressing up like a Mexican Mexicans have a traditional traditional clothing there's nothing wrong with Mexicans so why is it wrong address up like right and if you want to be punch oviya for halloween what's wrong with that what would you you can you can regard that as an Amar's just as much as a denigration that's like why is that such a problem right but anyways it doesn't matter because nothing's too trivial to be a problem to a social justice warrior and because they don't like to deal with real problems and yale went after halloween cost so this woman wrote a letter saying maybe we should just relax about this stuff and you know not don't put restrictions on what people wear for Halloween but let people decide what is and isn't offensive yes and well and then many Halloween costumes are offensive that's the point but her letter wasn't really reason I was perfectly reasonable it was like an it was like an adult wrote it yes yeah and and you know all hell broke loose fall help and she ended up she ended up quitting and I think he did you know I don't think I don't think he left I don't think he left but she did seeing him bow down to this woman screaming at him swearing in his face was so disturbing it was so humiliating I felt so humiliated for him because she was screaming this is our home what the fuck are you doing you're not making it's not a bloody home the university is not a home right it's not a safe space it's not a secure space none of that and and if that when I get a university isn't a home that's not what it is it's a place to be confronted by I would say often horrible ideas you want to learn about history you think that's gonna be safe do you know what human history is like it's an endless bloodbath with we know with with a certain amount of hopeful progress underlying it it's it's a it's a it's a horror show and great literature is like that and and and biology is terrifying and physics is terrifying and you want to be safe it's stay home stay home with your mom stay home with your dad don't come to university if you want to be safe because we go outside no one of you if you're going if the university is going to make you safe than it ceased to be a university so one of the things I try to do in my class I have this class called maps of meaning which concentrates on atrocity basically on Soviet atrocity and and Nazi atrocity and what I try to do in the class is to teach my students that had they been to Nazi Germany in the 1930s they would have been Nazis and had they be not offered the opportunity to be in Auschwitz aash wits camp guard then maybe they would have left out it and maybe they would have been in the sadistic in the more sadistic proportion of the Auschwitz camp guard population you think that makes you feel safe it doesn't make you feel safe to know that Nazis were humans and you happen to be one of them so I think that educators that tell students that they're offering them a safe space are doing them a profound disservice and you don't I'm a clinical psychologist and here's one of the things you do to make people less afraid you don't make the world safer what you do is you people tell you what they're afraid of and then you break it into little bits so that they can go confront them you know so maybe they're afraid of going to a party and you break that down you say well do you know how to introduce yourself and say well I don't I don't really know how to shake someone's hand and so then you practice having them shake their hand and introduce themselves because maybe they weren't taught by that by their half-witted parents when they were when they were young because they were ignored and so then you say well maybe you can go to a party for half an hour and all you have to do is introduce yourself to two people and we'll call that success and you build up their confidence and their confidence one step at a time and what happens the the clinical literature indicates quite clearly is you don't make people less anxious by doing that you make them braver it's not the same thing you don't make the world and its horrors smaller you make the person and their their capacity to deal with horror larger you encourage them you strengthen them that's what you do at a university you armed people with arguments you you hone their intellect you you help them learn to write so they can marshal their arguments you have you'll help them learn how to engage in intellectual combat because that's better than engaging in real combat you make them you make them hard and strong you don't mollycoddle them and make them safe unless you're their enemy unless you're trying to devour their spirit and that's what we have in the universities we have we have the reign of the eda people mother whose answered everything is oh just come a little closer dear and I'll protect you from the world it's just like Hansel and Gretel's the you know the witch in the Hansel and Gretel story well my house is made of gingerbread just come in here and everything will be fine while she feeds a candy to fatten you up so she can eat you that's the archetype of a modern University you
