five four three two hello Nick sorry for the delay we had a failure ladies and gentlemen a catastrophic failure of Windows updating it's sort of updated and hung on the TriCaster but we're back and it seems to be fine everything's working allegedly allegedly there's that there's that fear when you're like fuck I'm turning off the update I'm gonna start again that you lose everything that is the one annoying thing we were talking about this before the podcast I've been using Windows to write on and I like the ThinkPad I really like I love the keyboard it's great to write on but Windows updates like two or three times a day sometimes not just windows but like Lenovo will update and there's some sort of firmware update and the BIOS update and Adobe Acrobat is checking in want to know if we can defender updates yeah the I haven't used a think pad they got this love that little like clip right in the middle click I don't use it there I guess it's for people that have been using it forever it's very accurate if you do use it right it's like one of those things where you just sort of used a muscle memory you're used to doing it and then they touch the other buttons with their thumb right they can still do shit and it has the mouse at the keypad so it's both it's so weird how quickly you become accustomed to some new version of things like I've been using my iPad and I done and then I've gotten back to my computer and my live like a little MacBook and I'm fine even that weird like I found myself just wanted to touch the screen yeah and I have my muscle memory is immediately shot that's one thing that's very odd about Mac computers they still haven't embraced the touchscreen laptop whereas though think pad actually has a touchscreen oh you can straight up use this screen on it yeah it's an option one that has a touchscreen and one that does not but that's a lot of Windows computers have touchscreens and they even have it so you can turn into a tablet you flip it over and it I think they call it the yoga the ThinkPad yoga right and then Microsoft has won the surface or something yeah apples like now we want to sell you two different things that's exactly what it is yeah they're dirty people yeah they really are dead fucking battery thing really pissed me off did it come out that it finally get officially yeah yeah oh yeah they said they admitted it and they said they did it because the old phones they're trying to preserve the battery the fuck you were you were trying to piss people off so they got a new phone yeah we all know exactly what works on me it works on me every like year and a half from like why doesn't my phone fucking dying every 10 minutes and I'm like I gotta get a new phone dirty people yeah dirty people I got the new one I got the new yeah Mac whatever yes yes max yeah it's too big I fucked up is it too big yeah I've never gone to the bigger one I've always gotten this this size woman the ex it was perfect yes happy yeah but I got greedy I want to go back they have some of those now the smaller like the four-five that little size one yeah someone had one the other day and I had it my hand I was like oh this is nice yeah you could text with one hand yeah exactly and I think they now make that one with a higher power it's like it's that size but it's lateral yeah and it fits like in your hand square and that this the edges are hard yeah it's in there perfect yeah it's not like a slip this one feels like it's gonna slip I think you can't quite get around at the whole time yeah the four one that one you it it also has a headphone jack it's like the last the Mohicans yeah they got rid of all of it although now yeah I guess it's still no there's the converter I don't know the dongle I said what it is yeah they fucking they got me though I'm in I'm in I haven't used a none Apple product in a long time well I gotta think that like I was said and I like I said and I also got the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 the new one and it's very good dammit I wish it wasn't yeah I wish it wasn't yeah man they figured it out they figured some shit out or and it's also just like it's they figured out the lifestyle of something where you're like I'll take this branding I'm a creative those think different yeah it's you fuckers fucking work man yeah I was like oh because I remember used to getting like that Apple the Mac I'm gonna edit fucking I'm gonna start eddy mode shit well I remember hearing that Louie was editing his show with a 13-inch MacBook he edited his whole show yeah and he'd like doing it on the little MacBook for some stranger yeah your Brown a plane or doing whatever I get it I never added anything I could never fuck him so did you ever do it you know does your brain work that way there you good like with a manual and shit I feel like your brain works that way a little bit now I mean I could I just don't have any desire yeah yeah it's like your brain has this at some point decided like my I have a certain amount of capacity in my brain and I don't want to use any of that for anything that I don't I'm not interested in it's a good point yeah and sometimes some people like that stuff it's just like its I've never been drawn to anything like that and I'm just not interested like as soon as I could have someone else like do my taxes I was like yep I don't want to think about that yeah I want to do it what's all about bandwidth right yeah like what what are you spending you're thinking on you could do all those other things but how much would that be annoying yeah and how much would it fuck up the things that you like to do yeah and some people love that stuff like I have a buddy I have a buddy who's a successful actor who still does his own taxes pays his rights out his own residual checks he fucking he likes it again you know what I mean I'm like all right good for you like anjuna that's that's joyful and that brings you joy well he doesn't have to worry about getting ripped off that's I think that's part of it Chuck Palahniuk was here his agent stole all of his money no yeah Millions really he's broke it's crazy man what happened to going after the fucking I'm just going to jail yeah fuck guy stole millions stole millions from him and a bunch of other people they don't know where the money is he's hoping he can get some of it back they might be able to find some of it but the agents stole from several different clients whoa some madman and Chuck writes like Chuck writes books about like watch out seconds yeah write books about creepy people creepy shit yeah someone did it to him fuck yeah Dane's brother and his brother stole his money I think it's his half brothers half brother yeah stole like seven million dollars and wouldn't tell anybody where it is so fuck you I'm going to jail yeah and I think he might be out I think he might be out of jail looking for - you looking for new clients I think I think you like put it in coffee cans and shit and drove across the country and where are the holes yeah I mean if you have a they would be able to find it if they got ahold of your GPS unit but if you got like a Garmin GPS unit using to go hiking huh you can you know mark where your camp is but you could you could do some like geo tagging shit you could totally do that you could go to the fucking woods and go to a tree and dig a hole next to that tree deep into the ground drop a coffee can with a million dollars in it geotab put a little tag on and come back come I keep going a coffee can I don't know well there's something about yeah there's something about a coffee can that's very pleasing and the idea of like rolls of money and like that yeah in Lycans chock-full of nuts or whatever that coffee is like a full Jers crystal yeah I was garbage bag I know Fargo was just on the other day and it's like Buscemi hiding that money and then he like he's it's like he he takes it like he's got his window scraper and he's in the you know far it's just like desolate snow for miles and he just like stick he sticks the like the window scraper into the snow to mark where he's hidden the money and it's like all this guy's fucked he's never getting that money like there's no horizon line it's just snow and fucking skies do you ever watch the new version of it Thornton is yeah it's great season one's good season two is I think for my money like the best television like season two of that show is unbelievable and season three is very good but season two is un-fuckin'-believable it's like in the 70s who's in it kirsten dunst in it but like Jesse Plemons kirsten dunst who's the fucking I don't even remember but it's great it's great I like that I like all three seasons of that show but season two to me is like unstoppable are they still making it are they done they might go make some more in a few in a year - I think they might they were talking about making one I think Chris Rock might be attached - dude oh that's right yeah I saw something yeah I saw something like that but I don't know I don't know what the deal is with it but and season three is great but season two is fuckin cooked half brother and sister-in-law must repay 12 million is this new that's just from 2010 when it happened yeah he got six years in jail in 16 years probation so he'd be out by now six years in the pokey in 2010 yeah he's out I think he just got out dude because I remember seeing something about stole from him fuck must repay okay I don't have it yeah what do you do how does that work I'm in jail I mean the guy just stayed in jail like he could have I might be getting this wrong but I do remember some of the story was they they were offering leniency if he gave someone moneybags like yeah fuckin I'm not gonna give a case like that much all the gold what's that some guy found a bunch of gold he's in jail cuz he won't tell him where it is and he owes people like I don't arguably hundreds of millions of dollars or something like that because of how much it's worth he found the gold he like he found the golden and he got investors to give him the money to help him go to go retrieve it Oh was it like a shipwreck deal yeah yeah there's a lot of money in shipwrecks I was watching a documentary on these billionaires or rich folks rather who financed these guys to go hunting for treasure and there's they know where some Roman ships have sunk and so they go looking for these Spanish galleons and Roman ships filled with gold coins that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and you know it's like this crazy gamble yeah the oceans fucking gigantic yeah and also like I guess gold does gold maintain its it's like substance after it really does yeah really does that's why earlier this holy grail of shipwrecks 17 billion dollars 17 billion in gold they found it some of Massachusetts finds a shipwreck with a treasure of up to oh my god 17 billion and so and someone finance it icon no yes I thought those Carl Icahn that's fuckin wild man so um where is this fucking in Cape Cod god damn 310 year old ship Spanish ship Wow wow that's amazing yeah there was a bunch of those I mean you imagine taking a fucking boat that you made out of trees with me I try to float it across the fucking ocean with like a map that's some fucking drunk do drugs and no knowledge at all about storms coming like I hope we don't get hit by one who the fuck knows you got a Farmers Almanac thank you that all the time I just think about a letter I just think about like families like immigrants coming over to this country and like you know wherever fuckin Ireland Poland Russia whatever you want to say like turn over the 1920s whatever hundreds of years ago people get over here and they're like I made it okay I went to New York and now I'm in Rochester where the fuck I ended up and then they have to send a letter that hopefully goes back across the ocean and then to like some fuckin mailman who's drunk and dies a heart attack in the mud in Poland and you're like you hope it gets to you to be like yeah okay I'll go meet you in Rochester like I'm blown away that anybody got in touch with anybody yeah and found their family or I don't know you would think you would make like duplicate letters I guess so that has to be right they just were like I don't know if you got the last one but heads up yeah I'm you know maybe I'm a fucking slave in Rochester but I mean imagine the patience that people have back then cuz like I'll get an email from someone and then I'll get an email like an hour later did you get that email yeah like Jesus Christ bro yeah relax that was just like I was I was we're counting I saw a buddy of mine who I'd been I had met in and we were in Europe and we and we met these kids in Oktoberfest they lived in Germany and we were like meeting up with them on Oktoberfest and this was before email and cell phones and you just were like I'm gonna be at the fucking 210 train in Munich like I hope you're there and that was it that was like you hoped that you connected and that was that there was no like hey I'm texting I'm five minutes late or like I'm emailing you to let you know like we'll meet at the McDonald's or whatever the fuck it was it's crazy yeah it's amazing that anything got done yeah the people met and got married and had kids and yeah and then they traveled across the world and then came back a month later and found their family people were waiting for him yeah and they did it it happened all the time I mean and maybe shit didn't I don't know I guess like you ever watch the show Vikings no it's good show well one of the things that's crazy is these motherfuckers would get on boats and they'd go just roll across the ocean kill a bunch of people and come back six months later with some gold and everybody'd be waiting for him at the docks it's like what kind of life is this yeah just waiting in the docks is like there's no version of like well fYI we'll be there yeah I think it's not even like you're gonna sit we'll just turn the motorboat ahead to like let everybody know that we're gonna be there in like a month that's it we're gonna people are gonna one day laugh at how ridiculous it is to send a text message like these guys weren't even telepathic right did you imagine they had a text each other right they to send pictures cuz they couldn't see what the other person was actually seeing yeah dude it's that all it's just gonna be all you know fucking contact lens so what's gonna happen you have a chip it's gonna be a chip and it's gonna be like black mirror for sure yeah how far off do you think twenty years max yeah I think it's gonna happen so quick yeah just like cell phones have been so quick that the iPhone was only what 11 years ago yeah that's crazy and I was the first iPhone had a camp did it have a camera on the first time I maybe it had something if you go back and look at your iPhone pictures from like five years ago yeah you okay how dare you how dare you except this is a fucking photo I bought an Apple digital camera and it was a giant hunk shit he was like this big and it was one megapixel it was fucking jack Gant it was so big yeah it was just this brick I remember going and buying that first like a video camera early 2000s to like put myself on tape in New York you can hear the you can hear the yeah and I would try to shoot myself to fucking try to get up you know there it is that's what I had was things and that's a win his one it was probably like $2,000 probably yeah and before that when I first came out here in 1994 I had a meeting with this guy I was like one of the the bigwigs at Disney and he had a Newton do you remember a new TAF vaguely it was like a tablet and he was also happy about this he had although very organized on his Newton like this this fucking it was like a he had a thesaurus with a screen that so it looked like this big stupid fucking thing and it had you know a little stylus and he was it was this ad axon it was this in the years like between when Jobs had gotten fired and they were like or was he still there that was I think that was when right in the last year's I just saw a Alan Alda just posted a thing on his old Atari commercials I guess he was like the spokesman for Atari and it's him talking about Atari you could also use for word processing and then also that they had like a very early tablet he's like you can draw on paint on and I was like shit that's a bad man this is like 84 Wow which I'm like I don't know what that was but it was Atari early Atari shit you could paint and draw on it I guess well they're the things that they can do now there's these new I love it [Music] yeah I know well it's also funny cuz like back then in the 80s like he looks young but he also sort of looks like how like it was like he's 40 yeah is that what it is yeah but he's probably not 40 he's probably 30 but he looks 40 people used to look at shoulder yeah they'd shit nutrition and bad vitamins and doctors didn't know anything yeah and like any sort of gray you don't know what it you know no exercise well he's all though yeah those got it is crazy it's also like you look at old movies and you're like they're like it's an old old movies where you're like Cary Grant or something like he's playing like the young bachelor and he's like he looks like fucking 60 and maybe he is 60 or maybe it's just like he was just fucking smoking and drinking and looks like but he did not look good you're like I'm still a bachelor yeah there was no health back then no one was healthy no man no one took yoga classes or more did wait no nobody CrossFit there was like I'm smoking light cigarettes today we played some clips from Spartacus oh yeah Douglass like like you think it was like a Roman soldiers like a guy who like probably never worked out a day in his life no yeah and he's holding this looks like plastics or a sword looks so light you could tell he's still just sort of like one bring it down yeah those old-school bodies old-school body weight lifters are like yeah he's not yeah just everything about him I think he was 40 when they made this movie I think we looked it up yeah did you think he was is he spiked any you never know how old like how old is he supposed to be here yeah you never know but he looks old yeah he's got that it's like he'd be 60 yeah look at his arm left-hand corner yeah like if the rock remade Spartacus right now it would look it's a little different yeah well he's like Finn from cigarettes yeah like that's the extent of a workout look how slow everything I know so corny I know she needs to be so but I guess people didn't care he's he's tan though yeah legs yeah guys never done a squat his fucking life I don't know if they knew what squats were didn't it is crazy anything have you gone back and looked like what fitness like the guys who were into fitness like what they were doing yeah I'm I don't I'm genuinely asking I'm like I don't know what they were doing for they were just like fucking eating raw eggs I'm assuming well there was just very few of them there's bodybuilders back then but the numbers were so miniscule in comparison to you know today like you can go to any gym today like you go to Equinox it's filled with Jack people and women with giant butts and guys with big chests see that's all real shit that's a great workout right right yeah they're hanging from those bars and doing push-ups doing like they're doing like some circuit training shit right there right but there yeah but there these are like high school kids though yeah this looks like yeah they look very young all right that's all legit yeah but how old were they there were 18 right there was no one who is 40 who is doing that no if you go to the gym today you'll see like guys who are in their 50s who are jacked yeah man yeah it's a different world and look at that that looks fun hey man I fucking love your show the show is hilarious thanks man and the character the animation yeah it looks like you it has your lips in your nose it's really it's like it looks like you without looking like you you know what I'm saying like they captured it yeah it's weird it's uh someone posted it was right before the show came out this year someone was like someone posted like Japanese make we make our cartoons cuter Americans let's make our characters ugly as fucking possible and it's and it's mine it's me it's big mouth it's means a little fucking kid and I was like that's just like I was like that's exactly what I look like it's it's because it looks like you without looking like you yeah yes there's a real gift to that when people they figure out how to capture the perfect caricature it's weird that we and we give them even when we even if it's like we try to like when we have new characters we'll just give them pictures of the people that are playing them and just let them find that version of them and even when we don't we'll give people references because there's something about capturing a real person that makes it specific in a way that you're like why all the dudes - everybody can draw just like draw whoever which does but still there's something about like being like now we want a guy who looks like Rogan like they'll they'll get that essence that yeah great something that feels more real it's so weird but they're great we have a killer team of people designing all those characters what I love about your show is well I'd like a lot of things about it but one of the things that I love about is that you really can only do that on Netflix yeah it's just like there's it's so unhardened hilarious and there's no boundaries to it now it's one of the more amazing things about something like Netflix is that there's just you could do whatever you can do whatever you can do whatever length you want you can do you can say whatever you want you have no advertisers who you're either supporting or in competition with so we can mention brands they don't really care about that they don't care if there's no app you know when you're on network TV it's like you got to get an act break you got the first act has to be eight minutes second act has to be bah bah bah bah bah and even when there's there's more flexibility now but they but also most importantly they just basically let us do whatever the fuck we want that's amazing yeah they they've been very good partners creative what have you done stand-up special with them no I did one special years ago for Comedy Central did you just did you just came out yeah just yeah how was how it was how was the experience it was this is the second one well I've done three with them yeah it's just one with them in 2005 a long time oh yeah way back in the day and then I did one two years ago and this way they're fucking amazing yeah they don't bother you at all no they just leave you on they go you're funny yeah you want to do a special yeah okay go ahead yeah that's kind of thing they're just like you've proven that you can do your thing yeah we're not gonna get in the way and I think they realize like oh we don't get in the way we just have less work to do yeah and if they find someone like you that is a funny guy they just they know you're gonna try your best yeah yeah like you're funny it's not a money grab yeah I mean it's like you want to go you want to go fucking do it and do it well and you know that everybody's gonna see it that's the thing with them right now is you're like I don't know about you but it's like I just want if I'm gonna spend a lot of time making something I want the most amount of possible eyeballs that I can get yeah and that's what they do well especially for a comedy special yeah there's really no other game in town I mean I've had friends that did something on HBO and I'm like oh yeah if it doesn't air if you don't see it that night right there's some streaming services I'm known as HBO go but yeah I would love to see the numbers I'd be using those things I would love to see the numbers across the board but it is now it just feels like we were cuz we went out we went out wide with the show we had a couple different offers and Netflix just seemed like the place where was like they weren't gonna creatively fuck with us and they were and everyone was gonna have a chance to see it and we were gonna get like kids like we're gonna get anyone like we have like thirteen-year-old 12 13 year old kids watching the show whoa which just it's crazy yeah because it's fucking dirty yeah it gets pretty dirty yeah but I love that the masturbation demon that was we got the Andrew was like my partners on an Andrew Goldberg mark lemon and Jen flaga were like they were talking about it because mark and Jen have a kid who's was around that age when we started doing it they were just talking about hormones and that all that shit and they're like we should have a hormone monster and then they're like yeah it should just be a hormone monster and then Andrew called me he's like we're thinking about doing like a hormone monster and I just immediately was just like tell yourself Angela and it just became I was like okay all right we got him we got him fucking lockdown and it is I mean we have those we all have those things you know yeah sometimes they get integrated sometimes they don't well it's I just love that you just like what you see in South Park and what you see in Bill burr show f is for family there's things you can do in an animated show that are physically impossible in any other form and it's amazing yeah it's an amazing format especially for I think for us like for if you're a especially if you're like a comedy brain that doesn't necessarily comes of like classic sitcom writing that what you have other weird ways of getting into something and you want to be able to personify it and like animation just allows you to do it also allows you to fucking have a but like you couldn't do live-action stuff with the kit with kids the way we have where you just like it's just too uncomfortable but but you see it in animation you can get away be like alright let's have the Statue of Liberty talk to that girl and let's have this hormone monster in this season it would be unethical if you had children actors have you ever worked with kid actors yeah a little bit yeah I only did it once I did this show called hardball and there was a little kid it was like a batboy and there was a little girl was on the show and they were both like early teens like 13 14 and it was weird I felt weird like because everyone else is adults and they would swear and say fucked up that you have to look over your shoulders if the kids around yeah you say something crazy I had to deal with a kid I was on the show called the league and we had a I had a son on the show who was you know aged up every year but by the last you know seasons four or five he was like from like seven to like nine and it was crazy because we were doing some crazy shit and there's a scene where he's like eating ice chips out of a urinal and it was fine it was a clean you know we made sure it was all good but still unlike we had him doing some fucked up shit and you're like alright and the mom was there the mom was cool with all of it but it was like it wasn't just like even a sitcom or it's like we're gonna have a little maybe someone on set saying something weird like we're adding this kid doing some weird shit and it was like okay I hope this is all right well yeah what year did you get in the show business how old was I I was like 20 I graduate I started doing open mics like oh - I was 23 24 yeah that's a good year that's a perfect year you're your adult yeah young adult yeah what about you I was 21 yeah yeah young adult yeah which I was like and it took a while to like get it all rolling but it was it was I do think of the early I mean I had there a few people who seemed to start young okay but it's tough man I never met one yeah they're all crazy have you met Seth Rogen and all of you dealt with cetera how old was Seth when he he was on Freaks and Geeks when he was like 16 maybe that was the cutoff age yeah that's the age we could pull it off yeah enough awkward uncomfortable actual years as an adult he also had like a fuse on that show and then that show got canceled and he like didn't have much of like there are a few lean years there they're probably good for I think it like made him a regular human being because I'm trying to think there were no kids on Newsradio right there were no were there any lifetime there were there like act there no they're all they were all adults yes all adults except Mandy dick and it's just whatever he is yeah yeah yeah yeah I ran him at the comedy store the other day he will not the other day he's not he's banned now is he banned yeah he licked Earl Skakel's face and he just there's drunk Andy and when drunk Andy's around you just gotta get the fuck out of there you know you can tell the difference it's two different guys very aggressive yeah gets like bangs in the car window oh no it's drunk Andy yeah and and sober and he's a fucking sweet wonderful guy and so funny man he's a hilarious guy we we did scenes together where we had to do the take five six times because I couldn't stay straight yeah kept cracking well you can't stay straight with Andy yeah but he is he is he's so funny but I had I did a I did a early one of my first things I did of like a voice on American Dad and I did they had me do Andy Dick and I was so psyched to get a gig you know and I mean I was like I'm not my favorite thing is not doing other comedians like there's some weird kind of code that I don't know what yeah you know what I mean you feel like a dick I try not to talk shit about comedian it just it's like I don't know why it's like I did it it was one of my first gigs it was like oh cool I gotta be on American Dad I did Andy Dick it was looking back I would not probably do it now where you know you do it over the top I don't know I just didn't I don't know I mean isn't Andy Kahn over the top as you know what I mean like yeah I did not mean it was not been like I'm gonna go fucking get Andy Dick but anyway when I saw him when I since then I've seen him over the years and and I like him and I think he when he is sober he's like you know I saw your impression of me and he's like and he's kind of like it's funny you know and then I've seen him drunk and he's like so you know it's like a very different it's a very different version of it and I'm like oh but you know and but I get it man if someone did a fucking impression of me on some animated show I don't know I probably I'm like nah I'll do the impression of me let me let me control my narrative here I think you got to take your lumps I guess so if you dish them out you got to take your lumps yeah yeah well cuz then he's done it you know but he'd go back and watch Stiller the Stiller show he's funny as shit man that was a great show people forgot about the Stiller show yeah that was a fucking great jet him Odenkirk Janeane Garofalo Stiller bunch of I think Apatow wrote it was a crazy group here was that that's midnight or maybe run early 90 to 90 it had to be pre news radio I think it was pre when is when does News Radio 13 94 did you come verse he's out here and get news radio how old are you can get news radio 27 I was like something else I was on a show called hardball when I was 26 and was cancelled yeah it was a baseball sitcoms terrible baseball said come on Fox yeah that's the one when I did with the little kick yeah yeah yeah but that did like six episodes and it got cancelled and I was ready to move back to New York I hate it out here but uh I got a lease on an apartment yeah I had to stay here for a year like I have this place I bought a couch I bought a TV got a stereo you like this is a six-cd changer I'm not about to fucking move across the country anywhere you remember that there was like oh you could put so many CDs as fucking caesarean yeah you have people over and would go random Anya yeah let it do random yeah like a boss yeah then there are people had like hundreds CD changer oh yeah you had a tower yeah stack the tower with all CDs it I just opened up my I just opened up my cabinet with all my DVDs and like all that shit which I haven't looked at and I haven't looked at in like five six years I still have a stack of VHS tapes that I won't throw away yeah there's some of them that I just like I don't think I can get this anywhere do you still have a VHS player yes really you have one yeah whoa I haven't even touched it I'm curious five years I haven't even touched it have you gone back and did you have your camera I just went back and digitized a bunch of like stuff that I shot on like a you know my little DV stuff you know what I haven't done that and I don't even know I'm gonna I just feel like like time I know let it go more inclined to do that today because everything is did everyone's taking photos of everything and video of everything and I just feel I don't have time to look at them like if I went and looked into my iPhoto from like seven eight years ago you start going through all the pictures of them the only thing I keep is photos of my kids keep those I keep photos of your kids to thank you that's very kind of you I'll go to you if I need backup yeah other than that that's it yeah what I'm gonna do well it's like where I feel like we're in a I feel like I have a goldfish brain like I feel like I just like swim and five minutes later it's gone yeah you know what I mean and I feel like I am constantly in that space and I feel like we we record all this shit and then we don't really look back maybe some people look back but I I'm the same way I think we're in and date we're over run by information I don't think our brains are even remotely capable of processing the amount of raw data that comes from it if you check your Google news feed then you check your Twitter feed and and you know people send me things in email and I check those out I don't I don't have time I don't have the time or the storage it's just it goes in and it goes out yeah I have well I have I just was like I use the Google app on my phone to like search it yeah me too and I'll go on there but now Google's got like stories they thinks I'm gonna be interested in and then I'll be like oh fuck I guess I gotta look up did whatever is going on and then like 30 minutes later I'm like why did I go to Google what was I going in there for that's my toilet time yes I'm taking a dump I'll open that app up and next thing you know my legs are numb with the weird red imprint imprint impressions I'm like right above your knee and it doesn't make any sense it's like I didn't get anything out of that nothing I feel like if you have discipline if you could avoid that the good stories will come to you yes the ones that you need to hear about like dude have you fucking heard about what happened and like okay then you hear about it yes it is or because I also there was a period of time where I was like not reading the news I was parsing I was piecing together the news based off of people's Twitter jokes okay I'm gonna put the math together I think like you know I think there's been a hurricane somewhere yeah but I I feel like my downtime my problem I think I'm scared of having actual downtime because when I have actual downtime I spend so much time inside my phone that and that stresses me out so like if I'm working I don't have time to be looking at my phone and then I'm like just work you know what I mean but it's yeah and it's I'm scared of like downtime yeah downtime in phone time they are very bad for you it's just it's not healthy it's not normal it's not a normal interaction and if you're like looking at shit that you're freaking out about that is not like I was I was freaking out today about the what's going on in Portland there's all these anti feh riots that are happening and they're blocking traffic really yeah and people are trying to drive for their job and the antiva people are telling them go right we're closing the street off they got like masks on shit and the Portland mayor apparently is not doing anything about it there is stress smash some banging on some dudes car because he refused to fucking go right you wanted to go straight through his Street they were literally directing traffic and there's all these videos of where people are freaking out cuz Portland is just it's a great city so fun so overly progressive that you have this section of super far left maniacs that are that have gathered and have found the cause and now they're they've decided that they're gonna and these are white people screaming out fuck white people if the whole thing is so crazy it's like a misguided I just want to eat delicious food in Portland I just want to eat like fresh food good place for comedy to it is fun it's a great comedy town they're so great town yeah so blessed it's just you know when you get a town of millions of people you're gonna have a fuckin few thousand assholes there's just no way around that yeah everywhere I've gone that I yeah I'm at the Pacific Northwest is interesting just like I found the homeless vibes in Portland Seattle and San Francisco it's intense right now you know Seattle or rather San Francisco has a new app that you can locate human shit on to alert the Health Department it's like a crap app I love it only in San Francisco there's like it's a startup they have a giant problem we were there dude it's intense man it's intense they got too liberal they let - they were they're just too open-minded with the homeless folks and these people just shitting openly shitting in the gutter look at that there's the poop map oh I like that the coloring I wonder when they discovered they're like we can do varying levels of ruff what is that area that seems to be covered is it like that's downtown Embarcadero or like right off the mission shit fuck look how much shit there is that's the poop area that is crazy like on all those corners this human shit oh man that is correct and that's not an exaggeration I was there my friend Jake put it up on his Instagram a guy with his pants down just spraying shit out of his ass into the street he was standing on the sidewalk ask to the street just spray dude I mean I do that but that's like I go but I do it for art its art it's my art you know what I mean and it's for leisure do something to take public if you read a published shitty I'm not on purpose yeah I should mention it's a couple times I work but I mean I kept it in like inside my clothes yeah I shit my pants I was thinking about I was coming in here being like to have any like I'm like I don't do MMA everything I was like what did I ever do crud I was like oh right I did karate until I was like seven and I did it and I like I remember being I was in a class with a bunch of cops in my town they had like a self-defense class on and I was friends with like a cop and so he said come take the karate class and I was like sure we going to take it and it was and I'm wearing that like the ghee and I it's fucking you know I was sick so I just kept nodding it you know and I mean you're just like oh my god and I kept nodding it and then I go to class and I'd like I'd eaten fettuccine alfredo I was fucking and I'm sitting there and I'm like taking the class doing my little kicks and then I'm like I got to go to the bathroom and I get to the bathroom and I can't untie them enough it's too many fucking nods and I just I'm 6 I just fucking spray diarrhea down my down Mikey and then like go back to class and I was like I think that's the last time I took karate that was the end of my mixed martial arts career yeah that could be a problem have you ever fought so hard that you like lose can like it like Mara does that happen like with yeah like marathon have done that inside the Octagon for sure yeah there's actually a new rule in some athletic commissions they stopped a fight just for hygiene concerns yeah someone shits themselves sure but it's happened many times yeah cuz you think if like you got an open wound and you got shin there's like some yeah real issues yeah there's some real duty issues there a problem yeah and there was there was that marathon runner who lost her like yeah that's happened a bunch of times apparently marathon runners shit themselves all the time just keep running I'm now see I'm not that are you that way isn't it like you'll push it like I'm like I would never push myself to that point where I'm like yeah push myself really depends on what it meant to me you know I mean if I if I had some deep emotional reason to finish this marathon yeah like my dad died or anything right you know what I mean like burton re run marathons right I don't think Ari's ever run a marathon his dad did his dad ran a marathon his dad is a Holocaust survivor in his 80s and he ran a six-hour marathon and the but we were telling Burt there's no fucking way you're gonna beat Ari's dad Burt you're a fat fuck yeah did he beat about like a half hour Burt did it in like five hours of Ari's dad was like 70s 80s running a marathon Hades yeah he's 82 you can survive the Holocaust man yeah what's a fucking marathon you don't I mean well he was also in the Israeli army he's a tough old dude well yeah and but you look at our you're like I could see it's like there's that there's that version of julik that skinny Jew that can like run a marathon oh my god I that yeah it's like yeah I could see that well when we started doing this Fitness thing already had you know we have the sober October thing then there's this fitness challenge attached to it and Ari literally hadn't worked out at all in I think he said ten years I think ten years ago he was taking jiu-jitsu with me that's the last time he did any exercise at all how did he how's he doing he's doing great he's in second place right now he's right behind my it is a game of genetics on some level right it's just a game of will yeah yeah because this thing this this thing that we're using all it does is measure your heart rate so if you're just willing to keep your heart rate elevated and push yourself right it just depends that yeah like what is your level of competition you're like that you want to fucking yeah and what is your how strong is your will that's really what it is is there anything to it if it's like if you have an exercise in ten years and you all of a sudden start to exercise your heart rate goes up naturally because it's like what the fuck's going on we're trying to think that like maybe he's so fucking out of shape that he's just like walking his heartrate spin but I don't think so but see this thing is very flawed this fucking this thing that we have because it gives you the same amount of points for 80% of your heart rate as it does for 90 so for the first day I was like I'm gonna bury these motherfucker yeah and I pegged my heart rate at 90 for like 35 minutes I was like I'm just gonna leave them in the dust yeah like they can't keep up and then I found out all you've just keep it at 80 which is like 143 beats per minute which is easy well you'd walk and talk you know Ken today 143 if you if you're on an elliptical machine you could have a full-on conversation no problem at 143 beats right right so it's flawed but it's it's a little flawed and there's that difference between 80 and 90% where like you're getting that extra burn yeah but it's a matter of the sheer time you put in that's that's what's separating everybody in this little challenge that Ari will put in two and a half hours like he will watch a movie and just keep his heart rate pegged I had 140 346 beats a minute for two and a half says he wants to fucking beat you guys yeah just wants to win and he wants and he's been talking mad shit about it I was I was I was at first I was like you know what this contest is so fucking stupid there's no real like stakes like there's nothing we haven't established what happens to the loser you know we haven't established what the winner gets other than a belt we have a belt so models our belt like a WWE yeah yeah sure getting one made funny but it's just it doesn't that's all just wanting to beat your friends yes but in for a while it's like fuck I'm just gonna do my normal workout and if they beat me they beat me and then I was like I can't let that happen so I started ramping it up I decided over the last couple days guy took three days off too because I had to go to Vegas and out of work and then I decided yesterday I'm gonna fuck these guys up so yesterday and today I've been hitting it hard I did three and a half hours today yeah that's crazy you feel good how great yeah I mean yeah and physically do you feel different yeah do you do or do not feel different like being completely sober um well I'm definitely high as fuck from all this running yeah there's no doubt about that that's real like runner's high is legit like if you run for two hours and then of rockfalls in your car from the sky-blue hmm guess I lost my car right it's so silly it's and I get the same way from yoga yes silly there's a silliness to you yeah I hate running so much I fucking hate it I'd rather go like I started playing soccer again soccer is great yeah which is serious aerobic workout that's intense like I finish that my problems I turn bright red as soon as I do anything with any and I'm like with a color like a deep maroon and I'm like but that's great but I need I need a game attached to it I can't just run that's why jujitsu is so good for me that's what I love about jiu-jitsu you're doing something yes he's trying to you know you're doing a martial art yeah it's exhausting yes you get a great workout in while you're having fun beating the shit out of somebody yeah Chokin people yeah that's not my go play soccer and then slightly injure myself now I'm like as I'm getting older it's like every time I do it I do something fuck up my body you definitely can do that you know we have here that's amazing we have this HTC vive it's a virtual reality headset and there's a boxing game and you're standing you see boxing gloves in front of you and there's a dude in front of you right looks really good yeah throw punches and you get that aerobic workout without yeah pounding or fucking he hits you you see sparks really boom like you hit you yeah you don't feel anything but you see it makes you nervous like damn he got me yeah like I've done rounds where you you've you fight these people and you get exhausted boxing seems to be crazy aerobic workout it's great yeah getting hit in the head thing's fucking terrible for you though it's so bad for you yeah man I can't I've never been I've been so averse to that shit I was talking of Louie about that because he was boxing for a while and he was like I love sparring I go you're sparring he goes yeah I go how often he's sparring and he's like you sparring quite a bit I could do I go I know you're having a good time but you have to understand like there there's real consequences to this he's getting in car accidents concept you're getting hit you're getting hit in the head like that counts and you're doing it when you're four eight years old like this in your fat like so you're not moving a lot and right you don't got great head yeah and like your your muscles aren't there to like take whatever that there's real consequences to getting here so how often do you do that I don't do that at all you never get hittin that no I don't do it at all no no I stopped doing a long time ago yeah just it's I hit the bag I'll hit pads right I'll light spar with someone who I know yeah well where I won't hit them and they want well you know if we touch each other be like what about you yeah what about all this is different yes just choking yeah that's not there's no like there's no hitting no hitting in the head is fun it's fun it's fun to hit people it's fun to not get hit it feels good here shot give one back but the consequences are real yeah I see too much of it I see I see this slow degrading of your cognitive ability I've seen it in too many people what do you think do you think anything's gonna happen with football oh yeah you think it's good are they gonna is gonna like I think people are gonna wise up I think fighting is way better for you than football and I think fighting is terrible for you I think football is the worst yes they're running at each other full clip and slamming any each other all day it's like driving off a cliff constantly over and over and over again fucking nuts we have a friend and they have a kid who's in high school who has severe depression from get'em football he's all fucked up from football and they can't believe that it happened so fast I would go how long has he been playing for a couple years right he's been getting smashed in the head for years cuz it's just like you you watch like a football practice those dudes are just like that but I listen and I'm more less and less now I think they're finally realizing but like when we were growing up all my buddies played football like every drill was like alright stand in a circle and let's have these dudes fucking run into each other yeah speed over no finding out now they're getting hit in the body is as bad as getting hit in the head really yeah because when you get slammed in the body your head snaps back and your brain goes whoosh whoosh inside your fucking skull and it's you think that concussions only come from getting a head injury that's not the case they're fighting the people get concussions from getting hit in the body so this is pure ignorance in boxing or whatever when a guy gets knocked out yeah he's getting that's a concussion right oh yeah most of the time right yeah yeah and so those guys are just getting they're getting concussions all the time yeah yeah and they get concussions even when they win sometimes like um there's a guy named Joe vault aleni who's been on the show before he's a World Championship kickboxer he had to retire after he won the title he won the fight and then afterwards his head injury was so severe he couldn't look at the light from a charger from a phone you know the phone charger he had to be in total darkness for months at a time but for weeks at a time rather and what saved him was actually CBD oil really yeah CBD oil is pretty good at reducing inflammation it's pretty rad and its effect and that that brought it all down for him I haven't been I haven't tried CBD over him right yeah it's really good for pain and stuff like that it's great for pain it's great for anxiety and one of the more important things is it doesn't fuck with you like cognitively yeah it doesn't make you high it's not right right so you can do it and just go do stuff but it alleviates anxiety calms you down with they think that some anxiety may coincide with inflammation oh that makes sense yeah like physical inflammation at it yeah so oil you know drops yeah oil drops it's also good for just your just your overall your whole system your your gut biome it's good for everything yeah it's I've just been smoking weed forever that's good that helps I went to uh I went to Burning Man this year oh and did I had just a fucking wild time of cuz I know you talked about it I'd never done a stood before hmm I did asked it for the first time how was it it was fascinating I've done mushrooms like somewhat regularly for most of my adult life like not not a crazy maths but like you know once a year depending on you know and always loved it I'm like I was like if I were left with one thing might be that one because I like the warmth like the organic the giggles the warmth like everything love everybody I love everybody and it is like what I you know what people used to talk about like what ecstasy was I was like oh that's mushrooms like you just feel giggly and get warm and connected but I was like you know what we're going to yeah I'm going to Burning Man a couple buddies were like I've done this acid before and I haven't read the Michael Pollan book but I was like enough there's enough gonna know you've been talking about there's enough around there that I'm like I'm ready like because I remember in my late twenties someone been like trying to buy mushrooms and they're like I got asked and I was like I'm not gonna do it like I had you know at least when we were kids there was that fear that like you knew acid you could fry your brain for yeah you never come back right and I don't know if that was the kind of acid people were doing or for just people were doing a ton of it they think now that what that is it's it's people that are schizophrenic right and there's a certain percentage of the population like they were trying to make a correlation between marijuana use and schizophrenia that it causes schizophrenia but they found that that the numbers are the same as the general population the numbers of people who use marijuana become schizophrenic is the same numbers as just you take a hundred people there's gonna be one of them that's gonna be schizophrenic yeah whatever the number is whether it's one percent or higher sure and there's they think though that it can exacerbate the situation and it can actually bring it on like say maybe if someone has maybe sort of a manageable because kids afrien dia exists like many diseases do on a spectrum sure you know there's really bad cancer and as people have a mild cancer they get over yeah well with schizophrenic s-- if they do acid or if they do even edible marijuana apparently can bring it on shit man I don't think I'm suffering but if any time I eat pot I feel like I am I can't I can't I was like immediately like the thing is a little you gotta do baby doses that's the king the king with edible marijuana is great at about 10 to 20 milligrams yeah when you get to that Joey Diaz level where he's doing 500 a thousand big boy he's he's he's not just but even he quit he quit edibles really yeah he quit I can't I just like early on I was like I tried edibles and I just remember I remember I remember being in Austin I don't know if it was South by or what and I had like a cookie like a little bit of a it was earlier much earlier than now how regulated things are and I ate a little bit and like went back to my hotel room and I was like oh I can't even look I was like I can't look at the screen and I just like walk the streets went to the city the capital the state cab homes like looked at the like portraits of the former governors of Texas and then was like got like sober ish and then my buddies were like we're going to a gun range I'm not firing a gun but I'll just like and I was like this who was like eight hours later and I'm still like a mess but uh but but I was like you know what I'm going up Burning Man I'm gonna try acid I went with my buddy it was my college roommate neither of us had done it before a guide giving it to us who I was like I've done this asset I know how to do it he's like I recommend even taking this um assassin and listening to classical music and eating fruit that was his mmm and I was like all right I was like I listen to classical music and eat fruit yeah and I was like I like classical music and I like fruit so I was like this that's great I was like so we're out in the fucking desert and we eat it on our last day and have you been to Burning Man no I thought it was I was kind of blown away I found it I've enjoyed it very very much fucking weird I mean it's not sure but it was like people executing whatever they're doing incredibly well and there's a lot of different versions of it and stuff but it's kind of um there's a lot of pranksters they're like there's it's actually not it's like there's a hippie dippie quality to it but then there's some real people kind of fucking with people in a fun way that I got a kick out of but we took them took acid and like I don't know four and we start we're driving around the desert you know you're everyone's on bikes you're just on a bike driving around did you have to wear a mask no this the dust was fine it was cool and like we start kind of feeling it and that I I've had visuals on mushrooms before but this all of a sudden like the melt enos of everything started to set in and the Debbie doesn't acid in the desert before no never in the desert it's it a good good place it's a good place for it just cause like visually what's happening is like is pretty interesting like we went we driving around on bikes and we see these immediately then like some couple is like can you take a picture of us as we like try to do a duo yoga pose with the sunset I'm like okay I'm trying to do my camera I think this is what you want you know and then we drive away from there and they're these like porn stars who were two wanted pictures of that or taking pictures of themselves and I was like we're like you know we're in the Burning Man spirit of like we'll give them the gift of our music and like they don't want their now they don't want I'm not even hitting nothing I'm just like literally like driving around we've got our little like you know our little Bluetooth speaker playing classical music and they don't want any of it and then we go and sit and and we're just now starting to peak right it's sunset in the desert and it's like it was it was like oh this feels like some version of what heaven feels like you know like we're the the sky the the colors in the sky are unbelievable and and all of a sudden all the desert all the sand you know this it's like this real fine alkaline dust and it's like you feel like you're seeing some real like grid work you know I don't know if you of that feeling where you're like oh I can feel like I'm seeing some underlying dynamics of the structural stuff I've seen them on mushrooms yeah yeah where it feels like you're witness to the pattern of yes like there's some sort of yeah the structure of things yeah and that's what it felt like you were like you're looking at this like this crazy you know you go here yes you're seeing the this sand this very fine light sand with the really red mountains and then the blue really crisp blue sky with with the the white clouds on and it felt like you were like oh I'm seeing some structural shit that's going on it was quite and we're listening this guy Erik Satie was like a classical musician and eating cherries this is pretty fucking sweet I was like it's cool that you followed it to a tee you went with the fruit and I why not let's just have it you don't why not and and I think classical music is but it was interesting cuz I I didn't so then so then the Sun sets and it's like what even at the height of it it didn't feel warm like mushrooms have felt it felt like clinical clinical exactly that's exactly the worry about that it's very interesting that you said he took it riding bikes too cuz that's in a lot of ways in homage to Albert Hofmann that's how he found out about it you know he synthesized LSD and you know got it in his skin when he was working with it and then rode his bike home and on the bike ride home realized oh my god whoa I can tripping balls here yeah without even knowing what tripping yes I mean he knew something was going on he did I mean he may I believe correct me if I'm wrong but I believe it the initial reason for creating LSD I think they were they were trying to come up with a drug to induce labor I'm pretty sure that was the original I think that's what they were working on and in the process synthesized LSD and LSD as a compound and it's one of those unbelievably potent compounds where someone I think was Terence Mckenna described it as the the power to weight ratio is so huge that it's like if you had one ant that dismantled the Statue of Liberty in 30 minutes like that's how that's how potent LSD is yeah well I mean I took it actually said the Empire State Building Jesus I took a I mean I took a responsible amount like I was like I don't need to like lose my mind here I've only micro dosed it yeah I've only won one time I doubled the Micra but still it was a small dose if it was enough to just like yeah it is I had planned the synthesis of the compound when the intention of obtaining circulatory and respiratory stimulant Hoffmann wrote the new step since however arose no special interest in our pharmacologic pharmacologists and physicians testing was therefore discontinued huh I think 25th attempt aptly named lsd-25 not knowing he was not after like of psychedelic drugs no I don't believe so dosed at 4:20 p.m. you all look at him go down look at that go down yes yeah he dosed himself at 4:20 was most intense from 6 to 8 p.m. during that time he rode home on his bicycle fuck it's the best it feels great so the so we we we sort of are peaking around sunset and it's like hey it feels like I'm with my buddy of 20 years I've known as as college we've gone through our lives together and there's a thing when you eat when you trip where you're like that space-time continuum thing there's like it feels less linear time where you're like I'm having thoughts that I had 20 years ago and I'm having them today and I'm gonna have them in 20 years and like where this the linear nature of all this feels a little less you know and I'm with my buddies been like a witness to my life you know so we're having this great large conversation about our lives and all that shit and the Sun setting it's beautiful and then it gets dark and it's like alright let's go watch the man burn now like you know that at Burning Man everybody gathers 70,000 people gather you go to this big central area where the man who's been sitting there for seven days is in there's like a crazy firestarter show fireworks go off and then you burn this like 30-foot man and it's dark and it's night and and it's like it was the other side it felt like heaven and hell you know like where you're all of a sudden and that's where I felt like it was weird cuz like that's where I felt the clinical thing where I'm like I feel sort of high but I now feel actually quite in a weird way quite sober and I'm like I'm witnessing these things and I feel removed them in a way that when you're I feel like when you're on mushrooms in some way you're like you feel kind of inside of the the flow of nature and but I was also like it's the end by the time the end of Burning Man like there are people there all week and building it and putting all the stuff together an artist that's interesting and then like there is definitely of a section of Burning Man which is just like super wealthy people showing up for like debauchery and and like to be around models who are nearly naked and it's like and that's when and you look around and and the aesthetic of Burning Man is like somewhere between like Mad Max game of thrones and Tron it's somewhere in that space which is fucking rad but then when you're kind of on acid and you're kind of looking around and I had this feeling of like uh the rich are here to collect their spoils like these do you think that having the great experience of seeing the sky and the the desert and all the beauty and when you're like wow this is amazing and then when you have something like a fire and then on top of that you have a giant group of people yeah it seemed and then you realize there's not really a lot of law enforcement here it just seems like completely chaotic yeah it's and it is like the fire itself is protected cuz I think someone ran into the fire last year yeah yeah fucking killed himself after Chum ran right in that fire this year was like this year was pretty well regulated like because we had seen a couple nights before at sunrise there was like you know they have all this it's what I found do it it was like the kind of the duality of at all like Burning Man feels very much like there's this like sacred and profane shit all happening together and it's oftentimes pretty cool and like sunrise a couple mornings earlier there's this like 20-foot wooden dragonfly statue that someone had built and they are they light it on fire you know they're just like now we're gonna burn it like some dude it's been a year making this statue as I now we're gonna fucking burn it and so there there were Park Rangers all around it so there's no getting inside they light it on fire and then the Sun rises over to the left and then you looked I looked up and there were like 30 people parachuting out of this guy at sunrise and you're just like what the fuck is going on it was met it's it was really cool I really I enjoyed that but by the time Saturday rolled around you know there is something about fire that's very primal and you can feel like there's like there's some pagan quality to it all and it's cool but it's like you could feel like everybody's like energy kind of getting like a little darker and more primal and and I hit a point where I was like all right guys I gotta I gotta get the out of this like seven teeth and I also had a fear of like I wasn't scared of the fire I was scared of like I was seated watching and I was like I'm scared of a trampling yeah that's what I mean by like the giant group of people and then also with a fire and and then a gathering when when you're dealing with a big gathering there's always the potential for someone acting out whether they just need a lot of attention or they go crazy or I mean think about adverse reactions to psychedelics yes and 70,000 people the potential for something going haywire is pretty high yeah what I found interesting over the whole week was because I was pretty skeptical I didn't go in I went in being like I want to experience this thing that a lot of people have experienced I just want to like know what that experience is but what I found fascinating is there's and there's some law enforcement around there some Rangers around but there's really no it's pretty anarchical like there's really very little but in ISM in so much there's actually like some unspoken rules that basically everybody's kind of following which I found kind of fascinating where you're like there's no everybody's on bikes they're crazy art cars running around with like fucking shooting fire into the air there's no there seems to be no like regulatory board being like let me make sure that the you're crazy 30-foot three-tiered iron car is up to standard yeah there seems to be very little of that and yet it all seems to function pretty smoothly like there's like some unspoken acceptance of certain rules I'm sure there are people freaking out I know there are people like but it's mostly people like being like I took too much drugs that I didn't hydrate and like they go to the medic and there but like weirdly I found it all operating pretty smoothly but that's when the the the acid then sort of turned a bit where I was there's some darkness here that I want to get away from well it's it seems like whenever you have a situation where you get a bunch of people that want to do something outside the norm they want to get together and they want to experience something that's just they're bored of society and this is their big break and it seems like there's there's so much expectations and there's kind of a code that these people want to follow and that code is that you know it's almost like a utopian vision of a better society I mean if it's for only a week or so yeah and I think it works for a week like I don't know if society I don't know how a society would function and like largely lawless I mean the biggest rules are like don't put your trash anywhere like there's no garbage cans anywhere don't pee outside like pee in a port-a-potty pee in a jug take it back dump it out because it's like no mark no leave no no mark and it works I'm but I guess it it works for a week where you're like everybody's agreed for that week and then you go back to your life but like I don't know I got a fucking kick out of it like there's and there's a you know there's like we there's one night you know there are all these crazy light shows at night it it becomes like this crazy Tron like light show everywhere you look you at the horizon for as far as you can see is just like people on bikes that are all lit up crazy art cars crazy pieces of art that are lit up and it's really wild but like you go we you know you ride around bikes and they're all sudden we like roll up to this area where there's a like a mechanical arm holding these lights that are um LED lights that are in this you know in a circle and you lie below it and it's a go light show you know but it's this like vortex light show so everybody's kind of looking up at and it's really trippy and fun you paramos like well it's a trippy and I we I laid down I was like this is rad and then this dude rolls up my friend sees this you know those costumes of like those like Tyrannosaurus Rex like that they're inflated and they kind of her like you know individual sized things but they're like it's super weird so I look at this guy and I'm I start cracking up and my buddy just took that Tyrannosaurus Rex and walked him through the middle of everybody having their quiet trippy moment you know it's like this trance where it kind of rolls through it he's just like he was here before you you know it's like so it's kind of fun it's just like everybody's like having their trippy moment and then it gets fucked up and then a minute later they're back to the trippy moment you know I got a real I got a fuckin kick out of it was weird yeah I don't know if that would work long-term either because you'd have to have resources right you have to have feed and water and land and then who controls the food water and land yeah I think one of the things the reason why it works so well is because it's outside of culture like yes or it's outside of civilization you go to a place and everybody meets there yes yes nobody has an established like dominance or domain over it at all you just are entering on the same page we've been talking about this a lot lately like cults never work like there's not a single like one of these wild wild country things or you know Waco or the guys in what was the one in San Diego they cut their balls Heaven's Gate yeah I haven't gate they never work they never work no one is nailed it how come no one can put Bernie Mans kind of nailed it they've been the way they nailed it is they just do it for a little bit and then they go back to life yeah and and it's I guess the guy who founded it or is one of passed away this past year so they think he was in the middle of the burn this year and but even he it's it's not a cult of personality like I think that's the thing you know if you decentralize that and at the center of it is like is this fucking man burning is like I think if you take that element away I think the problem of cults is they're out there I mean is there any cult that isn't like driven by one central force it's always a person it's always a person and always gets fucked up because that person uses it and it's all run through them and then if he or she goes away then it's the next round of that person well they're always it's always playing off of this weird alpha chimpanzee instinct that we have to have like a Big Daddy the daddy that has all the messages and is in touch with God or the UFO behind the asteroid or whatever the fuck it is there's always this one person whether it's Jim Jones or you know fill in the blank yeah there's someone who has all the answers and there's a weird desire that people have to look to this one person that has all the answers yes it's very--it's well as a tribal thing it's troubling and it's specifically if you're someone who gets into a cult you are searching for something you're searching for some solidity or something and and if you've got that person at the middle is like I got you don't worry I'll give you the way at all force we were like oh thank God you know you know but I was thinking about like Scientology and being like well shit man Tom Cruise like if you can learn to fly a helicopter in like four months like maybe it's not so bad bill Bergey fly helicopter instructor yeah but it took him probably a couple years I don't think it took him that long but billboard didn't fucking yeah bill burr is a dude who likes like figure stuff out yeah he's a really good drummer have you seen him drum i mean i'd know i mean i think i've seen like ab you tube of it or but i'm fucking really good yeah like he could be in a band yeah but in his cars like he is he is building that truck like he is that old 68 yeah 68 for PIC so yeah that thing's cool that's god that's an a manual transmission on the column it's one of those weird old school ones we shift the gears like next to the steering right that's how they used to do it yeah but I think they called it three on the tree oh yeah you fuckin loves it I mean that's a brain that likes that stuff yeah and likes to like wants to learn to master flying a helicopter yeah there's a couple good there's a couple of improvisers I know - like who we're like I think Thomas Middleditch learned to fly plane my buddy Neil Casey I'm like that stuff is a real I'm like hobbyists yeah in that way I'm just like I don't care you don't have any hobbies I like hiking and I like that's a good exercise yeah my brain wants it my brain wants that and I do yoga now do the hot yoga regularly regular yoga do you how you yeah I like hot yoga you get that fucking sweat yeah it's it's there's there's a study that they just did on it or they're in the process of doing it right now at Harvard where they're trying to find out whether there's you can get similar results to sauna that you get from hot yoga because they think it's a similar situation that's happened with what's called cytokines or heat shock proteins huh and what what they showed in these studies sauna studies is that 20 minutes a day four times a week decreased all cause mortality by 40% I'll call all cause mortality meaning heart attack stroke cancer from just sweating sweating it out yeah well your body reacts to that extreme heat when it's I believe the number whatever on assay was at 180 I think she said one eight hundred and eighty degrees yeah 170 180 something something like that 170 or 180 and you do that for 20 minutes four times a week and it's there's a radical decreasing of your just your overall systemic inflammation because of that and that's getting it that hot makes you less inflamed because we got it out of our system there well your body reacts to it the body reacts to that heat and it produces these heat shock proteins and these heat shock proteins apparently are just fantastic at decreasing inflammation all about your body I gotta figure that I'm because it's all based for me is like turning red one here yeah fucking love it I use it all the time almost every day you just sweat it out going there crank that bitch up tonight I found that air pods you can put air pods and they don't overheat your phone will overheat yes you can't have your phone in there it'll shut off yeah but you could have your phone outside the song I have the air pods on and you could just listen to a podcast or listen to a book on tape what are you listening to oh yeah usually podcast yeah yeah your Studios in Europe no not listen to mine if it sucked or if it's something that I need to like Rhonda Patrick like what jeez yeah spouting out science and I heard over and over again to get it in my stupid brain yeah yeah but or if I like that podcast sucked and I need to listen to it to find out like where it went off the rails uh-huh no because that's yeah that's uh isn't that the bummer of being a trying to be a good at what you do is being like paying more attention the shit that doesn't work have to like bad sets bad comedy sets I always listened to those I fucking hate them I don't even like listen to the good ones but the bad ones are ruthlessly painful doc yes I gotta listen to the good ones because I'm because I'm like what did I what it's like not like what was so special about me but being like oh I improvised this and this oh that's big too but the problem is like part of the joy what the reason it was fun is because it felt yeah fresh and then you try to recreate it and it just doesn't have the same fuckin juice it's possible to recreate some things yes some things they just they were in the moment the audience there's a thing that the audience knows too like if you have have you ever seen a guy who's faking improvising it's the saddest thing ever cuz when you see someone worked the crowd and then you go this guy's brilliant and they see in the next night he does the same shit yeah and you go oh it's a trick yeah well you can there's a moment that happens when you're improvising with an audience where someone says something and you just have the perfect response out of nowhere they know that you just came up with it out of nowhere and it just works but there's also lines that you add to a bit that just came up out of nowhere and maybe they just crushed that night but they're still viable there's something to it you have to figure out how to recreate it yes but it's that it's that's feeling also of not wanting to be if how do you build material on stage keep it have it feel fresh without feeling like a fraud like a parlor magician yes which i think is which is sort of like the tricky the tricky thing to do you got to be less self-aware and you got to be more involved like for me at least I have to like be more connected to the idea that I'm saying like I have to recreate my own personal wonderment that's involved in the idea because they can smell it if yeah yeah like you have to like you have to really be in the moment like if you're doing a bit about bottled water you have to be thinking about bottled water like you have to be like what in the fuck it and then it has to be real it has to be but if you're not thinking about it and you're just saying the words they fucking smell yeah they're little smelly animals they fucking know it yeah even when they even when they're psyched to see you and they like it's still they're still like yeah yeah but you got to be warm or you back out your beer I mean you have seen doing spots you're back out building the new yeah I'm at like 25 30 minutes five ish right now I just can't you know it's a grind it's a crying man and I just like I don't know how like I'm like I do my show we do you know we we write big mouth it takes us like you know five six months to write and voice it and then and when I'm writing all day it's tough to go out new spots at night what was it like to break it up to do your Broadway gig for a while yeah it was great I mean that was the most fun that was like me and Mulaney do we did it off-broadway for like 25 days something like that and then toured it a little bit five days in Boston five days in DC LA New York whatever not New York and then we went back and did the Broadway show we did 140 shows like 138 shows every night you know five show weekends and that was the most fun that was the most fun cuz it's you're on stage with your buddy so you got someone even on the nights it's not working you know when you're doing a showing you're like I know they like me but this is not fun they're tired whatever and you got but you're up there alone all of a sudden you're you got someone else up there who you can make I gotta talk about me like fuck these without saying a word we both know we're like let's fucking him tonight and we because we wrote it we could improvise change whatever we wanted every night it was like having a stand-up set that you could improvise with your buddy in character that was you knew every beat you had to hit but you had a lot of freedom within it it was it was a most fun so it's like stand-up but not yeah like it was largely we built it to be presentational so we could talk to the audience at any point because there's something about doing like a play or even when I was early on doing sketch it's embarrassing you know I mean you're like we're gonna I guess we're gonna pretend like we're in a fucking Chinese restaurant right now but you're in the audience we're all in the same room right now yeah it's like it sucks to not be able to do a joke and not have a work and not be able to like talk to the audience about it yeah or be angry at the audience directly or whatever it is so we could do that so we were presentational like you're doing stand-up but we've written this play that has real scenes in it and then we built in an interview in the middle or we would interview different people like on the on the Netflix special Steve Martin and and we also had Michael J Fox Allen special as well but every night it was someone different and it was anyone from you know we got Letterman to do it but we also had like Robin Byrd remember Robin bird she was the channel J cable access porn stripper interview show in New York in like the 80s and 90s so there's no reason you would know it except if like you were 13 and going to sleep at your friend's house in the city and jerking off the fuckin stream the troopers getting interviewed like I was I kind of remember the name yeah I kind of remember that Google Robin Byrd you'll see some old there she is you know it was like you could see just the quality of that kind of like cable-access 80s New York shit we had her on the show because we felt like our boys would be interacting with Robin Bird you know so we'd have her and then we had like you know crazy so every night we got to interview someone different it's like a mini live podcast in the middle of the show so we just built the most fun show for us to do every night it was great it was the most fun and then we finished that and then came back and I did that we wrote that we did that in between season one and season two of big mouth because it takes so long to write it and then to animate it and all that stuff so that was so we we wrote in voice most of big mouth season too before you know last year just takes forever so in the time that you did it you did you do stand-up at all while you're doing it or just did it while we're doing oh hello there was no stand-up at all we're doing big mouths we I'd go out and do like a couple spots you know here and there that's exhausting right time wise yeah it's just like nine hours ten hours and you're just pitching jokes all day long and it's like you know for me I do a bunch of the voices on the show so I'm pitching for myself I'm pitching for my you know all the other characters and you're just at any given moment you're watching you're writing you're breaking in episode you're rewriting another episode you're giving notes on a radio play of just the audio you're giving notes on the animatics screening that's coming black we know which is like the black and white kind of rough draft and you're giving notes on a color screening that's come back from Korea from like six months ago so you're kind of at any given moment your rewrite especially when you're in the middle of the season you're just you're just kind of you're just yeah you're just given your your rewrite it's the beauty of animation too that you just keep getting a fucking you know figure stuff out when something's not working or just keep you know it's the it's good for that kind of perfectionist polisher of like what you're talking about were you like you're like what's not working you keep getting to figure out what's not working you know versus like live-action where you're like I hope I got it you know it's gotta be that's incredibly time-consuming and it must be exhausting it yeah it kind of is it's at the end of the day you're like I'm not gonna go out and do a spot now yeah I don't know I mean I think there's a balance right like you can't burn yourself out too much because then you won't have the jokes for the next day yeah you'll be too fried you got to pace yourself I mean everybody works differently our pacing is pretty good that like you're you're you yeah I mean there are certain times where I'm like oh I feel cooked but it's like anything else where you're like you train your brain in that space where you're like the first two weeks you come home your brain is exhausted at the end of the night and then two weeks in you're like oh okay I got my endurance back up like I can do that I can do that nine-hour day did you what did you do to keep your energy level during the day did you take any nootropics or do any no I would actually be curious cuz I get I get hammered at like 2:30 p.m. I want a nap yeah and I can't and I'm but I'm like I'm not thinking or acting like you are so I'm like coffee in the morning and then I'm you know iced and then I crash and I eat sugar and then crash and like I don't know what I'm supposed to be I'll take any any advice you got I would say that the sugar part is the biggest thing you should get rid of yeah yeah that's the thing that makes you crash the hardest greetin donuts and shit they taste delicious but your body has a really hard time processing that shit and afterwards you just Bowl like the other day I was in Vegas and because it was on a Sunday I was like fuck it man I'll just have some pancakes or something like that so I had crepes and I had this yogurt with all this it was like you know surely yogurt with fruit in it and shit and I had a and I had two cupcakes or two - two Donuts because they had homemade donuts at the hotel all right I'll get a couple I felt like dog shit for the next six hours it was just like oh yeah felt like I had been drugged like I was exhausted your body's probably truly not used to like I've trained my yeah yeah but I think there's a certain amount of a cut you get accustomed to that terrible feeling and it's just the normal feeling you have after you eat but even after like even let's say I have like a greens in protein lunch like I'm like fuck it I'm having a salad with chicken or something like that still I just hit that like my body wants 15 minutes to close its eyes at like 2:30 p.m. yeah whatever is obviously in the couch in your office I'll do that yeah I need to schedule an I need to schedule it better into the day to be like hey guys I'm walking away right now for it because that's all it needs is like 15 minutes but are like what are you what is it is it just a what is it like is it a there's a bunch of different companies that make them what they are is essentially the building blocks for human neurotransmitters um there's the gummies like when it's all powder most of the time either you take them in capsule form or you you drink it there's a good company that uh that makes one called neuro one I really like that one because it's got caffeine in it too and then there's another one called true brain that's a good one my company makes one called alpha brain that's my favorite one not just because it's my company but I think we did the best job of putting ingredients in the work synergistically but I take a neuro one a lot I like that one a lot how do you how do you take it take it in a shake I just I just mix it with water in the morning like or just whenever you need whatever and I'll take it before a workout I'll take it before a podcast I'll take I take alpha brain before every UFC yeah yeah what it is is it helps here it's been clinically proven through two double-blind placebo-controlled studies at Boston Center for memory that increases verbal memory like your ability to find the right word for a sentence increases your reaction time and I'm sure when you're doing the UFC shit you just have to be ready to yeah there's just no and I'm recounting thousands of fights like if you hear me talk yeah I don't use notes really I mean I have some notes in front of me that like I'll get a guy's record or you said I don't know especially guys that I haven't seen fight too many times right there's a few things that I'd like arrests of ants like most if it's all the back of my head so I'm recounting a thousand plus fights you have as your memory always been like that for fights for fights for fights and certain things for sure for certain things but like my wife will tell me something in like an hour later Blake what you need told me that she like she's like I just fucking told you that well I was yeah I was having a conversation with a friend recently it was like and it was like well I remember that your friend is Brazilian but I have no idea where I was in April yes yeah it's like I don't know what that is no I don't know if my memory was bad like I also would the show luckily my partners are great detail-oriented like I I'm like improvising in the room writing buh buh buh buh and I like I don't I don't want to type anything I just want to like but it'll it it's verbal it's just all verbal yeah mhm and then I'll like watch a cut of the show and I'll have an almost no memory of what I've said oh that was funny but I'll have no memory of where I came from yeah yeah and then I'll watching me like okay great we'll figure that a bit like it just seems to be the way and I don't know if that's what I've done to my brain or that's just the way it is I think funny people a lot of times they think and sort of that abstract way and that usually doesn't lend itself to the best memory it's sort of a wild loose impulsive abstract quality that in my opinion yeah the my friends the funniest friends that I have sort of have that thing going on we write your joke do you write your jokes ahead of time I do now yeah I've been doing that over the last maybe four or five years I've changed what I do yeah but I used to do is I would have things that I wrote down on notebooks yeah and I would write a little bit on a computer but maybe four or five years ago I got I became very diligent with my writing yeah and so I write out I'll write and rewrite and do it all over again started from scratch really and then yeah sorry go ahead no and then then I put it into a thing called Scrivener so Scrivener you don't you ever use that I mean that's what I'm using I use that so I could switch it's the the there's a left-hand side where it's all the column is all the different subjects and then I can move them around and put this one first of that one second and then when I click on each one that it takes me to all of the shit that I've written on that particular subject I've just found them that makes a big difference in my my output yeah quality material like how much stuff that's good tag lines I never forget the tag lines anymore because are you visually seeing when you're on stage are you like visually seeing the tag line in your head yeah what I do with with on stage one the thing that I do before I go on stage like that day usually within a couple hours of performing I write things out in a notebook if you look at my notebook it's like all work no play makes Jack a dull boy oh work now I say I write the same thing over and over again like 40 pages because it's just a memory book yeah I should call it a memory book rather than a notebook yeah it's very little of it is actual writing most of it is just like I just want to make sure that I write down all the beats to whatever bit yes yes I I've never found an organizational method that I like and can stick to in that way like my my shit is like there's like my little notebooks that are like you know my little that you carry up and I'm put on stage with a set list and then I've got like ideas of my phone and then I've got another bigger notebook with some more writing in it and then I got shit on a computer but none of its centralized none of its like and I and I'm like I'm but I cuz I also think if like if I sit down and write a joke I then deliver it that night it doesn't ever feel like how I don't know I don't it just takes work you did if you just try to write it out the way you're gonna say it onstage it will come off clunky but eventually you'll get it yeah but the the difference to me is if I just write in my head and then go onstage and I have a good premise and I work it out and it turns into a bit and as long as I do it a lot I memorize it that usually does work but it's better if I write it out and do that it's better if I do both things bet it's I still give myself a lot of room on stage to fuck around yeah and I will like just take a premise and run with it on stage but if I have a bit now I don't allow myself to not sit in front of the screen and just right yeah right that bit like there if there's a bit on like I said bottled water if I there's a bit on bottled water I will write that bit out and I will write it again and I'll write it again and I'll just open up Microsoft Word and start from scratch I'll say okay let's just start that bit over again let's see what about maybe if I just did it today would I do it any differently thing you got to leave that time to do that yeah you have to I really feel like there's a lot of people that say all right on stage okay I run on stage too but I feel like if I write on stage end I ride in a computer it's better yeah I feel like my writing is better my bits are they have more depth to them yeah well you're you're taking the time to actually think of it and then leaving yourself that room that's what it is yeah it's the time it's the time and the focus the amount of time thinking about it that's what I can't that's what I'm like especially when I'm on the show I'm just like that time is not there yeah I got it but I'm like it's you got to decide I feel like it's just like whatever you're doing you're gonna fucking jump in and do it or try it yeah whatever it is well that's one of the reasons I like podcasts so much cuz I'm fucking lazy and you don't have to do anything you just show up and start talking yeah like you and I just talked we've already been talking for fucking two hours you just start talking yeah that's it but it's interesting like people are happy to have that digests it in this format right now yeah but do you think you could get away with this on stage no yeah I mean you could do a podcast on stage if they knew they were coming to see you live yeah it's just they would enjoy it right and people do enjoy it but it becomes a view done by pop yes yeah weird right it's weird especially if it's like kind of just a chat you know I mean like if it's like yeah I feel like I'm ripping these people off I agree I agree unless there's like a specific like weird like I've done my buddy's podcasts like Mantzoukas Paul Scheer in June right Phil have a podcast like how did this get made where they talk about shitty movies and then they like they that's cool yeah and then and then you do that live and the audience has been told what the movie is and then we get up there and we fuck around and that feels like everybody there's a but there is like a prop it's not just a or fuck around right this is a structure there's a structure to it that I feel like an alive audience loves and deserves like they're psyched about it they also know what they're getting in that case but I I agree just like us shooting the shit on stage it's like people paid real money they want to see something that feels more yeah you and I were having this conversation there's 2,000 people to our right hmm it would be very fucking strange I feel like sorry folks well the weird like we're on we're it'll be in like this is on YouTube right now yeah so yeah hi guys more than 2000 but this the thing about being in the presence of those people is what makes it odd yes I agree well that's in its weirdly kind of what I'm saying about when we were doing all hello which is like we're not going to acknowledge these fucking people let's let them know what we're doing that's the cool thing about that they guys wrote it yourself and you you don't have to adhere to you know there's not a producer that no stick to this ancient script yeah there's not some like like assistant director coming I mean like hi I'm Matthias thinks that you guys should be you notice that you changed this word like that was what always drove me crazy was like right on set where you're like I know especially now where I'm like when they wouldn't let you change a word yeah and I'm like I get it you wrote a great joke absolutely but I also know I've been in a writers room I know that we wrote that joke three months ago fucking ready for lunch like the this isn't some this isn't Mozart like we didn't write some perfect song it requires like yeah you know like I respect your process but also respect that you wrote this three months ago yeah and we were not in the room and you were not with this like we are now in this particular situation on this day so let's also realize that that and I accept that when I write for other people that like whatever I was trying to do in that room let's try to get that but let's also acknowledge where we are in this new moment you know yeah that was one of the more amazing things about working with Paul Sims on Newsradio is that he allowed you to rewrite entire scenes and I really yeah Dave Foley was really like a secret producer that show his Dave Foley is such a brilliant writer what he would do is like there would be a scene that wouldn't work and he would sit back and be like okay why doesn't how about if Vicki comes in and she introduces this and then Moore comes in like here and then he will he will have like a totally different thing and he'll say to Paul like I we have a new thing for you tell us what you think uh-huh and Paul will go love it yeah and thank you guys that was in rehearsals leading up to it but I think that that's like to me the best creators and I mean I think there are some like auteur geniuses but I think the from in general the best people are the ones who are ego is enough in check that they can be like I brought you in to collaborate with me let's hear what you have to say cuz it might be better and it'll make me equally look good nobody knows yeah nobody knows that like it's gonna still say like Paul Sims created the show nobody's gonna know that Foley did a did a interesting like rewrite on a rehearsal well I think Paul would even tell you but the thing about it was that when you write something out just like we were talking about before if you write jokes they don't come to life unless there's people there they come to life when you're actually performing you like a joke just doesn't exist in a vacuum it they they've really you really need an audience yeah the thing about run and there's a similar process involved in sitcom in that as you are running through it then it comes to life and then you realize the clunky part yes or you realize a better way to get to it or you realize well this is the joke the joke is that he doesn't know this yeah and that this has happened yeah so why don't we have it this way yeah and like ah yeah yeah we I mean that's how we we we do the show you know we have a fucking killer writers room we will break stories together someone goes off and writes a script comes back and then we'll rewrite the whole script in the room and I and I I don't know if all the rooms I don't know how other rooms work but like we'll read the will read every scene together in the room just to hear it out loud and then rewrite it based on like what we all just laughed at or didn't laugh and so by the time we're actually getting the table read where we're hearing it again out loud even before we get there we've we've read it all out loud and put it on its feet five times before it's even getting heard in that room you know what's the grossest thing of all time what the fake laugh at the table read yeah the fake writers laugh yeah as you're performing you feel like a dirty whore and no you hear their fake laugh I know cuz they're just like trying to sell their jewelry but you caught the tail end of the fucking sweet spot yeah the tail end of the sitcom era yeah you really got you guys I mean with it was a great show it's amazing that there's really no sitcoms anymore I mean yeah there was the the fucking science one what does that Big Bang still won last year that's amazing it's crazy that was the first show that I was gonna test for like that was the first like thing that they were like we want to fly to LA to test for this and I was like I don't think no they weren't offering much money they weren't offering a ton of money so I was like even then and I by the way that shows not bad and those guys will never have to work again ever but I I just like I don't want to be locked into any I want to fucking dude I want to do new stuff I want up around yeah I just might were stuck on that yeah and again those guys god bless him yeah how long did you guys do newsroom was it seven years five years but it was never a success it wasn't no no's it bombed every year my friend Lou Martin was one of the world yeah he used to you know Lou yeah he used to wear a t-shirt every Monday over what our ratings were and he showed up on the set one day and it said like 88 and I went no fucking ways that really oh it's yep we're number 88 and what oh my god but by the way whatever that number was then would now be a fuckin monster hit oh the numbers that we would get and for in terms of viewers yeah be huge yeah a huge hit yeah in comparison a load B that it now be dead in the wall and now would be a huge hit and they'd be psyched but then it's like there was this sweet spot then which is like between friends and Seinfeld that was sweet spot and if you could get into that oh sweet baby Jesus you were fuckin you've made it baby there was the Caroline in the city yes Susan yeah they kept trying to seize shit what Paul Sims would call these shit sandwiches when you have these really good shows these slabs of shit in between them they were fucking terrible terrible shows and they went on for a long time and they were big hits but it even in syndication they're dead like nobody wants to watch them maybe I'm trying to think if I watch news radio in syndication that's how you want it became a hit after the fact that was the craziest thing about the show the show became popular after was canceled oh yeah cuz it was on reruns on whatever ever only was attached to so much controversy because Phil Hartman murdered and yeah you know before the final season yeah it was all so much was that weird was it crazy I mean that must have been the saddest most intense thing in the world that was that was well it taught me a lot first of all taught me do not stay in one of those evil relationships because there's people that just they just don't work together and they try to make it work together and why not fucking hating each other and that was him and her it was ugly and I tried to get him to divorce her several times and he was terrified of losing his image terrified of losing money I mean he just didn't want to be a divorced Hollywood bachelor guy his image was the family guy yeah you know I'm a married man family guy everything's great everything about him is like I'd look like a nice man yes yeah yeah yeah exactly the funniest but he was living in hell it was awful yes she was like openly insult him at parties and stuff and we you just cringe this like toxic she hated him you know and she wound up shooting him in his sleep I mean it was it was as so intense but yeah as ugly as it gets I mean he took like nyquil or something like that to go to sleep and she shot him in the head while he was sleeping she's how did you guys fight you find out on like a next day or like how do i well I found out I think I got a phone call yeah that's what it was I got a phone call this is like pre this is pretty cell phone pre yeah you know probably yeah I was 90 I want to say 98 I guess I had a phone but I mean I guess I had a self yeah a shitty Motorola StarTAC yeah remember the razor they are there yeah about 47 minutes of talk time out of battery but yeah actually now that I remember I found about it this is crazy I found out about it from a girl I'd gone on a date with who worked for like one of those shows like hard copy right that she called me up and she was trying to send a news crew to my house what a good what a nice what a nice person it's like what the fuck you talking about she's interview we're gonna send a crew to your house or what and then and then I turned in the news and there was hell this is what it was really weird there was helicopters flying over Steve's of Phil's house and then there was that guy who was in cocoon who was like a really famous actor for a while but he lost his fucking marbles who was that guy that was in cocoon the young he was a young handsome guy Steve Guttenberg now I mean Guttenberg yes yeah it was him yeah that guy lost his mind he lost his mind and he his career had fallen apart so he had pull up a photo of Steve Guttenberg let me make sure it's him before yeah let me say what he looks like now yes yes so pull is see if you can google Steve Guttenberg at Phil Hartman's murder because he had decided that he was going to talk for to the to the police yeah or not to he was gonna talk to the press so he put on like a suit and he got out there and he was he was out there talking to to the press and we were all like what the fuck is he doing I mean maybe a minute he's you don't hear about this guy anymore right he kind of vanished but he had already vanished back then it had already it was already like it was post all those movies both of the police academy and all that shit and there's a weird thing that happens to some of these guys where they just they're like it's all gone right and then they're like oh this is an opportunity for me to get back on camera and we were all all of us were like how well did he know Steve Guttenberg what the fuck is going on it was a strangest thing him standing there with a Sudan talking to all the press and talking to peace it was so weird I mean maybe I'm wrong and maybe he did have this wonderful relationship that Phil never talked about yeah but I was pretty close to Phil but I mean I don't know it's just I think there's a certain there's a certain weirdness to talking to the press about someone who's just been murdered and people that are willing to like go on camera yeah and and give interviews and stuff it's like are you morning aren't you freaked out like aren't you yeah I don't know I I someone I just was time this is a slightly change but it was someone's like do you remember where you were when the oj verdict was written I was in high school I climbed a tree like where were you in the OJ verdict in a tree I remember I was with my girlfriend at the time and she threw her hands on her face and went oh no oh no she's kept saying oh really she's went oh no oh no were you in LA yeah we were watching it in my apartment we were watching the verdict and we're and I was dumbfounded I thought he was going to jail everybody thought he was gonna course and she just she's kept going oh no oh no oh no yeah I just remember being in high school I knew Ron Goldman's sister - really yeah yeah that was real weird yeah yeah I knew his sister well because also like her her Ron Goldman's father and I have no like I can't imagine I can't even begin to fathom what that whole experience would be for anyone but he was like he felt very performative to me like he felt like he liked he was again I say this with all due respect like I don't know what it's I would have no sense of what that experience like but there are certain people who you're like oh you do like being on camera I know something horrible happen to you but you did like being on camera mm-hmm I mean I have no idea I don't know either I mean now who the fuck knows how you I don't know how I would react your son was murdered by some superstar yeah just think about how crazy is not just murdered but murdered by a famous guy yeah who then is like I'm off flaunted and got off yeah and he was a part of this weird race thing where was post Rodney King so there's a lot of people that felt like there was some sort of a racist aspect to it that like there was racist cops who got off with Rodney King so now it's their chance to get one for black folks yeah and it was people about it you know it's that crate did you watch the you do watch the oj the documentary and then also there was the FX show watch one episode of the FX show and I was like damn Cuba Gooding jr. fucking nailed it he really seemed like Oh Jay in it it was really good yeah but that's all the documentary is interesting because it sets up like la all like that the whole preceding years leading up post riots all that stuff like and you're like oh it does it sort of it does like lend itself to be like oh this was this was a perfect confluence of events then led to this thing of like you know racial up you know all everything that went into the OJ trial it's fuckin nuts it's crazy it was a strange strange time yeah strange time because it just seemed like the world was made of something that was way more flexible than I ever thought it was before like I never thought oh Jessie could be a murderer I thought murders were bad people and that the the people that you thought of that were good people on TV you would never think of like OJ was always so friendly and smiley and he would have that big laugh and he's handsome yeah talk about head injuries to CTE it's like you're like I wonder what for sure had to do with it yeah hundred percent 1000 million percent right in fact his doctor said that if the trial were to take place today his doctor at the time they would introduce CT yeah yeah you see all those toots I mean like the the level of violence that there is yes that's right police academy oh yeah they could gun make a so that's so he's funny and they could gun but it's interesting you go back and watch that documentary and it's like you know his buddies he's like his good buddies who stood by him yeah his good buddies who stood by him talk about him in high school and he's kind of like he was fucking throwing his friends under the bus in high school like now all three of them would be like doing some like in the bathroom like doing some shit they're supposed to be in class and the principal would come in and the three of them are all together and OJ were just like saddle up next to the principal and be like what are we gonna do with these two guys you know I mean he was like throwing his buddies under the bus you're like oh he was CT he fucked him up I don't know what kind of man he would have been like whether he would have been so violent or whatever but you're like piece of shit plus it kind of felt like he was a piece of shit his whole life well how about the book if I did it how crazy how crazy is that that he wrote a book if I did I didn't do have did you see that did you ever have you ever seen his prank show Joost oh yes that's post the murder oh yeah post the murder me yeah it's fucking crazy you ever see his rap song no oh Jamie find it yeah oh yes yes this was part of that juste I think thing right it's in that same thing that's part of jinsa ii it's all these young it's all these like little hot young little hotties who look like like Nicole it's so far what is that picture of him with the glasses that's from one of the sketches look at that what crazy why didn't the fuck is that well he can go anywhere with that you can go to Disneyland yeah you're that famous and you did something awful like that you got to go in disguise how many chicks bang him just cuz he's OJ no a lot you think still people are you still think we're gonna bang him yes 100% but it's a pretended hue to what what does it say got cold it this guy yeah the cuckold this guy oh god the poor guy I don't know man I a hundred percent these love's yeah this wacky broads that want to bang murderers really yes I buy it yeah I guess so there's there's a guy that we had in here Nicky Aris who went to jail he was on death row for 20 years for a crime that 22 years for a crime that he didn't commit and he said since getting out he's just in it he was asking on the podcast with these women to stop sending him emails I'm married I have a good relationship but please leave me alone like stop testing me and like really yeah if they just interested yeah there's a well Richard Ramirez The Night Stalker yeah that guy apparently got all these women were sending him pictures and email or what was letters actually yeah and he might up marrying some woman really yeah Allison Madison's mayor man C got married mmm-hmm yeah a lot of them get married yeah yeah real common fuck man crazy yeah I mean look I'd fuck OJ I would do I'd fuck them with you we'd high-five each other would you want the front of the back I would want I know I I think I don't want the front from people more dangerous if you had a CTE you like flash back and bit your dick off oh that's true you could control you can control the back a little bit yeah I wonder what I was teeth did in in prison he's out now right yup he's out yeah which is really weird that's wild what is og doing these days he was I can't remember what he was doing recently boy I think is Jamie it's got a good podcast I've got his podcast I put on my my Twitter should I interview og on my podcast or nah what was what was the robot motion capture just said via text was like what would you I guess that would legitimize him I guess quite an interview with that legitimize him I've heard that before Oh Jay Simpson living life of luxury in Vegas 23 year what year is this this is 18 oh this is just now last week Wow he's living a life of luxury in Vegas look at him here you know just walking around strolling plays golf four to five times a week of the exclusive-or golf club far from keeping a low profile the former Buffalo Bills star has been spotted at hotels and even a Vegas Golden Knights hockey game Wow what the fuck look at him okay getting someone young poseur OMG people fuck him I guarantee you girls fuck him 100% I wonder probably more than us combined CMC reported travels around town with his own breathalyzer if he exceeds a certain blood-alcohol level he could be sent back to prison so maybe he should just stop drinking maybe you should just enjoys a martini a day well what is that if he what was the blood-alcohol level where they send you back to prison how crazy is that like three but if you have three beers your fucking cage Shaye's on parole I guess right he was on the Ali G show or the thing that's yeah owned it he's at the very end of it he was trying to talk him in the sand and did it yeah I think he was I think Oh Jay was more aware of what was going on than a bunch of the other people on that show well I mean you exactly think he's probably a hyper paranoid that someone's talking with him I think everybody's fucking him since always yeah yeah more young pussy for oj oj wanted to meet me my name is Nicole he said that's my favorite name oh my god that is insane but you know what I bet he gets a lot of those vacant odd young ladies to accept it I don't know I have true I have trouble believing that maybe I mean why because you think you ever do you ever ironically fuck somebody I think some gals would do that right ironically fuck a murderer I guess they can't madam maybe I can't imagine I don't know what the social like the currency of that is what is then when Scott Peterson was sent to death row in California San Quentin prison for murdering his wife and their unborn child dozens of women phoned asking for his address with one teenager wasting no time offering to marry him Wow yeah there's a that's I think this is what I think I think there is some sort of ancient DNA that people have that attracts them to murderers and conquerors because those are the people that survived and the your there's a some sort of a strange inclination for some women obviously ones that are not thinking clearly but for some women to want the sperm and the genetics of a murderer because that's the type of the if you had a murderous brave Conqueror for a child a child would survive huh like that DNA survival yeah yeah I mean times of barbaric you're sure you wanted to be with someone yeah that's what I think it is like a killer not so much like the caveman comedian well I think that if a male feminist goes to jail they get zero requests for marriage they get none but uh yeah if some male feminist like gets arrested and goes to jail yeah it's a wrap yeah that's it but if you're a murderer you probably get a lot because women there's a reason why men become I mean there's there's men who believe in equality and want women's rights and then there's men who are really Weasley and what they're doing is they just oh they're young in the posturing yeah and I think those guys if they go to jail crickets well either way they're in jails they're not good they're probably not know how it works I don't know get in some places you can get conjugal visits yeah but I think it's it's dependent upon the jail even Cosby's getting any marital any proposals I bet it does I bet girls trying to get raped by them believe it or not I bet there are some girls who would want cause me to drug them because they are fucking crazy people get their faces tattooed yeah people you know there's people that are just straight-up nuts yeah there's a high profile thing like that yeah I think I think when I think about that I'm like what happened to those people that made them to the point where they would be interested in something like that the person that goes after yeah I have my theories about Cosby I think that when that happened when Cosby first started doing that I think it was common I think that whole slipping manataj yeah I think in the 60s in the 50s I think asshole men did that to women all the fucking time yeah and I don't think people thought about the consequences I don't think people thought about the rights of women I mean if you just think about like chauvinism in films male male chauvinist behavior and sexist behavior men smacking women in films I mean it was really common oh yeah Steve McQueen and Ali what it was with any Ally Sheedy Ali MacGraw Ali McGraw beat the fuck out of her in a scene lot at an actual scene she'd even know he was gonna do it right just beat the shit out of her and they look unfit right that was that just came out was like Brando was like yeah we didn't we just sprung this like sexual encounter on this woman yeah that a different game yeah it was a different world yeah and I think there was a lot of I mean he was always hanging around the Playboy Mansion I think there was a lot of man that just raped women and drugged them I think it was common yeah I'm sure you've talked to many women that have had something dropped in their drinking right yeah for sure they're crazy there's darkness out there there's so much darkness out there and it's a bummer it's such a fucking bummer man it's such a bummer and it's and it's yeah it's and and you think about but with it's crazy with Cosby's like it was and until again that's I mean it's crazy to think now however many years ago Hannibal set it on say it's like we all knew some version like we'd all heard some stories about Cosby and it was sort of like oh well Bill's bill I heard about it on the set of Newsradio that's when I heard it back yeah and nobody touch him well no one knew for sure nobody knew to the extent I guess or but you've heard you had heard from someone that you know bug adorable it's the crazy things when Hannibal said that on stage the people that aren't connected to Hollywood were like wait what yeah what the fuck yeah did you say he's a rapist yeah like that video went viral millions of people saw it know what Bill Cosby rapes people and then everyone's like yeah like he raped me you know yeah what it's crazy and now he's in jail it's darkness good fucking good man well it's crazy um good but crazy that it took so long and crazy it was only for three years yes he's got a three year sent three to ten year sentence wise that's the last one they could get him for right right but did you ever see him live did you ever burn and I was supposed to go for all that shit went down and we wound up cancelling and then burr wanna up seeing him and he said it was amazing Chris Rock said he was fuckin amazing - yeah Chris Rock said that he felt like he was an amateur after he watch cause yeah he said yeah he was I felt like I don't know what the fuck I'm doing yeah I saw months in Montreal during the festival I was hungover and I watched and I fell asleep it was like a Sunday afternoon I was like I know I know weird if you really enjoyed it if he was like your best your favorite comedian I know that would suck would suck I would it would suck more yeah who was your favorite stand-up when you when you're first starting uh well let's see when I first started I started in New York sort of a moment the alt scene like I remember seeing Galifianakis early on him being like Jesus Christ what the fuck is this guys do enough no he does so yeah he'll pop up and be any so funny I remember seeing BER because I've been doing sort of more alt room stuff and then I remember seeing BER come to like uh like the UCB in New York and seeing him to stand up and be like oh he's doing him and he's doing it in this space where people are not used to seeing just a straight stand-up and he's fucking killing I remember seeing him early I mean like Jesus this guy is fucking killing yeah and then being like very impressed be like how do I do that and however many years later I'm still like how do I do that when you were a kid was there anyone that really stood out you consider stander I mean I remember seeing delirious watching delirious and then we're like the The Specials that I had or around me growing up where Carlin and Carnegie delirious and like Robin Williams at the Met or summer like you know like those specials those were big for me and I just remember seeing delirious it being like memorize you know did you ever get to meet Robin no no did you see him at the store a bunch or like around I met I mean the craziest way possible I did a set at the improv and afterwards I was taking pictures with people there was like a line of people I was taking photos and this old guy with his white beard and glasses and a baseball hat came up and he wanted to tell me how funny he thought the show was and I was talking him for a couple minutes before I realized it was Robin Williams Jesus and then in the middle of it like we're talking oh thank you that's so nice I really I really appreciate a man thanks I'm glad you didn't enjoyed it holy shit I never told them I knew I was like but my Rangers saying I didn't know what to say I really appreciate that thank you so much you know and and you know he was just talking about a specific bit that I was doing and you know like about how crazy it was and like I love the twist and the turn this and that I was like wow thanks man the guy waited in line with everybody that's why yeah just waited in line came by himself did you see him doing some version of your bit couple recipes you know what you did he thankfully wasn't doing stand-up back then that was uh when he was doing that show remember he was doing that show the crazy ones oh yeah I can try to do a sitcom before he yeah but he yeah I mean I had friends everyone would see him in like he'd come cuz he'd come to do improv at UCB or and then he would go and do you know he was sort of I don't know if he was doing stand-up at any point but you know I never got to catch I never got my like you know I have a lot of friends who I feel like got got a little touch from him and and that feeling of like you are you know and I'm een because he was a guy who I was like oh that's what I like you're doing what I like you're doing stand-up but it's characters and you're doing all the stuff and you're acting you get to be in serious movies and you get to be in comedy like yeah I was sort of like he was sort of sort of a model of like well I was like I think I would like to do what he's doing yeah he was so flexible yeah in what he was able to do yeah yeah did you ever see patch Adams know it might be the worst movie ever made no be the worst it's probably right up there with a Travolta Gotti movie but I hello my god I want to see that Travolta guy fucking city every psyche says fuck every three words and you're like Oh Johnny look at you this fucking city I fucking love it there's something that I like I just like love that John Travolta there's something I like love about a man so deeply out of touch yeah that's the thing is like no fucking thumbs fucking up me and my wife's dressed as Sarah Palin I love this fucking city but the sexual chemistry between them is palpable probably real super you were talking about at the beginning of like like cults and I'm like I'm thinking about I'm thinking about I'm thinking about Tom Cruise and Scientology there's a man using every ounce of what Scientology is offering to make himself the best available man that he's capable of being yeah then you've got Travolta you've got two versions of like like a man who's becoming slightly out of touch with what he you know no look at my fucking wig back it's a good way how amazing our wigs each day he's got great wigs I mean that's a fucking incredible wig like thinning just a little bit up front you would think that's his hair he's living the dream it's incredible he's living the goddamn dream are you okay with time we could wrap this up whatever yeah I'm 33 third yeah we're what is that oh yeah that was I saw him that's amazing that little that little chin is that his he wore a little chin yeah like a little chin yarmulke there it's unbelievable I remember seeing him in an award ceremony that and then that when he had that little chin thing did he put that on after the thing I met him when his wife was on fear factor really yeah Kelly Preston was on fear she was on fear factor hmm yeah celebrity fear factor David Hasselhoff Kelly Preston how were they she was really nice yes yeah but but I I felt like I felt like they recruited people yes yeah I mean for Scientology was sort of stigmatized mm-hmm it was there was a lot of people that were joining it what is going on there though she has a black yeah I love it that here so crazy fake-looking that's like that magnetic man that you could like move the magnets around the create hair that's crazy man that's I mean they'd the color everything is wrong that's madness but yeah she was super friendly really down-to-earth super normal and friendly she's like these tarantulas are great you know if you eat enough and you want to come and hang out later we could eat more true yes eating tarantulas and you can join yeah I can John we can get your phone number your way some meters yeah I I remember watching that dick going clear the documentary man like oh I'm not scared like they're not coming for me like Miss kovitch is not coming for me he's coming for like the people under him who he sees as a threat yeah like I don't think he sees us as a threat like I don't think he gives a fuck us being like I don't know about Scientology bet he shields himself from anything like this any kind of criticism and yeah but I do tell you that I had miss kovitch his dad on really yeah oh right because he's the he's asked he's left yeah dad yeah I'm scared cuz he's like miss kovitch is like my dad is a threat to me like you and I talking about Scientology I don't think mr. which gives a fuck it was a weird conversation what was he like well he's sad is like he lost his whole life to this nonsense yeah and his sons gone like you can't his son won't contact him yeah and it was his idea to get the family and so he's like the guilt of that yeah the Sun rises through the ranks ones are running the whole fucking thing and the other son won't talk to him my favorite thing is miss kovitch and Tom Cruise shaking hands yes it's the best it's like this it's these tiny yes miss kovitch is trumping him where you can you can see Tom Cruise trying to pull his hand away and miss kovitch is like I will not relent I will not release and you can see Tom Cruise being like this tinier man than me has an even higher level of alpha ness than IQ No yeah and I would like and I will I will relent well the real threat to them is Leah Remini I mean what Leah Remini is done like she is you can see him trying to pull this the fucking salute say salute salute Brandon hand and there you must see Tom Cruise like trying to pull his hand away and miss kovitch won't let it go it's really fantastic relented yeah unrelenting you can see it's trying to like you can see the hands trying to like come loose and he won't let it happen he's like and it's like that trump move my favorite thing is when they salute the the picture of LRH yeah they saluted a shitty science fiction writer look he's wearing that big dinner plate around his neck hey no and look at Tom Cruise is not a tall man and miss kovitch is he towers over Tom Cruise or Tom Cruise towers over yes I'm sorry yes yeah look at that fucking giant gold medal he will yeah I know about being the most awesomest person universe but again I'm like did you see the recent Mission Impossible he's amazing it's amazing he's a fucking fantastic action I'm like so on board I'm on board for the whole thing I'm like listen man you know how hard it is to get a movie made now to get anybody pay attention go learn to fucking fly a helicopter and jump off a building and break your ankle like fucking go for it man well you know as well as I do you've been around a lot of actors they're all fucking crazy but yeah his crazy is just a different kind of crazy but it's also a different kind of success yeah but I'm like he's a guy who I feel like you would get like like he's like yeah like what whatever I need to do like I will I will maximize myself in the gold medal it's fucking amazing I love it I get some volume I'm here some of this I take this as a half AK it's an inside joke that's like you do it inside sight a joke yeah for sure I will continue on my way okay these are the times now people okay these are the times we will all remember isn't that the song are you there what did you do I think you know that I am there for you and I do care so very very very much that's why he's the best actor ever yeah cool shit right there where do you think he's bullshit I feel like he's on the verge of fucking tears I think so but he's shit for sure with everything he does I don't think there's a moment in his life where he's not full of shit right but he's believes it so deeply look at this the salute eh go back up back up a little bit I need to see that again watch this Twilight you know anything about that guy yeah Elrond Harvard was a fucking maniac yeah did you read going clear did you see the digested argument book it's fucking Fanta yeah the book is he was fucking shithouse rat crazy yeah crazy on a boat just he was out of his fucking mind yeah I'm self a bunch of metals have you seen that there's a there's a podcast called you must remember this and it's like all about old Hollywood and it somehow circumvents a little bit of like l ron Hubbard's seen in like Pasadena with like all these other like you know spiritualist futurists like and there and it's like it's cuckoos Ville they are like they are they are cruising on their own fuckin agenda and it's kind of amazing but he's yeah it was I wish I had more information on but again my brain doesn't retain this stuff I need to get into Scientology the book help if you just maximize your eat Ron's or whatever fucking you ever do is a stress test you ever goes again one one time I was filming a television show at San Diego and we had downtime when they were setting up a scene and if we happen to be at a park where they had one of those Scientology booths set up I went over there and the guy like put me through the whole thing I hold onto the the cans and they're connected to the wires but he was so unenthusiastic don't know something you passed I guess the thetans are I don't know the guy had no energy I think they just make them do it you know and some people don't want to do it the next thing you know they got a fucking conference table set up in a park and yeah stack of books and then they're gonna know we're in clear water they're on the other coast I gotta get to the fucking East Coast goddamn man yeah god bless him though IIIi am like I am weirdly like I mean I don't know about God less like like dislocating people friend disconnected people from their families but I am like I am sort of of the feeling like whatever you if you can find something for yourself that brings you some answers and and like gives you some comfort and motivates you to be the best person you can be I'm like good good do whatever the fuck you want I don't give a shit I agree I do I am like if you're like dislocating people from their families and stealing everybody's money like whatever but whatever your personal choice is I'm like go for a minute and quite honestly like why is it okay to be a Catholic and it's not okay to be a Scientologist because Catholics the Catholicism which I grew up with is one of the fucking nuttiest religions filled with kid fuckers yeah where they literally have their own country the Vatican is its own country they move priests around all over the world it happened there's a new case it just happened a couple of weeks ago in Pennsylvania they just found yeah thousand children that had been molested so ya know it's systemic it's crazy when did you do was there a moment in the church we were like oh I'm out I'm done well I was really lucky without my parents split up and when my parents split up I went to Catholic school for one year after that and then my mom met my stepdad who's a hippie mm-hmm and he was yeah and then next thing you know we moved to San Francisco you're right so we were in New Jersey I was went to Catholic school a year later living in San Francisco next to gay people and living right off of what's that Lombard Street yeah forget the street in the world yeah down there fisherman's whoa that's a change oh there's a craziest shift I mean this was also during the Vietnam War so I went from being in this really sort of repressive East Coast Italian Catholic environment to being around nothing but hippies and gay people out your mom wanted out oh yeah yeah everybody wanted out my stepdad wanted out my mom wanted out they just realized that there was also this was 1970 okay I was seven so 73 uh-huh 70 was for 74 so it was like the heat of the Vietnam War the hippie movement was in full swing Nixon I think was president yeah it was craziness back then and fuck everybody wanted out you know yeah have you listened to that there's a podcast called slow burn I'm just going to see that it's all about Watergate and it's sort of from the angle of like how it just took a while to unfold like it's just like you're like okay tip it like this didn't happen overnight because it would like the Russian a trumpet investigation yeah it's like this slow it's just like it's just slowly unfolding piece by piece in your like over time you're like oh right like these dominoes slowly fall and in that one you're like I didn't I just didn't know that much about Watergate but I was like oh like the water could happen and the election was five months later and Nixon won in a landslide like wow the country was like the country was like uh Watergate said it's not that it's nothing big deal and then it was another year year-and-a-half before like he yeah before he was in people yeah it's kind of its kind of crazy but it's like it gets into some of the early stuff of like Watergate and after Watergate and all the like sort of the beginning of what I think became like lidget legitimizing and different versions of like conspiracy theories of like what's really going on here you know and it's it's pretty business yeah 74 he resigned yeah but he was reelected yeah he was reelected Watergate it happened why nobody had nobody thought about it after his resignation was issued at controversial pardon bars successful Gerald Ford that's exactly what Mike Pence is gonna do you think he'll go down you think he'll get impeached I don't know I thought that more a few months ago now feels like I just he's so preposterous that as time rolls on we're we're conditioned to his preposterous Ness just all of it loses its teeth yeah look I mean the stormy Daniels thing nobody gives a fuck about it anymore okay I fucked her so what but I feel like yeah I feel like they everybody knew he was fucking people before it's like it's if you don't apply yourself to a a like normal moral framework then right it's not like he was um super ethical guy like you who was the guy that was running for president and it turned out that he was right yes well she was dying of cancer right yeah and he's having Farage on it or a baby with someone yeah yeah and that's well that's the problem with like well you see like Al Franken go down for like you know nothing no nothing and it's because on that side it's like it's like the moral framework is like you can't do that to women but if you're if you're true if you're a trump guy then you're like we it's none of your Trump guy but it's like it's like yeah well that's how Donald is right like and he's like that's how I am yeah so if bill o'reilly was taking pictures of the chicken grab there but everybody big oh yeah yeah exactly yeah but it's like if it's on the other side it's like well there's a moral framework there that you're like fuck we gotta if we're gonna say that that's the deal then we have to follow through that that's the deal Michael eventi was going to have a naughty naughty yeah this guy who's running he was the this would be great for two I was proposing a three-round mixed martial arts fight with Donald Trump jr. for charity no joke and Michael avenatti said this will be for two great causes I'm in why this guy he's it he's a little they were trying to forget some show with him in the moot right care Moochie he wants to run for president avenatti I'm saying he'll be the big threat in 2020 to the Democrats on huh I can't I can't I can't imagine that oh man yeah he's getting supposed to getting released for jail what weiner yeah on good behavior how
