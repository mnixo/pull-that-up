the Joe Rogan experience the system push you like this I think a Mustang trainer the more that the guy that trains the most the system is SME more is the best you know every time every time you see look at this you stay for because I stay in the national team for almost 15 kissing is 15 yeah 15 years staying in the Limpy Center you can imagine a stay with the tank guys for 15 years and the 15 years 10 guys I want to kill you sure yeah yeah yeah listen look what so soon building you know you choke what I know it's a building with a lot of rooms but I basic an aquatic conference a community sorry look what the second does in my room that's the rule for the another guy but this guy is that the same division right anybody told him he can see for 15 years anyway you're doing anything where you eat everything with you when you sick everything he know you about about you everything hmm so you live with your opponents right right they know when you're sick they know it's not like when you're fighting Matt Brown and he was he's in Kentucky and you're in Denver training nobody knows what's going on right there they train so you know what I'm doing I know what you're doing huh so we're all on the same floor they do it like that to build that vert you know whatever they tell them yeah adversity yeah for sure yeah come on do you know how you prepare yourself mentally for how do you did I kiss her but they had a mental imaginer you have to become a fucking machine machine but it's not only machine in the fight in India fight no no my shin are you life yeah on the day when you're sick Sitaram beat the heart something this guy not only one you should think guys hmm you know do you think it will better now machina in bed your ass that you're mending you got that no you have to become a machine inside and out and outsides those 10 guys know when you're sick right they know when you get hurt so now I'm training with you but I saw that you hurt your wrist in training I'm going after that fucking wrist right right right you're gonna say I'm like it's just that it's it's it's intense so that's why he's the machine that he is he says it only trains you to be a machine and on the outside but also trained you to be a machine on the inside well why would you do what can you do so easy I drop a 25% tax on shine Jana and you know I said to somebody that is really the messenger the messenger is important I could have one man saying waiter it touch you 25% and I can say another listen you motherfuckers I'm telling you man look I'm not in favor of the wall I'm Pro immigration I'm not a favor these ice busts and all that jazz but she'll like that wins me over I said I just won the fact that the guy's the fucking president and they said listen you motherfuckers you gonna pay 25 percent taxes he says it years before the campaign he doesn't say how many years old but what you know what's funny I was talking about on the stage I'm so tired of being yelled at by like online about people hate him like listen I'm not a huge fan of him either but so many people are like I hate him I hate him I hate him that now I kind of like him like you know how enough people say shit you're like fuck you I'm so tired of you telling me your opinion it's all the same - so I'm also what annoys me is when someone goes fucking moron that's like that's it that's all that's what you did you you you put like that's not doing anything by going hey Trump suck my dick all right dude well you got them here's my take on that if it's that if it's fucking moron you're not even supposed to listen that's supposed to not even go in I know cuz it's not if this is not effective communication so if you engage that guy don't I just completely waste your time even if you get upset it you're completely wasting your time I wipe it away but I see it and I'm like oh come on this the works the one that gets me is Nazi fucking Nazi Nazi oh yeah he's a Nazi and you're a Nazi fascist they throw these words around they really don't even know what the fuck they're saying like if you really think that everybody looks likes Trump is a Nazi you're missing that's insane you're missing a giant point you're fucking up everything you're ruining this conversation right you're right about a lot of the shit he does wrong but as soon as you say he's a Nazi right and that there's not see everyone's a Nazi well then when real Nazis come around you're gonna better have a better name new yeah yeah you can't the cool Nazis you can't fucking take the word Nazi and apply it to shit that's not Nazis that's dangerous like they say the Pacific word like call someone a murderer why'd you call him a murderer cuz he yelled an insult out that man okay that's not a murderer right but you can't do that the same thing we calling someone a Nazi that's not an onsen he might be a moron he might be a fool he might be into Trump just because he's a dumb guy and he likes the fact there's a white guy in office but that doesn't mean he's a Nazi it's also like the the biggest problem that I have is like you're it's still illegal to be a asshole it's not illegal to be a dick right if someone someone said something you don't like well it's not against the law my number one concern with all this stuff is that I think it's happening so fast and so many things are taking place in so many different realms when it comes to innovation that this stuff will just catch up to us before we even recognize it's happened and it'll be too late for sure I mean even just forget everything else even just the whole atomic bomb see Wow for the last ever since we started from the 1940s to today there have been some seriously close calls yeah you know there was remember the one there was one in the 1980s I think right before the end of the Cold War where there was in Russia you know the guy goes to his boring job where they are supposed to look for missiles from the United States and nothing ever happened day after day after day and then one day there's a blip on the radar and you're like oh shit and he's the guy's job to cool his superiors and then if he does the odds are they are gonna press the button and he's like nah let's come down maybe is wrong Americans are not that stupid they will not send one atomic bomb if they do it they send a bunch so this must be a mistake let's all relax three minutes later another bleep another belief another but if he's like oh shit they are sending a bunch of atomic bombs this is the real deal and the guy still doesn't do what is supposed to his feels like if I make this call nuclear war starts I need to be 3,000 percent convinced the evidence in front of me is pretty solid but I still don't feel it and then five minutes later all the bleeps go off it was a mistake on the radar and it was like some random bleep and oh the guy promptly dies a bottle of vodka straight because he was like you know he almost caused World War 3 exactly yeah and you know most of us all their lives now some Russian the wood in 1980s who decided not to do what he was supposed to and then didn't all because of a stupid mistake a stupid bug in the radar that's a pretty open-ended description so open-ended there were so many like weird performance art things that would happen we I mean we had performance art class there was a guy that like taped his genitals to the side and put on lipstick in a mirror and that was his performance art piece or the girl that way we would all sit there and watch it genitals did he go naked and pull it aside or how did he do that that's a really good question I like how your mind just went there you're like what actually happened I think I blocked it out because I think you could probably get away with doing that or the guise of it being something you're doing you know in a class someone yes yeah yes you get away with that so pervy I think I was focused on his beautiful lips I was trying to be polite and I look down there another woman was obese and her piece was she had pre-setup we weren't where she was doing the performance butter Pat's in like dominoes like a you know a few thousand of them in a line and she was obese and she crawled on the ground she didn't actually eat them but it was something that's weird my mind kind of drops off I remember specific parts of it but I don't remind crawling and away that was her performance he's another guy the this was I went to Detroit and then finished in San Francisco and San Francisco is known for being a real performance art history a lot of the you know the most famous performance artists nobody knows where that was the scene was in San Francisco so uh it was to store a really beautiful campus overlooking you could see a Lombard Street on one side you could see the water on the other side and another guy's piece was to jump from the second-story to a tree was like that he may or may not have made the jump and that was his party his art pieces jumping from a window to a tree yeah what the fuck I know this other guy the room where we had our class he had a bread machine this was back you know bread machines were new technology had a bread maker you know those machines you can make I guess it just does the dough right right maybe it bakes it it I think it just needs the dough and then you bake it I don't know if you bake it in the machine right no you bake it in the machine that's all coming back to me he bakes it in the machine we come into the classroom as he's baking it there's always like a reveal and these pieces right so we come in he's taken plaster from the wall and put it in the bread he's fed us the bread half of us get it half of us don't and there's plaster in the bread why do you put plaster in his bread it was something about I mean is some get the bread some don't but even if you get the bread there's plaster and so in your face what the fuck oh my god [Applause]
