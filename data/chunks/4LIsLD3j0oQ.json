and we're live with Dan Aykroyd cutting oranges and doing a podcast at the same time yes it's it's kind of like walking from the the tightrope between two buildings chewing gum and looking up at the ceiling have you ever heard of the the guy who he was a tightrope walker at the turn of the century and he was very famous so I forget as he was a French guy he walked over and I agra falls several times no a time yeah IIT was a French tightrope walker and one of the things he did Joe was one one morning he said I'm gonna do this but I'm gonna take my manager on my back I'm gonna take a small stove and I'm gonna cook him breakfast in the middle of the falls right over the falls oh and this is recorded of him having I can imagine the manager you know the conversation there okay you're gonna climb on my back we're going to the middle of Falls I'm gonna make you breakfast I love you I love handling you but know what really I have to do this so he took his manager on the back out to the Falls cooked him eggs right there and then walked to the other end of the Falls with a stove his manager all on his back this is like you know these are these are feats that that we hear about did he cook in the middle he cooked in the middle of the Falls he cooked bit cooked eggs and I think flapjacks and all while handling his manager on his back and handling the stove and the whole thing yeah there he is there yet there there there's the manager look oh my good yeah not funny where's long day that was his name yeah I want to see him cooking yeah they must have the photo they've got a little barrel up there yeah yeah wheelbarrow he had the manager on his back ferry as the manager on the back you see taking him across yeah that's how you earn you keep as a manager I know and I don't know I wasn't there there he is little table downstairs yeah so that's where kind of up to here today and I know I when I came in I saw the beautiful ball equipment and all your workout equipment I was going to bring my pinball gun so I could bounce to them off your stomach but you know what does a pinball gun well I'm just making it up here I know you've got a hard stomach there and I could just see them bounce off but and I said you know Joe do you have a knife for the oranges and I knew you'd have a really nice sharp hunting knife and he hauls this out and here I'll talk a more custom nine beautiful beautiful where that of I don't know it was a gift from my friend Donny Vinson brought it in for me yeah a thousand people died going over Niagara Falls many of them suicides and many of them you know just just that that went over in rafts and that kid Roger going over in a life jacket and kids in Bear and people in barrels who were actually intending to go over the falls and wanted to float down that far one dive a guy and the lifejacket survived and a couple of them in the barrel survived but the the tribe of the Niagara Indians who lived at the indigenous natives who lived at the bottom of the Falls were overweight and why were they overweight because they didn't run through the forest hunting they took all of the meat that came through the Niagara River and went over the falls and was dashed at the bottom of the falls the Bears the Wolves the moose all of them who drowned in the Falls all these was wildlife and they just harvested the meat off the rocks at the bottom of the fall how so they just wait they would just wait exactly yeah Wow yeah how many things get stuck it would seem like you'd be waiting a lot man forty people are here fall over so every year right now yeah Wow oh my god forty but I love upstate New York I love us I love Niagara Falls New York's beautiful um architecture from the 30s and stuff yeah Sonne it's so neat up there yeah it's a gorgeous part of the country do you mind if I make a non-additive vodka drink here for us yeah this is your vodka company and you base it I know you are a huge fan of extraterrestrials and one of the things I'm very excited to talk to you about is that but this is about your book for on all that cool this is based on the crystal skulls right well the other package is package is based on the on the crystal heads because we wanted to sell the idea of purity and you can see it's a nice smiling little happy little skull it was designed by John Alexander the great Texas artist here's our this is our wheat version we have corn in here we have weed in here and there's no cleaner vodka I must say on the planet we go to great lengths to make this a clean product not only is the bottle beautiful but the unique fluid inside is what has got us to 70 countries over 50 million bottles sold we've won twelve old medals we won the producs bow in Moscow for excellent taste out of 400 beverages and what we do is we take peaches and cream corn from Chatham Ontario and we put it in the truck in the mash and we ship it 95% alcohol volume at that point and we take it over and we put it in the ferry boat and we bring it over at the distillery in Newfoundland Canada the last one of the last state-owned stills in the world and why are we there because the water from the original Wisconsin glacier is under Newfoundland so water is an vodkas an old Russian word for water and really yeah and great vodkas have sweet water I'm just gonna I want you to just take a sip and then I'm gonna make a nice crystal globe but just so here's our notes here sir just a sec yeah Cheers yeah indeed hey to our daughters to everybody daughters and sons and already sons daughters mothers it's very good sweetness sweet vanilla dry crisp with a kick of heat off the finish our notes from Anthony Dias blue we take that to the distillery in Newfoundland we use the water there we do not add flavor packs flavor packs are added to lesser vodkas that's glycerides sugars terpenes and we put them they put them in these packages and they put them into the vodka we eliminated all of that and we have no additives at all this is c2h5oh six just absolute ethyl alcohol grain alcohol purified distilled in in a carbon filtration system not the one with the hole is where they just blow it through no we we distill and we filter and we pour it over Herkimer diamonds diamonds yep pour it over diamond we do we pour it over the Herkimer semi-precious stone and the Hermit Apprendi semi-precious stone is a one of our last purification processes now if you asked a high school professor what does pouring alcohol over diamonds do to the alcohol they probably say well nothing but our stones after certain pours a certain number of pours they turn yellow and we have to bleach them clean them or replace them the Herkimer diamond is found in an anomalous area of upstate New York also in Afghanistan and in Oaxaca Mexico they're found there they're little semi-precious double-ended crystals and people love the taste of the vodka poured over the stones now is there a chemical reaction that causes the stones to turn yellow or you know again you know you'd have to sit with a chemistry professor and say why why does the alcohol turn that the crystals yellow is it doing anything as it's purifying it we've done flavor profiles where we we pour it over the stones and give it to people and we don't pour it over the stones and give it to the people and they like it better pour it over the stones now why I like the Herkimer diamond is of course because it's near Griffith Air Force Base Romania and ya know and that was where a lot of scrambles went up in the 70s and 80s against whatever was coming and going and in the mountain and the mountains there Pine Bluff you know our Pine Bush New York Pine Bush yeah Pine Bush New York so I thought this is great Herkimer diamonds from that area associated with ETS the Navajo the Aztec the Anasazi they said that these skulls came down to them from the star children they were they were given to them as scrying devices to help the tribe move forward to give positive energy to the tribe and so I thought perfect tie-in we pour our vodka over Herkimer diamonds were tied in a little to the extra-terrestrial legend there with the skull and it kind of it's the neat kind of bow to our product but the most important thing is that then though the fluid in the bottle matches the beauty of the bottle and the bottle is to sell the idea of purity and enlightened thinking enlightened drinking which was what these these skulls were made for gosh it's good even without the orange juice dan Aykroyd you might be the greatest salesman that's ever lived another one folks I don't know if you could see this for people listening you definitely can't but if you're looking at it in on YouTube this is an absolutely gorgeous bottle with artwork all over it this really cool design is all his ol skeletons and it's hard to tell because it's kind of abstract a lot of the stuff in it but well that's John Alexander's work he does he loves skulls and skeletons and that kind of stuff from the gorgeous and day of the dead stuff and and so um you know he he painted that up he's my oh he's one of my oldest friends and we met because I work on a Saturday Night Live and my girlfriend there was Rosie Schuster one of the writers and you know we fell in love and we had a great time and to show we wrote Fred Garvin male prostitute and a lot of other things and then I went away to do Blues Brothers and she said I'm breaking up with you and I said whoa for what her for who well I met this artist John Alexander so she dumped me for him and now we're best friends and really what if I go see again I no no no if she dumped me for and he went on to uh to get married and do other stuff but yeah that's how we met so it's kind of interesting friends creative friends so we are of the vodka for the creative spirit it comes from two artists a writer him an artist a graphic artist and designer and painter and sculptor so you know Millennials love us because there's a no BS story on our purity we are we are we are a pure story we're a story about fun and about enlightened drinking in moderation of course and we are a story about quality and so I think people are buying we have a lot of female demographic there because of the cleanliness because we don't have the additives in it and you know we just take the trouble to make this product in a special way and we do this about 11 years we're in 70 countries and I'm doing doing really really well with it because people are getting the story that it's not only the bottle it's it's what since what's in the bottle you get at BevMo total wines ABC liquor bars all over the the world have it now and yeah they got a sign bomb they like the they like the no no additive story and you know it's you know it's a little more expensive in retail but it works out to about 37 cents a drink more if you have 25 drinks in a bottle you buy that bottle it's you know you're paying a little more for the quality and for the package but you got a you don't have to yet you don't have to pay too much more for for a drink it's like 37 cents more if the average drink Wynn bars we say we sell it for like maybe seven bucks a shot or say now in bucks a shot seven four or took you know two for 14 and 3 for 21 while losing people in the weeds here this is a very delicious though I'm not a vodka guy I generally like whiskey because I like to know what's happening I think about vodkas it's so smooth and this is very delicious and smooth like before you know what you're fucked up well I feel like you know it with every taste where you like oh we don't have an overdose Casa T it's sweet and and and that's it's got beautiful viscosity though this is the thing to drink around a ketogenic diet do you can you want to want a little citrus in there try it sure yes your move yeah yeah no I like I liked it get can you squeeze it in there very slowly and make it look like an egg yolk going in there and I'm having a lot of fun with it the business it's 11 years we're having fun we're fighting against the big guys you know we got to do stunts and do exciting things and talk you know talk about it in ways that it hasn't been talked about before the we did change the industry we are the purest play out there in terms of a vodka consumption I don't slag other brands they want to use the flavor packages they want to put glyceride in there which is of course since that it's a lipid you want to put in them there it's a cousin to antifreeze I gotta say glyceride glycerol but if you're like the whole person your cousins a murderer though does that matter well let me see Christ you know love prisoners and Christ forgave so it's Gandhi's sister I don't know yeah maybe she's a nice person I want to talk to you about the the story of the crystal skulls themselves cuz there's this strange sort of folklore attached to them and then there's a lot of people that believe that it's all horseshit and that these were created by modern people and buried underground yep in order to well my understanding of it is there you go yeah and indeed that's just as the citrus model the crystal driver there were 13 heads and and it was purported that the Navajo Anasazi the Mayans the Aztecs each had one the most famous one is the the mitchell-hedges skull which was found on the Yucatan by Anna Mitchell hedges he reached into a cave she was with her grandfather and was around 1926 and she reached in and there was an oil cloth covered item in there and she pulled it out and opened it up and there was the two-piece detachable jaw mitchell-hedges skull beautiful skull the hewlett-packard engineers did a test on it in the 60s they said it could not have been carved by a lapidary by my tools it had to have been polished over hundreds of years over over centuries to get to the shape that it was they said it was a polished item let's see there's the mitchell-hedges skull the Phyllis Newman skull named max she says doesn't that later decided by some people this was not okay I'm gonna I'm gonna exactly get to that point because of course it's it's important it doesn't affect my business whether they're fake or not these were beautiful artifacts and we've recreated it beautifully but it's nice to know the true story and I have a kind of a thought on the theory either way so there's the Phyllis Newman skull named max she has to put it in the closet because it talks to her there's no way we hit the brakes Felicity hit the brakes bunch of you you're an excellent talker sir oh well you know I was inoculated with a gramophone needle at birth I could talk a taxi dispatcher into vow of silence I could talk an air-raid siren to scrap but and you're obviously Canadian because you said slag yeah Canadian gal she of the tall so that's another tangent Canadian gals and yes an ATM guys so the Philip Newman Newman skull she she got it it's name is Mac she has to put it in the closet because it talks to her she said so there's the mitchell-hedges yes she does Phyllis has that one then there's the there's the mitchell-hedges skull that's in Indiana the woman the man that took care of Anna at the end of her life eventually had it and got it it sat in grafton ontario for many years and i never saw it but people said when they walked into the room and she uncovered it with the cloth she kept it in that there was an immediate feeling of well-being and healing coming over to look at the at the original mitchell-hedges skull there's one in Mexico City it's one of like one of our minis it's got a cross stuck right in the top of it which is you know that would shatter crystal if you did that how that cross got there I don't know there are there's one of the Smithsonian in Washington too at Smithsonian Washington DC and one of the Victoria and Albert Museum so that's there's supposed to be eight that we have in five that we're missing the woman that Smithsonian who has the two there I think it's they're a cloudy orange one on a cloudy green one and they're smaller she says they're all fakes that they were carved by a German lapidary in the 1800s and that he seeded them around the world oh wait a minute I think one was found in Tibet one was found in Ohio we're hearing at the Serpent Mound why does she think this one gentleman did he because he was an expert lapidary he had the tools to do it and and she figures her theory is that they're not artifacts polished by tribal hands and passed down that they're all fakes but it's just wait a minute he would have had to about an airship to go and deposit these wherever they might be around the world and what pictures of the skulls up the smithsonian personal heads and millions crystal heads you can get in victoria albert crystal head do they all have the same similar type of markings there there's the there's there's yes yes they do they do they all have the same now you see some of them are more are clearer see there's one of the the the the British Museum and there's some that are clear and they're more beautiful and there's some that are rougher like that one there and then and the green and the orange one but she says all fakes but if they're all fakes how did they get to these different places around the world and how were they found well here's the thing but what why fake the word fake is very strange because it's like they are certainly real carved crystal skulls were they from tribal ancestry them is the question who made the modern Western and Hell where they polished over they car if that's the thing aren't they beautiful oh god what are the indigenous people say they say they found them there now the whole say they came from the star children that they they were brought down and deposited and given to them as crystal ball devices crying devices - what's that one down there Jamie keeps growing where you were the one on the left right there that looks somewhat almost like a real skull oh Israel's yeah no the green is beautiful so so I guess I don't know I'm not a scientist I'm not a professional historian I guess I have to trust the lady at the Smithsonian but then I questioned they were found at different times in history around the world how do you go and seed how do you deposit them there why did she believe that is she given a coherent reason why she thinks that they're all hoaxes or she's done their analysis whatever they've done you know - through their skulls but again the youlet packard engineers took that mitchell-hedges skull and they they said this cannot be have not had been polished it would have been cracked or destroyed it could not have been built by tools it would have been cracked or destroyed it it had to have been polished yeah so but what about some sort of a very fast-moving drill with a diamond bid on it that can slowly grind down well that would be then that would be them the remarks that would be visible under under the scanner they put hood and you polish those marks down I don't I think that the intensity of this of the Hewlett Packard scrutiny revealed that there were no none of those marks and that's why they were able to make this here's the problem with this it's like you want them to be real don't you oh yeah I do too I get to but I don't trust me no neither do I so that's why I say openly when you're saying all these things I want to believe you I want them to be from the sky people mm-hmm I do too but again you know you've got a professional in Washington at our National Museum there who says no no yeah well what does she know well we could go might be her name we should get her on the first get her on the phones might be a party-pooper well I eyes I think that she's probably as in love and in love with the skulls even though they are you know not polished it in her mind I bet she loves them as much as we do but the thing is if you are a professional intellectual or someone as a curator of you know fine artwork and ancient relics you kind of have to be one of those people that dismisses anything preposterous because if not that's right like Neil Tyson don't you love us I love him I love Neil lovin but he there's no way you can sit down and say Neil Barney and Betty Hill were abducted by a flying saucer in 1957 he's not going to accept right because he can't accept that because everything in his training everything in his knowledge everything that he knows about physics and science and propulsion in the universe and how to get from place to place defies the defies the legend or I would say defies the theory that there are extraterrestrial advanced ships out there he can't accept it it's just you know he it would be unprofessional for him to say okay there's even a possibility that there were abductions but the Betty and Barney Hill story is very interesting but there's there's no real evidence other than their testimonies that correct well there was a stain on Betty's dress there's her excellent recall she was not he was on one stain on her dress that's so interesting it was a fluid that they used in in in the testing that some kind of a fluidity in testing that that they did it wonder they drew over from her and they drew sperm oh yeah from him now so there's a book out called contact by Stanton Friedman we read that yeah and Kathleen yep I'd love to know where the car is were they the the Chevy they were driving or where I don't know I'd have to ask Kathleen where it is did they get it end up on a junkyard since there were marks on the back of the car as well there were trace evidence in the back of the car you know Ted Phillips is he goes around the world collecting trace Ella evidence and radioactive signatures from sightings and and and landings on the back of the car there was a couple of marks but it was Betty's it's their credibility why would they want to bring this into their lives and she was conscious a semi-conscious through much of it and Barney was not conscious he was unconscious if you hear the tapes of Ben Simon's interviews with them under Elsa screaming and the and he was just so frightened yeah and that's and the Zeta Reticuli map when when a little the being Betty looked at the map and the being shorter a map if she was on her way out the door and she said may I take this in the being was going to give it to her but then another one zipped up and said no you can't have this reticula is exactly the same place where Bob Lazar says they found those the with the spaceships that they have an area as for well the little greys Zeta Reticuli Barney and Betty's abduction you had Marjorie fish inanimate your amateur astronomer she took the memory of Betty's Betty drew up the star map and she did a three-dimensional scale model of that part of the universe and was able to identify Zeta Reticuli 1 & 2 and accepted by astronomers so that map that Betty saw aboard that ship had not been seen on earth before and petty has no history of astronomy no no studying no none of it at all and and and you know interesting things like when they got back to the the house there there there the house was open and the keys to the house were in on the table with leaves so that they might have dropped them at the site and the beings returned them now you know who Ted Budd Hopkins was yes he said that since um he studied the Linda Cortile case where the woman was floated out of her and building over the East River and orange orb picked her up Tellez he was the God was an artist he was a graphic artist he was a designer a painter and a lovely man and he was one of the first people to start to deal with the trauma of abductees he got a reputation for me able to interview them hypnotize them interview them and get their stories and empathize and sympathize with them and he said that in some cases that he studied the beings would grab a man from somewhere in America and grab a woman and out of their cars out of their clothes put him up test them draw over draw sperm fluids whatever they were doing and then the woman would wake up in the man shoes or a different car or the almost as if that the beings were finished with them I don't care where they go now yeah I put him put him back you know that kind of thing he said that was the oddest phenomena like releasing a trout yeah that's right well I think that's such a trout you catch a big rainbow trout in your fly-fishing and you got a barbless hook you know most people if you go to Montana go to the Gallatin River shout out to the Gallup beautiful gorgeous place mmm people catch and release because they they appreciate that the trout are there they'd rather go by halibut from a store and not eat the fish because they want this the salmon to be healthy they want the trout to be healthy well so they catch them and then they release them but if you're a brown trout brown trout or invasive but if you're a saint here oh you're a rainbow trout and someone catches you and you know they take you on some 200 yard run down this river as they're trying to draw you and it's a big 9 pound rainbow catch of a lifetime you're a full time and some guy pulls it on it takes pictures of it like shows it and then releases it and then this thing's like how the fuck did I get here what am i doing outside of my universe yeah am i doing in this other dimension of air where I can't breathe it precisely yeah yeah and that's that's what that's catcher Moses lease with people Travis Walton says you know you got to think of them as just people from over there fire in the sky movie was based on here's another interesting story here's what I want people read ability there and credibility with Barney and Betty I just don't think they're lying and I don't think the aerial schoolchildren are lying I don't want to think they're lying this is the problem that I have with it I want to believe them but this is what I want people to consider because most people that are pragmatic people that don't want to be ridiculed they look at these stories then go out come on people are full of shit and I've been there too but I want I want people to imagine that if if aliens did a que occasionally visit earth what how often do you think this would take place and how it would be very infrequently and if it was if it was happening these would be completely unique unusual occurrences out of nowhere where someone would come down they would do something and they would be leaving the person with this thought in this memory and this inability to describe it with normal words if you were taken aboard a spaceship and you were some reptilian beings that were three feet tall were running experiments on you and you were paralyzed then they released you back on earth how what words do you have available to you to describe this experience in a way they like if you tell me hey Joe I went whitewater rafting with my kids it was a great time it was so fun we got to see Eagles and it was it was gorgeous and then we had lunch at this beautiful little cafe what a great day I can envision this experience I can see it but if you tell me hey man we went camping and I woke up and some alien at a finger of my gosh the allagash incident they went camping and they they were they destroyed a few of those right there's hundreds of thousands and here this is I brought you a book this is Bruce Maccabees book it's all the headlines from 1950 to 432 reports given and I'll address your specific question about people how they relate their experiences and and how genuine they feel in a second here 432 reports given the Air Force in 1952 on aerial sightings ships from other planet we've got memories members memos from the government here former army pilots these Flying Saucer by daylight whatever was sighted here July 30 stories fighter pilots at Newcastle stay alert for more saucer reports these are newspaper yeah that's yours well newspapers never lie well uh why don't you know that well they never they never make fake stories well I never touched a New York Times pretty reliable Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie Kean are reporters for the New York Times and they've been studying this phenomenon they report were very credibly on it tell you how an abductees experience is related I attended a lecture at the Fifth Avenue Medical Institute in Manhattan with my wife a few years ago that would be about 15 years ago and John Mack was a lecturer you know he wrote the book abduction he was the Harvard psychiatrist who wrote abduction we can get that up to abduction John Mack yes I've read that as well yeah and so I freaked a friend of mine out she was a very pragmatic non UFO believing person and she could we were working together on Newsradio my friend more attorney and she came up to me and she goes like this book is freaking me the fuck out and he wrote a second book as well didn't he died in a car accident John Mack believed he died in a car accident stepped off a curb in in in in a small town in England and he was struck by a car yeah and three other John Max died the same day in England so so you Pete think people whack and John Max does he know too much I don't know say again I was at this lecture and there were 300 abductees there that that some of you we interviewed with some some he had not but who were therefore interested to find out about more about their experience and one guy got up and said he had one arm and I don't know whether that was related I don't think was related to the experience but he said I'm a Wall Street broker I'm quite well-off I have a sailboat I was in Long Island Sound a few years ago and a blue light hit me and I had missing time of about five or six hours but in it I have felt filtrated memories of beings addressing me and telling me that I was powerful and influential and I could help the planet survive and they put me back on my ship and I woke up and and and and he said I'm waiting for them to come back I want them to come back and I asked the room I got up and I said of all of you who've been taken how many of you would would want to repeat the experience or have it happen again and about half of them said no no way they'd wanted to have and I have it happen again and a half said yeah we'd like to have yeah yeah half yeah now I love of so Bruce sign this to me and I'm going to give it to you and it just got great it's got great headlines from the you know from the 50s which was a massive time for saucers you know that famous for all the saucers over the the capital the glowing lights and yeah see if you can find that photo Jim's question ein 252 Washington lighting this was initiated by the detonation of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki where they decided okay these fucking monkeys are doing some stupid shit we need to go down there and see what's up and see if there's eminent danger to the cosmos let's find out what kind of capabilities they have because if you listen to Lazar or if you believe the work of zecharia sitchin or any of the people that believe that human beings were engineered that there's the the reason why this is giant leap between us and the rest the primates on the planet is because something came down and manipulated our genetics well the movie mission to Mars with Tim Robbins you know basically it says that you know basically it spits shows the face on Mars and that that is one of NASA employees favorite movies yeah there they are yeah 1952 UFO incident thank you come on let's go here and that's crazy yeah then in an airplane that ain't a helicopter now some crazy photograph and it's from 1952 I mean the the special effects back then were incredibly crude no no this is something that was reported thousands of people they Jake scrambled jets from from Andrews Fortner as well as the Phoenix lights those Phoenix lights is fascinating these you know the Fife Symington the governor said I saw them he made fun of it with an alien nut yeah but he dummies about that afterwards yeah I was put under pressure to do so yeah he's in a movie called what is it there's a there's a documentary on Netflix it's available that he's in that he talks about the pressure that they put on him to make light of that incident and he talks about his own personal experiences with seeing something some sort of triangle shaped craft that was enormous the size of several football fields it was flying overhead that was completely silent and how it freaked him out angle the triangle and Delta crafts are very very interesting but you know the the Tinley Park incidents of the of the 80s and with Sammy Rondo was the investigator there for new fun these things would park over the family barbecue for about half an hour and you know families and suburbs were looking up them the sky being blotted out by these things parking above them so yeah I think it comes down to they I don't think these beings I well Lord Hill Norton said there were 23 different species visiting the planet in 23 different types of ships I don't think they want a formal relationship with people on earth they want an informal secret relationship I think they probably have one with elements of the black elements of the Air Force and the government you know David Sarita is I've heard his David Sarita you should have him on he's very knowledgeable about this he's his theory is that the Roswell event may have been precipitated by the Trinity explosion at because it was such an interdimensional disturbance of the atoms being split and that explosion that was there was that that saucer there that went down in 47 may have may have been influenced somehow negatively by by that explosion now Stanton Friedman doesn't didn't buy that I love Stanton he just passed away there he was the expert on Roswell yeah I'm upset that I never got to meet him before he died he was so credible interesting guy who believe in UFOs but believe most people were not were lying about them oh really really yeah well he believed that there was a lot of horseshit going on including Bob Lazar he thought Bob Lazar was full of shit well I again why would why would Bob go out there and do that and and and compromise his life let me tell you something after talking to him for three hours and then riding with him the night before my I don't have I don't is to believe I had the best bullshit meter in the world but as I've gotten older I've gotten more honest and I don't I didn't see anything he's he's incredibly smart guy and he's not a guy who's like seeking out attention and he's not profiting from this and that just his demeanor and everything Jesus he's like an accountant he's a legitimate scientist yeah I mean and I've talked to him one of the things that I engaged him with we had dinner we talked about science just science in general and we talked about all sorts of different things and he's a scientist he's a legit scientist I've talked to a lot of them yeah I know what kind of person he has he said and they just hassled him again there they raided his his nuclear like to think he has element 115 that's what they think wouldn't they all love to have that yeah that's what they think that's some artist created that thing up there with element 115 yeah element 115 indeed well there's this little sliver of that yeah that's would be pretty exciting they he talked openly about it in the 90s that he had managed to weasel some away from the area s4 and they think that he still has it yeah there was some experiments that he had done that George Knapp had actually filmed that it showed some really bizarre distortions using this stuff and then it was able to it was there was I got to remember exactly what it did that they show but they did some experience with like steam or smoke or something like that where they showed element 115 emitting some sort of vapor well no it was emitting some sort of a field oh yeah literally couldn't physically touch this stuff mm-hmm yeah no would it be nice to find that that's for sure but I believe I believe Bob I do and I believe Barney and I believe Travis I want to believe all of them I believe the I believe the allagash guys why would why would they do this bullshit well I love to lie they love attention they love crazy stories people love telling you their psychic people love believing in astrology people but people believe in Bigfoot I think that there's a lot of people out there that want fantastic things to be real including me it's exciting it's way more exciting than generally than not being it is entertaining that's what I love the whole stuff it's my problem with the thing is that these people were severely damaged like Barney Hill was damaged the Allagash Boys were damaged Travis Walton were dumped psychologically damaged by these by these experiences allegedly you don't know I mean they've damaged already this might have been except that yeah this might have been somebody you read contact and Betty interviewed doesn't she come off as she does someone who was extremely credible she does she does so does Barney the Betty and Barney Hill it's a they're an interesting couple because they were an interracial couple what year was this this had 57 so they were dealing with all sorts of pressure this is during the civil rights movement and they were you know some you know they were pretty it was it was not the what you would expect for people that were calling out and trying to get attention and the way I'm you know the way they described this it resonated with people well he was having nightmares and rashes in him they had to come to some medical conclusion about it and that's our friend consistent the story was extremely it wasn't they they consulted a friend at the air force you know who they knew and they they came to bend Simon on that no it's it's a fascinating story there's this you know it's it's just it's just in a way as again it's it's it's very very very entertaining and how did you get involved in this well my mother worked for the Ministry of munitions and supply in World War two for the minister and she was suborn to work with the aircraft production for the hurricane she was in charge of working with getting the hurricane fuselages built in Canada for that he for the hurricane fighter plane so she was you know in the world of aviation and in 1947 she was walking down sparks street in Ottawa and she looked up in the sky and she was sort of said something told me to look up and she said she saw what looked like a Christmas tree ornament just winking above the street about four or five hundred feet winking on and off red green white red green light and she thought that's odd you know and then she looked at and she just zipped off in the sky and disappeared and around the house after that point we always had articles there's an article there's a cover of Life magazine with Marilyn Monroe talked about flying saucers as a cover look magazine with Elizabeth Taylor it get catalogs the Barney and Betty Hill incident so whenever one of those articles come up she always had that at home for me to read so I've kind of I was interested it from from then and I've had four sightings myself quite vivid the first one was in Martha's Vineyard I was four in the morning I got up to take a leak on the balcony there and I looked up in the sky and about a hundred thousand feet up I saw two glowing disks flying an echelon formation you saw this I saw this I will do I was was I'm in my thirties yeah and so I look up and I see these things and they're moving man they're going from Horizon to Horizon twenty thousand miles an hour and I I've been in an f5 I've had it in my hands I've been in a b25 I know helicopters I know aviation I know meteoric Bowl rides I know what's not a meteor and what is I know what's a helicopter and what is I know it's the moon and Venus two glowing glowing round objects a hundred thousand feet maybe twenty thousand miles an hour they do and because they went across the sky like just in a zigzag formation so if I screamed to my wife my friends they got up the three of us saw it and I said you know and they all knew it was something unusual that was my first sighting okay now who knows okay meteoric ball ride though many people can dispute that that wasn't real but I I know what I saw I know what my friend saw or my wife saw those things were moving they were glowing fast they were flying in formation and they were doing enough speed to get from basically the right side of my eyes to the left side of my eyes really fast the second one was I was I was in so that's so that's four I count those two is two and then the second one that I saw so the 1 2 the third one I saw I was up I was in Montreal Canada and I was at the 23rd floor of the Queen Elizabeth hotel and this would have been when we were doing patron in Canada the Patron tequila a promotion and that was a bitumen in the early 2000s and and I looked up and beyond the window there and I saw this well it just looked like an air mattress turned over on its you know with with it with the bubbles on the bottom it was huge it was a hundred 50 feet long 50 feet wide gray it was a gray rainy day in Montreal broad daylight and here was this thing at the 23rd story of the hotel and I'm looking at it and it moves slowly down on st. Catherine Street and I'm thinking where are the wires where the wires were it's got to be a balloon it's got to be there's no Thanksgiving Day Parade here what what is that and my friends are with me what is that and it come along and just parked outside the window we looked at it big grey thing with these bulbs underneath and then it slowly turned and we saw the full length of it and then it went around the corner we ran out on the hall and we just watched a drift kind of sideways off over the st. Lawrence River and disappear wha-ha-ha you know do people take pictures no we didn't get any pictures and I don't know who else all yours is in the two thousand let's see five or six something like that and then that other people report it no I don't know I should think I should have checked in and seen in Montreal with the local MUFON I think they have a representative up there but it was we all saw it and then they the fourth one that I saw I was on my motorcycle leavin town to go at Kingston Ontario where I lived there and I was driving out of the farm gate and and I saw there's a power line that runs on the opposite farm there across the road and I saw this winking red light just moving slowly along the top of the power pylons and I thought well you know helicopters did do that kind of work where they were they string power lines but they don't really do it at night I thought that's got to be a chopper or a hydro chopper like a hydro company chopper watching the powerlines checking for faults or I don't know Ives and it goes along like this and I'm watching it and I stopped the bike you know on I'm on and then it stops and makes a right angle turn and comes right at me and so I turn on the I have a police motorcycle so I turn on my wig wags you know like that you have a police motorcycle cars why do you know a policeman have a police aquit well are you a cop awkward imagine getting pulled over by a blues brother wouldn't that be good I've actually I've actually had the experience of actually pulling some people about any pulled people over sure why'd you pull him over your sheriff's well I was a reserve deputy sheriff for Taunton I was a reserve the reserve I must say but I served under the first african-american Sheriff and Hinds County Mississippi in its history anyway back to my sighting the thing comes along I put on the wig wags and the bike and it stops above me and it turns on a light and I'm going where's the rotor whop where's the where's the wash where's it come on a helicopter at 3,000 feet you can hear it this thing's like three four hundred feet above me and I'm looking at the thing I'm thinking where's the wash where's the words that it looks like it looks like a helicopter it's got to be a helicopter do I see a canopy do I see rings rotors nothing just just a mass of kind of metallic and lights and it just shines this light light on me and I turned the lights on the bike on and and then turn them off and then it winked the light off and it just drifted out over the field and just drifted off like that hmm so so you've had three different and then one night well one night I was in bed I was a night in bed with my wife it was in the nineteen eighty seven or so and I well I woke bolt upright at 3 in the morning I said I'd kind of go outside I got to go outside they're calling me they're calling me they want me to see they want me to see she says all go back to sleep so I went back to sleep next day all over the radio of upstate New York they talked about a big pink spiral in the sky that had appeared to upstate northern northeastern Ontario in upstate New York and they were saying oh it was a Chinese rocket what at a bottle rocket or the Chinese Center rocket this was the explanation that the media and the government was giving at the time so thought those are my experiences and you know how yeah and then and then an interesting thing same thing happened well I was doing a show called out there beyond belief and we were doing it over there for for Bonnie hammer over there at at the sci-fi channel and it was an interview show where I talked to Doug Meldrum the Sasquatch expert and and all kinds of talk to Doug yeah I believe him I believe him he's passionate about it I don't see why he's also a scientist I talked to all those people but the day that I had sasquatches are real yes I do I believe I believe that there's got to be that's just you know Gabrielle Reece the Olympian sure have you she talked about her Sasquatch experience no now I need to talk yeah you're really yeah yeah he's so gigantic and beautiful I would imagine that Sasquatch wanted to breed well that's why apparently it shook a camper that was she she was up in an upstate woman super athlete she was attacked her camper was attacked by one she tells that story yeah but where was I about the I was where we go back to the Gabrielle Reece a squatcher by how you interviewed all kinds of people on this show I haven't heard anything about my show I was supposed to be a let's watch it was supposed to be a yeah but was supposed to be a show I saw on sci-fi channel an interview show where I'd interviewed everybody you know all the people in the in the field of cryptozoology in that and and and sci-fi and and and science fiction and theory and UFOs and I had Steven Greer and Steven Bassett on that same to have that Steven Greer on the show too okay so I interview Steven Bassett I'm about to interview Greer and I get a call in about like noon at our noon break and they call and they say your shows cancelled we won't get out of the studio by the end of the day we're not gonna air anything that you've done sleeve and career Steven Bassett Steven Greer the UFO show it gets canceled that day now maybe miss hammer made a decision you know talk shows aren't really our thing or Ackroyd's not really what we want on a network or I don't know what she called by someone or what why that day when I was going to do this vivid you know UFO show that was going to go out on the on the air eventually why why then did it get canceled those problems how are the well no we never got we never got to air I did 26 of them and never got there never got to air so you just filmed them and it never did you guys do any wacky ones where they got the film and like what are these crazy fuckers doing was there any of that like if you were non-believer non UFO enthusiast your interview show I didn't show any footage I just I just interview just talk to people yeah so the day of my UFO showed I was going to my big Steven Greer and Steven batchat show he got cancelled so you know there's that do you think that they would can't listen sci-fi is all about those shows I mean I watched an episode of sci-fi where there's a bunch of people that claim to be trapped in a cabin in Maine because werewolves were outside it's just like it's kinda nuns they don't do talk shows I did a show on sci-fi show called Joe Rogan questions everything well how long it lasts not very long but part of that was my idea uh whatever body keep do it worked for Bonnie hammer know it was different people better than she's one of the smartest executives in the industry and I I don't doubt that she'll be running NBC someday or all of Universal but I know and I just I just I would all like to know what happened did someone call you Bonnie in and say you know don't bring myself I don't no one's gonna call people about UFOs I mean if they're gonna make phone calls they're gonna you know take out Don Lemon or something because he talks shit about Trump just doesn't make sense I was like to know what UFOs are openly discredited by normal people people not industry so half the world it believes if you look at the work of Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie Kean New York Times reporters they're credibly reporting these to this stuff Barney and Betty Hill the state of New Hampshire has certified their site there there has certified their experience with a plaque you can go to the place where they were allegedly abducted in the state of New Hampshire has UFO canceled know that that doesn't mean anything doesn't mean it happened means it's a state certified or state recognized paranormal experience sure you can get anything certified in New Hampshire that's a goofy place well I don't have to shout out to New Hampshire but I'm sad ler comes from there that's one of my he's a he's a definitely a national trend that great Wow like a state certified and also another state service are 161 out rising right around the time that was a couple months before Kennedy was shot right wasn't shot in November 63 for him right yeah Oh was it 63 yeah 63 and that wasn't 47 yeah but there you go there Barney Hill experienced a close encounter with an unidentified and then in Marfa Texas you heard of the Marfa lights no I have no now the Marfa lights are these anomalous and that's a state kind of recognize paranormal mystery too mysterious Marfa lights they have a kind of a picnic area we can watch them at night no one knows what they are they appear every night and they bounce around on the horizon they go up and down and back and forth people sell their headlights from different cars in the highway but the Air Force the state police they've all tried to figure out what they are and they just don't know what the Marfa lights are and they're recognized by the state of Texas as a paranormal event yes I do yeah lightning is a real thing that's created by pressure inside the tectonic plates but every night consistently going north and symmetrical pattern but I mean every night we go there tonight yes helmet yes we could hundred percent absolutely really yep Marfa lights how many videos of the Marfa lights are available are Fayette Martha there they are you see we got here what do we got here yeah no one knows well rednecks they're driving their trucks over there well that's what they say they've looked in there they've done surveys they've done geodetic surveys what is it is it gas is it what what do they think it is what's the official explanation the no one knows mystery lights that state of Texas has a little plaque the Marfa mystery lights enjoy them because they're there they're gonna be there tonight those sings p.m. to 2:00 in the morning really every night everybody and we get a place out there every night smoke weed and stare at the sky do you is there any UFO sightings that you think are nonsense is there any like mainstream ones that you listen to and you're like I'm not buying that one um well um all the people that I've talked to that have had sightings and have that experienced it seemed very genuine I don't know that anyone has been I don't know anyone that's been blown out publicly that I would doubt I mean can you think of one I don't know I believe like the allagash boys Calvin Parker down there in Mississippi the Pascagoula incident I mean again their their lives were severely negatively affected by these experiences but they didn't know whether or not that was gonna be the case when they reported on it a lot of people do silly things that negatively affect their life yeah and this they don't they're not a way they don't they're not future tellers there's a there's a guy there he was he says that the alien appeared at his back screen porch door he's in Colorado do you know that gentleman he says that your balls deep in this man you know all these stores this guy I don't really I don't know if I believe him because no yeah Colorado of alien at the backdoor or I don't know one seam right I just looked I don't know if I believe him or not it just looked like he was fabricating there I'm sure there's a lot of people fabricating things and I'm also sure there's a lot of people that believe they're telling a true story but in fact or schizophrenic or they have some issues or there's I think there's a lot of that going on billy meier was was doubted for sure what do you think about him the pictures are so vivid and the platings play team story so vivid I don't I don't I mean a book Billy Meyer you can see early Meyer UFO photos so where's he from he sweats he was a swiss yeah we have his book that was that I know somebody came to the Comedy Store and Blamey does a book on that kind of pictures on that yeah well look at the one by the pine tree they're going they're going all he attached the saucer to the pine but he threw it in the air and took a picture of it okay well that's one theory but wasn't it you know didn't they do that just to show the scale of their ship and some of those photos are pretty pretty convincing I don't know and okay if you want to say who keeps taking awesome pictures use those I'm not buying it well again you know if there was anyone that I had doubt because thrown so much doubt has been thrown his way that's pretty I mean how do you well I suppose with Photoshop but Bruce Maccabee I believe is Bruce macabees analyzed these well he wrote this book he says they're real right but a guy who's writing a book on UFOs is analyzing you know what you're saying they're real there's no but bonnets the Bruce Maccabee is a doctor and he's society he said he worked for the Naval Air I want to talk to his ex-girlfriend's see if he's full of shit so you know I'm saying like like you could say all these positive things beyond he was he worked for the Navy he was the one he's the expert well he's the expert he said yes the Gucci version yeah look at those balls well it's a bling-bling those are the pin balls oh yeah well if you had an Instagram account you an alien that's the one you'd but I think he did a photo he did a photo analysis and he said that that Bruce believes they're real and I believe Bruce of you if you read this book here he said he's the real thing like what Stanton was the real thing Bruce Maccabee is the real thing because they're there scientists who are doing you know very very thorough and close inquiry on the on the matter so if you ask me who I doubt maybe I don't know Billy Meyer I don't know I don't know yeah he took too many yeah if you had like three like a glut it's like yeah it's chocolate yeah come on bro that's all you're doing you're out there and they just come to you why don't you set up a camera crew 24/7 for a couple weeks and a little Steven Greer uses lasers he points them up to the sky and and kind of attracts them yeah daughters have said that if you know they've sat out and watched these things come and go with in North Carolina at their house but people saying that something happened and so how about all the photos but his thing is about UFOs he's made documentaries about UFOs business is he knows a lot about UFOs what do you walk to Greer I'm not buying what you want is you want the Sam you want the you want the herb Shermer story what's the herb Shermer story Nebraska Highway patrolman on patrol sees a flash of light in the Ashland oil refinery near Murat Nebraska flash of light and oil refinery in the broad daylight not thing could be a fire goes up not into UFOs highway patrolman goes up he was taken into a ship and deposit and he's one of the famous one so no agenda there I didn't want to tell a story and got into trouble flow and here's the third Shermer herb sage i rmer no disrespect to her but some cops are crooked they steal people's money some cops rape people some cops pull people over for nothing some people shoot people for non-existing crimes a lot of there's a lot of people that just happen to be police officers that are also full of shit that's that a lot of people are foolish yep that's true but I you know again here he is is a guy why would he say that's not the other one is his evidence well his evidence is anecdotal like a lot of it but that's the problem well the Phoenix the Phoenix lights there's there's video of that that's a different one that's a different wana Zamora Zia is a mor a he was a New Mexico Highway patrolman he said a saucer landed he saw it land and Dan Aykroyd everybody wants to be special and one of the best ways to be special is for you to have a special moment with some special creatures from a special place no one else can recognize whether or not you're telling the truth or not telling the truth right talk about this and everybody wants to listen and they listen to you they're totally fixated on everything you like - so how about how about supervised jafari Pervez jafari well I like the name okay he's a fuck he was an Iranian Air Force pilot and still lives in Iran he does many lectures and he did the famous it's the Iranian Tehran UFO sighting he chased the UFO in his jet and the thing turned off all the electronics and the jet and he said this thing was moving how about General de Brewer well how about David flavor I don't know him he's um he's the guy that they were talking about on the Bob Lazar documentary he's he experienced something that flew exactly like the Lazar once I'm gonna talk to him soon movie and he incredibly credible and you know military accolades he's a very well-respected guy and he's never had any other fantastical sort of stories and he's told I can't wait to talk to him about this yeah Ron's Jafar he's a good guest - you should get him oh and then there's the guy who flew the Alaskan you know the Japan Airlines flight with all the wine on it and the UFOs above Alaska it circled them several times that's a famous story I'd get a bottle that wine yeah that was yeah yeah so Alaska Airlines sighting that's another one so no but I like I like your view you are not gonna sit here and say oh it's all true I'm accepting it all it's too easy all I give you all I give you to hear today from my experience is the ones that I believe mm-hmm and that's Betty and Barney Hill Travis Walton Iman Josh boys yeah Betty and Barney Hill are really interesting one because also there wasn't a precedent Betty and Barney Hill in 1961 there wasn't a bunch of people that were talking about these things happening to them and since then they've been very many that were really similar very similar and it makes you wonder because here's but this is what I want to say to people that are skeptical and of course I'm scared the skeptical that's why I'm knocking holes in these things you know but if that if it did happen and you were left alone to try to explain to people something that is incredibly unique very few people ever experience it it would be so hard to get people to believe you well that's so I have instructional you go to a profession there's no such thing you know well just somehow who can the professional means you make money doing it means you've studied it and you make money doing it there's not a single fucking human being on this planet that's a professional Explorer of other worlds right there's not a single person on this planet that is a professional expert on alien civilization it can tell you everything they need to know I know more about French about the language of the French language than anyone that's ever lived knows about alien civilizations and I don't know shit about French do you know Sam yeah I know it's a real place I know France is a real place and French is a real language and I could say Pauly vous francais that's more than anybody can explain about any any civilization on some other planet gotta take the credentials of the people who report these things and I means barley terrestrial they are that's right no you know UFOs generals pilots and and on UFOs go on the record that's Leslie Keens book and there's some pretty pretty compelling you know stories remember Arsenio Hall when he that thing you would do things that make you go hmm hundreds in states see flying saucers Indianapolis news you know anyway this is a neat book by Bruce I believe Bruce was the real thing I believe Stanton is the real thing I listen J Allen Hynek is one of the more interesting characters to me because he ran Project Blue Book and his directive was to debunk these stories whether or not they were credible he was his directive was to say that's a weather balloon that's a that's a star this is a swamp gas that was his directive but then when he left Project Blue Book he said listen these things are real yes twenty percent of sightings are explained and said these things are real and when you talk to a man like that who's living was in debunking these things and then after it was all over he was compelled to communicate with the American public that there was a real situation going yeah going on there is and he's really interesting to man can Arnold his sighting is pretty compelling sure so I think I don't think they want to form a relationship with us I think they're coming and going like taxis and they have been since the beginning of the existence of life on this planet or the existence of this planet do you think they engineered human beings well that mission to Mars movie is one of NASA employees favorite movies I think maybe the motion of Mars movie something that's a mission to Mars Tim Robbins really good picture doc it's a feature feature yeah mission to Mars yeah yes it about it's about the mission to Mars and them discovering there was a civilization there and that perhaps we were helped along in our development what year is this around ah not sure mission two houses really really good it was like a horror movie here's the here's the I saw that movie Marilyn there's a case for interplanetary saucers that was in Life magazine okay I remember this movie now is that a good movie it was really good in the end Tim Robbins kind of this new astronauts that got really deep into UFOs right little Adam is one of them well have an interesting story for you and this is of course totally anecdotally part of the it's part of the lore and we have you want another drink hell yeah okay so Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin I do believe that we actually rent to the moon III don't believe that I don't believe that that's a fake experience I know I'm gonna said people say oh well it was black and the Dustin's you know the just flew up and it wouldn't it wouldn't crystal had vodka cleanest vodka on the planet so I believe that when and and and you know I've Buzz Aldrin a good friend of mine loved as a good friend of everybody's but I loved buzz and so they go to the moon and I love that story about there was only 17 seconds of fuel left one thing when they landed and then then he had to kind of hop over some rocks to get there you know so there's a story that Neil Armstrong was at a conference in in in France in a hotel room and one and there was a woman there who had been previously head of mi6 and she was a part of this cocktail party and she overheard a conversation between Neil Armstrong and another gentleman was in the intelligence service and I was asking him about the moon landing and Neil said you know there was a frequency that we switched to to talk about other things that were happening at that time and then guys what do you mean he said when we landed there on the rim of the crater nearby he said there were several ships and they were large and menacing what's a menacing ship shaped like one of your bottles of skulls well no this is a happy school no the Coneheads starship or mother conehead so I mean that's a total ending I mean but I think you know if that if you deal arm if that's true you know well well he only said that one time in French maybe they again the woman you want this will have a straight right the woman the woman was with mi6 purportedly that's kind of a neat story of course it's a neat story Edgar Mitchell said that he saw something out there too right you're Mitchell did and he's passed Condon he's passed away since right yeah although he was a firm believer and the and then the STS 1979 SDS Space Shuttle footage you've seen that STS 1979 hether satellite tether break oh I have seen yeah the tether broke off it was a mile long and they were supposed to spin off a satellite it was a mile long and they said that broke so the tether is a mile long but in the back of the tether you see these old lifesavers shaped rings going back and forth mm-hmm well David Cerreta says that's a species that was trying to help the planet and they were bringing giant water bags and giant giant water vessels to heal our ozone layer it was the STS 1979 space shuttle tether water heals ozone layers a lot of these what water yeah water and water - it's a big big massive massive dumps of water these were supposed to be these old shaped lifesaver shaped UFO figures and then what he did was he compared them against the length of the tether which was a mile long and said these things would have had to have been you know quite large now that's David's arena you should have emani's is a brilliant ufologist and theorist hmm and sts space shuttle 1979 and then Lonnie Zamora you should also check and herb Shermer a Chir Mir I'm Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal you know this is just paper but there's a video for there you go evidence records and plasmids in the thermosphere there we go they're ten separate NASA space shuttle missions over two hundred miles above the earth within the the thermosphere the structures appear to be self illuminated maybe several meters or kilometers in size and have four distinct morphologies what is this what's the title of this who's this from emeritus brain Research Laboratory Northern California cosmology it's pretty neat across it it may be wrong Joseph's PhD Center for cosmology Silicon Valley California huh the there's but there is video video the tether the video is weird and someone described it as ice crystals and they said the perspective is what's screwing everybody up as if the ice crystals are between us and the cable but it makes it look like they're enormous but they're actually quite small I think I think at this point we can accept that these ships are real if they're advanced then we yes we can I think we can accept there's just so many so much so much footage so many reports Ted Phillips has trace evidence so many landing sites so many I think we'd accept the real I think we accept these beings are real they're many different species some are benevolent to a summer malevolent what we have to get past is ok now that we know that how will that help human transformation now John Mac at this session I was at at this Fifth Avenue Medical Institute a woman got up and she said I was a socialite in Massachusetts I all I cared about was money and spending money and where I could go and spend money and and buying things in one afternoon I was in my garden and an orange orb came into the garden and a figure got out and lectured me you have so much power just like the guy in the sailboat you can make this planet a better place your obligation now is to use your power and your wealth to make this planet a better place and she is now one of the leading environmentalists on the planet she devotes her money and time to this what's her name I don't know Arnie don't remember her name but Jan Harsin Jan Harz and I do know his name he's head of MUFON and why is Jan Harz on an IBM X IBM mainframe engineer a head of new font because when he was a boy in Marin County California he and his brother were left for the weekend he's 10 and 12 year old brought 12 year old brother in he was 10 an orange orb dropped into his backyard and two beings got out and played with them for several hours and then he came back the next day and John said I have to go into science I got to know what that was that wasn't a helicopter that wasn't it have you had Jan on if you had yeah yeah I have Jan on and you know should have okay should have Jan on you should have Beverly Trout on she's the she's the Midwestern one of the directors for mid to the Midwest Sam moranto the expert on the Tinley Park cases which that is so great I want you to retain Aykroyd has no notes in front of them these notes are these words just flying out of his head these name of DC grain dismembered Tinley Park I mean the deltas parking above your family barbecue you know so it's entertaining we got to get past that they exist and get to the point though how do we benefit our planet how do we make this planet better how do we take these warnings The Day the Earth Stood Still one of the greatest UFO movies ever oh yeah he comes down and he says you know these nuclear toys you're playing with we don't we don't like that you know so I think that there's some intervention to Barada nikto Klaatu Barada nikto Patricia Neal not sure what a great movie man that's that's an inaugural movie yeah but you is that have you shown your children no not yet you should show that was in the 50s yeah that's a great one and because it really took the real science of what was going on and and and it took all of the stories that were reported in Bruce's book here and kind of distilled them into you know into a theory of what might be happening hmm how much you dad you spend thinking about this well I am an eternal researcher and I'm always looking for stories I love them you fond stuff that's coming out you know my family was into paranormal research that's why I wrote the Ghostbusters uh my dad was a researcher and my and his father that's why you wrote Ghostbuster yeah because because we have an old farm in Canada and my grandfather was a dentist in Kingston Ontario on the in the 20s and a man walked up to him he had been researching psychic research and the other world and mediumship for many years and a guy walked up to him and said mister are dr. Aykroyd I believe that I have a gift and his name was Walter Asher's he was a locomotive mechanic at the local engine works and he was our family medium for for at least ten or fifteen years and we would have they would have seances in the 20s and 30s and Sunday afternoon the big dodges and Cadillacs would pull up in the women the matrons would get out and my great-grandfather would have a 90-minute session with the medium and they would channel entities from the other side have you heard of the Fox sisters and the whole Lilydale thing the whole mediumship of the concept that you know we are the life billet lives beyond what we have here do you know who John Edwards as the the psychic on television yeah isn't it no busted noise well you know what happened yeah busted with an earpiece well he John Edwards the psychic got busted he was he had some very well maybe you know sometimes what happens is they they you know they lose their powers in they and they are unable to or they're full of shit the entire time that just gets like John Edwards though I watched a show I kind of believed him but I'm not sure if he was the one that got busted and one of those one of those psychics got busted yeah so to see you across from penn jillette yeah of course no he's like to him well he's an expert debunk horrible yeah yeah super skeptical I would love I'd love to have Penn Jillette tell me what he thinks of the Fox sisters why why they went around the world with a spirit that performed with them right what happened well it wrapped a spirit wrapped yeah well kind of ran our AP not-not-not reading yeah yeah oh I thought wow like muezzin reverberant rapping ya know I'd love to I'd love to you know so it's a spirograph mediumship that's that's a very very telling i by Insane Clown Posse are yeah Slipknot there we but I I believe that we the consciousness can survive after death there's a school called Arthur Findlay college in England and you can go there and train to be a medium why you'd want to I don't I don't know it's very exhausting he imagine shutting down your whole system going into and trance reaching the other side having that entity come through the other side use your body yours your fluids use everything and then abandon you after and then just go you it's exhausting exhausting but my family research mediumship and I wrote Ghostbusters based upon you know it's just our family interest on the Fox the Fox sisters your sisters you should get them up there's a picture of them foxes in 1848 they were lying in bed in their new house near Hyde's Ville New York and all of a sudden this kind of wrapping started terrifying them they thought it was confined just to that house in Hinesville but they managed to take it around they and when they went to Rochester it happened in houses when they went to a theater it happened in front of three 400 people and they eventually they toured the world with this act they called it the peddler and he was someone who was killed and murdered and buried in the house and the basement John Edwards a hoser here Popoff there they are John Edwards I looked him up it didn't come up necessarily he was they were all they were all and they went around the world tipping tables and and and yeah that's a drawing real people they never existed no they did they did they were they were and they were very well scrutinized Maggie in the end of her life said no we were we were producing we were producing these reverberant Riley's a head what is that is that them know what boy said that's doubt of my realm there's something about mean-faced ladies from like the eighteen hundreds of scare the shit out yeah there's the there's the cottage there's a yeah hard time to be alive that's the cottage that had occurred in and you know they said it was the ghost of the peddler that lit that was murdered in the basement and they look down they did find some bones but every time they tried to build the groundwater a dig for the bones the groundwater kept filling up anyway Maggie at the end of her life said no no we were faking it I was creating the wraps those were laggy said she was maggie said she was faking it but she said i was creating the wraps these reverberate it in concert halls right with my knees and my knuckles you know now I can crack my knuckles maybe in my knees but you can't make them they were slapsies there were wrappings and then yep and then she recanted it and said the skeptics you know made me do it I was talked into it there was so much pressure on me and in the end of her life she then recanted her recant her retraction of it but I'm very convincing that was the origin of spirituality people were looking for a new religion you had Mormonism that had come in in the 20s you had all kinds of Protestantism that area of New York was called the burned-over district because the preachers had all been through there people who were believing in all kinds of different religion they were looking for something new and spiritual spirituality and spiritualism gave them that but you know I've had I've had people contact me that have passed in dreams I've never seen a ghost I've never you know experienced that but III do believe that consciousness survives after death I I do believe that it's an interesting idea there's no evidence that it doesn't you know I think that reincarnation is also a fascinating concept that's repeated in many different cultures mm-hm and I wonder why you know there's a great Tyler Childers song called born-again and it's it's about things living and dying and being reincarnated in different times I and I think that's very attractive to people the idea that our physical body is one thing but the spiritual body is something entirely different well I think that you know atheists and the track it is attractive atheists are never gonna believe that they're not going to accept that it's hopeful it gives us a little hope and after all you know the Koreans they who was that they were a Russian research research group they're famous for the experiment where they are the Kirlian photography K IRL I am and you want a little zippers they they they they photographed a woman she sat there and she was able to blow smoke into a fishbowl and shape the smoke in the fishbowl so here are some Kirlian images they have faith they photographed auras and they did photograph they did you know 21 grams is supposed to be the rate of the weight of the soul and they've they photographed a guy dying and they claimed to have photographed his aura leaving his body yeah yeah all these claims is there a photograph of this photograph I've heard I don't know of atomic weight of the soil 21 grams and Kirlian photo of dying man I don't know but there you saw the auras the photographs there why would the soul have weight if it doesn't have a physical embodiment yeah well energy energy mass energy what electricity doesn't know anyway does it what's going well I don't know I fit that it acts as a certain force there's there it's certainly a force so there's guys that's that's an interesting question but mass is what right reacts to scales gravity yep right I mean well electrons you know if there's a mass there there's an atomic mass atomic weight any one gram seems like a lot it does it does seem like a lot yeah fat ass soul but but the Killians were yeah they were they were that that would be a fat soul yeah member they made a movie about your into everything man you're into ghosts you're in the Bigfoot you're into aliens UFO abductions everything well it's entertaining I'm an entertainer it isn't it you know but I feel like an alien you remarkably sane for some noise all these different things inside their head I don't know my family would maybe say not but pot you know I'm allergic to terpenes I love the cannabis story I beans are in oil thought that that's it you know it's an everything you know it's like lemon in lot terpenes yeah we had that what you what if you have good pot and you're smoking goodbye what you're smoking in the terpene that's what makes it that's what gives it its power Chara peens give pot its power well it's part of the element that contains THC well routine it's an oil Thirteen's is the is the is an oil that's that that's in there and all in all marijuana you have this you're allergic to marijuana I'm allergic to the terpenes the cannabinoid I my dad is on the cannabis oil right now to go to sleep he's 97 years old I everybody has a dad yeah everybody has cannabis cannabinoid receptors in them it is a tremendously healing thing there's the terpene there's a chart yeah cool chart yeah beans yeah so so somehow all that stuff yeah look up now you know and different breeders to put something my my parrot partner and friend Jimmy Belushi has a farm in Oregon he grows it and he's researching it's a dirty drug addict it's up there selling drugs to people pushing chugs well it's legal now in or drugs well the point is that if John had been a pothead he'd be alive today sure because he died of a cocaine and and and heroin fee ball injection he find I had him smoking pot there that there in the vineyard like you know back then he would he would be alive today yeah so I believe of comedians or pot heads well you know wanna I hear Seth Rogen's office at Columbia Pictures had to BD fumed and d50 fog when he laughs but I gave him stoner of the Year award one day yeah when the with one of the High Times Awards yeah I presented him well can happen at cannabis is tremendously valuable we're finding it with art right if you take the THC out and put the CBD in there that that's great for arthritis and that I like to smell a weed doesn't bother me it's just it just it just bothers me as we go to an hour just to get that cured well sure sure so I rely on the on the on the beverage products of your right psychedelic experiences oh yes I've taken acid and psilocybin and mescaline yeah you ever had any it's some sort of encounters while on psilocybin one of the things that makes me more more open to the idea of extraterrestrials is some of the experiences that I've had on tryptamines you know particularly dimethyltryptamine but also urban is that's wait DNC goes way back for me but just like the high school how long back is that the DMT I mean last time it is a year and a half in a controlled situation yeah tell me about your experience oh I'd be interested in oh that's a little speedy this is a that's a DMT tattoo that's a DMT mold oh okay yeah I got a bunch of them there it's it's healing for mental health they're finding that that is it has a great effect as a palliative profound alleviation of anxiety there you go cuz it transforms your perception of where you stand in the world and it's a absolute ego dissolver you you're you're confronted with experiences that defied logic and one of the things that this is interesting one of the things that shied me away from UFOs was DMT because because it was so profound it was so crazy that if a UFO landed right in front of my house I'd be like yeah it's not DMT though because DMT was a completely different dimension and there were things there then one of the things that's you were in a controlled environment with friends you're yes yeah yeah but one of you seated we when nature we seated in my houses well you take three giant huge stuff you can shut down your sci-fi show for talking about aliens no no that that's right DMT has some there's some prejudice against it and you can opt out at the drugstore it's in thousands of plants it's literally in almost every plant nature in fact the one of the universities in Israel believes that it was responsible for the burning bush that Moses guns in ten commandments from yeah they think that burning bush was actually the acacia tree and the acacia tree is rich in DM tenet burst into flame and he inhaling the vapor exactly they saw God but they think that this is just a problem with translation is that this what this idea of the burning bush oh there was a burning bush well maybe or maybe they figured out a way to extract the dimethyltryptamine from the acacia tree or this bush acacia bushes well and that they took this small amount of dimethyltryptamine from this fire and inhaled it and had this profound religious experience like I've experienced like many people who experienced that have taken it and I think that one thing that happens when you do this is you're confronted with entities now I don't know what these things are but they seem to be communicating with you and they seem to be talking to you and they seem to know everything about you so the question is like is that really your subconscious is this is is this you know what you know about yourself stripped down to some very bare raw form and then confronted with the psychedelics that perturb your your visual cortex so they provide you with all these intense visualizations or is it a chemical portal to another dimension there's were they effulgent beings like being the way I described means they're complex geometric patterns made out of love and understanding mm-hmm and that the communicating sounds like you know HP Lovecraft was a wonderful writer and and he describes in my machine no that was HG Wells by HP Lovecraft he wrote the Lulu the the dunnage horror and books about Cthulhu and he be kind of you know walked out of his life and disappeared from his family and all that but he go uh well he can I went out for cigarettes and kinda never came back but no one ever found him well no I think they found him but he had vanished for a while HP Lovecraft maybe look up a grave or sighs but but you know he wrote about geometric shapes he wrote about interdimensional geometric shapes and and getting to a space where you saw the universe in terms of geometry and diamond-shaped things and multi not you know multi patterns and colors and you know the artist Alex gray - I don't Alex Grey's a beautiful artist I mean an amazing amazing guy and he all of his stuff is tryptamine based artwork pull up some Alex gray stuff so he could see it it literally when you see it you go oh and that I recognize that I recognized that how long was your voyage all of them are about 15 minutes to 20 minutes long depending upon this is all Alex gray star beautiful yeah pull up the one with that one down on the very bottom in the middle the whoa yeah look at that that's very similar to what it feels like when you do dimethyltryptamine Alex has had drops a little purple barrel right now and just look at that I'd have a nice afternoon yeah well a lot of the things the most profound psychedelic experiences are the the compounds they mimic normal human neural chemistry mm-hmm like dimethyltryptamine is it's a natural occurring compound in the human brain it's produced by your liver your lungs and there's a lot of evidence at least in mammals it's produced by your pineal gland which is literally your third eye that is that's right I did DMT way way back I think I was in high school or something whoa you know something and I think I was out of motorcycle ice race or something about doing it so that was psycho ice race and DMT yeah living on the edge in high school man yeah well that's what they you know motorcycle ice racing you get that you get on a small bike like a Jawa sees a and you put the metal rims with that with the studs and then you race around the ice I never did it but I saw it and I think I was that's when I went to my a my my my friend said they take one of these will have a better time so I didn't see any beings but well the race was fun take one how orally how did you take it uh he said it was a pill was a cap oh that doesn't work no yeah yeah well no you need to freebase it CT is all right your body possesses a cap he'd give it to me in a whore like the size of a horse cap right maybe it was horse drank and I never know he said it was the empty it's not well if it was it doesn't work because your body produces mono a mean oxidase and the only way that DMT works orally is if you take an MAO inhibitor this is what ayahuasca is by do ya see ayahuasca is what the the indigenous people the Amazon to figured out is how to take DMT with harm me from the plants right and harmine is a naturally-occurring MAO inhibitor so that's how you could take it orally it's also why the experience is not as intense but it's longer and many people find it more spiritual because you can relax Jimmy's going to the experience done later yeah but it's not in a capsule form you were did he dosed you up with someone else oh yeah I don't know yeah no I guess I've something yeah who knows that could have been suicide well psilocybin converts in the body to something very similar to DMT the DMT is the chemical compound is N and D dimethyltryptamine but something happens in the body's production of DMT or the body's breaking down of DMT where it produces something called for forelock C and M dimethyltryptamine this is out of psilocybin so maybe he gave you psilocybin pills now just real common that's real could be but it usually if I were to take psilocybin I D D time I just eat the mushroom yes a lot of people take him in capsule form though so they can get an exact dose remember sprinkling it on my cereal once and why it's yeah and then going to deliver the mail yeah my friend took him in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Bowl psilocybin and then I went and picked up my mom mail truck and yeah I was I was a Royal Mail courier that was an interesting morning did you get everybody's mail oh yeah this is fast [Laughter] but that's one of the things that made me more open to the idea of extraterrestrials but more closed off to the ideas of these stories that people tell because I felt like these stories that people tell were so crude it was almost like they were trying to fact simulate this real experience they were trying to recreate it in their mind and the other thing about these abduction experiences is that almost all of them happen at night and a lot of them happen while people are asleep and during sleep is when they believe your body's generating dimethyltryptamine they believe that DMT is also responsible for dreams but you know the Linda Katya case pretty compelling she comes out of the apartment she's grabbed by an orange orb and then when was this this was in the evening early on and that's a thing that night but there were two witnesses from the Brooke our witnesses from the Brooklyn Bridge to United Nations security and a judge in New York state judge that saw the whole thing they saw her being abducted a saw her being slipped sucked through her window into the ormond wants to the really river yes my pendant Lee they told the same story they were no they were together in the car and they saw it and I'm not judge a New York state judge sought he's independent he's independent so he came forward as well once once it started to come out and these two guys went to the apartment where Linda lived I wasn't a real name and of course she was freaked out that someone would come in and talk to chief there was a while before they were able to get her to talk about it it is possible the thing about it is that if these were unique occurrences that only happened once every 10 years or something like that very rarely and it did happen and you were left with this memory in this this thing go try telling it to people that haven't experienced it good luck good luck it nice to believe you you need people just like you experienced trauma or car accident yeah it'll around you who love you to listen to the UN yeah I believe you don't want to help you right now and ruffle is a lady who helps with abductees and there's a you know there's there's some psychiatrists who deal with it you know yeah yeah well it's it's a that's the John Mac thing right John Mac who was a psychiatrist and he was a very pragmatic reasonable person and started these he was dealing with these people that were having these traumatic experiences and he was trying to break them down I believe it was hypnotic regression there was the initial tool right and through that he sort of sort of started piecing together these people independently had remarkably similar stories right was a him obviously was it hypnagogic just 320 million people in this country alone if 100 people have these experiences good luck getting those other 390 million people listen to you they're not gonna listen to you this is why I'm I've tried to be open-minded I think if you went out to the local mall and when said do you know the UFO is yes have you ever seen one no the only buddy who's ever seen one yes I think you if you went to the eye to the outer perimeters there is perhaps you yeah it's perhaps no and that's look that's the important except I'm on like Michael Shermer and other people and and Philip class they come on and they try to debunk these UFO stories but they don't have their facts straight they don't they don't haven't done the research they haven't studied these cases they come and they just blank it's a it's it's not real Michael has never met a conspiracy that he doesn't want to debunk mm-hmm right do I think that recently he came out with was that he thinks that Jeffrey Epstein might have been murdered I was like whoa how yeah yes such so far table ranger believe no but it has to go that far yeah it has to go that far where a guy is on suicide watch and they go ad don't try to kill yourself again and then leave him in the jail cell at him that kind of kind of let him do what he wanted I think I think they'd let him I think they'd let I tell himself I think they more the money let him they let him or they might have killed them he had a broken neck mmm that's true that's yeah it's true that's right when you get justice fixie ation that's right that's right yeah yeah well if anyone deserved to die that mo foo did yes yeah if everyone's telling the truth I believe you're right yeah it's the whole story of UFOs is so interesting it's so interesting because the Fermi paradox because this concept that if there are these species that exist in this infinite number of stars and infinite perhaps even infinite number of universes we really don't know our limited perception of what the the actually multiverse yeah physicists refer to all the time Neil Tyson will refer to the multi started happily and comfortably well he also will refer to the concept that not only is the universe infinite but what infinity truly means is the real version of infinite is not just it's really big but it's that it's so big that there are an infinite numbers of dan Aykroyd Joe Rogan's and Jamie Vernon's in a room and there's an infinite number of versions of this conversation that we're having about right there was a philosophy died of philosopher a few years ago he believed that everything that you think like if I think okay I want to go steal a Cadillac well in another dimension I've stolen that Cadillac and I've done that yeah you know and he was he believed that everything we think can become reality in another dimension and does become reality it's there's so many different possibilities it's it's impossible for our puny little brains to wrap our heads around I had Nick Bostrom on who's a philosopher who was famous for his work on simulation theory and the concept of artificial intelligence and sentient artificial intelligence and he was freaking me out yesterday this the where he was talking about essentially it's more probable that you are in a simulation than you're not a simulation I'm so hard looking around your studio here on this play I was this is a simulation I mean I you I will not divulge what I saw in this incredible warehouse here but the greatest gym I've ever seen the greatest workout space well I feel like my whole life doesn't make any sense of my life if anybody should believe in a simulation it should be me yeah no I I'm in a wonderful simulation here today oh this is great yeah no look you know a human experience it's just wonderful how we wake up in the morning human identity yeah you know the electric love love just our ability to communicate our ability to see friends and the beautiful feeling you gets when you hug affairs it just pheromones is it just chemical is this anymore yeah that's right and love was what you should drive us we are here to give and receive love and once we figure that out and the world's going to be a lot better we have to if you don't know that everything else is horseshit you can have a hundred million dollar house and a private jet and if you know of love you don't have anything you're missing the key ingredient that's right you know it's like having cement but not having water that's right you know it's right you have you have the mix but you know the water yeah you have nothing yeah you ain't building any house motherfucker yeah I know and and you know we and unfortunately there's so much lack of love in the world for other other you know and there's so many people that want to instead of propagate love they want to propagate anger and they want to propagate hate and it's so easy to do and so many people are dissatisfied by their own existence that they want to do that but they don't understand but that by doing that you are perpetuating this whole terrible cycle that you've been caught up in yourself if you go out there hating on everybody and being shitty to everybody and throwing all this anger out there in the world that you are literally poisoning yourself there's a there's a wonderful quote about jealousy that I think also applies to hate is that it's one of the the rare things that is ineffective on the person who's your target but works on you instead mm-hmm you're jealous here's a person out there like oh I I wish I was living her life and you're angry at her like you it's not hurting her it doesn't even affect nobody's like you dancing in the wind you feel the poisonous you person to win that way it's gonna come right back on you it's just hard for people to understand that there's techniques and there's strategies and there's philosophies that can help you steer through this world with a happier life and that that is a big part of it a big part of his embracing love and friendship and camaraderie and be nice to people and I think it's much easier to be nice and to be mean yeah it's hard for some people because they're not even nice to themselves well self-love is where it all starts yeah I don't like yourself you ain't gonna do too well yeah anybody else and you know sometimes I wake up in the morning like myself or what I've done the neck the day before or in the past but you know in the end I yeah I gotta love myself enough to get up and get going and yeah just don't keep going it too much this wild crystal vodka no no everything in moderation hey can you fall in love with a vehicle I brought you a Scott man I brought you hemmings mate or motor news you know this book can't read that thing I'll go crazy and start buying no no that's like me too but what's your dream car like I know you've got that beautiful Land Rover up there land cruiser I have a lot of cars what like if you what what yeah what yeah what kind of cars you like I mean well I love American muscle cars those in my favor okay yeah I'm sixties those are my favorite like dodges and I have a 65 Corvette that I love to death I have a 69 Nova that's being built oh yeah my friend uh Nova my friend at a 494 degree that was great he had a Camaro 454 Camaro nice yeah that was fun man I just think there's something that happened during the 1960 yeah there was like this this incredibly potent moment in the universe where this part of the world he iack oka well not just Lee Iacocca because that was Chrysler it was also Ford and it was it was Chevy there was but the Mustang was Lee yeah yeah yeah yeah but Leslie Chrysler know he started with the Mustang but he went to Christ or no the muscle cars of them s Thomas Lee Iacocca's right that's the super bee and the shaadi yeah Sheldon Carroll Shelby the Super Bee that was so much there was so much fun those are Cudas those barracudas yeah me but this but the the point to me is that there was something that happened during that time with American automobile manufacturers working they had come up with designs and they were influenced in a way that they created these iconic images that if you looked at a 1960s car those 1960s cars are so incredibly valuable and cherished where as late 1970s in 1979 car nobody gives a fuck about that car like in 10 years the cars went from being amazing to dogshit the 70s were pretty bad for automobile cities - they hit up blip they have especially American muscle cars they hit this blip and then during this blip they created Camaros and Dodge Chargers and Shelby gt500 s they just had with the young people bought into and loved and now today you can't get a young person to even go to in a showroom the people who are listening to your your your show and I would say 80% of them they're in taxis or uber or buses they don't care about cars interesting right people live in New York City I have friends who live in Manhattan they born and raised didn't even know how to drive all my kids didn't get their licenses till they were in their 20s here's a 1969 Dodge Dart GTS they want 77 grand for it that's they're very valuable I know they're really really valuable are you doing with that magnet why'd you bring that because I know you love cars III want to give it to you yeah any cars Oh sir sir um haha too much got my father got me into this you know so I think my favourite like my favourite car that I have is a 1932 Pierce Arrow 1604 limousine this is the car that and it's been untouched I basically found that in a barn and I've never touched it the Pierce arrows were built between 1908 and 90 million with that all the Pierce Arrow a pierce-arrow museum Buffalo New York piee RC 69 Pierce I know it's 3232 oh ok so lay off so Pierce Arrow made cars between 1908 and trucks and bicycles between 1919 38 1938 they've got bought by Studebaker what happened in the 30s they began to build these big luxury coaches in the 30s in the depression to compete with Packard and rolls-royce and rampage and all the other big companies that were out there the white house always had pure serous white house motor fleet will show the Pierce arrows on the Pierce Arrow is beautiful because it had you know the Bullitt headlights that are on most old cars from the 30s the Pierce Arrow has the headlights fused into the fender like sculpture you see there they are you see how the the other fender is fused in it's like part of the car and so I have a 32 1604 rj edgar Hoover had those that's like Bonnie and Clyde type car oh yeah no I need this office I need the tops and auto of you know 100-round drum you know third does anybody take one of those and put like a modern suspension many times but I've kept mine original it's never been touched you see the way the headlights are fused right into the eye so I have a 32 it kind of looks like that it's green all people and up and yeah they're pretty cars so that's that's my kind of those are pretty but they don't resonate with me well I like it's a v12 it's an Allison v12 the same engine that they had me and these p-51 Mustangs it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate it it's like I don't have any I don't lust for them yeah a 1971 barracuda I lost this yeah that's in there yeah get excited so I like that carve a little Bentley a little 48 mark six Bentley it's got an overhead valve six in it it was built at the end of the war you know to kind of get England back into production I liked that car but my regular everyday driver and this will be completely boring to most people on the planet I have a 2011 Ultimate Edition Mercury Grand Marquis luxury sport four-door sedan okay that's like what's that the New York Times said when when the production of the of the big Fords were discontinued the big Grand Marquis when they were discontinued in 2011 they went out of the out of the out of business they stopped making them the New York Times said you've always liked one but you never really wanted one well I found two of them in upstate New York and they used to be and they I found them and I looked I was driving in Auburn New York Anna and and and I saw I was whipping by in this town on my way down and I saw these two cars sitting there with snow and I looked I liked that Grand Marquis so I found out about them bottom found out they were both equipped by the US State Department motor pool for diplomatic career they had lights and sirens in him and they had work done on the motors I'm on the 401 in Toronto a Mercedes you know 300 C will pull up behind me and won't like want me to move over and say okay geriatric driver and the old Marquis move over and I just go and I'm gone with this thing that big v8 no chip in it there it is that's it that's my car yeah that looks like a government car thought I'd check my paperwork yeah know that and that's got the beautiful minor black and it's got the beautiful v8 and it's got the engine works and that's my regular drivers drive one of those and it's just total sleeper totally yeah I pull up the lights to Corvette so look at them and I'm like take them no probably in that thing nothing there that's funny yeah I love the old Packard's in that so you like the muscle cars yeah I'm Lauren Tesla Tesla t-shirt yeah I got one out there oh they're beautiful oh I love that guy what a visionary what a man man I mean come on he went to Queen's University in my hometown yeah and Kean Kingston Ontario Canada Penitentiary capital of the country he went to Queen's University which is like your Harvard or read or Yale and he went there for two years so whenever I've never met a LAN but I'm gonna sit down and talk to him both those Kingston winter he's a great guy yeah his car is the most preposterous ly fast car I've ever driven in my life what seems right stupid well the doing the thing that I have out there I have a Model S Oh elite 100 d oh yeah it is the most ridiculous car I've ever driven it makes other cars feel dumb I have other cars that I enjoy because I love engineering I love cars I just love them I've always loved them since I was a kid but that Tesla makes them all look stupid they're all dumb that car goes zero to 60 in two point four seconds and makes no sound it transcends it just moves through space and time in a different way punches a hole through through the life itself it's show me no brilliant it's there it's just one I had a friend who had one in Toronto that's a no and he took me yeah we shouldn't lick it up I'd give you the keys to mind there's after yeah no they don't drive we have drivers today no they zapped through that yeah you need to drive one you need to drive mine you know my wife would love one because she loves you know she's an environmental activist and now she needs to get one the problem is that she loves her laptop so much that if that big screen in the uh-huh Tesla yeah that big screen yeah I think she'd be on that more than map well I know there's done that thing but Hames you can plan on when you part know when you're when you're driving to know at a park we won't let's do it but the guy have my friend he has a Tesla there in Toronto there and he said he he he programmed it in downtown Toronto and it drove him to Kingston city hall and parked in from the city hall didn't even have to look at look at he was working on his laptop Todd well that guy's an asshole you need to look kids jump in front of your car you need to be well yeah yeah I guess that's where too much reliance on that you need you definitely I mean that's what other vehicles do you have a 69 Camaro oh yeah I have 2007 Porsche 911 you like you like a high-performance car that's what I got with that Ford that I'm driving it's just it's just beautiful yeah yeah I just love I just love cars a la I've always loved them

Ford Excursion that was the greatest car ever built by man have the aviator now - it's a smaller version they're sensational cars those really are navigators the new ones they put the Escalade to shame they really do I don't like other brands but amazing they're gonna come out with a new one Escalades are amazing but when you get a navigator like whoa this is next-level it is next-level speaking of cars there was a great old Cadillac and once upon a time in Hollywood did you see oh yeah we were talking about the other day I think yeah black no no no I have it I met him at the comedy store though this is one of the great film like this is amazing Gus is gonna win Best Picture I'm a member of the Academy are you mind you yes of course yes on I think you voted on you you know you regret no not really I support my people in the industry that I can tell you right now and I'm gonna get in trouble for this that that's my vote for best picture right now really what a superior look at that beast yeah that old cattle that's an amazing car man and how great are those performers I can't wait for a Brad Pitt's new movie ad astra to come out the new space movie that he's doing Alex how great were those two guys in that film how great was that cast everything was superb film inking and if you know the Madsen story it's all that what's so well I don't want to give any spoilers no that's not but it's it's one of those movies where you think something's gonna happen and it's something entirely more magical happens yeah Brad Pitt is like just supreme those design are DiCaprio's I know that always but this is this yeah these are masters yeah and I love to watch them work i I love I'm not in the pictures so much anymore we've got the Ghostbusters movie that we're working on now and I will be have to be performing in that but I what is the deal with the new Ghostbusters movies so they're really good there was the one with all girls great and film in the really good film those girls were superb but I should have been sitting there as a producer watching costs a little more I you know Paul Feig and and I and Ivan we had our little conflicts there were things that we thought that we didn't think would work why shoot it why spend the money but you know he's a director you got a we'd have to have faith so there was a little conflict there and I've spoken about it before but all that's in the past I think he made a great picture with the girls I I love it I think they're all great in it really you know he treated the movie with with a tribute kind of legacy respect and and there were some great new spirits in there and the girls were great now Ivan Reitman son Jason has written a new movie called the goat balls going to be ghostbusters the third movie that he's run away now well it'll be all most of the original people and then the Rihanna stars first movie yes some from the original memories gonna be in it we're we're we're hoping come on bill yeah we're hoping come on yeah and then the new the new cast and it's it's the new cast as well there they are younger you don't throw Bill Murray out a window and oh yeah yeah he played he played a psychic he played a skeptic psychic and he played Michael Shermer Mary played yeah through mother one that because you would want to throw my no no no I don't wanna throw a better window no come on a fake window no no no I have other things that could do that with him put them in my old farmhouse for the night inside buddy so yeah so that's it's gonna be great I'm so excited about it and it's just just wonderful to be able to you know go back and revisit that all that yes but I was saying I love my colleagues I don't do the pictures anymore much and I'm in that way my greatest movies of all time there because anyways collaborator films yes for sure I had a great collaborators and and you know I love watching people work actors on Broadway and I love watching actors work in film and I enjoy going to movies it's it's just I'm into other things as you heard there was a bunch of comics of The Improv the other night talking about Ghostbusters and talking about holes others Blues Brothers still to this days one of the all-time great comedy films it really is yeah it's a great movie it's just one of those movies where it gives you this feeling like you're just so appreciative that you can watch it like wow we had smocking Ray Charles and Aretha John Lee Hooker oh yeah no everything's great in that movie it's just great no no we had good good times on that and it holds up and on you know what here forty some years after John and I first performed on SNL Jimmy and I are still doing it we have a concert in Minnesota coming some maize and we still do it you know well I figure well I can still move I'll still dance and move and you know I'm not gonna sing from a chair like Solomon Burke you know do you like your real interests though like they're spread apart you have a lot of different things going on like you seem to be a guy who's got freedom and independence which is a beautiful thing to see well I don't have a desk job which yeah I'm happy if I never but you're pursuing your vodka company you're obviously I mean you're not profiting off for this UFO research but you're obviously balls deep in it i-it's it's just fun because it's entertaining and I think it's enlightening and if people want to come to me and get my view of it I'm happy to present my view you know and I'm happy to hear stories and I'm happy to hear skeptics comes come forward and tell me why the thing I saw when I was on my motorcycle was not a UFO right why was it okay it was a hydro helicopter okay well okay if it was a hydra helicopter why am I not hearing a rotor whop 400 feet above me what do you what's your take on the human memory being very fallible there's like a lot of there's a lot of funky no question about it no question about it you can no no I remember I remember I wore a striped t-shirt on that Sunday and then you look at a picture all no it was solid black of course you remember the tracing I mean about these I mean how much do you think you remember about these experiences I remember every I remember every detail of the sightings I've had because they define reality every day things that are not that profound your memory goes no no I try I try of course because we'd go crazy if we had to remember everything right right that we picked off the ground three years ago if you had that or just today right like what what color shirt was I wearing when you met me you were wearing a kind of a whitish grey kind of a corded t-shirt and you had sweat on and okay clothes great thermal yeah okay yeah just check it here's some of the Cadillacs with the fin his name was Harley Earl oh you know the guy designed it yeah there were two great designers one was Harley Earl yeah and then Virgil Exner was the guy with Chrysler and he brought in the Finn as well but when I chose the vehicle for ghostbusters I thought what I need the biggest station wagon made and it's got a fit for people in the front and it's got to have capacity for the so I picked the 1959 Cadillac Miller media or hearse because it just had the capacity we needed and then the bonus was it just looked so good yeah what's the golden year for Cadillac I would say 59 60 when you had the full fin that that 59 60 fin was just the pin is ridiculous yeah I parked in that guy me wedding you know why offend one day because we was rocking time we don't want to do that we all want to go to the moon you know we all love the Stars you know yeah by 1959 in actual 1959 Cadillac Jamie but that's like a not one that was ever made I think that was a concept car yeah wasn't a concept car yeah no there there now you could put three bodies in that trunk that's so bad that's a hardtop convertible there with the no pillar post a beautiful car that was back when gas was 13 cents yeah on the motor the motors were beautiful in those cars yeah melt like shit and if you kept the windows rolled down you get brain damage no look at that thing hey kudos hey to Detroit to Detroit you bet yeah and today Detroit's like a booming town there's all kinds of stuff going on new what do you think of that building or that that mid-engine Corvette that's pretty amazing you've seen that thing I haven't you know for me I mean I get my right leg might fit in that I don't think I get big they have plenty of room inside of them they've designed them for taller folks you know if I could buy any car if I could I would try it on any car stop pretending that rich how dare you well it's not that it's just like if I could drive the streets and actually be seen in a car that I felt comfortable in it would worry about that but Lee yeah is that why you have that crazy the sleeper that that's a new Corvette look at this yeah that's beautiful the Bentley it's 2019 Jamie that's actually a front-engine car you want to go with 2020 the 2020s a mid-engine car the 2020 is the very first there it is that's the very first go to that red one of the top four I win chopped with the court no that's the old one I love him he doesn't know jack shit I like the Bentley Mulsanne the the big one the big Bentley Mulsanne cruiser love that that one right there Jamie that your cursor was just on yeah that's it click on yeah but click on that that's a mid-engine Corvette it's a different car see what is is the engine is behind the passengers in between the passengers and the rear wheel whereas the other ones it's in the front trunk you see the one in the back that I don't I don't think you're gonna get the average software engineer at we work for instance wanting to buy that car because he's taking his the bus and he's on uber and he's in taxis they tell me stop being a pussy now we get that yeah new Corvette is so powerful it's warping the frame and tests America yeah they don't even have the zr1 or the zo6 yeah that's the reality 51 mom yeah no I love I love speed you know that speed kills more men than anything it killed Santa means you know no you're wrong no 70% of men between 35 and 65 die from mechanical speed jet skis yep motorcycles this is a 70% 70% died from accidents holy this is some this is a statistic I read well whether that's true or not we know that we like speed so yeah watch your votes watch your jet skis watch your motorcycles watch your commerce my dad that's at my age like I'm 67 now my dad at 65 had two Buick Riviera's well to 1960s 62 63 Buick Riviera's and he got he an e and he was down to like four points on his license by the dyno yeah and he loved cars do we got me into the cars you know y'all music is one of those cars that there was a victim in the recession yeah Buick Pontiac Plymouth gone yeah yeah well sure well there's all kinds of names we don't see anymore like especially from the 30s you know the Packard the grandpa the Diana moon the REO and like the GTO Pontiac GTO is gone you know yeah Plymouth is just gone I mean they still have dodged so people try to revive it the new challenger looks pretty good it's kind of very nice yes the Camaro the new Camaros a monster of a car yeah III just I've always been a fan of those rumbly engines and those you know they just they're viscerally exciting yeah no no I love them absolutely yeah how about motorcycles I don't fuck with them I was about to get one I had a bunch of took a bunch of lesson and I was going for my license and then two friends wiped out well yeah and got pretty significant accidents and one guy that I know got hit by a car by an old man who ran a red light and t-boned him and sent him flying into the air and snapped his femur no that that that would turn you off I've been riding since I was 19 and you ride in LA I can ride anywhere but I prefer to ride in the country up north in Canada you know or I'm living these days a half and a half here half there half there a little more in the States because of the travel with the ban on that but I I'm there with my dad in Canada a lot and then we have the old family farm but the with the cotton farm house and I've got a spotty well let's say let me say that it's there's residual energy from the people who've lived there in the past so you hear footsteps and voices and creeks and doors closing in that and many people have had experiences in it so there's a reason why people don't want to live in a house or people were murdered no one was killed in that farmhouse right many people pass there but even that weird that weirds people out but absolutely if you have a house where people were murdered and this is why there's laws you have to decide oh I had to divulge DJ uh it wasn't because of a murder but when I sold our house in Los Angeles we lived in mama Casas old estate and order Wilson Drive and she sold it to beverly d'angelo and she's been on the celebrity ghost show talking about the spirits that were in that house what happens uh you know jewelry will hop around the table shapes will be seen you'll feel a touch in the shoulder that kind of thing the staff felt it and I had an experience one night where something got into bed with me I was alone I don't went on there but I just figured well in my I think I was being come on to there but anyway Thank You Tube clip that house Anne Aykroyd fuck that ghost well or it did try to come on to me and I didn't refuse its so you resist him you know what I just dug 'old up next to it and went to sleep I phoned with it I did I felt a shape I looked and saw the night scene I saw the depression in the mattress and I felt ashamed about that form next to me and I I'm not I'm not no no not that night I was working on a picture and went to bed early I was alone you're laying alone in bed and you're working on a film I'm lying there was something that I've been working down at Universal I don't know maybe dragnet or something like that okay see you working on drag men living in bed and then there's like a wait next I feel a wait next to me I turned I like up the person is laying I saw the depression there were two yes and I and there were two spirits that might have been there maybe mama cast herself although she died in London and then there was another guy that apparently a rumor was he died of a drug overdose at a party and they buried him in the hillside and my daughter saw him walking with a little red-haired girl down the hall once and and and you know we think that he might have been there but anyway when we sold the house to Beverly there was a write in the California real estate document that we had to sign by law you have to divulge any unusual activity in the house so I had to sign a Azam there that said yes at the beginning of our tenure in the house we did have experience yeah so she bought the house anyway she's still there she's very happy you had to sign papers that said you had unusual active you sell a house in California you will look in every real estate contract there will be a clause that you must report a new unusual activity so that is the status of state recognized what if you got what's that what if you do acid in the house well I can tell you about something individual activity well that's unusual activity that you're doing that's not external but that California you know just that the state of California requires that in their real estate documents it's it's pretty compelling evidence that there's something going on or compelling evidence the people are paranoid they want people well I think the coasts and spirits also have have reality I think you think so I believe so tell me about this thing you're laying down in bed so you're about to go to sleep sleep everything's good and I and I feel this depression I feel this something Anna are you asleep yet not asleep no no I just turned out the light and I look and I see this and then I go well what am I gonna do about this I'm gonna leap up screaming no I rolled over and I just gonna knuckle up against it and and went to sleep and I slept with like a baby step like a baby so there's a scene in the Ghostbusters movie where I'm in I'm lying down in an old fort and then this ghost hovers over me and in the director's cut I think the belt comes off and the pants come down whoa so sex with ghosts he didn't get nervous you know I may have been so tired I may have been so resolved and resigned I thought you know what there's no point in panicking there it is yeah so that's you do you just accept it yes that's right I just accept it that's some way to go man I mean why fight it it's spiritual it's true it's true so did you smell it no no smell just just sense out the way felt the way and saw the depression and then when I feel anything on your body I did on the form yes I did I felt a form next to me when I knuckle dup push away I did not did you push against I actually kind of wanted to see what it felt like if there was something there and I did feel something there I was a little feminine or masculine it felt masculine Haro you were cuddling with a dude like a dead biker maybe yeah I don't know it was the guy who died in the hillside I don't know could be well I don't want it friendship you know this male or female they say the old days men used to just sleep together they're just actually sleep sleep like well you know there's a yes there's a there's a at Davis and Abraham Lincoln Lincoln yeah we're partners and they were law partners and they slept in the same bed many times when they were on the road yeah I was probably cold as fuck back then it was hung about the room that bar the world yeah yeah I just have a couple blankets and your stay heated together yeah so when you woke up in the morning did you feel crashed or violated I had slept beautifully I woke gotten maybe better than ever pretty good yeah I mean I told some people about the experience and mmm when there were people that worked in the house and that were there and then that you know the live and that that knew that was something going on but they knew nothing of it you and a ghost had something happening after I told them yeah so they knew something was going on well because they had been they've here the Stairmaster going by itself the exercise the exercise it apparently yeah and and a hand on the shoulder then the sighting my daughter had then you know other little things like jewelry dancing on the table we knew something was going on in that house oh so you're a hundred percent on ghosts I am now tell me about why you're a hundred percent in on Sasquatch is that that one is a that's more puzzling time well just that it's it's again Gabriel Reese's story was quite convincing Jeff Meldrum's research amazing I would have talked to her about ya Jeff Meldrum told me he cut his finger off said if he could find out if Sasquatch was really take a pinkie off I said if you cut your finger off to know that Sasquatch is real would you do it he was which finger I'm like your pinky well he's got casts he's got hair I went to Jamie Bravo Jeff Meldrum and the ldr um it used to be it's in my room he's a he's uh you know he's a paling geological scientists at the University of South Dakota but he can also be a silly man sometimes study things you memorize them you pass a test but you still silly well but but you talk to him did you think did you feel he was you know I open up my finger for nobody man yeah I'm not giving up a finger to find I have sasquatches real that's crazy you know yeah he's pretty devoted to it but it's been you know yeah T the yak and yet his story you know the Yeti story and just the around the world it's just the the sightings that that people have had all right hi Greta burners well there was a book called diary when Alaska housewife it was about a woman she wrote it she left in the 70s to move from Kansas to Alaska and her husband worked on the pipeline and she tells the story one afternoon when she was at her you know her window in the kitchen and she went outside into the garden so she felt saw something went outside and she smelt this really strong strong musky musky odor and she saw this big huge shape at the corner of her garden kind of disappear in the woods and I don't know bear grizzly mmm no sure could be yeah how about where are you on chupacabra not at all I think it's nonsense I think it's coyotes with mange mm-hmm yeah I'm convinced yeah yeah I mean they've they've captured coyotes with mange that look like demons how about Mothman that's a neat story or shit listen let's go back to Bigfoot let's not you don't believe those kids yeah I think they're full of shit let's go back the Mothman Prophecies the the bridge collapsing yeah I mean I'm not gonna sit here and argue on behalf of Mothman but it's an intriguing story because when you have multiple witnesses like as far as the UFO I will go back to good foot but the the aerial encounter the the schoolchildren at the aerial school in in Zimbabwe in the in the 90s you know the story John Mac was working on it no two beings landed in two different crafts and they encountered these school children all in elementary school and now they've come back and they're interviewing them now and their adult time and it's amazing how their story's synchronized why would all of them conspire to make something up okay we're dealing with two different things the Mothman there were fourth really credible kids there that the UFO thing is less preposterous than anything because we are currently sending spaceships into orbit we are currently sending probes to Mars we're involved deeply involved in the exploration of our solar system at least with these robots and drones and things that we can control that Dan'l all that makes a hundred percent sense to me Bigfoot is interesting to me because there was a creature called Gigantopithecus it was an enormous primate that was a without a doubt lived it's a real thing it was a bipedal hominid they think it was between eight and perhaps even ten feet tall was a huge ape-like creature and it went extinct and the reason why they found it is because there was an apothecary shop I believe it was in the 1920s an anthropologist found a tooth in his path carry shop in China he talked to the people where'd you find this he recognized it as a primate tooth they brought him to the site where they found it and then they started finding other pieces they found bones that read that seemed to indicate that this thing was bipedal and this is something that's accepted in the paleontological paleontological record this is like when anthropologists look in the history of primates when they look at the they think this is a widely accepted real animal so why wouldn't it was real why was so why did it why do you say that it couldn't have survived and and beyond it extinction and exist today in some form it could no there's no evidence that's compelling just like there's a famous fact they think the only mammoths pretty much the film yes fake the Patterson footage yeah that's why they say it's faked here's the thing if it looks like a man in the suit no animal looks like a man in a suit there's not a fucking single correct kangaroo out there that can it looks like a person in a kangaroo suit I just I just think Gabriel story Meldrum's research of the book that I read of the woman was what was Gabriela Reese's story well she was in the camping up there in one of those northern states Washington and I believe she has video footage of Muhammad shaking shaking though she's shaking the shaking the shaking the motor home that they were in yeah yeah hmm she was quite excited to tell me the story and and quite vivid about it she said that it was it was if there was a small popular try finding a Wolverine yeah try finding or a or or a super one of these super sloths in the you know South American jungle now these big sloths yeah they think they're real there's one there's one scientist that is literally risked his reputation and he's his whole fuckin credibility's and demise because he decided that he was going to spend his life looking for the giant sloth and these indigenous people have pointed him in the right direction and they've recognized that there's you know there's dung that seems to be sloth dung that they've found and they're trying to point him towards where these things are and the giant sloth was a real creature but there's no real evidence that the giant sloth is currently alive but the thing is the vast wilderness of the Amazon rainforest is so impenetrable it would be like trying to walk across the earth and make a good audit of all the creatures that are on it yeah I got to run into them and you know we many species are dying on this planet right now for dirt forest reasons but there are many that are being discovered we never even knew about before and you know the northwestern forests are pretty impenetrable to the yes Washington's voice interesting is that the the location of the area where if the thing crossed the Bering Land Bridge and it came into the United States that's exactly where it would be mm-hmm it would be in that Pacific Northwest because there's no as you walk down from Alaska we've heard the stories of loggers going in there and seeing them more sensing them more you know because they're being driven out of their environment there's a hostile accident logging companies that they think have been perpetrated by by you know those yeah by the Sasquatch yeah nobody wants to believe in Bigfoot more than me I work I worked up in in the Northwest Territories I was a flex track system mechanic on Tundra crawlers and I was a road surveyor when I was a kid I work for the Department of Public Works and we were up there and along them the Hannie River the headless river where explorers would go in and they'd find their heads and then never come back that can be walk by yeah the Bigfoot heads no no just the human has a human the headless Valley the headless River in the honey River in a haan and I but when I went up there and was with the survey people there had been guys who've been up there you know you know years before me and they and they said that Sasquatch was a common thing that was spoken about among the natives and among the survey crews out there you ever see the Bobcat Goldthwait movie Willow Creek no outstanding moving cat goats we've made a horror movie about Bigfoot Bobcat Goldthwait the comedian made an excellent horror movies that it's like like like fire in the sky that's a good depiction you would love it oh I love it it's about a bunch of people that go up there to try to replicate the Patterson Bigfoot film sort of as a lark oh they go up there for fun and they encounter a real sasquatch so Willow Creek it's called yes it's really good I love that that is a 100% believer uh-huh he believes he and I have had some ridiculous conversations about it be nice to go and go into the intense woods up there and maybe camp for a weekend yeah look mando to see something like that a bipedal hominid that has avoided detection for hundreds if not thousands of years to be amazing yeah but the Native Americans his Native Americans had more than a hundred different names between all the various tribes a hundred different names for sasquatch because I really yeah yeah yeah oma was one of them you know that you saw that American world from London thing that is uh the the guy who created that what it pat rob a Coeur no no that's brick Baker Baker I'm sorry yeah Pat Magee who's the special effects guy created the one for me but Rick Baker designed it originally but he made a Pat Magee me in a movie called ol mob what was it called oma primal scream see vegan but it's basically a horror movie about sasquatch and you know it's it's incredibly compelling to people like this enormous primate that's been avoiding detection living in the forests legends among the indigenous people say that they they sometimes grab children and take them I think that's because it used to be a real thing that's what I think I think that's because if we all agree and scientists agree that this Gigantopithecus was a real thing if that is the case then it's entirely possible that one point at one point time human beings were in direct contact with them on the regular basis and those stories been passed down through generations every generation the real questions are they still here because the people that are telling you these stories like when we talk about people in North America it's widely accepted that most Native Americans they share a lot of genetics of people from Siberia because Siberia is what's close to the Bering Land Bridge I'll come down these people eventually many many many many many thousands of years migrated into America and they have so those are people that would have been in contact a hundred thousand whatever years ago but they don't know they know that these teeth that they found from Gigantopithecus indicate that it at the at least a hundred thousand years ago they were alive mm-hmm does that mean they were alive fifty thousand years ago very possibly like a homo florensis you know that the Hobbit person that I found yeah this tiny little thing and right right on the Flores Island that thing they didn't even know that was real until the 2000s and that thing existed as recently as I think it was thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago which is incredibly recent yeah and this is a completely new discovery that people found that there was a totally different species of human being that was very small with a chimp sized brain but it was human it used tools and it lived amongst humans yeah so this thing if they know it lived a hundred thousand years ago could have easily lived 50 mi to live 20 so it lived 20,000 years ago today we just gotta go and find yeah but this there's no evidence of mammoths either yeah right we know they were real but there's no like if someone said I saw a man with you like where do you have a picture no no but I sensed it the fuck out here with your sense of NamUs I think if you did if you put unmount mounted a horrible avatar style military let's say incursion into some of the deep woods of Northwest America you might you might get traces but what a horrible thing that would beat it to be an excellent thing we get footage I know but then you're destroying theirs Oh mom that's Pat McGee's version of oh it's great yeah it's like kind of like Groot and now yeah wow that's just a weird picture no that's beautiful um primal rage mmm yeah look at the animatronics yeah see that face right there Jamie yeah that's not coming out or is it it's been out now for quite a while a primal rage and and I'm get it the creek is really interesting because Willow Creek is like Blair Witch style yeah it's all like found footage I got whole thing like okay here we are we're in the woods you'd like it Bobcats a genius is he did a great job with it it's really good it's like compelling it's exciting and even if I don't believe in Bigfoot or don't don't believe it's currently alive just I know too many people that are in the woods all the time I know too many people that are hunters that are in the woods but how they spend weeks and weeks in the woods and none of them seen chef they see bears walking on two feet though that's really normal yeah yeah and when you're in thick dense forest bears walking on two feet you see them in the dusk sure oh my god I saw Bigfoot I'm convinced yeah and then you really are convinced so then you go back and tell everybody yeah I think you know basically just each individual has to make their own minds up about all of this stuff and if you want to believe it's just like your religion you know I believe in mediumship I believe in the afterlife of our consciousness and that's kind of my religion and who's to say why should I be disputed on that you know how do you believe I'm glad as people I want that's intelligent people that believe in silly shit well you know look you know many people live in the Virgin Mary scaffolds and and that's quite a myth and many believe in the angel Moroni and the gold plates and the magic spectacles and and many believe in Zanu you know the Scientologists belief so yeah I'm not gonna go and say hey oh I dispute your belief there were no golden spectacles or there were no gold and no there was no Xenu no there was no Virgin Mary no I respect people's belief and they realize that's what you believe and that's what helps you for you you know and I I would never dispute that and likewise I I want to be just respected for my belief in spiritualism and mediumship and I think there's there's a religion and skepticism as well I think there's this there's a that go for yeah but there's you know I'm saying that there's a tendency to just try to dismiss everything mm-hmm as being as like well believe the official story of every single you know why that's good because that empirical view will be able to sort out the fake stuff the hoax stuff from the real stuff if people of real scientific minds and unreal you know and quests they're go into it that's what's gonna that's what's going to sort out what's real and what isn't yeah dan Aykroyd you're a beautiful human being thank you for being here man Oh fun pleasure was really pleasure 19:52 you a full books yours
