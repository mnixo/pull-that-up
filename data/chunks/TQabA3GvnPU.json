boom and we're live Jean Jacques Joe Hogan pull this up it's been in quite some time but we made it yeah we made it we made it happen people still to this day all my friends call me Joe Hogan because you I don't know Joe Hogan that's a funny Brazilian thing you know the Portuguese translation of ours two H's I think I think when we speak English you have to use your tongue in a way that in Portuguese we have just flat-out but you use Rio you don't say he'll right do you say he'll know we're real how does that work somehow that it's in Portuguese the first two letters are the strongest one in the world but but Hickson and hoist and say Hickson right it's but it's not Rickson but it's real yes how's it worse I don't know when it becomes the name is different than when you say a city name oh really yes ah it's funny real it's more some perform and when you say personal it becomes a little I don't know hex on so high people it's an H but it can be an R or R sound with objects and things yes are just places I'm think more places and it's funny because in each region in Brazil is a different accent really well that makes sense kinda like America yes each place like what country's dead because if this sounds very different but we it's a beautiful language Portuguese has like especially Brazilian Portuguese sounds like a sing song you like a float it's the Boston off a carnival then yeah but it's not the way you guys talk it's cool it sounds good you know it's more almost like singing yeah how many Americans have I put on a fake Brazilian accent once they started really getting in jiu-jitsu must be and I think I think in a way when jiu-jitsu establish their flag outside Brazil it makes funny it's fun in a way that people our goal is to make that area become more Brazilian than any other place it's not that we're trying to speak more English but we'll make the English become more Portuguese hmm and almost every student and I have maybe probably because my accent they start listening speaking very similar the way we do yeah in average it to school yeah well that's uh we used to see that in Taekwondo too does would have like fake Korean accents and in each school the instructor has a different accent and different vocabulary hmm which even extended more it becomes like another language in the jiu-jitsu community so jiu-jitsu is huge in Rio but what are the parts of Brazil that it's a very strange if you stop and think about the history of martial arts which is something that's always been very fascinating to me jiu-jitsu is the most fascinating because until 1993 very few people understood how potent Brazilian jiu-jitsu was when when I stacked understand jiu-jitsu and became on the denature time jiu-jitsu is basically in Brazil has that amazing aerial of my uncle h√©lio and Carson the whole first generation of the family which Brazil was all over jiu-jitsu is all over Brazil as a teenager remember the jiu-jitsu is basically established in a very wealth area in Rio de Janeiro only three heads basically have all these schools is to call Gracie schools by the neighborhood have a Gracie might I have a Gracie Copacabana I have a then future Gracie Baja but everything was almost Gracie school everywhere and was wealthy people only in the welfare of real Wow then slowly because keep in mind is to have one maybe two tournaments sport of jiu-jitsu a year that's it we always practice jiu-jitsu mainly at that time for self-defense we want to get ready for protect ourself we never had much chances to try in a tournament because there's no tournament hmm every train will do is based in defend yourself what you're determined start coming about but in beginning of the 90s I think the jiu-jitsu tournament start catching up was a crazy video of your brother Keegan and Hickson competing at a tournament once I was the biggest tournament of the Year 2300 300 competitors I hope that's crazy that was the biggest that's the biggest one three hundred people now thousands the big ones is that five thousand people yeah now when this happened what uses with your brother I think was in the eighties not sure which year with something I don't think today looking back is something that I didn't like personally because there was no need for that with everybody's to train together and later on I find out there was behind the scenes people involved with the organization they wanted something more of the tournament and they end up making something like that happen oh so you mean because he gained and Hickson a train together having them compete against each other was not a good idea oh no Hickson was teaching us rights our instructor why do you think they wanted to have him compete against Eagan it wasn't even these happen on the day of the event was no planning of having that fight or anything it just made that happen there and today I realized that the promoter of the tournament the sponsor was talking to someone involved the promotion hit me and I'll give you more money if it makes something like that happen mmm in an hour time if my instructor tells me I wanted to go and do that I don't even question I just go and do it right that's the way we were in you know in the whole family and our instructors and I gotta go and do this even though I don't like it it's wrong I should not do it we do it so what would be wrong about it would be that you were all training partners and in fact Hickson was your instructor so for one of you to go up against Hickson it's just I will give you a in the Indian 90s early 90s we have a symbol wrestling tournament in San Diego and when we moved to America was no Jiu Jitsu event and we are in search of something similar that we can do to keep the edge and we went to some judo con tournaments we went to wrestling tournaments and not knowing the rules of anything and we end up in a simple wrestling tournament Sambo for people don't know is a Russian martial art where the judo jacket but they were wrestling shoes and sure it's kind of a mix of both different rules I still don't know exactly the rules but here we are in myself and now we go there and I saw Hickson in that event and when comes towards the final match was me in him on the final you know back that time where we have some conflicting sided family things that are I'll keep that in four four walls yeah but we were not the relationship wasn't as well as should be then when the referee called me a sec well I'm not gonna fight my instructor my my coach my my hero my idol no I'm and I told the ref no I'm not fighting even Hicks was like look at me and I think in a good way he knew I'm not ever compete against him but at the same time he he realized that I would never turn myself against him where I will fight for him for the rest of my life and and period and I think was the point that I was able to engage back our family things together after this did and showing him that it's all my respect and I will fight for him never against him well there was a time where people were trying to use the Gracie name and many people were opening up schools that weren't necessarily really that that wasn't their birth name Gracie whereas you guys went in a different direction and used the Machado name and the Machado name became enormous - so there was like from what I remember in the 90s when I first started training with you there was I started out at Hickson's place and I only trained there one time and then I went from Hickson's place to Carlson's place just because it was closer I didn't know any better I thought Gracie is Gracie oh Carlson Gracie hick Spears I didn't know anything it was a white paths that's like oh another Gracie oh this is like ten minutes closer to my house that's how you stood in Brazil when you're on the eighties is Oh gracious schools but then when that place went under carlson lost that put it was on Hawthorn those when vitor belfort made his UFC debut in 1997 and that place went under I started trading with you and when I started training with you was like ninety seven ish right somewhere around there 98 somewhere on this one was I think was right before fee effect no those yeah a few years before its Fear Factor was 2001 news radios time yes I was still on his radio when I was training with you but I remembered there was like a call you're Machado now Mike we're talking about I was like I didn't understand like Carl is like Machado's and then this great is like two different like the Ephesians they think they happen in that time was this my mother older sister she's married to college Gracie senior let me he had seven wives color his last wife was my mom's sister and that we grew up with the family we don't have the same last name but I feel like I am and all my brother's the same thing we represent the great family the best way we can forever and now and everything I have a big family have cousins that you relate better than others but it's to a family you know and back at their time two of my brothers were teaching at the graces Cohen Carson was Hagan and Carlos and I think about that time Chuck Norris is no longer training with Harlan at the Gracie school they're not sure what happened and he stopped raining then one day some of the some Czech noise show up at our house at our garage which to teach in our garage and Redondo Beach and we opened the door suddenly look is like man that guy looks like Chuck Norris Chinna was a him this is Chuck Norris and we look like what and he brought him to Train he D train a few years back at the Gracie School in Babylon it's a long story then he sat tranny furs and when he start when tea fires we become very good friends it was amazing like something right away he invited us to his house and he's a great guy me an amazing persister hanging out and by that time I remember his to make a movie one movie a year he worked for six months make a movie and he has six months off when we met him he was six months off literally he trains every day but when he trained he doesn't go home we have lunch he hangs out got your movie they suddenly become good friends then one day he after few months after train office he invited us to the valley where he used to live in and soon and said look I have surprise for you guys then he took us to a shopping center right on Ventura Boulevard and he shows a have a gift for you guys and he shows a are one of the unities mats red is like a school then he said look this is for you guys at your school then we'll look at to him like for Ventura Boulevard run on the streets I said check I don't think we can afford that is there none don't worry that's my building you guys have to pay anything I just want to make sure I don't have to drive there one one at 4:05 Redondo Drive and he gave this cool to us like what can I do more about this guy no and that's why we have this school in the valley because he used to live in Encino the school was in Encino then we stuck coming here then here we are Joe Hogan Tarzan came by to our school yeah that's amazing wow what a great guy but the point on that a conversation was that our school when we opened our schools to call Carlos Gracie jiu-jitsu because of our uncle because when we came mean we have the gracious queen I remember the famous big and everybody has your side of story everybody's saying something about your uncle your cousin and we want to make sure that this side of him that we were representing away with Carlos side then a lot of people on the with did the grand opening Chuck Norris were with us doing the self-defense and the most raishin in the grand opening of the school and that was on Sunday on Monday were not even ready for the amount of people that show up at our school and we have a small place with the amount of people but a lot of people start calling the other school asking where our school were because we're not even on the the book yeah we are not even on that and people calling the other schools hey do you know where they are the school is in there create a little situation back there and we got some calls from all the cousins and they say hey you guys can I use the name for the first time living using the name of our family we realize like what why not because you don't have the last name you can use it then for us we grew up fighting for the family doing everything for the family we still do nothing change but then their suggestion was yeah you can call machado like all the Grayson name my family was this because of whore Ian yes before he was a lawyer and so he was the one who kind of copyrighted it and wanted to make it was like trying to sue carlson at one point but do you know the crazy thing with this we have one of the students in and as we learn jujitsu the most important thing for me as instructor was everybody can learn how to fight right how can you translate what you learn on the mat to implement on your personal life that's how we learn to use the impact fissures you two has on you to succeed outside the Academy I know you can fight but can you fight on your life outside then is a different ball game is a lot bigger and a lot harder and we have a lot of students that came to us when we have our garage time that change their life in coincidentally one of the students happens to be son of the biggest lawyer in California and we have no idea because we end up getting sued by one side the family they don't have no money we turn to the shin Se guys I have I'm sorry we're going to have to leave so you thought you're gonna close down the school oh yeah then we had this guy which his father was very grateful to us show up so look I'm this hotshot lawyer I can represent you guys like what happened to pay now you guys already I owe you because my son was saved by you guys who is your son the his son was 21st for quite some time became very good easy to change his life around it was a drug addict now he's uh one of the best yoga instructors out there jiu-jitsu allit yeah we go in his life and that lawyer protector has made sure that we stay here fine what's back then and that was on the test today for our families we have our difference backgammon it's less now oh it's it's nothing well there's enough for everybody now I think everybody realizes in the beginning jiu-jitsu was so new and so powerful and that gracie name was so huge do you remember when Vitor they used to call him Vitor gracie yes they would call victor for some reason it was Victor VI Katie Orr and then it became Vitor like I was there when they were calling him Victor gracie me and they know they mean anything in the eyes a fighter and in my generation brazil everybody wants to be part of the family of course everybody wants to feel that you and that big circle because there's so much history and it's the name I soaked in August August 12th at your birthday right first level August 11 they're gonna have a statue for Carson Gracie being in Copacabana really a lot of recognitions happen now which is you to especially gracious because anyone that does use it today you're doing great sushi somehow yes maybe second generation third generation student off this guy who his instructor was a student off I mean I think everybody should be and they're grateful for what the family's done and yes the fair it's the most important family in the history of martial arts by a long shot man it changed the world change the world change the world change my world I remember when in the UFC came out and I watched it and I had been a striker my whole life and I had done a little wrestling in high school but no jiu-jitsu no submissions no nothing and I watch boys Gracie just run through everybody and I felt I felt so vulnerable I was like oh no I don't know anything I don't know any this what the fuck this is how I was watching him take guys down and just strangle him like shit and these guys were killers they were stand-up killers and hoist was just dominating everybody and I mean when I was in Arizona remember the first one they show in the pay-per-view and I was in Denver right the first you see and I was teacher seminar and I think back those day they got pay me $1,000 for that weekend and and I was watching a group of guys and they were not even sure and I put them on in the Davis hey who wants to make a bet that the skinny little guy like look like a doctor is gonna win everything and everybody no no okay put the money that nobody put the money though and here we are because we knew what you do too is we knew that she too works and I think she too brought a lot of reality into the martial arts world oh yeah we made a lot of enemies that today are our friends because we showed something that people refused to learn until they have no other choice they have no other choice man oh yeah man we have UFC the biggest fun is showing the world what they come from came from Orion there we go from the streets in Brazil to to the world and Hori and Gracie who we all owe a huge debt to he wanted to prove the effectiveness of gracie jiu-jitsu so he established the Ultimate Fighting Championship and that's where it came from it came from that guy's imagination and his desire to spread the word of his family that's watching you to do for people you believe yeah imagine if you did not believe in what he has and what he learned yeah we'll be none of us be here talking today yeah promise to do something else and maybe not as happy as we are today no it's it's amazing man the whole story is it's hard for people to understand too that they've never practiced it but how fun it is you know it's it's an amine so and it makes your mind better okay I was telling some of the students jiu-jitsu is a health way for you to be bullied by someone you are nice school in environment and you have the high belts playing with their weapons yes they in day out the white belts come in it's literally been bullying in a half way because it's in our safe environment well it's not bullying where you're not getting picked on but you're getting manhandled then the thing is they get smashed daily they come back for next class yes next class until soon they're gonna stop be able to do the same thing yes and that little step they do they realize that well I'm being picked by someone now I stand by myself and I'm able to and he turned the table round it's a very healthy way to be picked up every day that if you stay there stick there you're gonna use that you're gonna reverse that you get choked pretty soon gonna be choking someone in Rob are gonna bar summer and it's a walking up in the stairs and that's how we grew up we go to these schools we get beat up like by the older cousins and and I don't think that's for me but then we come back one more time come back one more time then 40 years later you still coming back for one more time well teaches you not just resilience but how important it is to just keep showing up and it's a it's fun whole thing you get choked to go home like how that guy choked me yeah I thought I knew how to defend it how did he make me turn in the way that he got the choke then its intrigue then you keeping and back in the 80s we had no videos we have to try to memorize and see how this actually happened write this there was a lot more challenging because you have to try to remake it not sure if that's what actually happened to you but the amazing thing in I will remember a lot of times are looking around the mats I have all my brothers or my cousins it's no way someone in this room who never will not have the answer for the question that you have right and you have so many different views that is impossible for you not to learn and I'll get good in jiu-jitsu yeah you have so many amazing fighters out there knowing more than you know then every member every time I ask something to the technique I get five different answers yeah and I use the one that works for me well that's the what's interesting right is that everyone has a different approach that jujitsu is almost like the way people talk it's like having conversations people use different words and different styles and and the amazing thing is let's see we train and I do well with you then the Train of that guy you do well that guy in the theory I should be doing one of the guy no maybe his game does not fit with my game I might have a lot of difficult against him which I shouldn't write what is the matchup game is very interesting is nothing that is guaranteed all that guy's gonna write no it's not right and maybe my game is used yours but not to his well that was the most amazing thing about Hickson right because Hickson was the one guy that everyone said was the best when I grew up and I have to say the privilege to watch for me have some guys from Carson school there was amazing fighters used to watch them and I remember one of them Acacio Cardozo for me was phenomenal we have definitely Hoyle er for his size his weight most accomplished phenomenal all the greats no matter what this guy did with his size against opponents if people look like not no way and yes it is a way yeah indefinitely as you going heavier I have my brother Hagin which was an amazing fighter too and everything before me my time with Hickson it's like you have the era of Hickson you know a lot of them believable fighters but yeah you're in the wrong decade vixen there and now could be you but he was right there right you could have been numbered you were number two in the Hickson you could have been number one other anybody in the in the amazing thing you feel like a chameleon and again he can kind of make any game you traded him he can pretend to be you fighting me or anybody it's amazing that aspect especially the teaching process what was so good about him he used to go to our school have third of the best guys all hi belts and he tells you okay choose how you want to start and he chooses okay he is not gonna get on he gets out and he gets you in the position you ask him to start with everyone I think the most the best thing that he has on his game on my view and should they understand that was his defense hmm no way to get him you let your mom take his back do whatever you want you can't get him he used to start like guys take his back with a rear naked choke fully locked in black belts go ahead start from here and stun then defend get on it out and get you there yeah crazy then messes your mind up like hey wait a minute yeah how can he get out and he gets me he can get out you know mm-hmm and I think the amazing thing was his confidence and belief on that it makes amazing well he was unusual on that he was really into physical fitness as well like yoga really into yoga become incredibly flexible and strong and really in the breathing he had a amazing control of his body as well as the knowledge of jiu-jitsu man he brought a lot of elements to the yeah I don't think people realize how important it was before so I knew that no you did not he brought in the breathing I spent the the janowska that makes you come closer to the nature habitat yeah gymnastic are Naturals what we're talking about it's a style of who invented that was the man Orlando Kenny and it was a Brazilian thing as well Brazilian guy he's still alive in his eighties and you look at him like how can he do or still do that well and the whole idea is move your body like the animals right so bring back to us the animal instinct that we end up losing by the generations you see some of that now with IDO portal and a lot of these guys are training martial artists and these movement like movement classes and movement styles and a lot of that is very similar to gymnastic unnatural amazing but the biggest difference I think was the concept that he used the approach that he wasn't as just mechanical the way it is it was something that sometimes on the exercise you change the direction of your movements it's not certain kata you have to do 1 2 3 4 no he goes 1 2 jump before 10 go back to 6 you flow mm-hmm and Hickson brother into jujitsu and I remember train he goes hey get there keep moving keep moving don't stop moving keep keep the flow of the technique you're gonna get it and he brought that movement into the sheets which for me made a huge difference in the way I fight how did you fight before that we learned the technique we do the drills and it's more like you pause and wait for somebody to pause in this position when he came in understand that is you learn how to start guiding people to where you want them to go mmm I'm training whew I want you to go to my left there's no other way for it to go to my right I learned how to mold my body in a way the only direction you have to go is on my left I know that but you don't right there we go I one step ahead then when you go to my left you're gonna put your left hand on the ground start off your right hand I know that too then um two steps ahead of you I mean when you're trying to defend something you already two steps behind because the defense is our shorter than the offense you stretch your arm for me to get your arm I have to put my hands and swing my leg for you just bring one back well it's always short it's quicker that's why when you have one or two steps ahead you don't have the time to defend well you're blocking off the difference I'm already too far ahead for you to defend right and that's what I learn with those movements that he brought into jiu-jitsu mmm you start learning how to guide and mold yourself to make you go to that direction who was a challenge to him in the early days because there was a lot of great guys right we have a lot of great guys and it's funny sometimes as you know go to the internet and see some of the fights and you notice that a lot of guys they we can kind of hang out for one two five minutes after five minutes and great athletes they just done right because of that movement he keep going constantly keep that rhythm people were not able to keep up with him right and he's not lifting weights and a bodybuilder no he's and we learned how important for human needs to be in contact with nature would you imagine yourself not going for hiking some days in the morning I mean we need that we need that energy yeah we need to walk without shoes we need to be near the mountains the water mmm that's something that make us healthy and stronger and that's why you see we used to go a lot up in the mountains and waterfalls and out of this city to trying to get that in a healthy animal instinct that we had yeah where they listen to the birds listen to in the middle or maybe son coyote there are people that on the city they go on the mountains they're gonna get eaten eaten by a mountain life it's not even here the mountain life but if you walk in the heart off and you understand that you will develop and still have that oh I heard something there mmm we're losing more of that as usual we trying to bring people into that environment which is something they make you better off regardless be more aware of yourself exactly you know more primal and also that's the struggle of jiu-jitsu is so much different than what most people experience on a daily basis where you're literally trying to stop someone from choking and it's a friend like a good friend like you yeah but they're trying to choke the shit out of you and you're trying to stop them and the amazing thing you're trying to stop and you don't get mad at him not at all you don't say thank you man you slap hands and then I say how'd you get me like oh you forgot this like oh here we go is there is is the amazing thing one student said something like do you know why was it so people are so friendly cuz they hug each other at the time yeah well there's so much physical contact that that is true there's something to that but I think is the idea I contacted the talking to each other and in that exchange of information it's also humbling which I think people need I think people have a distorted perception of what they can do in this life and I think sometimes you need to understand this is where you are and when one of the beautiful things about the ranking system of jiu-jitsu is you know when you give someone a purple belt you you say hey this is real you're ready for this I've seen you I watch you I know you know a hundred percent where they are they're ready to get a purple belt and then it's this feeling like okay they're all this showing up day after day drilling after drilling coming in when I don't want to is this paying off and I've reached a new place it sounds like when you promote someone's a flashback they go back like wow you know they realize all this time that are bringing in a very good way suffering going through these your worth when right here right now feeling much better when you gave me my purple belt I remember thinking that is probably one of the happiest moments of my life because to me purple belt was like a blue belt was like you just kept showing up you kept showing up you kept showing up now you got a blue belt but a purple belt was like you could get a black belt you just have to keep going you in the top of the mount is a purple belt you're right there we did we fought the top prize there's no way down there is just up you right there with all of them that was during the fear factor days I was more happy about getting that purple belt than I was about getting tired I have to mention some because I get a lot of message from people at home as you're hooking good in Jogja and you just as good say man come to my school anytime Joe Hogan shows up and he's he's back now training it's not about his power man he doesn't care he wrestles everybody anybody and I see him twisted people around and in school and he's one you know this is this is real he's one of the hardest students training partners that I have and I think one of the last time I rest of him and my Malibu school I think we trained maybe for half an hour or something like that I was there for I don't know 20 minutes just trying to sleep Joe and Joe is right there I finished the training man my legs are sore and I don't I don't remember if I did sweep him or not it just stopped raining after her an hour and I want people to understand it's anybody that I wanna train I would never and I refuse I never give a bell to anybody unless they deserve the belt I want to say the service I don't defer people from more famous less famous thought now it's everybody's ug2 world is the same you have to walk in the same road as everybody because that's the only way you were actually gonna learn jujitsu for real yes you now remember you say no to anybody training get hurt a lot of times that don't care show up and my neck is here my knees they're in training and you're out there that you listen here's what the strongest scuse my language motherfuckers I have my school training jiu-jitsu with and that's why I'm here we I'm pushing him to get back and I'm gonna show up here and now that I know where he is I'm gonna show up here what's up Joe soon as I hear this fucking it is amazing and I want people to know that is the real deal another thing that people don't know is when he was back in a fear factor time he had one idea to one of the challenge for the people would be training fighting a cage with me in that case doing jiu-jitsu and then I realized Joe you don't need me you go there and do it yeah you're gonna mango everybody there you don't need anybody to do that yeah we end up not happening and they decided that it was too dangerous to do a person versus a person they thought there was too many legal implications exactly meanwhile they have people ride a fucking bull but so the challenge was they were gonna have to start with you on the ground like in your guard or with you mounting them we're gonna figure out what it was and whoever survived the longest you know like though the you don't need me you can use Joe just gonna do the same thing and gonna twist whatever needs to do it has all the tools for that that was for anything the point was you you can do it with no need for me to do it how do you how you still fairly injury-free and for all these years because what's interesting about you is you know you've been doing jiu-jitsu forever but you can still roll and train with people a lot of other guys after a certain amount of time they really can't roll anymore they develop all these back problems back problems in particular neck problems I learned I mean more you learn Jersey - last chance to have to get hurt in my point is I'm I'm I was under control I'm always controlling my opponent and I know how to avoid certain situations before this situation actually happened because a lot of times people go for the kill but not concern about them getting killed sometimes they expose themselves to be in a bad position and they have to learn sometimes you do an armbar in somebody and somebody put all the weight on your neck and I see people insisting in getting there no you go back keep the control then you do it again well but not insisting some bad positions and everything has to do how well do you eat how well do you sleep do you exercise let me alot of the things I exercise to be like with weights lift weights and run you know and swim you have so many things that you can do and people say oh no everybody's gonna die one day sure we can buy two more but I want to make sure that time I'm alive I'm healthy right and I don't see myself going to jiu-jitsu school teaching and not training but even Hickson can't train anymore oh no he's back training he's wrong yes he's really no I saw one of his students they trained last week just for an hour Wow I had an injury in a gun understand real bad back problem yeah as a bag and heap a lot of things in a lot of those things happen more not with you sheets with some of the MMA fights mm-hmm I got understand back those days with Laurel no protection at all went no rules throw each other out of the ring and I was something you know very very challenging no weight class yeah he show up as a young age fighting some monsters over there that's like man I don't know how he did it but he did it no showing up and but Zulu when he was 18 is losing same but strong was more fond that time Danette you sheets mm-hmm never Hardison necklace nothing mmm then his back training nah man and would love it is amazing man I don't see myself with idiots will not be able to train didn't you you've got a cortisone shot recently I yeah I'm not sure what happening my knee bugs me and I go there have a little meniscal tear I'm still training have a certain position there are it's not comfortable I have the cortisone shot and so far so good not anymore no bother me you have a central position that but the physical therapy that I'm doing is being very helpful what kind of stuff you're doing and lift weights and everyday and a bike doing things that make your life stronger bikes great all bike is amazing it's so good for the needs no impact I mean yeah I think we have everything we need if I don't have I can learn how to do it but it is a lifestyle in general yes yeah it is in the pits it's almost like it's not just a lot it's like a philosophy too because there's a lot of people that they learn how to deal with life through the struggle of jiu-jitsu because the struggle of training is so much harder than most of struggles that you face in your daily life it makes you more accustomed to dealing with unconfident engines out there funny story that why should you do this for you I my my older daughter had some health issues like it two o'clock in the morning something like that and now called the daughter and said look I've gotta go and get this inhaler something at the pharmacy man I was wearing my pajamas driving crazy to the pharmacy and as I'm walking in have a guy walking out and bumping his shoulder - hey son of a DS a few and man Chu turning them on I'm gonna find go home coach oh wow dude then they got number wait for you then his south side ago got the medication I put the stuff in semi gotta go outside he's no longer there several months later the same guy show up in my school and I did not recognize him but he keeps tearing me and I approach hey how are you and habit ran sheets before is like do you remember me did you train here before no I bump into you in the pharmacy I hate girl like thank you for not hurting me man what happened to you that all my father passed away a day before I was so depressed so the point for me was with jujitsu I can walk away for something like that and I feel sorry for the guy yeah I'm not concerned oh I'm afraid of him no I'm not afraid it's just a fact that I'm saving him to get hurt right today he is one of my best friends he's my lawyer my dear friend he's been training utiful since that time almost 20 years but I remember that day walking in and the guy pointing to me I wanna fight Wow anything man I walk away no no no you strung for me man go home and that's the difference - between jiu-jitsu and kickboxing because the kickboxing youyou can only hurt somebody you can't really like hold on - hey hey you ever see this already hurt man you ever see the video you ever see the video of Matt Serra Matt Serra was in an altercation with some drunk guy you know in a bar or a restaurant my son and me why Matt just took the guy down mounted him and just just hold it onto his wrist and he was like calm down calm down and the employers are like trying to figure out what to do is like he's fine he's fine calm down but you know Matt didn't hurt him he just held on to him and basically just mounted him and grabbed ahold of his wrist and was controlling of it I mean when we say jiu-jitsu is a gentle art yeah we mean that yes uzhitze will give you the choice to choose to hurt someone or not yeah and I think my trainee realized that that person has something already going on in their life right and we choose not to yeah I mean we grew up in our time and that's fine with teenagers in know she shoots at tournaments and then we go like how are we gonna test ourselves and back in the day it is in Brazil we have some fun time we go to a nightclub and fight breaks through and here we are practice jujitsu but not hurting anybody and not because we choose or somebody provoked now we get people coming towards us because we always little guys never know biggest guys in the place then we just make sure like man we take them down hold choke somebody out but no scratch and on the end those people become students of our school right how those little kids can do that to us right and that's one way that's funny in the eighties that jiu-jitsu became even bigger with some of the altercation on the street we convinced the person that we just fought we just choked to come and become our student because he didn't hurt and then up coming in like that they feel humiliated but at least they they feel thankful that you didn't injure them for sure yeah you know in in a fight man that I think is you to give you that sense of control yes there do you have you have that choice this is where I always explain to people I say if I'm in a street fight with someone and they're swinging if it's strong person as a strong person they're good athlete they have strong arms and then they're throwing punches at me if I get hit I'm in trouble no matter who you are if you get hit you're in trouble most likely I won't get hit if I know how to how to fight and I keep my hands up and I move right but if I get a hold of you you're not doing anything to me like there's a difference between like someone who's untrained and someone's trained like if a jiu-jitsu blackbelt grabs a person and gets all it actually gets control of them there's no lucky you're not gonna luckily submit me you know it's not gonna happen but you can luckily you could hit someone it can happen in a street fight if someone has a little bit of speed and they have power and there's a strong person they can hit you it's much more dainty and it's the only and we also wanted trained it was the only opportunity our opponent has is before we close the distance right that's the danger zone and if you think for a second a lot of things that we do on the ground in jiu-jitsu you just bring those two people up in the close distance is the same thing hmm and a lot of people today they don't do the same they trying to fight standing when they hold different then when you're on the ground the way you move your legs away play guard it's the same penguin is standing work on the people's body as a hook as a sweep to make somebody fall and and we learned that when we get close to someone we make this size not be affected as much ice could if you have a distance do you think that there was a transitionary period where a lot of jujitsu guys were having a hard time because they were they didn't know how to take people down and then the wrestlers were learning how to keep them a distance they were learning takedown defense in a yes and that's the very challenging yeah but if I'm fighting a wrestler what are the chances that he's gonna take me down it's higher than me actually taking him down right and most of the things that we do in the jiu-jitsu under what we see in this sport is used today we're not gonna use in a real fight mostly jujitsu seen at tournaments we're not going to use that in a fight mmm that's the difference from that generation of the eighties to the generations from the 90s and to up today it's two different kinds of jujitsu one is a sport which is very beautiful a lot of people they do amazing techniques but the rules of the sport had the tendons to take to another direction and when you have this residual as the eighties with practice using a lot of leverage with their arms patients and when we play garden day or eighties is different than we played today so they have a lot of gears wrapping around everything and he became a weapon right and our time they give us never weapon they give us a call most like a paper Brian who use a lot the neck a lot the elbow well that's what helped you when you transition to noogie right well definitely it's also because you were born with no fingers on your left hand and with no dip for me and today's no difference right I play exactly the same in both right no difference at all but you were all over hooks and under hooks and grips around the body and whereas the guys who transitioned to MMA and they're all game relied on grabbing collars and sleeves those guys had a harder time for sure yeah a lot of guys that's why a lot of guys are trying to come in they might be good on their top game but when they go on their back yes they kind of a little lost and mm yeah how to play the game yeah that's why it's so important pressive when you see a big guy who also has a great back great off his back like Fabricio Werdum and i think if you'll notice if I'm on the bar of someone and I'm flat I'm a target right I have to change that if I don't change the ink I'm gonna get ground and pound right like we've been seeing a lot yes you see some more this is a BlackBerry sheets and then you go like oh wow flatter his back that mean all my weight now is affecting you and we're up on you you have to learn that your legs should be an angle mm-hmm this way I'm not able to hit you there your legs on the way and that's one thing that very few guys do it or close the distance I change the angle but it can be look at him trying to go hold his neck he's gonna hit you hard well Eddie figured out a brilliant thing with rubber guard when with a brilliant thing with Mission Control and how to control from the back of the neck he like this yes close to the distance he changed a lot of people's games what what some people don't want to recognize but they have Chuy's the idea that he had then I remember him coming up and try some of the techniques and people this is crazy say no man keep going this is you're gonna get somewhere I don't think not everybody can do that because you have to be a little bit flexible but once you learn how to do it you save your life yeah how many guys have when they get ahold of their foot then keep that close is no gap or room for the person on top to hit you mm-hmm and as you try to move too much your arm suddenly is stuck yep and there we go you know closes the distance you can't be playing when my arms are free cuz I'm gonna ground and pound you that should be heavy guys hit once or twice that's it mm-hmm yeah he figured out some very unique ways to use his legs and you notice that he closed the distance or he changed the angle close the distance change the angle where is on top you don't have space or you don't have the angle you always enough we position when they get a hold of your head and they're like the way he does it's interesting to see the evolution of jiu-jitsu from 1993 UFC style 2 to 2019 - there's so many new techniques there's so many new approaches but there's some guys like Roger Gracie for instance who just use the basics honed razor-sharp edge you don't see a lot of crazy Barron bolo chokes or wild things from God those a lot of the like real rock-solid traditional techniques guys he this simple works all the time yes whichever simple works on it yeah anything usually require more than three steps you need to train a lot but even Hickson right like hips and style was the just it wasn't anything that no one knew how to do which is he knew how to do it better than anyone there we go he's he's the way he moved yes you can't find him right and once you find him he gets out and get you he goes around your back it's triangles arm bars rear naked choke s-- normal stuff normal things that everybody knows how to do you get to his guard you know you're gonna phone him back yes simple as that oh I'm his god I'm gonna fall his back he's gonna sweep me yeah oh I'm not gonna sweep oh he's gonna bar me I mean it's not much where you can feel safe mm-hmm and today you see Laura the jujitsu have they need some pickle transition you go for number one beginning the position transition then you have the submission today they jump from number one beginning to the submission is no transition the transition now has become muscle they hand over par never seen so many injuries today in the jujitsu competition really so many interests shoulder knee foot elbow like my god we're living it from because it's know you're missing a lot of sometimes the finesse to get there they have to muscle but that's one of the reason why I wanted to talk to you about your longevity because you are the best guy that I know of in terms of like you your you have a little knee injury little meniscus but that's it I've known you forever you've never had like a major surgery you never had like a major problem and everybody I know gets hurt everybody I mean again it's the way a train the way you control the fight and I think people can understand is I rather get you once but I get you well then trying to get you 20 times sometimes people try to go after each other in the injury will happen right cuz they're clashing exactly if you have somebody come very tense to me I don't play tense back well I try to relax more you relax more I'm gonna be able to achieve against you I remember when you competed against Dean Lister and he was about 250,000 pounds Dean was so fucking big he was so big man but you were able to there was one of the very big frustration for me on that event because I remember was training to be in my weight class below 170 and that year who have was marcelo garcia who have some good names good gas to fight and always training a lot for that and I think week and a half before the event are on I was supposed to fight Dean Lister but back in those days I think his contract with pride did not allow him to fight because their concern is an injury happen and he's gonna be missing the pride fight then they come a week and a half to offer me that fight and and end up taking their fight but I don't think I trained his specific and focused on fighting and I think the fight was a bonus for me Dean it was a monster but it wasn't a good fight was not much happening on the right it was mostly he was concerned to know and I wish I felt the difference on the always so light and I did not train if anybody heavy because I was fighting on the one seven I was just trying to people that way class and lower to get this speed to be ready for those guys then here yeah week and a half I don't think I was feeling ready for fight somebody this big my strategy I have no strategy back down okay let's let's try to move but he was very smart not moving much I have everything to be worried about him grab a hold got a hold of my foot and I think was 20 minutes not much happening on the fight and and for me was was frustrated not be ready for fight like that mmm as I was training to fight in a lower class I was so ready and I regret not doing that mmm would be amazing but for the other reason that moving happen no problem well when you did do Abu Dhabi the first time I think it was a wake-up call for a lot of people that you know because of you know being born with no fingers in your hand and your approach to jujitsu being so over hook and under hook powered you know you you transition so smoothly into noogie whereas a lot of guys from your era they would go in transition into noogie and they really little missing so many tools because they're so used to grabbing the game you know whatever man when you got a call to go in ninety nine and they said the rules would be ten minutes five minutes first five nothing counts right then after five whatever the rules were I don't even know today what the rules were anyways what counts are not count but didn't realize man the first five minutes not counts that's let's go right so if you don't know we're saying here Abu Dhabi is a very strange rule set so for the ten minute round the first five minutes of it there's no points it doesn't matter what happens if someone takes you back if you get mounted you you get into a triangle but you escape there's no points then I just go brink they got the ground pulled guard right away and let's go right and I think was surprised for a lot of people because right from the bat they keep going all the way and again with the transition that I for me I have no transitions the same game no key right and I feel at home yes that's what I do every day right and I felt a lot of guys not sure how to behave but in my mind the first five minutes nothing concerts there's it doesn't matter if amounts me take my back or do anything nothing is realistic their whole idea is to make people actually go after each other right but when I get there see people waiting standing five minutes walking around waiting for the firemen on one point opposite buddies yeah let's see if he's better grappling than me good if he's not good then but it was a wake-up call for a lot of people because they got to see you who did you find that first year you for Sakurai right I yeah what who was a big-time MMA fighters but I can I think they were well known and very well known it maymay world over there also known as being really good grappler so it was very eye-opening for people to see you run through them if I'm not wrong with the first loss for Sakurai his first loss what was fine I think for me is it's my world and let's see if a better grappler good if you're not good for me yeah yeah that was fun and I think was was very good for me too all the air ADCC I was able to be among the best three guys and that was for me was a great accomplishment being able to just stay up on the top of the game and fighting the lighter guys that have you guys I was in special no gear which was something that it takes for a lot of people some kind of adjustment because they born in the give world basing their game on the ghee and they have actually some hard time tuned and a lot of them even gave up like I forget it now in the early days of jiu-jitsu there was a lot of nogi guys on the luteal every side right there was a VIP for people don't understand there's a big rivalry in Rio between jiu-jitsu and lucha libre a lot of times you have people that come to our school and they don't fit in they and they walk away and they finally stood back those days those guys were some of these people that you know did not fit into the jujitsu schools and they're not creating their own nogi school but again understand that an and the eighties our generation in rio de janeiro summertime man it's a 110 115 extremely humid and we did a lot of trainings with training the Gihon after the gift session click the top of the gilt and here we go we train Oggy since we're white belts we've been doing that because the intent were learn how to get out of a headlock how to be in the bottom somebody trying to slap you what do you do and that was our train in that generation that's why almost everyone from the eighties is to up-to-date teaching and making a great school all the dead generations still the longevity on them being do jiu-jitsu still out there a lot of guys that I see now especially if the social media they all teaching all doing very well a lot of them too big some of them still in good shape in teaching but at that generation I think is a for me was a golden gold generation is you up there and the people that come from their generation their students they develop such a good jiu-jitsu roots is they're still delivering anywhere I think they still have there but it's not a rivalry anymore right now I don't think today past that time and I think that the rivalry was a need for our generation to establish jiu-jitsu was a very effective art and I think some of the MMA events that happened was the fighter should that should be happen on the streets then we're able to bring there and to make into a arena this way only the two guys would be funny not innocent people get hurt on the street mmm and I think ways what people don't realize is a lot of those fights could be happening right on a nightclub or some people even get killed now let's bring their fighting to the arena only you two guys nobody else is gonna get hurt and that's why a lot of those events happen no money no prize money not just for pride there's some videos of some of them that still exist you know just for pride there's no money involving a fight on the beach who was that he's gonna fight oh go to Artie that's right Hugo Duarte went on to fight in Pride he fought tank Abbott right man fought some different people and I mean I remember that they was so funny because you have a point on the beach in Rio that is it's where most of the issues it's where the pretty girls were and all the guys are going there a session the beach very famous people and then everybody got in that session and I'm we keep you here that will go Charlie Higson will coach Alan Hickson Herbert challenge he's right here there we go smacked him in the face then he goes like now he didn't say anything and I'm right there's some walking right there and light Schwartz there my mission were Nixon look up and look at me and say hey watch my back where were you I'm the one okay I'm off the screen now right on on my left you're gonna see me standing there then you come right if you figure up I can show you what year is this what you're this man sometime in the eighties and don't know who's filming that we have high and Gracie he was sitting someone shoulders with fast camera crazy to try to see oh no man I was getting so many bodies I was getting on I was getting punched in the head and the back just cuz it's watching Hickson's but everybody didn't jump in no no no what we did was we made a circle arms to arms and in Hickson's one with the green shorts right green straw yes and he had a long hair that day which nigga grabbed his hair there's that long oh no he it's a ponytail there really yeah I knew he had a ponytail from mammalogy obviously now you see Hickson mounting him oh no he got tired of punching the guy we felt and so my mission him punching him yeah there we go and the guy tap and stop please stop and they have he has a group of guys with him we want to make sure that nobody jump in his bed and then but the thing is we we have this and don't get me wrong I'm not telling people to go and do that but in that time in that generation a lot of those fights that happened in the street was a need for jiu-jitsu to be established the way should be and was better than two guys fighting there then that fight end up in a ball gang knocking five people shooting each other right in the remember Hickson said we we get together our first original Gracie by high school day and some members of others use you to schools you say look guys he's gonna go they're gonna make a circle only him and the guy fight nobody else fight you understand that because if everybody fights then somebody's gonna get really hurt because you're not gonna be able to control anything we just made a big circle we'll hold hands regardless of what happened we will not interfere it's Hix another guy and that's it but wanna make sure nobody jumps in then every man he say you gotta watch my back and I go like okay yeah what he said don't do nothing I watched my back and here we are I was behind him and getting punched getting kicked from other people but the crazy thing was they happen and Hickson on his mind said look I'm gonna go there slap him on the face he's gonna run then we like okay he goes there slept that guy and the guy did not run then we go whole shit game on then we hold each other and and I think was this happened on Saturday Tuesday night Google went to Hicks from school with a lot of people they are all carrying weapons Hickson wasn't there and they call he shows up in shorts and he quickly just slapped boob around somebody called the police later on and they even should the ceiling he ar-15 whatever just boom and they left but then was Hicks and just smash him quick this was on the cement not on the sand but there again happen in a way for us as a pride to prove the point is you too he's the best at martial arts and I would keep going strong and Hugo was a little afraid guy who was a little a very respected real strong one of the best guys to today and they had a grappling style it just wasn't as comprehensive back there they were doing a lot of foot locks already yeah you're the ones that are doing a lot of foot locks and oogie a lot of huge yeah and they have some quality fighters among with them definitely eugenio today Oh Jen it's a deal and they have I end up fighting one of the guys from there and now one of the Abu Dhabi's there but as the time goes by I think people get older can understand and I don't think today has any conflict or any bad feelings and they must have adopted a lot of the jujitsu techniques to everything magicians yeah take the gear right today our training grappling ok what is the definition of grappling the underground fighting then it's jiu-jitsu what do you think about this new trend that you're saying like you saw it particularly coming out of John Danaher and Dean Lister with leg locks like leg locks are so big in jujitsu competition now when when we learn jujitsu yesterday we would not learn anything related to legs until we get our blue belt the main reason behind these were to be able to let you develop guard mm-hmm without concern anything just learn how to move your hips in sweeps and hooks foot lock is something very effective but if I show you right away I might be stopping some of the evolution of your game or the other person that you trained with that he can learn which will make even better his foot lock right that's why we hold back until people get a one-year chew into jujitsu to learn leg locks but today you have the noogie everybody's such in a hurry then a lot of noogie schools the first thing people wants to learn it I want to learn heel hook mm-hmm and she cheats with ghee I wanna learn armbar right the noogie wants to go straight to the lag they give people want to go straight to down but I think particularly because of the success of these leg lockers against high-level competition no it's effective is amazing I think it's a portion of the game you know and I and you will see the development of people that we have defending that which also will force guys to pass also beyond the legs only mm-hmm but definitely they work it's a very dangerous let people wrap their legs around your leg hook you there I mean not everybody can get out of that and if you don't tap you're gonna get your knee ripped apart for sure and that's the real problem with leg locks is that so many guys wind up with pretty devastating knee injuries in the eighties the the the decision not to have heel hooks in jiu-jitsu was for safety we do we did practice but the competition is not allowed you gotta understand and in the eighties if you have a knee problem your careers over right there's no surgery that really would right today is different yeah you understand it's the evolution of the medical side make possible for you to put a brand new knee over there yeah but still to this day meniscus tears and cartilage tears those are still huge I mean without stem cells it's very very difficult to fix those unless you get I mean it's cute like I had part of my meniscus removed and my left knee and then you see them in you want to Train fall on Jeopardy and you can understand Chuy's I think some of those things should be kind of almost cranium a pearl League into the digital world because a lot of people they get hurt before even they learn what you Jitsu is that's why my only concern is the danger of all those you hugs leg locks because if you get somebody who knows he might tap or he might roll to the right side even know a lot of guys to get hurt yeah but if you hope somebody who doesn't have much experience in one of those traps it's for sure injury they brought the wrong way and rip it apart themselves even if you don't squeeze it's because they don't know what you do right yeah and my that's my view of as an instructor today on my school Synanon you're not ready for legs yet right oh I go to the know get don't go to the nougat tournament yet you have to learn first you understand for your own safety and also I want them to develop guard because when we get tired with pool guard hmm when you get tired you lie down to sleep you don't sleep standing you sleep when you lie down and you sheets is the same thing you get tired you're gonna pull guard and that's one of the ways I see some of my students in the tournament they get tired he's a top guy son hey stop pulling guard then he's tired he's already most and that's why you have to have a good guard just to survive and rest to be able to continue we surprised though that there's no gear leg walk games are taking off the way did I think because of the success you have so many guys doing extremely well and some of the guys that came from the nogi originally doing so well now some of the guys that come from the gig world doing no gear they've been finding some challenges to adjust to that lag I think in a way you have Chu is that simplify because if you get somebody in a Foot Locker like lot there we go and at the same time you complicate as you see a lot of scramble now and a lot of injuries every day and the same people don't want to tap then it's a position that you something's gonna get hurt yeah but I'm is that development and evolution of the the grappling world and I think it's amazing sooner or later somebody's gonna find a ways to protect better and better and better and better they were forced people to move on but you've seen that I think now with a lot of leglock guys against each other they kind of stalemate and you see them winning by rear naked choke or armbar again they're not using their leg locks against each other right you realize like man he knows as much as I do now I need more than that yeah they're using them to sweep or they use them to set up other things they're trying to exploit other holes like maybe they concentrate too much on leg locks so then they they're open to arm bars or I remember when when I learned in the beginning we have foot lock eyes the last resource let's see I'm finding the guy and I'm not able to submit him we're gonna foot lock him mmm that's how we used to have on the idea of your Hail Mary what lock is okay this is my deadly weapon if everything that I do is not working oh my foot lock him today is the opposite my first shot is foot lock him all the way it's not working I'm gonna choke him yeah you see so few foot locks in MMA it's interesting right you see like so few figure four foot locks because they danger also for you to get hit right yeah then sometimes when you do the foot lock your face your arms are both around the leg you can get not the feminist exactly what do you think about combat jujitsu Eddie's new invention man I think is a way for people to step up to reality and understand and some guys make a decision to know what I might be able to go and do mm-hmm but that's a real world yeah if you fight somebody that's exactly what's gonna happen right and making people more aware of okay my jujitsu for jujitsu sport only this is not gonna work there well for this kind of a jiu-jitsu I have not to be aware more of my real fight yeah and I think you will help more the evolution of that sport of jiu-jitsu to transition MMA for people don't know what combat jujitsu is Eddie Bravo invented a way where you do jujitsu with slaps on the ground and you you would think it's just oh it's just slap but no a palm strike really I mean you really can hit someone very very hard with your palms I mean I can do that with my hand on a table and it doesn't hurt my hand at all but if I did that with my knuckles it would really hurt so they're there they can smack the shit out of each other we stood in that after we trained judaistic all in portuguese top idea ii slap each other after the training no shirts yes and we used to train like that in brazil oh really it has to be ready again we have no tournaments right me after the train let's see and we stand in front of each other and open hands and there we go slap each other make sure they get slapped on the face but on the end of trying to have marks mmm all of your body and you still shake your brother's hands they love you but you're over mess are you still loved these two lift weights yes I do two days away two days a week but I but I like to run all I like outdoors mm-hmm yeah I run three four days a week and yeah you running trails I did try ma how now Stu Hart I don't know unless you go early in the morning yeah I go Rudy even in the morning it was hot this morning when I want boy it's very hot right now but I like it there I think I want to challenge my body hours to bring their best off the resistance III I think I don't like to go and run the same Street over and over again mm-hmm somehow your bite already gotta just to that Brian I'm always trying to find different the trails yeah this way is that gonna fight you changes up and down the whole time yeah and but it's something choose the juice is my excuse to do all of this right I want to go and do better all my students are getting harder however I'm switch that to make not that hard right I got to do a little bit more than I was doing now how do you mix up your weightlifting training with your to jujitsu training do you do it in the morning and then train at night or do you do it after you train right now I'm doing before teaching to the train my intention is when I show up to the Academy I'm already tired physically so that when you do train you can be relaxed and just this way my challenge is because I'm physically tired I make the LAV of my students higher because they have a lot of energy and they're good too it makes more challenge for myself to train if them because I don't have okay i'm my image now I have to purely use the techniques the jujitsu the techniques has must be on time I intentionally do that get their tired to make a good training for me and that's what I've been doing our show up and they don't know and then let's go and train then I can tell that man I should rest before train this guy I don't know if it's getting there good and too tired everything at the same time next week I'm not gonna do that again so when you do it twice a week how do you mix it up like what work on training you doing I work on one one day legs I lower per body and it's not the day upper body that's ours yes yeah so it's just to make you stronger just to keep the joints healthy and evidently feel the muscles I think is important for it's like prevent injuries yes that's the main thing yeah and I've been using a lot the idol neck stuff remember the guy from the arrow neck he sent it to me that yeah I'm using that it's amazing be using that yeah it is a recommend initially to guys for Jiu Jitsu guys it's a must go and get it man it's strong incredible well you said something to me wants and never forget ago never trust your knife you do not strong to get to the neck you have to be very aware of starting little flashes mm-hmm after that gets dark oh yeah no you're about to go out my friend [Laughter] but it's at least that you could train it safely now with the iron neck there was always a bunch of different ways where people trained that were questionable like there's a lot of people that don't believe in neck bridges they said it's actually kind of dangerous man our neck is if you see there the spine it's so sensitive you got to be careful in and work your neck mm-hm ugh we don't use our head on the ground right days are bad whenever and I think that our neck is again is the maintance of having your neck or well around because that spinning thing that you do man you work every angle of your neck yeah and I do a very simple exercise I have these touching to a bar and go forward and turn sideways there she knew the movement do you do the Ray Charles very if you wander around very slowly have that bungee that keeps more or less tension yes yeah it's sideways I love that machine or that piece of training it was a great addition to all the exercise hmm thanks to that guys because it's really really helpful yeah I recommend it to everybody it's just and for fighters that get hit in the head it's so important to have a strong neck to resist the impact will be dubbed muscles around mm-hmm this way the muscles take the first hit right just like you're talking about building strength around your joints by lifting weights actually the same thing exactly so are you doing like basic stuff like curls and dips and very basic and difference different than that time that you're training for competition which is and have heard a lot explosions and right this way just trying to maintain everything else I do in jujitsu some days I train pushing more some days are pushing lands some days are just trained in defense and there's a training ki gotta finish everybody today or got a mountain by today you kind of make your training a go for your training this way you're always excited to do it right you know and not having the same thing every day no I select okay today I'm gonna sweep everybody then I pull guard and keep playing as my goal sweep and some guys are very hard to sweep another day just when I'm out I can only finish people from the mount and I mean you you kind of make different goals and I think that keeps you and again my students yeah which is fun yeah sure it's fun you never know what's gonna happen right it sounds a challenge you go psycho yeah then you realize I should sleep in two hours actually I'm tired really want to find out where your body's at go train oh yeah I'm so sore I don't know and test you in every level no what about nutrition I grew up did you follow the racy diet I grew up doing the Gracie diet with my uncle Carlos and he explained that basically men they die to be the foods that you combine right some foods when you make that combination you're not gonna get what expecting from the food and that's how we learn I a lot of fruits lots I don't drink juices in where I make my own juice that's the only way you can have a proof that is actual fresh fresh and juice and if you then very rarely I eat meat fish and chicken and turkey more often than red meats I don't I don't remember last time it's been a while but it's basically fruits is my I love it up I in the morning cream cheese and honey late at night sometimes watermelon juice and tapioca I don't know if people know what tapioca is sure yeah tapioca pudding yeah not the pudding you make looks like a tortilla you make that in a pan and it's really healthy yeah I'll show you get to the end yes if I got powder it's like a brute and they shredded a root in and you you put in a in a pan and as the pain gets hit it looks like a torch in the end mm-hmm then you put a cream cheese and it's thousand times heavier than any kind of bread you eat in your life hmm I mean things that are good for your body but basically the fruits are my and my my main thing well you're always burning up so much energy that's still things jujitsu burns off so much energy you need a lifestyle you have you you burn more than you eat you're gonna keep your weight for I weighed the same thing from the past ten years the same way mmm go up two pounds go down two pounds what three pounds go down five pound you take any supplements I take I take maca tumeric pound or mix and all those juices that I make as more like preventive things you know if you don't you learn sometimes I'm gonna train harder tomorrow I'm gonna eat some carbs today the carbs would become a lot energy tomorrow my training and you base it little things that you learn but for me they may think is to stay healthy right there we go I don't remember last time I was sick no really I don't remember this time Wow people have headaches oh I have a headache you have many ways I have a headache you're not drink enough water or you need too much sugar something that you're consuming right now gives you headache now what about a post-workout recovery do you use sauna or ice baths or anything anything like that man the sound is a must yeah I mean I love it I see you put a lot of it oh it's a must so lemonade so much and your body's always pure and clean I love my apps on South jacuzzi yeah they're for I don't know an hour and just forget about life yeah choose brand new after let me have a lot of things that you should do eyes to keep the longevity offers to be able to do what we want to do and that's stay healthy it's amazing you stay hiking stay close to nature please trying to brief a good air it's pretty hot in LA but yeah you go up in the mountains man you feel like it's even on your mind you already changed the whole thing of fur and that's basically stay healthy how can I teach what tell my student to do something I'm not doing right it's like you go to the gym have two different coaches one that looks healthy and the one that is it's pretty big which one you're gonna pick right the one that knows how to get the way he is yeah when you see guys that start letting themselves go and getting big in fat and it's like it's very disappointing yes it is I give a hard time to a lot of people that I know friends that let it go as a man it's not what you say is what you've been doing yeah you know it I don't do this then you're doing well I mean what kind of it's more about an example yeah people getting hard to get lazy yes but man you you chose the wrong job to be lazy ya know your martial artists you can be lazy as a martial artist right you know do something a scene in the desk and then do nothing then it's I understand but you're doing a martial arts and you get lazy no you can't you become in a way an example for a lot of people and that's why I make people do what you do yeah there's no that's it's not an option some option becomes at all and it's soon as I see someone who is doing that who becomes lazy and becomes fat I just it's it's unfortunate you know it's unfortunately making a mistake I try I try to understand and sometimes I don't I said look man again you chose the wrong line of work yeah I mean you're telling me that you don't like what you do because you feel like what you do you're not gonna be the way you are right now and it's huge it's not working for you now which should be working right now more than ever well that's one of the great things about you my brother's you've always been a great example and you've always been a person who leads by example by the way the things you say but more importantly by the things you do for sure and I know that a lot of I think we're learning today is that what you say and what you do will affect a lot of people out there in a special now and the social media get so many great inputs for people that I have no idea who they are like oh thank you for this thank you for that thank you for you to put a good quote out there I think those little things have an impact in ours in a lot of people and I can't forget that Amen I love what I do I never had a job do you have a works and now at Ranger Jitsu and the amazing things they give me money to do dishes they pay me to do this can't be thank you Dan you know you you have a great life you make friends every day yeah you know you make friends every day and you kind of I able now to help people just with something that you say sometimes I have a high about students or even lower about students that show up for training and I learned that we file one story my uncle told me he uncle college he used to live there now and now back in those days he observed a lot of things and he has a was at time Timbers you have a lot of cock fighters and he has his regular rooster then he said man I'm gonna make him rooster I say okay and I'm gonna see how long the rooster actually fights and when I noticed that time how long he fights every time he's fighting I'm gonna get the real the cock fight hits the movie came out and they wish to think he's winning he's been doing that for a while then he realized the rooster can only stay in a fight for 2 minutes after 2 minutes he run then he goes to arena and challenge anybody there with his rooster he's not made for a fight to fight anyone there for one minute and they bet the money and for one minute the rooster gabby rap but fought for one minute did not run then one minute up he got his rooster a lot of fights and no I said one minute the point was I have guys that come to my school and they are not having a good day and I can tell that by looking to their face and I'm start training them and I let them give me a hard time and I go like man what's wrong with you today you kick my butt today and I can see the change that made in that person mm-hmm and I used that to train a lot of my students I'll give you an example a friend Eddie when he was before I fight Tyler when he come in he wasn't in the best of his game and I know his could be an amazing on the beginner prohibit anybody to give him a hard time or anything as he start building up the entire stay in the same and kick his butt he was so good and confident after a few months nobody could even get close to do nothing to him said man you ready you ready for a fight but on the beginning this was my way to work out his psychological to build him up he wasn't in the best shape he wasn't trained and said no you can't train if you're tuners everybody does what you do you gotta fight somebody who doesn't do what you do where a train of people that do what the other guy do right and here we are in 3 months we made him a monster and he did what he did on his fight we're using the same idea of my uncle telling me story to make you stop believing in torch the end I tell you guys man get him nobody could get even close isn't it funny how much of it is psychological because when you are tired but you start doing well all the sudden you have energy that's all in your mind and one of the things I try to remember who said that in we grew up and the fighting world Lauer's seeing samurai Bushido in the war and have a lot of good quotes and one of them was whenever you think you're tired your opponent is dead I always remember that until today I remembers a yellow belt one of my cousins told me that man when you're tired your opponent is dead that keeps you going your opponent is dead he's dead he's way more tired than you are that's the time he have to push he started trying to conserve no now push but what if you're tired and he's not this is this is the mindset then jiu-jitsu gives you the tools but makes you never give up mmm you can be tired we all going to be trying to fight that's for sure but you're not going to give up how important do you think it is to do additional conditioning other than just taking classes if you want to go and participate in on an event not tournament training is easy to train today you're going to do well if he wants to win the tournament then you have to do more you have to to workout you have to do your physical because that all involves if your mindset a lot of people they get nervous because they feel then already do you ever think that you'll have a jiu-jitsu school that also has weights and cardio equipment and things like that and maybe even classes to help supplement jujitsu training I think of the dream school for sure because a lot of people do not realize how beneficial there would be for them in general right not only for jiu-jitsu because I keep telling people now is put them in their minds for them to get better and believe in themselves but when they do those things are challenged them so if you challenge yourself every day you're gonna bring the best of you every day mmm if you do the same thing every day you already know what's gonna happen I never challenge yourself you're gonna bring something better and better gonna grow more inside I'm gonna stop believing so much more they keep ability that you had that would be a dream school I don't know any school that has like a real comprehensive gym strength conditioning gym attached to a jujitsu school use you to school I don't know any martial arts MMA places do and we may places yeah like all those big gyms yeah but a lot of things like sometimes someone may ask me and my thought above was this when you go to MMA gym and I think today is specific for MMA I mean they trained enough grappling for MMA they trained enough punching for MMA which is amazing but it's like you're going to a hospital you go there you have a general doctor but if you need a specialist I gotta go to the school that is specific for that purpose striking or jiu-jitsu even though now the biggest ones teams out there they have the best instructors of anything altogether right like American Top Team they have Carla boreal mean they have the best grappling coach you could have the wrestling but not all these schools are like that right that's a rare one but it's it's very challenged because of sometimes the ego among the instructors sure who the fight is gonna listen to right you get a lot of jiu-jitsu fighters and start training with striking coach and the striking coach has them convinced that they're a striker and I think the biggest challenge for the MMA guys is when is the right time for me to transition from standing to the ground right at the ground to standing and that's the ones that find the right momentum to do that they're the ones that are winning mmm and I know my uncle Hill is a man so no later they're gonna get your number I mean that's the MMA world very hard for it to retired without and when is the right time to retire right yeah it's hard to figure out for many many fighters now it's a lot of the things maybe money issues or maybe I didn't want to give up being famous or - a lot of things involve I should retire like now well we've been around for a long time and we've seen a lot of fighters fight long past where they should have retired that's when they can get hurt really bad yeah and you see that's when they the injury can be resting be with him for very long time yeah it does it bother you when you see that like particularly like older fighters getting knocked out man for me I think the people surround them should be say hey yeah enough is enough to know and I hope all of them and I think the way it is two days everyone is able to make good for their lives with enough money that they can live well not all of them unfortunates why they have to keep fighting as much as they can but is a very challenge I think is I have to understand is a short career you don't have 20 years fighting you have to understand is my body can take this much but after a certain point many and you can get hurt really bad just so everybody knows on the wall the studio right there does jean-jacques Machado's choral belt right there on that wall in the studio you gave me that I only made 10 of those one of them is right there my brother I know for a special person Joe Hogan man it's awesome well thank you for everything man thank you for teaching me jiu-jitsu thank you for being such a great leader and a role model and just thanks for being here brother I really appreciate you both super Joe thank you for having me here and now I can people don't keep asking me why don't you go and see Juho got the time and I think is a great pleasure for me to be here amazing to see the transformation and I think in the mixed martial arts world in the martial arts world how important was to have someone like you that knows what you're talking about because I remember the first few days of you see please UFC understand Joe Hogan was much big the UFC and I think you see reach out to a point like that to have someone like you pushing and you have so many people that loves you that follows you and the UFC was is you're the voice of UFC you know and don't get me wrong those guys out there but when you're talking and you have all those many fights there is very different than when you see the other guys talking about because I know the involvement that you have ana martial arts and the knowledge that you have and it's really good to be him and in all this best when you see the amazing you wanted to follow you see you're getting bigger and bigger and be able to to see that from the beginning is amazing well thank you and I promise I'll be training soon as soon as this knee feels better I'll be back and in Tarzana that's your main school the malleable one unfortunately was affected by the fires but Jay is now teaching somewhere else in the valley right what is he teaching I think we have a lot of filiation squares around here we have a one in Chatsworth we have one that's where he goes he goes there on Fridays yeah it's the Kings I have the one in some hot spot yes yeah and your gym the Machado Jiu Jitsu Academy is in Tarzana and you could find it online what's 27 years and now we're probably gonna be moving around the area for something that we need more space unfortunate unfortunate the same fortunately then no no no this podcast and we see yeah this can't be even more fucking clean anything that comes out at you hope he gets I love you again pusher listen you have the best fucking school I've ever been to in the world and it's a beautiful environment and it's a brother and a sisterhood and that's one of the best things about it is how how much it's like family over there it's like everyone who trains with you has the utmost respect for you and the way you are and the way you treat people it rubs off on everybody you really genuinely do make people a better person thank you sir and I'll see you back soon on the mat all right my brother daddy thank you everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
