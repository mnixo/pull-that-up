hello freak bitches you know it's just wild I mean in Vietnam it's like everyone's like it Nam is so beautiful you're gonna love it and I was like yeah it's definitely beautiful but I see poverty and air that no one can breathe everyone's wearing masks because they can't inhale there's no emissions regulations everyone's on like I was like oh right white trust fund kids or like PNM sputum and they say because they can come back to you know Williamsburg Brooklyn or whatever that's the thing that white people love talking about brown people being amazing it's like look I don't like you're not a better person because you think Vietnam is amazing like just admit that it's it's an we need to I mean I know we fucked it up a lot of it's our fault of what we did in the 70s but it was like it was um gave me a lot of anxiety you know cuz it was like I mean it was just like the hospitals I mean we were in a hospital and you know we needed four of this machine that puts babies to sleep pediatric anesthesia is very different than regular anesthesia and it's essentially bringing people to the brink of death and then bringing them back it's like incredibly fascinating job and they had one of the machines that they needed the pediatric anesthesiologist like we need four and they're like we don't have them we just don't have them in this country we just can't do surgery on babies it's just not in our purview it's not an arm you know so so back to the you know the kids come in with cleft palates and cleft lips which the baby is essentially they have trouble breastfeeding with some cleft palates just you know just kind of this opening here in a separation causes that malnutrition in the womb yep exposure to genetics exposure to pollution I'm sure all that napalm we dropped in the 70s didn't really help but yeah and in America it still happens but it's handled right away it's handled it comes out three months later it's fixed no big deal over there sometimes it's never fixed I mean you see adults you see men that are 50 come in with giant giant cleft lips and palates and they've and it's even worse in third-world countries especially African countries because there's such a stigma attached to it not only is it you know in our brains to go like he's different than me and ostracize our stigmatized someone but I'm a lot of more religious countries think you're the devil or you're you know you can't get a job you're you know completely sequestered you're thrown out of your family and you know and I think and this is gonna sound super corny but I guess for me I've connected so much to maybe it's because you know we're comedians or I was like look life's if you it's one thing to grow up in or third-world country it's another thing to deal with poverty and stress but if you can't smile like the basic the only real medicine we have you know everybody has Universal medicine of like laughing and smiling that's how we connect to people it's I mean that's fucked like that was frustrating and it's so easy to fix that's the other thing that's like frustrating is it takes like 30 minutes look at Joaquin Phoenix look at Joaquin Phoenix I don't want to live having anxiety issues like why do I have that way why what am I afraid of you know it's like well I'm not I'm not afraid enough to where I'm not gonna do it so let's just not make it a big not not make it something I don't like obviously I do like it that's why I'm doing track obviously I like MMA that's I'm doing it I don't want to make it something I hate I don't want to make it something I don't enjoy because it's so rational that's not why I do this I do this because I love it so let's not make it something I hate ever I try not to that's a very rational approach though it's very unusual for people yeah like there's nothing in this life like if I want to do it that fears gonna stop me fear is a realistic thing it happens yeah it's scary to get into the cage it's scary to think about losing you know and I've tasted the most bitter losses you could ever dream I mean it's devastating it's crushing that's the most scary thing it's not getting beat up it's not breaking your nose or breaking my orbital bone or letting my arm get snapped in half that's not the scary part about fighting and what I do the scary part is not being adequate enough not being good enough that you're a hundred percent wasn't good enough that's scary that's really scary and I've had that I've had to face that point-blank right in the face many times before and it's the hardest thing to do Bar None it's the hardest thing to look at yourself and like I didn't I wasn't enough I wasn't enough no one else could be responsible for that I fucked up I didn't do it I have to own this and to come back from something like that and think that you can still you can still get it back or you can still do it again or you can still get better you can learn from that that's that's also the challenging part of it you know and that's something that I've I've had to to get to this point I've had to get over those situations where I thought that my world had ended you know my second loss to Ronda was the most devastating the first loss was devastating the second loss was ah like it was horrible I thought my world was was coming to an end and you know and nobody cared and all my family and friends but the Mercer world they don't care I think you shit they don't care about second place they don't care you know and they're mean people are harsh they're mean on social media you have to get thick-skinned quick and nobody teaches you how to deal with that either there's no Mme social media 101 or they you know you just sink or swim you figure it out or you don't either bothers you or it doesn't you know either you yell back at everyone or you don't speaking of get in there I tried to watch soccer last night Ian oh yeah I was gonna bring that up people tweeted me that you're watching soccer I might invite you to a game on Sunday I can't go this is some others day Mother's Day all shit happen all right I can't do it oh yeah what happened why well I was at the store and we were hanging out in the secret comedians bar and and soccer was on so we just started watching it janessa who had that on Ron White was watching it I was watching it some of the employees were watching it who else was in there with us Tony was watching at one point but I started getting upset if these dudes getting slapped and going down like that yeah hit with a meteor I just like that I'm like I just can't support this kind of nonsense you were watching a really good game yeah yeah you're watching a really good game yeah it was amazing like skill-wise by a Munich in the red they're the best German team and this is a Champions League game so I don't know how to explain it Champions League is where the four best teams in each league in each country like playing a tournament to to be the best club in Europe hmm so Bayern is it's like the number one team in Germany athletically like number two number three right now they actually in number two number two spot right now but last year they finished maybe second or third at the end there they have less money but their coach is an ex Argentine player and he figured out a system where they just hustle they just out hustle you you get the ball and there's three motherfuckers on you and you're gonna cough it up and they're gonna get it and they'll score one or two goals a game and that's enough but you know and Bayern is just so really skilled that they might be able to they'd beat most teams but athletic is just so disciplined that you know they knock them out and and they're they're going to the Champions League final versus Real Madrid so there's two Spanish teams in the Champions League final and both of them are from the same city so it's like the Lakers versus the Clippers for like the best the championship of what what what what are we in like the of North America so we're gonna do some soccer games man you're gonna leave the world of soccer oh yeah it's gonna introduce it to me let me know it's funny though I know what you're gonna do come and then you're gonna talk you people I'm tell you right now you guys stop falling down people stop you know nobody likes that nobody nobody likes they shouldn't do it you shouldn't do it I've never liked it but people do it to get the free kick or the penalty or to get the other person sent off he's become a part of the game it's unfortunate so let's just get that out the way before you come in because that's you're gonna see that but besides that it's it's a it's it's a man's game yeah I mean get the fuck out of here when Raquel Pennington choked out Ashlee evans-smith blood was pouring down her face and she strangled her unconscious with one second to go with a bulldog choke in the first round that's a girl girl and you get smacked running down the feeling Oh fall they hold their mouth they roll around like a baby yeah and women and when you watch women's soccer women don't do that women don't do that women do not take dives and get smashed someone needs to start a campaign maybe we can help
