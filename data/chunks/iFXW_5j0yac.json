trained my jockey podcast by night okay so you were asking me before this about the fight yeah yeah that's right yeah and we'll you think because whether I come to soccer that's what it they keep the distance well and they know accepted it this is what I think a lot of people were like pissed off it was boring but I think that's because they just want to see people beat the fuck out of each other which I understand that's why you tune into cage fighting but to me the way I always described martial arts is its high level problem solving with dire physical consequences and if you run in on tyron woodley you got some dire physical consequences he's a fucking powerhouse and if Woodley charges at Thompson just dire physical consequences because he was getting tagged when he would he need set it to me after the fight he's like he caught me a few times as I was charging towards them so Woodley has a different style that Thompson Thompson has that wide stance that karate style and he's excellent and moving in and moving out and almost like point fighting you he's just jabbing you hitting you with these clean left hands sliding out of the way occasionally throwing kicks but mostly what he's doing is making you wonder what he's going to do and when he's coming at you and Woodley how to pick his battles and figure out when he could launch himself at him so at any moment something could have happened but a lot of shit didn't happen so the people watching at home look doesn't was born forward ever it's because those moments are so critical those moments are so dangerous you can't just they would like it to be like Frankie Edgar gray Manor just fucking chaos and punches throwing wild is not going to happen like that you can't do that with wonder boy you can't charge at him like that he will fucking counter you and you look you will be one of those people on his highlight reel so tyron woodley was very smart and that he knew he couldn't charge at him and wonder boy he's not going to charge it will either I mean he gotten almost knocked the fuck out in the first fight he almost got knocked the fuck out in the fifth round the second guy to Woody's a powerhouse man he hit so goddamn hard so everybody had to be on their toes they both had to be minding their P's and Q's and that translated for a boring fight to a lot of people but not to me to me I was like anything can happen in any moment in the fifth round it almost did was there when would when Whitley connected and Thompson's knees went out I mean he slumped he was out man he was out for at least a half a second or a moment you know there was a moment where his legs gave out his body went limp and they could have stopped the fight right there I'm glad they didn't I glad they kept going I talked to Big John McCarthy in the cage after the fight ago how close we to stop without fighting goes because I wasn't close to stopping my particle but you were looking radios I was looking because I go you were looking at close because I'll never admit it I go but it was I mean he was office outright he was he was almost out he might have been out for a half a second but he I gave him a chance like he did a great job he did an amazing job I mean that's why Big John McCarthy is so important a guy with that kind of experience and if he fucked that up everybody would be so mad at them but he did it perfect wasn't perfect he has the most difficult job in the sport other than the fighters fighters have the most difficult job second most difficult job is the referee third most difficult job is the judges yeah I really so I think so yeah believe he's going to interpret it trauma yeah or the other people well he has to be he has to look he has to be at the right angle like they're moving around and they're fast and they could go to his left and he could be over here but something could be happening on their right and he doesn't even see it you know you don't know like sometimes sometimes guys don't see taps sometimes guys don't see certain eye pokes or groin shots there's a lot of things that can happen a referees job is insanely difficult and they only get praised when they fuck up or they only rather get attention when they fuck up they don't get any praise and they do a great job and just just they need more you know they need more more people need to understand like how difficult that is so that moment where tyrant finally did connect on wonderboy and everybody's like why didn't you do that earlier because you could have got knocked the fuck out like that was where the opening was Woodley was so aggressive because he was down on the scorecards at least in his corners eyes and in my eyes he was as well and he had a charge forward and he had to connect and he did but to make that happen a lot of things have to be in place you have to understand Wonderboys timing he had fighting him for four rounds already he was getting a sense of what wonder boy could and couldn't do he also knew the consequences he'd been tagged a couple of times so he knew look I can't just rush at him because wonder boy was trying to time him with that right hook he was standing in a southpaw position with his right leg forward he throws that front leg side kick to the body throws it really well because he he picks it up from the ground like low and and it sort of scoops up so you don't see it coming until it's too late it might not be the most powerful application of the front leg side kick but it's very it's very sneaky because he slides in with that foot low and then it comes up and stabs you and you don't know if it's going to come up as a side kick or if it's going to go up and over your shoulder as a round kick you don't know what he's doing he's so sneaky so Tyron had to be very cautious and for a lot of people was very boring because of that but I didn't think it was boring while it's happening I was on the edge of my seat I was like there are moments there's going to be moments when the shit starts flying and in those moments that's where the fight becomes amazing but those guys are smart it is not dumb and the belt is so goddamn important when you have the belt you get to decide you fight all the best fighters you you you you make the money you know you get the opportunities for the big money fight it's like the Conor McGregor type fights there was only happen if you have the belt if you don't the belt nobody gives a fuck about you so for a guy like the tyrant man that belt is everything for a guy like Woodley or a guy like a Wonder Boy rather that belt is everything you don't have that belt you make a fraction of what you make like think about that fight that fights insanely close it was so close Dominick Cruz afterwards said that's basically the same fight as the first fight it's like you could call if you call the first fight a draw you could easily call this fight a draw and I agree with him and so that means that wonderboy and Woodley are essentially like so closely matched stylistically that it's a wash right but meanwhile woodleigh's the one who's the champion Woodley's the one who has the potential to fight Conor McGregor Woodley is the one who has a potential to fight Michael Bisping well who else he fights at whatever weight he fights at and that is where the money is so he's the guy was going to get the money whereas Wonder Boys you essentially had a draw with him proved that he was at least close enough on one fight and just hair under the second fight team ah he's going to make a fraction of what Woodley makes likely so that those consequences have to be taken into consideration when you're watching these guys fight is that they know there's a wind bonus and there's a loss like if you if you lose you get your show money you don't get a bonus if you win you get twice the money like a lot of guys have that way their contract is structured you'll they'll make X if they win and they'll make X plus X if they'll make X plus X if they win but if they lose they only make X so they might have they might be getting $200,000 for the fight but another $200,000 if they win that's a giant swing that's a big deal so they have to be really fucking careful they don't make mistakes I don't like win bonuses man I don't like it I think those guys are trying to win anyway they're trying to win I just I just think like especially in particular in situations like that when fights are like that fucking close like a judge can decide whether or not you make an extra 200 grand or don't like that seems crazy to me [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
