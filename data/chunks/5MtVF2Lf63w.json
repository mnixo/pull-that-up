hello freak bitches I find you know like I said Wanderlei probably one of my all-time favorite guys to watch because you see was pure chaos but I find that people like yourself oftentimes make really good analysts because like you're a guy who was like looking at fighting at whether it's MMA stand up on the ground whatever it was you're looking at it at this very analytical level it's for me it's like asking questions men's am one of my boxing coach's Kenny Weldon used to say that when I fought Aaron the second time he watched the fight after the fact and he was like I was like so what do you think Kenny goes that kid has a lot of questions it's like what do you mean he has a lot of questions he's like every time you do something you're asking him a question and then I'm sorry every time he does something he's asking you a question and you're answering him with him I'm gonna do this and what are you gonna do about what I'm doing and he's just asking me why are you doing that why are you doing that so he's like he's saying he's asking all the questions but he has no answers so he's asking me questions I'm giving him answers and um I think that's kind of how I watch fights or how I fought I would try to do something and see what you're doing because of that yeah you know you kind of play with that and feel it and and that's how I watch other people fight i watch when i watch guys fight I'm like what is he doing why is he doing that is he trying to set something up this guy gonna realize that guy gonna react to that what's he gonna do about him what's he gonna do about his strengths he knows he's coming in with these strengths so how is he gonna try to take those things away or is he just gonna try impose his own strengths I for me that's what fighting is it's be making yourself as comfortable as you can be at all times while making the other guy as uncomfortable as he can be for me that's what I try to look at and I try to see if guys play like that how are they gonna play that game yeah that completely makes sense that you had that kind of style would that approach you know I just always admired the way you would set things up you always had a real technical style fight which like I said I'm Meyer chaos - I admire those Melvin Manhoef dudes - you I admire Vandelay like maybe more than anybody just cuz he was so wild to watch but I found I find that for analysis like Dominic Cruz is another guy I think knocks it out of the park because he's so he's so smart in his assessment of risk and reward and putting yourself in a position where your opponent doesn't exactly know what you're gonna do but you know how he's going to react because you're you have this awkward style that you've seen other people react to for a long time but for them it's like this new thing they're standing in front this guy who's switching stances and bouncing and moving up and down and back and forth and you're not exactly sure what the fuck he's doing but he knows what you're gonna do yeah because he's so used to doing it to regular people like everybody who stands like you know like certain guys they have that like Muay thai-style and god there's so much that they're giving a guy in that situation and when you got a guy like Dominick Cruz like he's not predictable at all he's like flipping stances and moving around and throwing punches from these weird fucking angles where you would swear he's doing it wrong right yeah it's for me I always look at the way someone explains something to me as as the easiest way to explain it and that Askren Tyron said Ben likes to cause scrambles right that's what Dom does yeah he's causing scrambles on the feet because he's he's not in a traditional position he's not he's not coming at you like everybody else does so what he's doing is initiating a scramble right away when you're when you get a guy on top of you like RDA and he's good at establishing position if you can create a scramble then you have a better chance of getting out then if you that if you just try to use basic technique and Dominic is comfortable in those scrambles he he's been in them so many times when you react you have like three or four reactions but he has like 22 damn you know he did a great breakdown kirik from the underground cured Genesis yeah he see if we could find that he put it up today he put up an article breaking down all the variables of Dominik Cruz's footwork really interesting stuff because you don't see it as a list yeah like all the different things he does and Kirk did an awesome job of of just sort of breaking down all the different things in his fights and it just makes you realize like wow that guy's got a lot of options man like someone was I think it was Ludwig was saying that he doesn't think he has good technique of planking how can you say that dog because he'll and so many punches like how can you say it like it might not look like everybody else's but goddamn it's working I mean it works it's crazy how effective it is see this is all the stuff in that Kirk wrote down all the different stuff that Dominic does pretty interesting right yeah neo footwork is what people are calling it right it's like TJ Dillashaw style he's got a very interesting style too and I hit paths with Dwayne recently Dwayne showed me some stuff and one of the things he's doing is all these switch stances he's doing like these you're switching and throwing punches as you're switching he's got a lot of this switch stance stuff that he's really incorporating into these combinations and you see it a lot from TJ I mean TJ is as comfortable from a southpaw as he is from an Orthodox and he's doing a lot of these switch moves like they're they're hitting pads with these and they're very confusing you know so remember when when I said I don't like that style at Genki sudo style hmm because not because but Dominick style that style I think is the style to beat that the reason I say that is because the way Dominic is approaching it he's approaching it from educated I would say more educated more studious place hmm these guys are approaching it from trying to get you to buy the wolf ticket you know so they're they're giving you these weird looks because that's gonna make you get off balance again I'd stand there for them be the guy that's just the target but DOM is giving you these looks from a fighting perspective he's always in position to fight those guys when you're when you're breakdancing sometimes you're not in position to react DOM is always in position to react and that's why I think that style is the style that beats the other style 10 out of 10 times what's really interesting is I don't recall anybody before Dominick Cruz doing it like that I really don't it it's a lot of what I mean it's limited but Muhammad Ali did a lot of things like that with his boxing you know yeah the rope-a-dope and his footwork that that's that's a part of it that's a part of what Dom does Dom does it for MMA so he has to be aware the kicks tie ups and clinches I mean how many times you see guys press Dom on the fence yeah almost never never very rarely [Music]
