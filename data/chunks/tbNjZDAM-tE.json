four three two hello Kyle hello Joe Rogan good to see you again buddy good to see you too is is like deja vu you know was I think it was eight months ago or so then I was on the podcast wasn't it and it flew like that yeah it does fly like that yeah that's kinda scary a little too quick yeah I just turned 30 and in 40 before you know it well I was gonna say 30 was the first one where I ever really stopped like 30 minutes before I turned 30 actually took a moment and I was like okay you're 29 enjoy your last 30 minutes of being 29 and when I hit 30 it was the first like little inkling of is it I guess this is kind of what a midlife crisis feels like because I'm I have a 3 in front now and I'm not really not comfortable with that because I feel like I'm still a fucking 19 year old hmm you know well it's a weird thing to be obsessed with your your it's an inevitable progression like to be obsessed with youth yeah I love being in my 20s well why would you love something that's gonna go away real quick yeah it's just gonna get old there's nothing you can do about it just stay healthy yeah and people who fight it it's always easy to tell yeah that when they go get plastic surgery and stuff if you if you do like one plastic surgery sometimes somebody could get away with it but if you do multiple well everybody knows almost immediately you ever watch that show botched I didn't know I just started getting into it I accidentally watched it I turned the TV on and it was just on like when I turn the TV on and I was like what in the fuck and this lady was getting her nose repaired because it had collapsed cuz she had gotten so many plastic surgeries on her nose that her sinus had caved in so they had to take a chunk of her rib crop up her nose and but then then the tissue inside was dying one of those guys wants to come on they found out we were talking about it so he wants to fucked up what's the doctor gonna try to do pitcher audience on getting pleasure we're just gonna know the opposite I think oh yes a repair guy so what shows about repairing people that fucked up you know it looks so primitive to when you see how they do it like the way that they do I noticed this about wisdom teeth when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out they literally just go in there like you would expect for like a car repair there sorry all right time to rip it out and you see them like leaning on it pulling it and you're like oh I thought this was more advanced than this but it's really not and they step on your cheek I actually went under for my wisdom teeth because I've heard I know I'm such a bitch but I thought so I guess I got the Michael Jackson stuff the propofol I think it was I was it was a nice it's weird because you just they tell you to like count back down from 100 and you're like 199 and I'm this stop it oh my god that's so terrible that's a new surgery yeah what is going on here what stop whatever the fuck put in his knee man and he's trying to get it out oh my Jesus oh Christ so yeah the the moral of the story is we actually don't know what we're doing as human beings and we're still obviously very primitive even the advanced stuff is super primitive that's what that shows well I don't know maybe that guy just fucked up ever seen that before but isn't it for everything like even with nose jobs don't they do the same thing like oh we're gonna chisel down the nose so they have to take like a frickin sander or something just do it yeah I had my deviated septum fixed and then they have to pack it they pack it full of stuff and so you're all clogged up and they took big chunks of the bone out of the inside because what does they call it turbinates or something like that I had a bunch of scar tissue and calcification you ever sees when someone that's cauliflower ear yes yeah fighters usually you get that in your nose too if your nose has been broken a bunch of times what what that cauliflower ear is is blood under the surface of the skin calcifies and it becomes essentially a rock if you touch someone's califor it's literally like there's a rock in there it's really kind of crazy well you get that inside your nose too when your nose have been broken a bunch of times and it bleeds in the skin inside the issue and then it turns into this like really hard thing that blocks all your sinuses so if you put a hole in it what happens it's a rock it's a rock okay it's calcium rock have you ever seen those videos of like cysts when they drain the cysts do you ever see that lady's Instagram page dr. pimp no because I don't want to throw up she's great she's hilarious too she like she loves it she thinks and fun I bet she gets as iliyan views too oh my god she's got more Instagram followers than me I think how many she got nine while she doesn't have as many as me but she is a lot did you ever have bad acne at any point in life I had some pretty decent a cursor on try that one that one looks like they're gonna nightmare ones let's find some other ones Jamie the look of that is disgusting but I think it's universally agreed upon that the feel of getting a big pimple and popping it properly it feels amazing can you stop yeah he's got a bulging oh my god again again you'll be fine oh just one eating these cysts yeah that's like the side of someone's head weight and it didn't even actually like totally pop out either well those things are stuck I mean it's part of your skin it's part of your tissue I used to have pretty bad acne when I was younger and I had accutane they gave me accutane mm-hmm and that stuff worked I mean they say that there's oh a small chance that like I guess in maybe 1% or 0.01% of cases some people got depression and so they said there's a risk of suicide with this but I never it never affected me in that way at all and it really just like zonk's your sebaceous glands and you're just good like it's almost a cure yeah my friend Andrew Santino got it for the same reason but he said he got the side-effect you know we did yeah on one hand it was amazing because his skin cleared up the other hand he's never felt so bad in his life Wow yeah but you don't know what to do because you feel bad if you have acne feel bad if you take the medication but the medication will knock out all the acne well I also take I don't take accutane anymore but I actually take finasteride for hair and they say Trump takes that too and then there were some doctors I don't know how credible this is but there were some doctors who were like that stuff is not that great in terms of mental health no that's propecia propecia yeah and the same thing same thing in inhibits dihydrotestosterone which does cause depression in some people I think yeah ari Ari said that his depression was linked to when he started taking propecia yeah yeah I take it I don't I have never it's never affected me that way it decreases your testosterone no it kills your boners well would they be if you didn't take it I guess double or triple you tell me I don't know but the thing is I wouldn't look I feel like you really pull off a bald head very nicely thank you whereas I'd look like a leukemia patient do you think so I do decent-sized head dude I mean look come on I wouldn't look at all first of all I would have to go to the gym way more than I do now and I have to get tattoos everywhere yeah if you want to look like a badass with a bald head of course you do there's this guy there's this wrestler for w/e I forget his name but he had really long like greasy hair like the typical wrestler hair and then he recently decided to shave his head and he pulled it off nicely he looks way better with a bald head he had he's just one of those guys where you looked gross with the really long hair that was greasy but when you got when you went bald okay now you look normal that greasy hair is a new thing it's like the John wick hair grease eNOS in the hair yeah when remember when Keanu Reeves was John wick it was always greasy I don't remember that no it's good movie to listen to or watch rather when you're on the treadmill this is doing a cardio challenge a breeze a good one tad greasy but it's gel it seems like gel people make fun of me because gel they say is so like 1990s and I'm still wearing it mmm creature of habit it's just Joe yes available what people would make funny and for everything that's true yeah give him a chance dude I did powder on my face the other day because I was under these lights and I did feel silly as I put it on it's a little weird like why can't I just be shiny yeah yeah what's going on people terrified of sweat yeah the problem to me was pasty and shiny so super white and shiny and it just looked gross it looks like I'm unhealthy so if you're like a bronze a bronze that's slightly better but still kind of gross so you were saying that you got into it well you asked Chris Christie something oh yeah pull it on Politico and what is politican saying it's like comic-con for political dorks exactly that's exactly correct yeah and it's weird because what they do Joe is they invite like like establishment media figures and some politicians but then they also invite new media figures like me and our worlds do not mix yeah yeah so in fact many of them I don't even think many of them knew who I was meanwhile when you actually go to the people who were there you know it was all the new media people who are getting the most attention right where you have guys like Bill Kristol walking around who was in the Bush administration and people are like who-who are you mmm so it's a very weird you know thing going on there well kudos to them for recognizing that new media has such a place yeah it's just media I mean at this point I think that yeah this whole concept of new media versus all be it's just media yeah there's independent uncensored untethered media which is why we're more popular yeah of course yeah try watching one of those ABC Nightline or one of those fucking political shows terrible and then try watching something on YouTube where people get to be free with their language and free with their expression that beholden to any executives or producers and yeah so they get it but they don't get it get it because when I went to the chris Christie thing they had it in this giant room and about 25% of the room was full and then for one of my debates that I did I did a few panels but one debate they put me in like the smallest room and we had all the seats full and people standing up and packing the room so they get it but they don't get it get it they talk to them the new media people are kind of like afterthought like okay we'll have them cuz you know they should be here they don't they don't realize that the draw is not chris christie the draws the new media people well chris christie and that's not just me but i just wanna clear governor anymore he's not i mean like who is he why would they think that he we could fill a place because he's been on TV a lot but i want to be clear I'm not even just saying Oh left-wing new media which obviously is what I would be but even the ben shapiro types of course he has a big audience when he comes he's got a giant yes exactly yeah but it's so it's all the new media people who are popular and the rest of them are not did you go to some sort of concert while you're there this is how you got in the building without them giving you a hard time no I just haven't I didn't think about snipping it off yet but now swishing I did cuz we're talking about it there's some dorks that go to Coachella and they keep that fucking thing yeah yeah no this is this is coming off soon I'll tell you not scared take that big-ass knife well I'll cut off a finger by accident if I use that thing just so everybody knows this is what I'm talking about Jamie just gave you a pair of scissors if you want oh yeah I'll do it so anyway don't take it off under pressure me if you want to actually I'm not I'm not a bracelet guy in the first place no that's a weird thing to be a bracelet guy yeah like a lot of beads like you're really trying hard to be spiritual there we go yeah and that's not me or ice if you want to diamond it up if you're rapper and you know a lot of ice on your wrist I did used to wear earrings I did used to do that and I see in your face that you want to mock me at this - I had earrings oh you did yeah you probably had the old 90s hoop earrings I had a hoop and I had a diamond stud but it wasn't even a diamond it was a cubic zirconia yeah and has it ever happened in the history of the world that you know a woman has walked up to a man and said to a man you know I wasn't attracted to you but then I saw your earring hmm probably happened in the eighties somebody probably doesn't like that in the eighties just just cuz you're you're so bold you got a hole in your ear took a chance yeah I guess that has like counterculture vibe to it there you go hearing little cutie man you had a babyface know the other things just to earpiece sorry got here that's a hook that's the thing so you only had one on one ear yeah the left-hand side didn't go like full rock star with a double hoops like Axl Rose word on the street is that if you only do the right ear you're supposed to be a signal that you're gay that was the word at 1 grant in time oh is that true or is that just people talking shit oh I don't know I had it on my left ear because that's what I had heard you you could do both and that's not considered gay but if you did the right ear alone that was considered gay but if you did both you either a pirate or you're in a band it has both at one point and it's funny because when people see old pictures of me they say I either look like the Jersey like a Jersey Shore wannabe or like a Backstreet Boys wanted me because I look like because I had the earrings in and I had the hair totally spiked and yeah that was the style at the time well you're also running a risk because you've got like a little bit of facial hair yeah yeah I don't very masculine no a beard but yeah got something going on it's just Liam man or your almond undergoing hormone replacement therapy got that Chaz Bono type thing it's this is called a lazy man's beard because I can't even even really grow a beard so it's just this is what it is when I get lazy you got a little something going on though yeah I guess so maybe it's the finasteride but if you just had the moustache itself that would be kind of creepy no mustaches I'm going on a jihad against mustaches because I think for whatever reason they look more ridiculous than full facial hair I don't know what I'm people like like Sam Elliot the actor I don't know who that is I know I know Tom Selleck okay I've seen roadhouse but which guy is in row Sam Elliot everybody knows oh my yeah but he's got the whole mom but he's got the fucking mustache what a man but the grandpa vibe going on well he didn't always go to Roadhouse go to look at that Sam Elliott Rose yeah but he's a great voice nobody's blowing him because he has a mustache don't blow his fucking game arias look at that come on yeah I mean we love it with the hair right no there are there that's him in row down yeah but that's a full beard that's more of a full beard that's true and that looks better on him mmm I don't know look at that oh come on now I don't think a go to that maybe that one right there I don't think a goatee looks as ridiculous as a mustache alone some guys can pull it off you know it's a bold choice but it can't look you can't look overly artsy with it you know what I mean you can't or you can no you can't if you're if it looks like you're tied to your goatee as a matter of your identity then it's a problem but if it's just a dude who seems like he's rocking a goatee cuz he just decided one day to rock a goatee that's all right you know what kind of died out the old patch the soul patch yeah I haven't seen one of those in forever yeah that kind of went away did you ever have any facial hair no just beards just beards I grew it way out at one point in time because there was a guy named Evan Tanner who was an MMA fighter that was known for having a big thick crazy beard he was a really interesting guy and he really nice guy too and he died in he went on sort of a walkabout and decided to go in Death Valley and camp out and he ran out of water I couldn't find his water oh my god what up dying from heat and a lot of us were pretty broken up about it so a bunch of people on mine decided to grow out our beards for a certain amount of months that's me with a full beard Wow so you get a almost you could get a caveman beard going if you wanted oh yeah I get a full beard yeah and that's me trimming around the cheeks because my shit creeps all the way up to my nostrils yeah yeah yeah I grew that out for a couple months I forget how long we decided to grow you know what are you doing wasn't that was when he wanted to play Robert Shapiro's didn't he do that for the oj movie I feel like it was yeah that this verifies every single you know whisper about John Travolta tickle a ball tickle is just it's right there for tickling balls oh oh anyway so the chris Christie thing yeah so in Politico and he's with it what was he doing exactly there you are yeah you want you could play it if you want okay place yeah Kyle questions Chris Christie [Applause] keep on Zephyrs I just want explain that to Joe I don't know if you know what I'm referencing there but during the Republican primary there was one debate where chris Christie just totally destroyed Marco Rubio's chances of becoming president because he kept repeating himself over and over given the same talking points and Chris Christie pointed that out and then Marco Rubio did it again and Chris Christie was like there he goes again there he goes again and the room exploded and it was that interaction where everybody were Rubio tanked in the polls and finished him off so my strategy with Christie was I'm gonna start this off to disarm him and then I'm gonna hit him with his giant problems epidemiology store studies and he should know that for sure epidemiology studies you know you're basically questionnaires you know you don't take into account all sorts of other issues that these people do in their lives and also like when you're dealing with those kind of studies a person could be doing marijuana but also be drinking a lot but also be doing other things so if what the argument is that it's a gateway drug the only way that argument works is if you somehow or another tracked someone and saw that marijuana made them change their opinion on doing other drugs because a lot of these people are just doing drugs yeah and they do Merrill as well say look we've showed through these through these epidemiology studies that marijuana is a gateway drug because they started smoking marijuana and then they went to do heroin they probably gonna do heroin anyway yeah exactly that's really what's going on sure there's no fucking gateway drug that whole idea has been dismissed that's like saying water is a gateway drug to rape drinks water you know really is the almost that stupid so do you think that when there was a little bit of applause cuz he answered me quickly yeah do you think that that beginning of the applause was for my question or for him saying no I wasn't sure you know clearly he's got a food addiction his food addiction is far more dangerous than marijuana marijuana on its own has killed no one ever half a million people die every year from being a fat fuck that's that's the facts yeah this guy is a part of a real death epidemic and if you were mean you would bring that up this motherfucker brings a fucking bank robber sized bag of M&Ms to a football game I mean he's ridiculous he's ridiculous talking about marijuana and marijuana being a gateway drug the whole idea of it is stupid like smoked marijuana or don't smoke marijuana but the point is marijuana doesn't kill you it's really that simple now if you're saying that marijuana causes you to do all sorts of other things you've got to have some direct pathway yeah that shows that it changes your inhibitions it changes the way you think about things that's never been done if anything what gets people to try drugs is when you tell them that marijuana is dangerous and then they smoke marijuana I go this is Shane dangerous Jeremy I feel great the next day is nothing wrong all dizzy to pizza you know I got a gaggle I watched a bunch of cartoons my friends we had a great fucking time that is the disinformation aspect of it is more dangerous than the idea that it's a cape some sort of a gateway I agree with all of that now I wanted to pounce when he said that but you have to understand this was his Town Hall so I knew that I was first of all I was gonna be shoved to the side very quickly anyway because there was a whole big line behind me I'd be wrong about people clapping they might have really said it was wrong I'm sure some of the people in the room were there to see him and they'd agree with him because it was his Town Hall but I wanted a pounce but I knew I can't really go back and forth like it's a debate so what I did is whenever I knew I could interject just a little bit I pushed him on it and you're gonna see that in a weird background with like a bird so he actually changed his position slightly because when he ran for president he said not only am i against marijuana being legal at a federal level I wouldn't even let the individual states decide whether or not they want legal marijuana so in other words he would prosecute the states like Colorado and California that have legal marijuana using federal law and right there he softened his position slightly and he said well leave it up to the states and let them decide so don't you think that's because he knows he'll never be President no I think he still wants to be President there's no fucking way I think he's gonna run again no I don't know if he's gonna run in 2020 but 2024 first of all the odds of that guy's gonna make it eight more years with that FairPoint morbidly obese carcass he's moving his band around with didn't he get a stapler did he get his stomach fuckin suit you know somebody pointed that out I didn't know that I never saw those stories I'm not denying that it's true but I just never heard it but if he did didn't work well I had a friend who ate through two of those he when you're a date that's what I'm saying anyway about food he's addicted to food that's like this is unquestionably he's an addict do you think nobody said that to him in his life or no look look how much thinner you got okay okay and he did this oh I guess he did this before the presidential race because he wanted to mm make it but then he got fat again yeah mm-hmm so he was rotund before he was like a bag of water before and then you know he he trimmed himself down yeah and it's funny because I don't think in any way he realizes the hypocrisy of having his own you know issue with food and he would argue hey man listen how many would I want it's a freedom choice when it comes to freedom for somebody to decide to tweak their consciousness slightly all of a sudden he says you shouldn't be allowed to do that well that's where it's preposterous the idea that you mean even with what he said about alcohol didn't make any sense like would you mean alcohol illegal well we tried already it's called prohibition okay but let's pretend that you had some sort of an ability to keep that from you know going sideways again let's start from the beginning would you want alcohol to be legal or not if you could wave your hand and there would be no more problems that are alcohol associated would you do that and make it illegal versus give a grown adult the possibility of deciding whether or not they want to drink or not drink yeah he's not being consistent in his logic that's the point is that he's willing to say I'm thinking about Donuts but he even he even mentioned prohibition there but that makes my point not his point yes because that's when the Mafia got incredibly powerful because you pushed all the alcohol sales underground and they got all the power and the money as a result of it and that's when crime has shot through the roof so if you want to decrease violent crime and the drug war yeah I mean look talk to people in Mexico I mean the United States and our hunger for illegal drugs is a reason why the cartel got so huge yeah when we were kids when I was in high school there was no Mexican cartel yeah it was never discussed it was not an issue there was no discussion whatsoever about violence from Mexico that is an incredibly recent thing in fact I did MTV Spring Break I want to say it was back in 2002 I was hosting this Spring Break thing for MTV when Fear Factor was just on the air and it was like one of those publicity things that we did and there was no worries about going to Mexico Mexico back then was nothing it was just like hey we're going to Mexico okay cool it's like hey we're gonna go to New Mexico was no different yeah you know and now it's like you're going to Mexico heard about the gangs what about the violence what about the cartel people would go to Tijuana all the time and you would worry because it was seedy and crazy and you know a lot of ups pickpockets and thieves but it was never cartel violence cartel violence is literally within the last 15 years or so and our strategy had the opposite of the effect they wanted so you get rid of El Chapo and you think okay it's the decapitation strategy we got rid of the top guy now we're good but what happened is you had his cartel became fractionalized and then you had people fighting who were top officials in his cartel and they both wanted to become the head guy and so then there's a war between those guys and their gangs in the street so it's the exact opposite of what they say they want which is let's decrease the violence and make make sure everything's running peacefully and also an amazing fact that I just learned about a few weeks ago there are 200,000 deaths that have happened as a result of the drug war 200,000 that's crazier in America know the u.s. and Mexico that seems low do you think that's low I thought that was so high I mean I guess because it's been going on since Reagan you know one would think okay it's way more Nixon I'm sorry Nixon not Reagan right but that was like inside the United States but I mean like how do you classify a like what was done because of the drug war you'd have to go with all the stuff that happened in Vietnam with heroin I mean how many people were killed should say include via I think this is just for the US and Mexico and I think it's tied to what we were talking about the cartel violence and then people get caught in the crossfire and they get their lives destroyed it still seems low to me yeah and it's a over a trillion dollars has been wasted on this I'd be interested in talking to some who is an expert okay get Chris Christie on but it was a real expert on Mexico and what happened with the cartels the rise the cartels because I'm sure there was always organized violence and organized crime but like what happened where it exploded to the point where I mean I was just talking to a friend of mine who said he won't go to Mexico I'm like I've been to Mexico man Mexico was great I was talking about Punta Mita you ever go to Punta me now it's beautiful it's like near Puerto Vallarta it's gorgeous so beautiful but we were sticking we were staying at a resort and I was with my family and they have these golf carts that you can drive around the resort on and we said let's go to the town let's go see what that there's a town right outside of the resort let's go see what it's like you go out of the resort in a block you hit a military station where there's men that are standing by on armored vehicles so I said to my wife I said do you know why they're there and they're there to guard the resort I know that's what this is she's like you really think so I know I know so why are they standing here on top of this they have a pull these like steel plates with machine guns these guys have flak jackets on and they're standing there on top of these military vehicles standing there like they're ready they're on standby this fucking thing is right outside the gates of the Four Seasons yeah this is what this is scary yeah they're there to make sure that they protect their tourism industry yeah and that's all directly tied to the drug war well the drug war has had a massive impact on our cocoa acapulco used to play be the place where everybody would go they said the Vegas of Mexico if they were trying to rival Vegas and now that's where they say there's mega cartel violence they don't even just call them cartels now I would say there are mega cartels they're fighting for more power well then not only that there's been some violence where they purposely killed people that were staying in resorts to sort of send a message like oh my goodness yeah and there's dead politicians too where they they found these mass graves did you hear about that every now and then they'll stumble across a 200-person mass grave and then whoever's not being killed they're usually being bribed by the cartels so some experts have said this is a narco-state at this point I'm curious what this new guy's gonna do because this new guys supposed to be Anti Corruption and hopefully I don't know what his position is on the drug war but I'd be surprised if his position was not hey let's find another way to do this because now world opinion has shifted I mean in the u.s. 62 percent of the country says less legalized marijuana yeah and that's and honestly I think people are thinking that without even realizing that there's a giant spike in crime because it's illegal yeah they don't even know yeah I agree and they're also killing journalists in Mexico yeah they're killing police there's a lot of people that are dying in Mexico because of cartel violence you know we were talking about that Jamal khashoggi guy yeah before the plant got started and how disturbing this whole thing is and the the plot for folks who don't know what we're talking about Phil people in okay sure so Jamal khashoggi is a journalist who actually worked for the Washington Post and he went into the Saudi embassy in Turkey to get a marriage license in his stand ball to get a marriage license for him and his wife and he never got out they killed him dismembered him used a bone saw and then they even went as far as to cover it up where they had a body double go in and they gave him a fake beard and they had him wear his clothes and walk out is there video the body no there is there is in fact CNN had it I know yesterday I was looking at the CNN video that had it so yes audio Rabia now brazenly killing journalists and I'll tell you what she came up with a bunch of different versions of the story tow yeah but while they did it here's the body there you go there's him and then the guy on the right with hair why would they have a guy with hair as a body double think about how much this had to be planned out to have a body double right but why did they give the body double you bubble hey if you're gonna be a body double shave your head dude the other guys bald that's crazy so they didn't even do a good job at faking their murder but it's the worst fake ever yeah cuz the guy's got a full head of hair yeah it's not great no terrible house shoes on too he had different shoes yeah I mean that's that's the worst body double it's get dark hair and they're saying this is a guy look he's fine walking around no issues it's a body double not here double I mean if you're gonna have a body doubles shave the guy's fucking heads I walked in those different shirt and everything oh that's a body double yeah so his hair colors different too I mean he's got dark hair this guy's got gray hair the thing that's driving me nuts about this is so now this is getting a lot of press attention and I'm happy it's getting a lot of press attention of course but the reason why it is is because he's part of the elite class in the sense that he's a journalist so now you have the people from the New York Times and The Washington Post in Siena and they can relate and they go oh my god they're killing journalists now this is crazy look at the precedent that this sets but when people don't know is for the past two or three years Saudi Arabia has been waging a literal genocide in Yemen and that's not an exaggeration so they've blockaded the country to not allowing in medicine there's a cholera epidemic happening there millions of people are sick they have people dying of starvation because they're not allowing in food or humanitarian aid they're bombing hospitals they're bombing schools they're bombing open-air markets so they're doing a literal genocide and that got very little coverage but then with this journalist now finally starting to get some coverage but I'm curious what happens moving forward in terms of how will the u.s. respond to it because as I'm sure you already know this I mean they care more about that 110 billion dollar weapons deal that they just had with the Saudis than they do about the lives of Yemenis or the lives of journalists yeah the the idea of him being really valuable is not it's not just that he's a part of the elite it's that there was a conspiracy to do so that they think came from up on high yeah right and there was 15 people that they're saying Pheo in from Saudi Arabia and one of them was a forensics expert who like knows how to cover up evidence knows what evidence is what's like a move it feels like a movie did the bone saw thing is that being confirmed they know that well a bone saw I heard that now the nickname for him in Washington DC is what would they say bone saw Salman his name is Mohammed bin Salman they're calling him bone saw Solomon or something like that yeah dude it is the stuff that's going on is just scary to me and then there's also some interesting geopolitical stuff happening around this the head of Turkey is now using this as an issue to try to snuggle up to the u.s. because he's got ambitions where he wants to like recreate the ottoman empire and of course Mohammed bin Solomon he has ambitions where he wants to dominate the the Middle East so you have at the same time this weird ego battle between air Dhawan and Mohammed bin Salman and they're all trying to suck up to the u.s. to you know basically get it so that we do favors for them and we allow them to expand oh and on top of that the the story's changed multiple times right it's okay we've won five times yes they said nothing happened to them to him then they said we hide out fight yeah and now they're saying that he was killed by people who overstepped their bounds that's right yeah they keep changing the story there's also stories that the the consulate has video and audio evidence of the murder that's what Turkey saying yeah but they don't want to release it because then people will know how they're spying on them when they visit the consulate I guess so I didn't see that but I'll take your word for it yeah that was see if you can find that that was one of the things that was brought up yesterday that they don't want to release this video and audio evidence because if they do then other people will know how they're spying on them when they visit yeah I could see that I mean they should immediately cut off the arms deal with Saudi Arabia no more weapons for a regime that's doing the stuff that they're doing and we already knew that they behead people in the public square for sorcery sorcery do they really yes for sorcery for witchcraft you know Rojas to see for drug smuggling that baby had people in the public square for those things well the drug smuggling that's a real problem but you don't want any sorcery don't want sorcery man did you ever watch that movie dr. strange look you can get out of your Strangelove I think I know dr. strange never seen Marvel Comics character yeah there was a movie in 2017 he's one of the Avengers you know who dr. strange dude I have another thing I'm waging jihad on our a comic book based movies and I'll tell you a lot of dislikes for that but so be it you didn't like black pen no I you know I about cancer I did not buy racist you must be racist you got me bro you got me I didn't see what Con defragment actually the last one I saw was Batman which the Christian Bale one and just the voice alone the voice alone I said fuck this like it I couldn't stand it I said that so fake happiness but my brother-in-law made a good point he was like yeah but he's playing Batman and that's even more fake than the voice so why is it the voice that turns you off to it but I don't know I just have a weird thing with superheroes because if we know what's gonna happen the superhero swoops in and say today yay it's true I'm gonna live give me something interesting but the New Avengers movie had a lot of twists and turns okay like the Hulk couldn't be the Hulk even one who's getting angry I'm not gonna see it so they spoiled is what it fucked up the movie the fucked up the movie because the Hulk couldn't be the honk why the fuck do you have the Hulk if he can't be though wait I'm lying I saw the The Hulk with with Edward Norton was he the Hulk in one of the movies he was the Hulk way back when I saw that one too yeah Ruffalo's the Hulk now right I call him Buffalo Mark Buffalo yeah cuz why not he's he's a real bonus he's an activist but he's certainly very vocal yeah I don't know much about him I just know I call him Buffalo why cuz why not it's funny I laugh at it that's all that matters okay well for you that's all that matters um he's that guy's always tweeting about political stuff and social issues yeah it seems like very progressive very open-minded or at least very active sure mm-hmm constantly talking about stuff yeah yeah you know I just don't know anything about Mark Ruffalo so I can add nothing of substance can't be the Hulk and still be that guy I don't know it's one of my favorite superheroes so he was the Hulk to Buffalo he's the new Hulk no he's the new hope yeah he's been the Hulk for the last few years don't you hate how Hollywood just recycles the same stuff over and over well the crazy thing to me is spider-man this has been like 80 spider-man and whenever a guy gets famous being spider-man he's like hey I'd like a little more money they'd go fuck you yeah make a new spider-man yeah but they'd go with the Surefire things that they know will make money yeah and that's the superhero stuff well you could definitely relaunch spider-man and the Hulk till the cows come home and I guess Batman too but the ben affleck batman people like yeah gee that's another one I would never want to not bad Affleck that's the fucking that's the no doing Superman again now oh thank god yeah you know what if I was a woman right now I'd be pissed where's the goddamn Catwoman movies huh where's superwoman why is there not woman has there not been a Catwoman or Supergirl assed time there was a Catwoman yeah there'll be another one give it time they need to much percentage and women are getting discriminated against in the world of superhero movies there's only Wonder Woman she's hot it's fucking half-naked who played Wonder Woman gal gadot oh that's the Israeli something wasn't she in the IDF she was an Israeli military I think she was yeah she Marquez who was just here Marcus brown sure he was he was showing how she got busted she was doing some campaign for huawei phones and she tweeted it using an iPhone see that I hate that man I would only push a product that I really agree with and believe it I am Emma's friend who was doing Samsung commercials and the entire time he was using an iPhone and he was like if they catch me using an iPhone they will fire me and I don't care I'm using a fucking iPhone so he had his iPhone and the Samsung phone but he never used the Samsung phone all his friends you would text everyone everything you would do we do on the iPhone why wouldn't they just hire somebody who loves Samsung and is popular because they could do that it's better yet they should just looks it's not like Santa this was a long time ago though I want to say that that this was probably six five or six years ago and back then the phones were not as good like yeah court was a big difference between the iPhone and Android phones now there's not really that much of a difference yeah they're both pretty fucking awesome yeah and I think that they just hire someone who's got some fucking integrity and doesn't lie yeah mm-hmm yeah how about that yeah I'm kind of married to iPhone by default because I've been stuck with this since the iPhone 4 yeah and I'm just too lazy to like cuz I don't even know exactly which things transfer over if I were to go to a totally new phone you know what I mean like obviously nothing almost but what about my number would they be able to that with my number at least or no no no really even your number would be a giant issue because you're married to the right chat or I'm message and that I message thing we were talking about in the last podcast that I bought a pixel and I tried to switch over to a pixel from an iPhone and my text messages wouldn't go through and I because everyone was texting me using an iMessage and it wasn't sending it to a pixel it was so it will turn to text hist then send you nope nope well they're basically making it incredibly difficult for you to switch so I even called up Apple and have them take out my email from their system because I know my emails attach the iMessage so take this out for the system kill my iMessage just kill the whole system still wouldn't work I haven't want up going back to Apple make you mother I don't know how because I know you've spoken about it many times how you're kind of a techie in the sense that you always get like the new phones and stuff careful with that No one of the dumbest techies that's ever walked the planet I'm into stuff I like stuff but I don't it's like a guy who really likes cars but has zero idea how they work yeah sure that's pretty that's me yeah but you still go through the the hassle of ordering it and yes yeah that seems like a pain in the ass I would use the same phone for 10 years if I could hmm yeah it's just not something I think of what do I use it for I use it to text people and every now and then call and that's it I am fascinated by technology you know I'm always interested in where it's going and what what they've got going on next and now and what's the latest augmented reality is fascinating mmm we were talking about that that's really interesting because that's supposed to be the next big thing right and how you know we could cease it because the phone I have it's a not a new new iPhone but you could do augmented reality games so I could look like they're building blocks in the middle of this table and play a game where you know whatever charges I remember when Pokemon was hot and people were driving down the street playing Pokemon in their car that's right they were driving crashing into trees and shit yeah yeah I remember that I use it when I was a kid I loved Pokemon Pokemon came and went so quick the point where everyone was using Pokemon for like months yeah and then it stopped you're talking about the new one yeah yeah I'm talking about when it was on a Game Boy right I used to as a kid and then if you go back like I tried to turn it on maybe two years ago to just see what it's like it is the shittiest most a basic game ever yeah it's pretty wack it's pretty wack in comparison yes in what it showed me when people really got into that Pokemon game is that people of people are very easily amused and it's easy to turn them on to some new latest trend yeah and this latest trend being what did you have to do you have to go out and get things what were the pokey yeah you had to walk to where there were Pokemon who are gonna fight you and then you would I think fight them and then if you beat them you have them in your collection that's from all your video game but not the newest one you know you fight them would use so my understanding is you go into the app and by the way people could be make fun of your antics I could be wrong right and you're walking around with the phone and you say okay down the corner and make a right and that's where I see a Pokemon and then you go down there and then you know you fight that Pokemon and I guess make you're stronger and catch that one I think is the way it works hmm you sound like you're bored by that concept yeah yeah it wasn't I did it like once or twice and then I was like I rest it was also one of those things where people were losing weight because they were walking around a lot so they were touting the positive benefits of it look people walking for miles behind a car do compared to the car you've been doing is like absolutely nothing they're not like sprinting to get a Pokemon just the cardio I've been doing is totally unsustainable though I've got you said five hours one day yesterday five and a half hours and then another hour at night dude isn't that gonna like hurt your knees seems good everything seems pretty good right now everything's great Wow yeah so everybody listening right now you guys are lazy bitches because he ran for five hours what did you it's not smart it's like I used to make fun of people that did ultra marathons and stuff like it's not it's not healthy like I'm not doing myself a service by doing this like my body's like Jesus Christ dude like when I get home at night and I crash I crash hard do you sleep better tired I sleep like a brick yeah and then I wake up I'm like really already get up in my fuck I got to get to the gym within 30 minutes cuz I have a podcast in three hours yeah I have to get a solid two and a half hours of cardio in in the morning yeah solid two and a half hours at 80% you know so I'm cranking I mean it's hard and listen to I was listening to stuff to blow your mind they were talking about flying creatures a Quetzalcoatl and pterodactyls and the origins of the Quetzalcoatl myth in Aztec Mexico and you could watch like the full-length movie of the Titanic as you work out I've watched a bunch of movies like yesterday I watched two solid movies I finally got to see get out never saw get out it was great it was I really liked that movie that's a very very good movie that was a good movie like God the girl is so evil spoiler second annual Pokemon go fest draws over 21,000 attendees this July in Chicago so there's over a hundred and eighty thousand people that played Chicago lately remember do you remember when Hillary Clinton of people playing do you remember when Hillary Clinton said all right everybody I need you at a Pokemon go to the polls and then everybody in the audience was like yeah did she you never saw that no now you're you're you're a progressive but you're not necessarily a Democrat well I mean you're not necessarily like in support of anyone who's not a loyal Democrat so I describe myself as populist left that's how I would describe myself populist means you know I support the policies that would help ordinary people and I vote based on the issues and so if there's a politician that's for the policies I'm for that's who I'm going to support and that's what I'm gonna argue for so I'm very very critical of what we call corporate Democrats which are Democrats that represent Wall Street and represent big pharma and the military-industrial complex and for-profit health insurance companies and super critical of the Republicans also so you know that's why I co-founded a group called Justice Democrats and the whole idea was to basically do a populist left take over the Democratic Party where you get rid of the corporatists in the party and you have people who will represent the working class and we've been pretty successful so far they're still 26 justice Democrats were in the running and they can get elected and there were here's an amazing fact there were four politicians in the House of Representatives that didn't take any corporate PAC money there's about to be 40 and that all happened because of Justice Democrats our revolution which is Bernie Sanders group the p triple c which is another left-wing organization and basically what's happening is people on the Left who actually care about the substantive issues are standing up and saying we're not going to take it anymore and we're tired of being a lied to by politicians and we want people who are gonna actually represent us and represent working people yeah that's I love that and I love that approach and there's so much partisan politics and there's so many people that are just married to the idea of being connected to the Democrats that they're willing to overlook some really heinous faults and the old blue just won't do as Nina Turner says that and I love that phrase because it's so just hacky and partisan to be like no I'm on your team so are you gonna vote for me here let me do some platitudes and some cliches about how we're stronger together and we're gonna break down the barriers and you know it's like well I don't uh overtly hate minorities so vote for me it's like oh what a low bar give people something to vote for that's a great point yeah that way I felt a lot of that during the Hillary Clinton campaign everybody it was like anything but Trump so we're gonna vote for her but boy if you let's just be honest if you had a viable Catholic like Tulsi that's right Tulsi yeah Bert great cam if you had Tulsi Gabbard and she was running for president and she's also a woman and she's also left-wing but she's about the issues she cares about the issues and she's earnest yes like when you talk to her you can tell she just isn't I mean she's careful with her words because she's intelligent not because she's deceptive yeah and I would vote for her and a fucking heartbeat there you go I was just we just messaging each other she was messaging me about my Netflix special and I said run for president I want you to run for president mean that would be wonderful I'm slightly fucking win man I think she can but I think she can win I'm slightly butthurt about Tulsi because when I was on your podcast last time I plugged her talking about how awesome she is in fact I think I'm the one who originally showed you who she was right did you know before me in that podcast many people did so you have heard about well anyway she comes on a show definitely one of them she comes on the show and talks about yeah new media's awesome and there's a lot of great to meet you out there she goes jimmy dore and then there's a pause and then you move on to the next topic and i'm like god dammit Tulsi I plugged you plug me bro I know I'm being incredibly petty and I don't even really mean what I'm saying cuz I would still support her as a politician 100% so yeah I mean it bro this is some salt and it's headed your way Tulsi so remember now no but she's great she's great on the issues and yeah she's a genuine person that's what that's what I got out of her like what I got from talking to her she's a genuine person and man I mean maybe it's because she's from Hawaii and it's just a different place it's like it's almost like a state that's a small town I mean that's Hawaii's very small yeah I mean there's a million people in Honolulu but you get outside of Honolulu there's only a hundred thousand on the Big Island yeah I don't know how many Maui has but I think it's only got a couple hundred thousand I've never been to a Y before but it fucking great it looks like a paradise I mean the best is lanai if you want to go somewhere and just chillax there's a Four Seasons Inn lanai the entire island has three thousand people living oh wow it's great and you get real Island Hawaiians sure if they're not like if you go to Maui they're wonderful people they're great but they've been groomed you know I'm saying people have taught them how to talk like regular white people whereas in my I mean lanai they're just fucking chilled out man there and they just they have that way of talking you know they talking you know what pidgin is no it's a real interesting sort of I guess it's like a dialect of English you would call it but they have really cool expressions like some of they say a lot of things it would be choke like like if you talk about like a guy was explained to me how many deer there were in this one place he goes all is a choke deer there's choke deer so it's kind of like a broken English with different words sprinkles different words for different things you'd have to be around them all the time there's also like a way of talking that's yeah very very interesting that's kind of like I think it's called patois maybe it's called I think it's a people who are Jamaican who speak in English but it's very broken English real Sam one yeah yeah and they'd love to say bumbaclot what does that mean blood clot I think bumbaclot I think that's what it means right blood clot I know they also say blood clot they say blood clot a lot I think so yeah that should come up very rarely well unless you're a doctor I guess it's a way of saying stuff you know something's terrible it means mother fucker Oh mother bag that's what bumbaclot means it's a medical term basically talking about sutures that flight to Hawaii must be it's not bad it's five hours Oh from here it's five hours I'm coming from New York do you fly here you hang out for a couple days and you fly there again yeah top definition on urban dictionary says it's a cloth or rag used to wipe one's anal region oh that was my second guess the bum but like a bum a cloth so bumbaclot was like some asshole who's wiping his ass he's a cloth like you calling some of the douche bag use the cloth to wipe the butt as a war as a word to replace like fuck or yeah yeah is an ass wipe yeah yeah right that's mean it's awesome I love your ass wipes yeah Wow the last thing we hear to a swipe I haven't heard any long time that's like Beavis is Butthead yeah Dave oh you're such a butt wipe to the hole wipe anyway you're white yes very much so that's queer people can see that when you look at the potential candidates for 2020 yep who on the Left stands out there's gap Newsome he's just he comes across as a little too politician he and smarmy that's how he strikes me see you you don't like him no I mean I'm sure if I had a conversation with him and we spoke about the issues I would agree with him on most of the positions but I don't know if he really believes it and means it because he's a politician yes there are politicians who I talk to when I know that they mean it tulsi gabbard will be one of those role kana would be another one of those we spoke about him on the show last time I was here obviously Bernie Sanders is another one of those you know there's a really interesting politician coming out of West Virginia now I don't know if you heard about this guy his name is Richard Oh jeta and he's running against a Republican named Carol Miller get this he's running in West Virginia is super deep red like big-time Republican almost the most Republic tide probably with Mississippi is the most conservative area in the country so this district Trump won by 49 points there's this Democrat Richard know Jetta running he's up in a pole against her Republican by five points so so you're probably thinking how the hell in a you know a district like that can a Democrat be leading and the answer is very simple he's populist and he's fighting for working people and he's run these amazing ads where he literally gave out his phone number in one of the ads and said listen if you're a constituent of mine and you have an issue call me and I'll tell you what if a lobbyist tries to come into my office I'm gonna kick him out I don't want you in my office I don't care about lobbyists I care about the people and he's running on all substantive issues he's taking no corporate PAC money he's for Medicare for all so this is a guy who you know and by the way is a veteran in Iraq and Afghanistan and he's yes and he did vote for Trump and now he's one of trumps harshest critics and he said listen man I thought Trump was going to be potentially good for working people but it just turns out he wasn't good for working people so for example Trump ran as an anti outsourcing president he was against NAFTA and TPP and all that stuff in Trump's first year as president there were 93 thousand jobs that were out sourced that's even worse than Obama Obama had eighty-seven thousand jobs outsourced so when you go through his record with a fine-tooth comb even like the unemployment rate being low that's totally misleading because wages are falling so if wages are falling them you can't just brag about your economy being wonderful and his tax bill 83% of the benefits of the tax bill went to the top one percent we say the wages are falling how much they by they're not keeping up with the pace of inflation so it's probably about one percent so the point is Trump ran as a populist but ultimately he was a fake populist and he's not really helping the working class that's why his tax bill was you know he gutted the estate tax for example that's not something that doesn't that affects point-o 1% of the population yeah so Richard oh Jetta is this guy who voted for Trump and he says hey I regret it I think Trump is wrong and basically what he's saying is I'm the real populist candidate and he's a really inspiring candidate it's kind of amazing to see a +49 Republican district now potentially go democratic and by the way he's living proof of the point that I've been making since day one if you have Democrats who are running and they actually care about the issues and want to fight for working people that's how you win yeah the real problem is these labels in the first price right like Republican versus Democrat like yeah this the idea that we only have two different distinct parties that are viable options in 2018 it just so fuckin stupid to me B our system I don't like our system I don't I like parliamentary systems better now wish we had that when you said that the wages don't keep up with inflation and so they're they're down by about one percent but how much is unemployment up unemployment is down to three points um one percent is good I'm not saying that's not good but you just have to remember that that's not a very good economic indicator because think about it this is an argument that was presented I member back when I was in college and a professor was challenging us on this notion about unemployment and he said you do know we can create an economy that has zero percent unemployment right and all of us in the class like first of all we didn't know that second of all how do you do that and he goes slavery everybody can be working but that doesn't being paid or being paid yeah so when to use unemployment as like your top economic indicator it's just a shitty indicator it's just not the best thing you can use right because even if people working it doesn't mean they're doing what they want to do doesn't mean they're being paid a fair wage dude half of workers in America make $30,000 a year or less is that true that's true if Jamie wants to fact-check me on that I'm more than happy to be factually that's dark half of workers in America makes $30,000 a year or less now but what about Trump's always citing on rates for african-americans yeah minorities that they're lower than they've ever been before yeah what that could be true the one who true causes something like that is that something that's like well trend that was established during the Obama administration that's slowly but surely moving into the position it's in now and he just caught that wave or is it directly a result of the decisions he's made while he's in office well it does have a lot to do with this tax bill because corporations are getting a tremendous amount of money in corporate profits or through the roof so they're hiring right that's linked to that but again we come full circle back to the wages conversation and remember this is all it's temporary because look at what's happening to the deficit for example now I'm not at like a deficit Hawk where I think it's such a gigantic issue but the Republicans typically run as deficit hawks and when you look at the deficit it's gone up by fifty one percent of all American workers make less than thirty thousand dollars a lot of similar numbers but it's all right around that why are you so the deficit is skyrocketing and that's something that's going to temporarily help those numbers that were citing before that was during the Obama administration what was that article that's still the 2015 no I'm sure it is yes I'm finding all sorts of stir this one serious as to half of jobs in America pay less than $18 an hour can trump help this is from august of last year hmm it's fall right around house of cards Joe it's a house of cards yeah what was Trump supposed to do and what did he not do like what what was he claiming to do before he went into office so first of all he said everything at the same time so I could give any answer to that question because I'm serious and that's not to just pick on Trump because I was one of the loudest screaming about how Hillary Clinton was the exact same thing she's a politician who throughout her career she was on every side of every issue right and Trump it was kind of the same thing but the thing is Trump actually got away with it because I think the way he acts as a politician he acts like he has no filter and he's just a straight shooter sitting next to you at the bar but the problem is like Rand Paul pointed out in the debate he said Donald Trump is a straight shooter without the truth like he's like pretending to be a straight shooter so it depends what issue you're asking about I could tell you what Trump said you just have to give me the specific issue you want to know like foreign policy we won't talk about that for a loop sure so on foreign policy you know half the time Donald Trump said and there's so many tweets of him saying this before he was president before he ran that we need to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan it's a waste of time it's so stupid why we though we need to rebuild our own country and you know those are tweets where I read that I got i totally agree with that Donald Trump 100% but then the other half the time when he was on the campaign trail he spoke about how you know we need to bomb Isis to smithereens and we need to wipe him out and those things are kind of contradictory either you bring your troops home and you you know didn't you think he would be able to fix everything really quickly one of his premises that's typical Trump you know bloviating like I'm gonna be tremendous I'm gonna be amazing it's gonna be the best job you've ever seen over it's not a bad impression but you gotta change the tone well it's because I'm not doing the full hand you're doing good movement the movement all I have is the movement Joseph Rogan gonna call you Joseph is all I have what did you think personally when you saw Kanye with that insane he's gonna ask you about that too bipolar rant yeah I feel kind of bad for him I do yes and I'm not and I want to be clear I'm really not saying that as a partisan thing because even if Bernie Sanders was president and Kanye West was and also saying the exact same stuff I'd still be like whoa what is going on here yeah yeah did you burn any policy let him do it too because remember when you let those black lives matter chick take you remember that yeah that costume decide that really did cost him you think so yes yeah people do you can't do you can't just take the microphone away from someone you know so here's an interesting question do you think this helped Donald Trump at all with black voters having Kanye do that but how much a good number really you think so do yeah I do I don't know I don't know because I feel like there's Kanye West has been disinvited from a lot of cookouts now as a result of what he did with Trump Jaime's on black Twitter Jaime says not at all from what I read it did not in black Twitter and so his response has been very negative so as Kanye's really almost in a sense blowing his own reputation on this I guess I better say I don't think so I don't think no I think everyone who's a fan of Kanye West who's seen him blow up on Jimmy Kimmel and blow up on all these different people that have criticized him he he's obviously got mental health issues when he went on that rant I think it was in San Jose he's at a concert he said I didn't vote but if I did vote he was me I'd have voted on Trump yeah and everybody went boom and then he wound up going into a mental hospital after that oh wow checked into a mental hospital and then cancelled his tour remember that I do remember that that was because he couldn't handle the criticism it's part of it and also part of it he's legitimately mentally ill I mean look he didn't marry that lady and be a part of that family because he's thinking straight he's got some problems there's something wrong with him yeah no he's a genius in terms of music he's he's fantastic at creating beats and songs and hooks he knows the fuck he's doing there but he he's got a problem and you hear it when he rants when he's ranting and when he's talking about Ford making dope cars we don't use the word dope because we only use words like magnificent and many positive words like he's he's making he's listening to himself and jerking off to the noises that are coming out of his own mouth I love I loved when he said to the reporter when the reporter pushed back at him a little bit he's like you just asked me a question no you can't do that because this is like tasting a fine wine it's complex yeah yeah I thought my Rihanna mystical he's I think part of what he's doing is that he's a contrarian and when you are in a place like Hollywood and you're there all the time you're always surrounded by people who are anti Trump I think there's something about just this knee-jerk reaction Airy feeling of like like no I'm not with you guys I'm different and I'm special as a result of being different so I'm a contrarian and I'm gonna disagree with you and I also think there's narcissism in the sense that he looks at Trump and he really sees himself in Trump and that everybody left a trump when he said I'm gonna run for president I'm gonna win and if you remember a few years ago Kanye West said I'm gonna run for president and everybody was laughing at him wasn't even a few years ago it was recently yeah he and what the fuck's that guy's name Piers Morgan right right I didn't to it on on Twitter who said you're talking to your future president that's what Kanye said oh my god yeah or maybe was Harvey Levin he said it to you talk to me future prime I actually dislike Piers Morgan more than I dislike Kanye West on that one I think Kanye's ill I really do and I know he's been medicated yeah yeah I mean remember when he was all chubby and he's on his medication he got fat apparently he got off his medication and there are a lot of people by the way who would hear the point you made and B would be really angry of the fact that you think that he's mentally ill even though I think that's a probably I've seen I've seen it on my Twitter I've seen it on my Twitter people saying oh it's just a cheap partisan hacky point no it's not because he's admittedly mentally ill he did say that in the thing he said I was diagnosed bipolar institutionalized yeah he spent time in a mental hospital yeah for being mentally ill and when you listen to him rant this is just my opinion that is not the ravings of someone who's carefully considering the implications of each word they're saying and thinking about how to express themselves in a way that's gonna portray some sort of a clear cohesive message this is not he's not what he's doing what he's doing is jerking off he's just jerking off with his mouth I'm not kidding it's just it's just like it's a fine wine you know we're gonna make the dopest cars why can't for I make the dopest cars did you hear what he said in that same thing the reason why we got to help Larry Hoover is because in a different universe there are alternate universes I am him mmm I don't think that's correct oh no you ain't see nothing crazier than this nigga when he off his lexapro remember that time in Mexico remember the laughs that last time the episode asking me why the hell out text in code four times just to say don't text me hoe told you four times don't text me how and we finna lose all self-control but you ain't finna raising your voice at me especially in the Guiseppe still modern day Socrates larious man it's lit but I love that that nothing crazier than when he's off his lexapro oh my god yeah I do kind of feel bad even though this is such a you know like a sideshow type thing because I feel I mean the state of the country is so weird that simply because of his celebrity and the fact that the mainstream media doesn't know how to keep their eye on the ball you never know who can become president it could be somebody like God you think you're under estimating Trump I mean the guy who said he could win but you I knew you and I did too I mean I said it on my last Netflix special and one before my last one I I don't think Kanye West has a goddamn snowball's chance in hell of being okay I see what you're saying sure I don't think anybody that's famous can be President I think what Trump did was Matt some master manipulating skills combined with some superhuman energy that most likely came from diet pills what I think is like his ability to campaign his ability to maintain his energy and keep ranting and raving Hawking and fucking phenomenal he hillary couldn't keep up with that she literally didn't campaign places she didn't have the energy that's what is leaking down no heed Trump went directly to the Rust Belt and railed against NAFTA and the trade deals that destroyed their lives and Hillary Clinton I mean Bill Clinton is the one who didn't after yeah and she didn't campaign in a lot of those states because her campaign genuinely thought like oh we got those those are democratic lock ups and then guess what Trump ended up winning because of 70,000 votes in the Rust Belt mm-hmm so it directly because of that that's why I get so angry when there are some people on the Left who like only focus on the some of Trump supporters who are racist and all they want to do is talk about how bad of people they are it's like okay you could shame people all day long that's not gonna get them to vote for you right but I agree you don't you don't need the David dukes to vote for you that's fine but you know who you do need the two x obama voter who then flip to trump who is in the Rust Belt who had his freakin job out sourced that's who you need and that's who the Democrats abandoned the problem with saying that all Trump voters are racist too is you're creating these very clear sides and it's way too your loss it's a way to say listen we don't have to change in any way because it's just because these people are bad people so don't blame us there's nothing we did wrong blame them whereas if you really were interested in winning and getting power and implementing your agenda you want or if you want to reach whoever you can reach now again I'm not saying you try to get David Duke or Richard Spencer on your side because some people are too far gone but 70 percent of the country is not too far gone No so you should have went to the Rust Belt and you know tried to get the two times Obama voter who then flipped to trump and they didn't do that well I think there's also there was some real benefit in someone like Bernie Sanders just like I think there's some real benefit in someone like Obama socially whereas when you saw a guy who was came from a single mom who was a black guy who winds up being the president United States you just go wow maybe we're better than I thought we were like maybe we don't have all these prejudices maybe there's less of us than people try to claim and I think a guy like Bernie Sanders could have been a real foil it could have been a real he could have been a guy that if you looked at what Trump stood for Trump stood for the outsider who understands the game because he hired those people he paid those people he bribed those people and now I'm gonna clean up the swamp yeah drain the swamp and on the other side you've got this a deeply flawed woman who's deleted 30,000 emails who's beholden to all the Iraq and war the Iraq war but Benghazi how about the Patriot Act warrantless spying on all Americans which she supported every time there was a major issue where it was really a test of character and ideology she was wrong well and then when you go into her her thoughts on gay marriage she didn't believe in gay marriage till 2013 yeah which is like that is one of the least progressive things you could ever say like you didn't believe it until 2013 yeah like what why not like you think it should be between a man and a woman like what does that even mean it means you're trying to pander to what you think is the majority sentiment in the religious country yes you're going exact meanwhile Bernie Sanders is the fundamentally the opposite of Hillary Clinton and agree or disagree with him for the past 30 40 years he's had the same ideology saying the same stuff yes very very progressive and maybe he's totally wrong about some of his socialist ideas maybe would bankrupt the country maybe some of his I don't think it would I don't know would either should maybe would maybe it would be catastrophic to our economy to happen maybe would be bad maybe it would be the opposite of what we're dealing with right now with in in terms of the progression of unemployment where unemployment is at an all-time high and that or all-time low rather where when you're looking at people that are doing well in this country because of some of the things that Trump's implemented whether it's people that are getting lower wage jobs than they would like to have or whatever it is when you look at the numbers maybe those numbers would go in the other way so but my point is what he represents though is someone who's not corrupt what he represents is someone who's not beholden to banks but he represents someone who doesn't care about money it's not his thing it's never been his thing yeah his thing's been social justice and whether it's right or wrong at least it would represent something entirely different whereas what Clinton represented was corruption with a different taste to it so what I would say I agree with a lot of what you just said there in terms of Bernie I personally wouldn't use the term social justice for him because that has you know social justice yeah it's a thing on the internet and you know everybody it's basically what I think of when I hear social justice warrior is oversensitive college kid with pink hair who's trying to deep platform conservative speakers now right but that's unfortunate that it's become that well I mean let's let's take the way social justice let's let's say progressive ideology okay say that but what Bernie Sanders actually represents in my mind and based on his record is what he wants to do is make this country like every other developed country on the planet that's already kicking our ass in so many relevant areas so there's this common argument which is nothing but a straw man argument that comes from the far right where they say Bernie Sanders in his ideology he wants to make the United States like Venezuela or like Cuba or sometimes even say like the old Soviet Union well no if you actually go issue for issue pretty clearly he's asking for is a Swedish or Norwegian type system which is similar to the US except the major differences they have universal health care some of these places have universal education so and you know middle-class wages are higher so what he's asking for is a better mixed economy it's called social democracy he's asking for a social democratic type system it is not post capitalist it's not saying let's totally scrap the system and let's all you know act like we're whatever Hugo Chavez or Che Guevara what he's what he's asking for is actually I would call it moderate in an international sense because he looks at the rest of the developed world and he goes man these guys are kicking our ass on health care education their ass and what what parts of the world so when you look at healthcare for example there's a study that came out from the Commonwealth Fund which found that the United States ranks 11th out of 11 when it comes to develop countries in health care so we have worse health outcomes and it's more expensive and we don't even cover everybody we have 29 million people who are uninsured so when you go there there's single-payer systems and their systems beat us in every measurable that be there we see worse health outcomes based on what you have someone who goes to the doctor worse outcome in terms of like what happens once you've been checked in algae the study I don't know the answer that off the top and that's that's a big issue is because our we have a giant problem obviously with our diet you know and Mosher I'm not I wouldn't deny that for a second how much of I wonder how much of it is based on that when you're dealing with worse health outcomes like how much of that health how many of those health problems are there they're based on people's personal choices rather than the health care system that they're operating under so that is definitely a serious problem and one that needs conversation and needs fixing what I'm referring to is stuff that's more like we have 29 million people who are uninsured in this country we have anywhere from 32 to 45,000 people that die every year in this country because they don't have access to basic health care we pay per capita we pay double what other developed countries pay and again they cover everybody we don't cover everybody so it's very it's we're failing in every measurable way even if you control for factors like you're accurately pointing out you know I wonder what's going on too in terms of like but we have a very high of really fantastic doctors well see I know people that's the more I'm gonna address that Nasir please go okay so if you're a Saudi prince you do want to come to the United States for healthcare yeah because if you're in the top point o 1% you are gonna get the best care here right it's just a brain surgeon or just if the Pedic surgeon for the average person right you're gonna want to be in Canada or Sweden or Norway or Australia or any of those places this is the argument for socialized medicine versus privatized medicine the privatized medicine incentivizes someone to excel someone to be that guy that hey this guy worked on LeBron James oh so you know he's the best that's a decent point and my counter to that is I know Bernie Sanders is as well because I've seen his bill and he advocates for a particular type of Medicare for All system you don't need to ban supplemental private insurance in fact I would totally disagree with any bill that says we're now banning private insurance because you can do a single-payer system where you say we're gonna have public funding of public institutions or you could do a single-payer system like the French do or the Canadian do where they the Canadians do where you have public funding of private entities so what you're talking about is you know hey how are we gonna if there's no competition how are we gonna get the best doctors and things of that nature and my reaction to that is I'm just talking about the baseline public funding of private institutions and still allow people if they want to pay extra and go to a specialist they could do that I'm not necessarily even saying that what I'm saying is that the system of having an incentive for being excellent sure having a financial incentive mm-hmm that causes people to excel yes and I would agree with that in certain fields not another field well I think it's certainly exists in the medical field in surgery in many different medical practices you find fantastic practitioners here in the United States because they get paid substantially for it I would argue that the profit motive specifically in the realm of healthcare has had the opposite effect and has made it so that we have a disastrous system now if we talk about I agree with you as well with that as well but I think that when you're saying that they kick our ass in all these other areas like if you say I have Canadian friends that come over here to get operated on and I have in the American friends who go to Canada to get health care but it's cheaper that's why they're not going right but they're not gonna get Canada well care if you so if you were to go to Canada and you get sick you just go to the hospital they don't charge you even if you're an American citizen if you're a citizen in fact Trump was saying back he was on like David Letterman Show years before he became president and he was talking about how awesome the Scottish health care system is because his buddy went over there and he broke his arm when he was there and he went to a hospital in Scotland and on his way out he's like how much do I owe you and they said nothing get out mmm so if you're a guy in New Jersey and you fly to Montreal because you're sick they'll just take care of you yeah you don't have to be a Canadian citizen no it's pretty amazing Don't Tell certain things listen certain things in a civilized society should be off the table it's just a matter of what are those things right it's not a like everybody agrees with some level of government everybody agrees okay we should probably have you know paved roads and police like that's a given yeah so it's just a matter of let's prioritize here what are the things that we're gonna take off the table and fund with our tax money and every other developed country has decided well healthcare is one of those things let's not be silly yeah we've talked about that many times in this podcast that socialism is absolutely apparent in many aspects of our society especially firefighters police officers I mean paying for the streets paying for the roads like we all agree that our money should be pooled to take care of these very specific issues yeah but then when it comes to some issues we get angry and we pretend that socialism doesn't exist at all in this country yeah I think medicine is one of them but with my problem with that is that medicine is one of the most important things that a human being could ever have the in if you got health care health care can allow you to stay alive like if you don't stay alive you can't contribute to the society you're dying from something that they could cure if you had the money to cure it well this isn't it this a giant problem in society if we don't address sick and and ill people and injured that's true then we're not caring for each other absolutely and medical bills is one of the top causes of bankruptcy in the United States and medical bankruptcies just don't exist in the rest of the modern world it's not a thing here it's a gigantic thing a huge issue yeah it's weird what we've done and you know another thing that's weird it's what we've done with one of two countries that allows pharmaceutical drug companies to advertise on the air not only that fucking insane Congress and by the way this is why they have like a 15 or 20 percent approval rating they've repeatedly slapped down provisions that would give us cheaper pharmaceutical drugs because they're allowing the pharmaceutical drug companies to price gouge us why because they're all bought by big pharma yeah that's that's a giant issue right but you know lobbyists getting the amount special interest groups getting their influence out getting that kind of money and influence out of pollen there's a way to do it 28th amendment money out of politics you could do a system that's called clean elections which is basically public financing of Elections where instead of instead of running and only having a bigger megaphone if you sell out more to billionaires you run and you actually have a battle of ideas and competing philosophies and then whoever has the best ideas ends up winning so let's pretend let's go devil's advocate sure let's pretend you're arguing against that okay what if you were some lobbyist for the pharmaceutical drug theory and you were trying to make a I'll tell you what they said I'll tell you exactly what they say please it's free speech it's my free speech to take twenty thousand dollars and give it to this super PAC that's trying to get this politician elected because you're telling me I can't do that there you're telling me that which means you're saying I don't have the free speech to be able to say I support a private pharmaceutical system that's what they say they've literally argued that in court that's and then the counter-argument to that is many other people have pointed us out I'm not the first but if money equals speech prostitution should be legal and murder-for-hire should be legal because I'm not actually hiring somebody to murder somebody I'm just saying with speech because money is speech that I'm okay with hitmen yeah well you know the real issue as well would be that you're not talking about pharmaceutical companies making no money there's still massive amounts of people that are on met they would still make a lot of fucking money they just wouldn't make as much money yeah and how much money are they making and that's where it gets obscene when you see the actual numbers of pharmaceutical drug companies rake in in this country in terms of like what it takes to develop a drug versus what the profit margin is it's fucking insane and the hurdles to get a drug any drug and there's an issue that they're dealing with right now with stem cells and stem cell yeah the approval of that yes because they're they're treating them like they are a drug and the conspiracy theory is that pharmaceutical drug companies do not want the approval of stem cells for therapy was whether it's you know umbilical all these different types of stem cells because the success rate is fantastic and they think that it could potentially cut down a profit margins there's certainly an incentive problem there I mean it's the same incentive with against marijuana the shirt sales would cut down on the sales of pharmaceutical drugs yeah absolutely and another really gross part of the system is that a lot of these drugs are actually created in our universities by researchers and scientists and then what happens is the for-profit private pharma companies swoop in they buy up the rights to it for very cheap and then they price gouge and sell it back to the American people for a huge profit when it was the taxpayers who funded the research in the first place hmm so it's a way where they screw you twice you have to pay for the creation of it and the research of it and then they get the rights to it and then they sell it back to you again and jack up the price and then it's even worse than that because there's this guy Alex Azhar who's the head of the Health and Human Services now Trump appointed him this guy worked for Eli Lilly was a price coucher jacked up the prices massively now as the head of Health and Human Services you know he's in charge of lowering drug prices hilarious well the brilliance of Trump honestly the brilliance of Trump is that he goes out there and he says like he's populist and he's anti-establishment but if you go issue for issue on his policies he is massively Pro establishment I mean the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the perfect example is he picked a predatory payday lender to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that bureau returned 11 or 12 billion dollars to defrauded Americans when big financial institutions screwed them and now he's like yeah let's make that worse let's handcuff that agency and put a predatory payday lender in charge of it it's all it's comical yeah it's comical like people wouldn't believe this do I follow this stuff on a daily basis I lose my damn mind when I read this but think about your ability to follow this stuff yeah you have so much access to information you have so much time in your hands and this is a main focal point whereas the average person is not going to get this data and I don't blame them I'm not playing I was never gonna show don't blame them they they don't have it's there's no there's no bandwidth cuz no way it's coming in yeah what you just said I mean how many people know what you just said not many but that's my job my job is to come out here and to say these things and everybody could check out youtube.com so secular talk shameless plug I know and patreon.com/scishow killer talk another shameless plug I know but this is my job my job is to come out here and tell people what I read and what I follow and bottom line is guys and I don't want to come across as partisan in any way yes I like Bernie Sanders yes I don't like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton but my whole thing is I want a system that is based on common sense and it's rational and it's logical and it helps people now Bernie's not gonna run I think he might you think so I think he might I haven't heard a word bottom well he has been making some moves behind the scenes anytime you see a solid Asian person representing him try to get a hold of us oh really yeah they faked us out there was a Bernie 20/20 oh my god Heather sent an email if you want to get to him talk to me I don't know him but I know people who do know him I want to talk to him about his posture I could fix so many things about the way people perceive him and we can move his head from the center of his chest and put it in a normal place well you know the funny thing about Trump is yes posture this is how a person's supposed to be they not supplied been slashing two men know you've been normal Bernie's head is down here does yeah it's in the wrong spot it's like you know look at them look where his head is look at them see if you find a picture of him Yeah right there he head is way lower than it's supposed to be yeah your head supposed to be up here see where my shoulders are look at that picture of Bernie now watch me I'm gonna do the same this is my this is see where on my neck is here my shoulders look at that he looks like he's doing a little dance there Joseph Rome diddling the Jackie Mason I call you Joseph when I'm Trump or Bernie that's what I do you're not supposed to have your head so far down on your chest right there that's a perfect example that's terrible posture you know I've said this about Trump everybody laughs at his orange face and his dyed blond hair but I actually think that that does make him look younger the orange face and the blonde hair it probably does because he gives him some sort of life because if he didn't have let's say you know let's say he didn't do the comb-over he didn't dye the hair he didn't have the orange face people would be like oh that's like a really senile old grandpa who's ranting there's been people have done photoshop's of what he would look like without hair and with white with white skin well did you see that thing when he was getting on Air Force One and it that was like he was a demon dude oh my and he's got the orange in his face but see I would respect him if his hair looked like that when I see him with his hair all fucking swirled around no I'm like what are you doing okay I'm gonna defend Trump now geo that's what I'm gonna do so I am him from the that's a lot of makeup he's got a lot of makeup dude I'm stunned at the dedication he has to the comb-over because this that's probably like an hour long project every day and he does it every day he's probably watching Fox and Friends and tweeting as somebody's doing his hair yeah do you think someone does it for him he's try to find the video of him walking up the ramp to Air Force One where his hair it looks like a demon yeah the skin Sudan where it's like it just pops off he's pretending to be a human he's rotting from the inside and he's just barely keeping it together look at that yeah that's one but it's the image there's a direct behind animal that's the angle cuz you see how there's just a giant bald spot back there he does a really good job of covering it he does it's just so crazy if you put a video Trump hair gift it might come up that way go with it that's it right there Jamie OH that's crazy now you could hear the horror movie noises that sounds like the weird thing is like look how where's the hair coming from on the sides like house there's so much hair on the side it's a work of art Jill like watch who goes up the stairs and there it is a wing that wing has he not know that that wing is flopping around the amount of baldness in the back of his head it's like he's growing hair only on the side of his head yeah a strain usually when people lose their hair that back portion still grows hair at the very back and his didn't yes she's very screaming I mean it looks a demon so here you go step-by-step on how to do a Trump hair good that's it looks like some fucking English okay I could have been I could have been swayed into things got a lot going on there yeah but I actually do think that this it does ultimately make me younger helps I do yeah I do see with a picture of him bald up there scroll up there Jamie that picture right there on that same row the bottom rail the one next to it yeah look at that that's what he would look like yeah I look fine there you think that looks fine yes I think oh but he thinks he's not seven deeper I think he looks like a pudgy Uncle Fester no chance he looks like a fucking man doesn't give a shit about his hair one of the things it's a problem with him is it's not very manly to spend that much time but coming in spring that's true especially for a billionaire in his 70s it's one thing if you're like 20 and you're panicking holy shit I'm going bald before my time no you're fucking 70 and you're worth what twenty billion dollars or something probably way more now yeah he's profited massively from being inside the White House there was some sort of oh we could talk about that because so you know everybody focuses in mainstream media on the Moller investigation and is ties to Russia and stuff like that I think everybody's missing the bigger story because the bigger story is that there are two different emoluments cases which are proceeding against Trump and for those of you who don't know what that is in the Constitution there's the emoluments clause which basically says that a President of the United States cannot take money from foreign governments because there's a conflict of interest problem if you take if I take money from whatever name the place Russia Saudi Arabia Israel you name it if I do that well then of course you're going to be incentivized to do policy in favor of those countries and not necessarily what's best for the American people and there are two court cases against Trump that have preceded in federal court on this so while everybody screaming about the Muller investigation they're missing the even bigger corruption scandal I mean we were talking about Saudi Arabia earlier the Saudis data Trump's hotel and paid two hundred and fifty thousand or three hundred thousand dollars and they didn't even freaking stay there so why did they do that they did that because they're trying to make it so that when they give him a call and say hey man what about the one hundred billion dollar weapons deal Trump's like of course because he's got more money in his bank account as a result of the Saudis similar thing happened with Israel on the way in Jared Kushner and some other people in the Trump administration spoke to Israeli officials about how Obama and carry on their way out the door we're gonna say hey Israel stop with the illegal settlements it was just a little slap on the wrist it was more symbolic than anything else but Israel was calling the Trump administration and saying we want you to try to kill this thing and of course Jared Kushner has taken millions of dollars from Israeli banks and he has investments over there so there's you can't have a president of either party taking money from foreign governments because then they're gonna do those government's bidding that's a huge problem and I don't see anybody talking about that all I see them talking about is Muller and oh my god Russia Russia Russia and it's been the only guy that's ever been president that really has been a substantial business sure yeah to this extent for sure or at least that I know of to be clear maybe there's maybe one way before I knew yeah yeah it's it's dark because everyone knows that this is an engine issue I mean everyone knows yeah you know and that was one of the issues about Russia's that he was trying to put hotels in Moscow he did that with Russia did that with Taiwan it's everywhere yeah he pissed off China early on because and this was maybe not as big of a deal but he took a phone call from the head of Taiwan and China does not want Taiwan recognized as its own thing right and so that caused a huge diplomatic crisis because then China was like what are you doing do you can't don't talk to them as if they're their own independent thing and come to find out he was working on a deal to put a hotel in Taiwan yeah what is the deal with Taiwan versus China I don't know the detailed history of that I just know that china considers Taiwan theirs and Taiwan says no we are our own thing right but that's one of those issues where like whose side are we on there um I mean I don't know enough about it to give you my to give you an opinion on it but it seems to me like China saying I want that to be ours and them saying no that seems like a big deal like it seems like you should even and listen I'm the type of person who says let's try to work it out in the u.s. at however we can but if it really came to the point where I don't know Texas was like seriously no we're leaving now because of reasons XY and Z should we have the right to tell them no I don't know well I mean was Taiwan was a part of China yeah I think so up until I don't know dude yeah I try to be whenever I don't know something i try to be totally upfront about i appreciate that that that part of that story i remember thinking that this was you know people are saying this is unprecedented for the president united states to talk to taiwan yeah when really china's got a giant issue with this this could cause huge international problems yeah there was a big crisis behind the scenes I didn't get it though well I didn't it was it was only a story for a day or two so I didn't know too many details of it have you been following at all the Ted Cruz versus beta O'Rourke race no would you say Ted Cruz should be voted out simply because he's Ted Cruz because that's where I'm at with Ted Cruz well he's just a fool he's just he's so smart me I call him smarmy Ted Cruz well I'm one of my favorite parts of the election was there was a guy with sunglasses on and he was at some sort of campaign rally with Ted Cruz and he was like it's over quit you're done during the presidential primary sir what what what is the issue that you have with me sir like what and he's like it's over you're a loser and it's like the guy was a Trump guy yeah that was like wearing sunglasses like the whole thing was just I was like you don't know how to handle trolls like look you can't you're stun now he can't because he's such a fake guy so fake did you ever see Trump manhandle him in the debate when he tried to bring up New York values I don't remember okay it is it cool if we watch that okay because you're gonna love Everett Ted Prue's things though was the excerpts of his commercial when he was setting up those commercials and he had mom prays for me four hours every day she's like what speaking the Fox Business GOP debate Ted Cruz and Donald Trump discussed New York values say it again from well you know most people know exactly what New York values are you're from New York City might not there are many many wonderful wonderful working men and women in the state of New York but everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay marriage focus around money and the media and and I guess I can confirm it another way not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan I'm just saying conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan including William F Buckley and others just so you understand this place it's got great people it's got loving people wonderful people when the World Trade Center came down I saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully more humanely than New York there are two 110-story buildings come crashing down I saw them come down and we saw more death and even the smell of death nobody understood it and it was with us for months the smell the air and we rebuilt downtown Manhattan and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers and I have to tell you that was a very insulting statement that Ted made that could have been handled better you didn't like troche response and was sloppy Ted sucks he's shitting on a whole state because he's a partisan hack prick I understand yeah the way he handled it wasn't it but I got it that Ted such a cunt when I'm watching Trump stand there I'm like I hope he gets some yeah because he's so fake everything is so pre-planned and the video you were talking about is probably an even better example where he's you know pretending like he's sitting there with his kids like alright kids did eat your broccoli yeah well blame at Buckley's from even though I guess he lived in Manhattan afterwards I don't know did you ever see the gore Vidal William F Buckley yeah Bates those was called the the best of enemies was it call I thought it was on firing line in his show maybe you mentor E oh I didn't see that the thing is called the best of enemies but it's about the 1960s debates between Buckley is that it best of enemies it's great you should watch I will definitely check that out I want gore Vidal like I mean he pissed off Buckley to the point where Buckley called him a faggot and said oh yeah yeah he goes I forget what the way he said it he goes I'll punch you and you'll stay plastered or some fucking shit sock it to the left yeah I forget the term that he used you know gore Vidal lived in Ravello he lived in Italy and you know he lived in LA or Hollywood oh yeah okay in Ravello you know and he you know I was up there I was I was I put it took a picture from Instagram this work or of a doll used to bang dudes right Brooks respect I mean I'm a big fan of gore Vidal he's a brilliant brilliant guy but I like he got under William F Buckley skin so bad that Buckley fell apart during real AIDS oh you fucking screamed at him he's red in the face that's interesting because he was calling him a Nazi gore Vidal was calling me a Nazi yeah I saw on YouTube they have William F Buckley versus Noam Chomsky and you got the thing that he said back in like the 60s Oh from the sixties it is fascinating to watch that because if you're really nerdy and wonky and you love politics go watch William F Buckley versus Noam Chomsky because it is I love it I when I was a kid I used to watch it and be like oh man this is amazing he he calls the words you queer knows more than that yeah you could find the video well he said he would punch him who is this honest a plaster or something like that he said more than the word queer is this on Netflix yes okay yes it is after God tell me the name may not be on Netflix it's definitely on iTunes yeah maybe he called him a queer but what it whatever it was he called him a homosexual slur and then he threatened to knock him out he threatened to sock him or whatever the fuck he but it was the red in the face and the fucking eyeballs twitching and you know and and really was the end for William F Buckley anyway during an official like debate that they were having it was during the series of debates at ABC put on they put on a series of debates and you know gore Vidal was doing better and then William F Bucket was kind of a cunt and gore Vidal was mocking him he very pompous yeah only not Buckley worse yeah he's gross yes just weirdly grow but it showed how he fell apart from that statement on sure that was kind of the end of people taking him completely seriously people now look back at him through rose-colored glasses and then like oh my God he's such a brilliant intellectual well it's sort of like what they do with Reagan oh yeah Reagan was an embarrassment yeah because they used to well didn't he late in his time in office weren't there questions about whether or not he had dementia Oh a hundred percent well do you remember during the iran-contra debates or the iran-contra trials where they asked him did you sell arms to Iran he's like I don't remember kept saying I don't remember that could have been a tactic to try to get out of it right he was nothing he was losing if he didn't hear this yeah oh this is even older than the Chomsky correct wanting to organize their country and their own way politically this happens to be pretty much the opinion of Western Europe in many other parts of the world if it is a novelty in Chicago that is too bad but I assume that the point of the American democracy and some case some people without onazi and the answer is that they were they were well treated by people who was precise them and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American marines so that that started as a debate on Vietnam mm-hmm and then by the end they were now that's even seems like a big deal back then it was probably like oh my goodness I'll be on every nightly news show yeah you queer I'll sock you in their face and you'll stay plastered like that's almost like a rapper diss I'll sock you in your face and you stay Plested right a little bit yeah a little bit but the documentary is fantastic it looks good so definitely check that out it's really good yeah give me the name when it's it's the best of enemies it's it's really good because it just shows you like the the time that they lived in it was just a different world and that ABC was so I mean they were able to have this on national television and have debates on policies and on politics between two recognized intellectuals one on the right one on the left and this is something that they did on national television it was a big success you know for the longest time I was I was very anti debate and still to an extent today I feel like I'm anti debate but the reason I am is because I feel like it's the WWE of intellectual pursuits where it's more of a show and it's more about sophistry and it's more about being quick on your feet then who has the right arguments right and I don't think that's good but then the other argument is and now I'm I'm warming up to this argument is that it's such a better way to get people to watch and listen because when when you get really wonky and just have conversations with people many people just kind of tune out to that because it doesn't keep they're at mentioned but what will keep their attention is a zinger so if you know how to deliver zingers in a debate and you can get more people to watch and agree with you then it's almost almost like a necessary evil to do it so I decided like for the political thing I said okay you know what I will debate and I'll debate mostly because my audience wants me to debate I think my audience Abed Tucker Carlson no no Jake you were debated Tucker Carlson who are you gonna do I was gonna debate an Coulter oh that's right and Coulter pulled out okay and then she had the nerve to go on Good Morning LA and say you know these liberals they chickened out of debating me so she just blatantly lied she backed out of the debate with me and then she goes on TV and says no and she says her though is not what she's a troll but here's her reasoning here's her reasoning it was so smug and so elitist she's like oh how many bestsellers does he have bitch I don't write books I guarantee you I had way more listeners secular talk listeners there than she had an Coulter fans and let me tell you something even I have people who are very conservative in my own family and when they heard I was debating Ann Coulter you know what every single one of them said get that bitch I don't like it and these are people who agree way more with her than they do with me well she's not really a Republican she's a troll and she's a hack yeah I know I don't think she even believes what she's saying you know and one of the reasons why I say that is because the way Bill Maher treats her he laughs and jokes around that's true sure he's like there's a wink and a nod with her exactly it's a hustle I think she's an entertainer I think that's true and I remember back during the Bush years nobody was more in favor of the Iraq war and thought it was the greatest thing ever and would you know make fun of people who were against it and then when Trump rose up through the Republican ranks and he was bashing the Iraq war which by the way I loved it when he did that well the sudden she won she hopped on the Trump train when all the other candidates on the stage were not bashing the Iraq war so she flipped on this major issue that defined five years of her so-called intellectual life it's not real yeah she doesn't and remember when she was talking about invading Canada something about Canada's Canada not supporting us will fucking invade there's something over rack it was like he was something along those lines he remember what you're talking there's something like this bitch fucking mind you know what she said we need to invade one of these Muslim countries and just forcibly convert everybody there that was one of the things she said I remember that it's not real man yes she these are the fact that she still gets considered for debates yeah pretty stunning I know she's she's just disingenuous so it would have been I would have been screaming at you know a wall basically but the notion you would have it would have been wonderful see everybody says that crowd that lady into taking the stage with you it be fed run circles around her I ended up debating Scottie Nell Hughes who was big on TV during the 2016 election and she was a trump backer and now she's on RT and actually she ended up being very reasonable I'd say we actually ended up agreeing on maybe 65% of the issues and we had some some strong disagreements but mostly agreeing and I think it was a very fruitful conversation but I don't know if the audience liked it as much as they would have liked me bashing Coulter's know the audience probably would've liked it more but it's nice when those kind of conversations where people do agree on a lot of issues even regardless of what side they're supposedly on do take place because it makes people it gives people hope and the idea of reasonable discourse so then you would have absolutely loved I was on a panel with Charlie Kirk of turning points USA and he's you know close with Candice Owen he's only 12 years old that's his thing he's young he's not 12 he's probably he's 19 no no no everything in he's a little kid you're joking I see is barely in your face I'm a very literal dude so sometimes stuff goes right over my head but we're on hand as they sold Girl Scout cookies together that I would actually believe her so I was on a panel called how are we gonna get along Charlie Kirk was one of the panelists now going into it I thought I'm not gonna agree with this dude on absolutely anything but when we got in there what I did is I tried to frame issues from what his ideology is so he says he's a you know a conservative so I said okay that means typically you believe in smaller government so I said okay here are some areas where I believe in smaller government I think we need to stop the warrantless NSA spying we're collecting everybody's information without their approval and without a warrant I think that we need to stop the drug war I think we need to you know and our invasions of other countries because that takes a big government and billions of dollars to do these invasions and rebuild countries and things of that nature and I even said on the death penalty we should probably stop that because about six percent of the time we get the wrong people and probably shouldn't be the case and on virtually every one of these issues charlie Kirk agreed with me he even agreed with me on the issue of Saudi Arabia where you know I said they said something like oh we like law and order and the law and order president as Donald Trump I said if you really like law and order you'd be against the Trump administration arming 110 billion dollars worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia and Charlie Kirk to his credit goes no I agree with that now the other guy on the panel was an absolute pack he's a Mylo wanna be I don't know his actual I don't even know his name but he it was clear he was like doing an act and he's a daily wire third stringer like he's been Shapiro's thing but he's a low-level guy mhm and his I swear I swear to you Joe he was talking about how I'm very pro-life and I need you to know that I'm very pro-life and this is something I support my response in was well I'm glad to know that you're against the death penalty and immediately without skipping a beat he goes I'm for the death penalty in the audience laughs and I go well if you're gonna walk right into my trap every time it's gonna be very easy debate now isn't it what's going on with my should be asking you that I didn't even know the dude I haven't heard a peep out of him no he I think his whole thing imploded because there was an article that came out and they have like correspondence between him and literal like actual all right people where they were he's kind of doing puff pieces for them that was my understanding of it and he kind of disappeared after that and temporarily he was he was with Alex Jones you did a few shows with Alex Jones I was last I saw puff pieces like yeah like trying to make it seem like they aren't what they actually are like he was partying with Richard Spencer and they were singing together and it was weird mm-hmm yeah he's a weird character he's a he's definitely a weird character but I actually enjoyed talking with him off the air and I felt like there's a lot of what he is that's theatrics sure and you know it's hard to tell you know it's hard to tell because it's hard to tell like how much of how much of what you think is theatrics is them being theatrical in the on their on and how much is theatrical when they're talking to you and trying to be you know endearing affair yeah I it is hard to tell but sometimes you can see it when there are people who kind of get involved in this political space it's awesome and really all they want to do is just become famous yes it's like you should that shouldn't be the point you should really get in on this political thing because you actually are really interested in politics right I mean that's really what it comes down to but that's you yeah because I'm a nerd that's why I didn't expect my thing to ever get honestly when I first started I really thought maybe in my wildest of dreams I'll get to a hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube and as I talk to you right now we're almost about to cross 600,000 so I never expected any of this I never expected any of this and the fact that it happened I'm just grateful for it well you're intelligent guy with very reasonable points you deserve all the credit that you've gotten but you are also honest like your these are your actual opinions and this is your actual perspective the real problem with someone like Ann Coulter or someone like many of these other people that I see out there that you we don't even have to name is it they're hustlers yeah they found an inn you know yes there's an inn for a certain type of conservative person there's an inn for a certain type of democratic persons and in for a serene I there's Pro women people that don't give a fuck about women they're bullshit are absolutely you know the absolute supposed feminists when they're just narcissists there's a lot of that out there there's men's rights activists that really only care about finding this way into a group of people where if you have their support there's just a large conglomeration of them and you can sort of take them in as your fans do you mean it do you feel like that died down a little bit the men's rights activist thing yeah yeah I feel like there were maybe three years ago it was very big and then I have read about it yeah you got shit from them right didn't it what what shit you know having them be upset at me I don't give a fuck but my bit was that every men's rights activist I ever met I just want to grab and go dude we got them all shut the fuck up we run everything what's there almost every the whole idea is that nothing I don't think men should have rights but it's just we've got him yeah and that my thing in the bit was what if women started pay attention to things men actually did when they started going hey we just realized you guys caused all the war every single war ever and like if you imagine if women caused all the war yeah well we're gonna kill these fucking crazy bitches all you want to do is go to war this was in your most recent space right yeah that's great and they thought out there was some of them that were upsetting me but like that's a pretty bulletproof argument like right the only men's rights are argument that's legitimate is divorce laws sure I agree with that and we're in when it comes to alimony and when it comes to child support and when it comes to child custody yeah they're totally agree with that there are men they get fucked over and I know guys that have gotten fucked over in that regard and you know what courts tend to side towards the mother and even if the mother's deceptive and if the mother is you know they'll say something like he beats the kids or I think he might have done something sexual to the kids yeah these women have done horrible things like that and they've done that to get more money or they've done that to get custody or they done that just for spite but this is just this is a matter of the courts being designed to protect the situation system being designed to protect kids and protect the mother who needs to get money to be able to take care of the children because there's a lot of fuckin shitty deadbeat dads now if there were no deadbeat dads if men always pay child support then this would be far less of an issue yeah the issue exists the reason why women can exploit it is because so many men were pieces of shit sure it created this need for some sort of some sort of law that said some something that's said to protect children and to protect women with with that get custody yeah and now it looks like the do with the divorce issue and everything the pendulum swung a little too far in the other direction and there's like this default setting which is actually not too good for the guy right and I know they say you're talking about two because I saw that podcast a long time ago I think it was one of the people he worked with on Newsradio or something that's just one of them that's just one of them I know many people that have been fucked over by divorce but and you know and look I have a good friend of mine who I've talked about him on the podcast before he has been divorced for 14 years he has been married to a new woman for 12 years he still pays alimony not only does he still pay alimony he pays alimony to tune of more than $100,000 a year to a woman that he doesn't have sex with so he can't retire he cannot retire this woman has a boyfriend she lives in his old house in my friend's old house she owns the house and they don't have any children this is the idea that he fucked her so hard she can't work again like she's not 80 years old man I mean she's now in her 50s that's almost like indentured servitude it's fucking insane but you'd like to give me $100,000 in life he's giving well it's it's tapered down to like I think it's now a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year but if one point he was paying her a quarter million dollars a year and he's paid or that for 12 fucking or 14 fuckin years now 14 years he's been married to a new woman for 12 he has a family he has a family and asked to send money to this lady he doesn't talk to any more like she can't move on with her life and if he doesn't he gets locked up if he doesn't he goes did you L yeah I mean this is and he's trying to go to court and she fights it and she lives with her boyfriend and when they send people over to check the boyfriend puts his stuff in a fucking new hall drives around the block waits and then comes back so what if let's say let's let's say he loses his job and he can't find another job for whatever reason and he's locked he just always the money no matter what and there's no do you like you can't go back in front of a court and they can read you know take it down or whatever that's a good question I mean you'd have to go to court and the judge would have to agree but he's a successful man that's part of the problem is he's not going to be a loser he's an ambitious guy he does really well he works very hard he works 1012 hours every day and he has forever and he's good he's smart he's good at his job and because of this he has to pay this woman that he doesn't fuck anymore forever that's crazy man it's a nice lazy it's a nightmare but here's the thing it's like she's not she's not like she's not in a hospital bed it's not like she can were it's like she's she's totally capable of making a living and she now has probably four or five plastic surgeries she's the person we were talking about earlier I don't even know maybe she went she fits the route maybe she went the opposite I don't know but the idea that my friend has to pay her and every now and then you know we'll talk about I'm like you still have to pay her I just go oh my goodness he's fucking I mean he's got a family he's got a wife and he has children with this new woman and he's happy and he still has to pay what is that two thousand dollars a week two thousand plus ax just an absolute nightmare larious so here's a check for $2,000 lady I don't even know anymore so speak I guess this is somewhat related to what we're talking about here but what did you make of the Cavanaugh thing this is my tape I mean I've spent a lot of time over the last week paying attention to it oh really this happened a little longer yeah okay so you just caught up on it yourself for a while I was like this guy's gross this is gross I don't were you away when the main thing was happening you weren't paying attention I wasn't okay to it but over the last week I've paid a lot of attention to it and here's my take on it one of one of the things that got me was well one of the things that got me is it seems like most of his most of his life in his young life that guy was fucked up drinking a lot did you see it read the yearbook did you see the yeah yeah yeah and all the stuff about like on the calendar like he had his calendar and we're like things were scheduled like beers were scheduled right it's very bizarre that's very yes and he was sold like frat boy douchey like all the stuff he said was very cliquey yeah and he also lied you know Oh endlessly yeah sure that alone is all I need to know yeah he said he said boo f---ing is farting ranbu f---ing of course means fucking yeah yeah everybody knows that that's nonsense so he's a liar so and then he perjured himself and saying that he didn't and you know and by the way the Democrats didn't even mention perjury they just they just kind of laid down they just kind of laid down my whole thing was I I think it was a gross spectacle and III honestly I thought that even the hearings happening I felt like it was a little bit of a clown show because it's like here we are the most powerful organization the most powerful body this government the United States government we're having this hearing and we're talking about drinking that happened in the 1980s right it just struck me as so silly and silly but at the same time the thing that you know I was screaming about and I might may have literally been the only person in the country screaming about this stuff I actually went through Cavanaugh's judicial record with a fine-tooth comb hmm and I disagree with him on basically every decision he's ever made and that's not an exaggeration he's for warrantless NSA spying he rules with corporations 87% of the time he said that all of Obamacare is unconstitutional he ruled that the EPA cannot regulate greenhouse gas emissions he even goes as far as to say Donald Trump might be able to pardon himself so and that's I mean that's like that was one of the reasons why they think that Donald Trump was getting him in the first yeah but that's but that's like it was also part of the Patriot Act yes yes that's like the end of modern civilization type shit because you can't have somebody above rule of law that's like a dictator Emperor that's craziness so the thing that drove me crazy Joe is that here you have on all those important issues did you hear a single democratic politician bring that up in the conversations it wasn't it all about the accusations it was all about the announcement I'm not saying you can't bring up the accusations at all I think you can bring it up especially because some of them you know seem to have decent amount of evidence on their side and seem very measured and reasonable in their comments she can bring it up but it just annoyed me that there wasn't like a two-pronged strategy and trying to defeat it why do you think that is because the Democrats sucked Joe they suck is it just the suck it's then they suck in the end they and don't use any pressure to not bring up those issues no well maybe I guess maybe a little bit but Chuck Schumer for example cut a deal with Donald Trump just recently and he let him approve like I forget the exact number you guys can fact check me on this 6 or 10 different of trumps judges he cut a deal to approve them so the Democrats can go back home and campaign for the upcoming election but it's like hey douchebag the reason why you guys are struggling in elections is because you don't stand for anything so those people wanted you to fight on those judges because you're not supposed to agree with those judges because that's the goddamn opposition party yeah yeah I don't understand why they wouldn't bring up all those issues that you talked about before here is a demo 50hz I even because two long missions of 15 Trump judges yeah and see this is my problem with them is that you could give them an issue like take legalizing marijuana in exchange Dems facing re-election can go home to camp yeah yeah how ridiculous and this is what the Democrats do Joe is that like we were talking earlier about marijuana 62% of the country now wants legal marijuana the only democratic politician talking about it is Bernie Sanders and maybe a handful of others and if they ran on these issues and I can name a thousand others like raising the minimum wage ending the wars if they run those issues they'd win but they just don't do it yeah well I agree with you the Cavanaugh's take on all those issues are pretty fucking vile yeah but but and it did all those things disturb me what disturbed me most about what they were talking about in terms of his youth wasn't that he did bad things in his youth it's that he's lying about them now yeah yeah yeah if he said look when I was 17 years old I was stupid like many seventeen year olds and I drank but I never raped anybody yeah did stupid things and maybe I acted in sensitively and maybe I said some things that I should have said because I was a fool I am NOT a fool anymore and now I am a judge and now I think I'd make a great Supreme Court justice if he could say that but he didn't he got angry and like him like I've watched the video of him saying I like beer yeah it was do you like it he's asking a senator do you like it do you like it I like it like what does that fucking mean you were talking about you as a teenager when it's illegal to drink you stupid fuck and he also did a little sleight of hand there and said most of the seniors at the time could legally drink yeah why'd you say most of the seniors we're not talking about most the seniors we're talking about you he wasn't legally allowed to drink at the time but that's your right you're not it exactly right the problem was the lies Dubois he could have just said exactly what you laid out there but he didn't do it which again speaks to his credibility and it's kind of funny that the one woman if he did do that to her the one woman turns out to be a professor at this hugely progressive super liberal University who it's almost predominantly women like if you looked at how many women are professors at that university and how many women's I think it's something like 79 percent of the women are 79 percent of the students are women at that university and in some large number of the professor's are women as well yeah well well at least one of the allegations were bullshit against him yes no you know who was right Michael avenatti that anti-trump grifter who just wants to get his fucking name in the media he represented some woman and there's thousand holes in her story but this asshole cuz he wants to get his name in the spotlight he adds on to the other accusations and some of the other accusations do have merit and he blows up the whole thing so now the Republicans could turn around and go back look what we got here bullshit examples so it's all bullshit I think he did it now Sharpton that guy is a scumbag and by the way he was just a politican where I was yeah and he's listen he came out of nowhere he came out of nowhere and now he's talking about running for president who the fuck are you I saw someone say that they think he'd be great yeah well they see whoever said that's a fucking idiot well Bill Mark and I used to like him but he's gotten progressively worse and worse no pun intended on using the word progressive I think it was him on Sam Harris's show I'm thinking about it now I think it was him talking but his argument was Oh cuz I want a Democrat with balls and a Vinod he has balls yeah but the problem is a vanadis a piece of shit grifter I'm talking to make a presidential run apparently on extra they just posted this and why is the fucking mainstream media allowing this guy they're letting they're giving him free airtime Joe well this is the problem with the media why aren't you giving serious people free airtime why are you giving fucking economists or professors who are experts in social policy give people who know something some airtime this guy's obviously a grifter well they're giving him free airtime because people are gonna pay attention to the idea that he's gonna run for president because he was representing stormy Daniels and stormy Daniels fuck the president and this whole big fucking clown car circus event is it's something that people tune into it's basically an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians the presidential issue and imagine that's your guy like hey who are you oh I got famous because I represented stormy Daniels yeah like oh I was ingenious you are good gal and she she she fucked the guy and now she wants money the fact that that's like stormy Daniels has been in the news more than the genocide in Yemen which our weapons are being used to carry it out with I saw a fucked-up meme it's it's stormy Daniels is now going back to porn because Trump makes America work again that's actually true by the way she's she's going to strip clubs and stuff well I know she's been going to strip club so she got arrested that was fucked up she got there were these police officers who were super pro-trump and they went to one her strip club events and they just arrested her she did something that was bullshit and I'm no stormy Daniels fan but you don't just that so that was a political arrest it was just a fucked up thing you know what I went down in the rabbit hole on recently what MGK versus Eminem have you seen this who's MGK okay I was in the exact same boat as you like three weeks ago okay Jamie's all excited no no about black Twitter now no okay so so Eminem everybody knows legendary rapper one of the best rappers of all time broadly considered that he did an album where I guess he mentioned MGK because MGK who's another rapper years ago had tweeted something about machine gun cashing Gun Kelly oh well um GK and me bro I'm not trying to be cool I thought that his fucking name was in DC I did see that yeah so did you see the rap videos where they went back they were terrible both of them both sides killed himself I got sucked into a vortex where I was watching all the commentary on a tear I know it was but I I was fascinated by people's take this takes on it well people are saying oh Eminem murdered him and I listened to it was like this is terrible well the terror was kill shot terrible or was devil terrible they both Sun rose see he's not a rap guy so this doesn't I do like Brad and I'm only marginally around I like what I do yes I do I listen to a lot of rap okay that just felt like it was just I actually liked the MGK song though like the beat okay it was a good beat congratulations but he like ruined his car we as a result of it come on no that's look at the light that dislike on YouTube is like fucking 50% dislike why do you pay attention to that that's why I told you to avoid texts of it you can't pay attention that that's not representative of whether or not the guy has a career boosted his platen I mean that was the argument people said maybe he did it because even though he's this photos sort of what ended it he posted this saying like I win sort of with this large crowd behind them but he didn't tell them that he was opening her well he's opening for Fall Out Boy and this is yeah Fall Out Boy's crowd yeah he told them he took off his jacket at the last second said everyone turn around for a picture and then he got booed after this by the entire crowd yeah how do you know he got booed there's a video of it but did they boo actually what the booing videos was fake I do remember that I don't know if it was this one but I do know that he had a hoodie on or something and he took it off before this picture so they didn't know that he had that shirt on which is the cover of Eminem's album and you're right it was Fall Out Boy's crowd which is kind of a weird you know weaselly move of this guy to do I'm sleeping Oreos Joe doesn't care about the rap game Joe wants it's not that I don't care about the rap game it's this fucking these diss tracks are so lazy that it took the diss tracks to get me interested again that's what it took you had me interested because I remember back when was 50 cent versus Jadakiss and I fucking loved it kid I fucking loved that the Jadakiss rap was one of the best I thought I was the best battle rap I've ever heard well what about jay-z vs NAS that's a classic that was pretty that's a classic yeah and that did nothing but help both of them right uh you can't help nas more than help jay-z don't you think no you think jay-z vs nas help jay-z yeah black Twitter it's great you come back and tell you who's dating Twitter and all the memes off they run Twitter what yeah 25% of Twitter memes and everything is coming out of black Twitter 25% did you do the math it's a known fact bro and like bro I didn't plot that on my ass okay speaking of social media have you seen all these purges recently there's a new round of it that just happened know who got 800 or 800 or more accounts were purged from Facebook and Twitter and they're all almost all alternative media accounts so some of the sites are snowflakes was one I think on Facebook there's another one called anti media that was purged they're an anti-war media thing free thought project is another one I did this and there was cop watch at least the police was that was so basic and what they're saying is such a bullshit argument they said oh the reason we pulled this is because it's inauthentic behavior we're pulling these accounts because there's inauthentic behavior on those accounts what does that mean I don't know that's the point and they never clarified so what I think it means is hey these are you know these are alternative media outlets and we want to get rid of them so we're just gonna get rid of them because Facebook I know met with the Israeli government and Israel told them hey listen if you're gonna be in our country you're gonna get rid of certain accounts and Facebook went right along and said sure we'll do that well I think China with Google right but now I think they're doing that in the US now I think they're yes I think they're working in cahoots with the US government and so you have all these alternative media accounts that are specifically you know anti-war or what-have-you Anti Corruption some of these are okay and they're getting purged no the argument was inauthentic behavior yes that was one of the reasons they cited as to why they got rid he's inauthentic behavior does that mean that they're talking about instances that they're misrepresenting no I think it means more like bots that's how I interpret it it's like oh you know you're posting it and you're directing people to your own you know stuff and but everybody does that on Facebook and Twitter mm-hmm is it possible that that's that was going on I don't know I'm just asking is it possible they were using BOTS and perhaps directing them towards revenue creating sites my my whole thing is why shouldn't that be allowed well I'm not saying that shouldn't be allowed but is it possible that they were using stories that were taking place in the news distorting those stories to get people to click on things that would have links to ways that these people can make money so instead of it being some sort of political activism website that really was just a revenue-generating bullshit site that was trying to drum up artificial outrage I think for some of them it's certainly possible certainly not certainly not for the freethought project what is the free throw up project it's it's another one of these I think they describe themselves as like an anti-establishment or antique eruption you know thing where they cover all these stories related to government corruption kind of like a WikiLeaks type thing except they don't do the WikiLeaks does more the original reporting stuff and they'll just cover it after the fact and how many people Facebook deleted them Facebook I think I read of them if you I think there was an article in The Guardian Jamie if you're interested in pulling it up it's um Facebook and Twitter purged you know hundred sites yeah when you mix it was like I think it was mostly on Facebook like 600 or so on Facebook and the 200 or so on Twitter that they did and a lot of them were very like one of the accounts had over three million people who liked it now the free thought project what has their response been to this I don't know I know I can I only saw the original article I haven't seen anything after it you know this is a discussion that I was having with Ari the other day we were talking here this first they came for Alex Jones we told you you were next we were next we were this is on their website but they did cover in The Guardian and some other outlets in case anybody's thinking that this is BS yeah it is a scary time because you see that this can impact you know really anybody who's not toeing the line if you will like a police the police are we really gonna like do we really think that they pulled that down not for the obvious reason which is that you're sowing discord and the police don't like it as part of its purge Facebook has removed the pages of several police accountability watchdog critic groups including cop block the free thought project can police the police they've also apparently severely restricted the activity for the photography is not a crime page huh so do you think they're getting pressure from law enforcement I don't I don't know but I never usually believe in smoke-filled backroom conspiracies but they're starting to get hard to avoid because there's so many of these things man scroll down please here's what we need look at this and how does this poem end again it says first thing came for Alex Jones and Infowars but I wasn't race-baiting transfer over to spear see cultist who claims to murder children Newtown where our hoaxes and admit it in court that I'm just an entertainer who makes shit up so I said nothing yeah he's trying to be flippant about how Alex Jones was pulled the problem was once you bought into the principle of Alex Jones being pulled well then what you're saying is people who are executives that these companies can willy-nilly decide whoever they want to pull down now my answer to that has always been we should take Twitter Facebook these giant social media pages they can still be private companies but we should regulate them like their public utilities yeah that's the argument than our re and I were discussing is the only answer because you need to default to free speech now I'm not saying if somebody's daxing somebody or if somebody's directly threatening somebody and stuff like that there should be a process set up where you can ameliorate that and do it quickly but having said that you'd like people forget man the ACLU used to defend the KKK mm-hmm these course would already brought up yes and they said hey in Skokie they said hey listen we know we don't agree with these people we think their heinous we think they're terrible we think they're dead wrong but they have a right to say what they're saying because once you get rid of it for them what people don't realize Joe is that these things will always come back against people who are powerless and marginalized it's not like when you censor everybody gets together and we all go okay so it's just the Nazis right yes it's just the Nazis No first of all who's running these you know these organizations obviously they have their own opinions and their own vested interests and their own power dynamic issues and they're gonna take down whoever threatens their power now is are all these organizations still up on YouTube and Twitter and Google I don't know it to my knowledge the only one that totally got pulled down everywhere I think was Alex Jones he still has his own website here it says all but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community shortly after the purge on Facebook Twitter followers don't wiping out our profiles on there as well they gave absolutely no reason for the suspension said we had closed the free thought umbrella had close to six million followers Wow isn't that crazy and they just decided overnight what's crazy is I didn't even hear about the things well that's why I'm here yeah I appreciate you I mean I had heard that it was 800 different pages but the way I had read it and I unfortunately I don't have a lot of time and I was flipping through something I had read that it was a lot of anti-police pages some of them were anti-police but I think a lot of them were not a lot of them were anti-establishment Anti Corruption like they've always had it out for WikiLeaks for example yeah WikiLeaks has oh I mean you've had Mike Pompeo one of the top Trump administration officials says they're like a non-state terrorist actor think about that that's nuts that is pretty because it's basically what they do is what registers should you yes reporters should say hey here's what the bad guy here's what the people in the government are doing and this is the stuff that they're keeping secret that they shouldn't keep secret and our government goes oh that's terrorism now when Twitter or one of these people one of these organizations bans something like the free thought project do they make any statements or they just remove them all I saw what was on the Guardian article and on the Guardian they said it was inauthentic behavior was the reason why they were pulling them and maybe one or two other things that I'm forgetting at the moment that is a fucking weird statement I know authentic behavior yeah yeah it's fucked up man because they could just do it to anybody that's the point and that's what's so scary well that is what's scary right is that there are they are private companies and these people are allowed to post on them until they decide they're not allowed to post on them because they violate their Terms of Service but when your Terms of Service with are that open-ended inauthentic behavior like what the fuck does that even mean so they just they leave the Terms of Service purposefully vague so that they can get away with knocking off wherever they want to not good it's just weird that they all agreed that Facebook agreed and Twitter agreed like what would be the incentive of Twitter to follow suit what would be the incentive smoke-filled back room what would he say it was given to if you had to speculate okay what do you think would be given to them that would give them the incentive to want to pull a site like jorssy guy seems pretty socially progressive I think they are meeting just like what we said we know they did this with Israel where they pulled down pro-palestinian Human Rights pages to allow Facebook to function in their country they said you have to do X Y & Z I think that there are meetings with I don't know exactly who it is our intelligence agencies law enforcement FBI I don't know somebody like that people maybe CEOs of various corporations where they say hey man listen these people are problem these people are problem these people are a problem let's do the right thing here I would like to hear a contrary argument well I don't know I would like to immediately I would like no like what is the what is the contrary argument is there anything that we're missing if if we want we could try to find the Guardian article and read what they said what Twitter says what Twitter and Facebook said see if you could find that you know the Guardian article it's not coming up pulled it off the internet Guardian what was the headline searched it and went on news and like there was no articles from The Guardian by the way the only tools dumped the only two things I found the only two things I found it on RT and the Guardian and nothing else which is why you didn't hear about it because mainstream media didn't talk about it because guess what these outlets oftentimes our competition to mainstream media what the fuck man that is so the Alex Jones thing is really like a test run almost pretty much searching on their website from the Guardian website we thought project ok using Google to do it and the top article is something about food in 2013 okay well when we get off air I'll do a search and we could see if we could find the statement yeah but when we get off air is not helping all those people listen to us right now they saw the article from the free thought beyond Jack and that says the same information we just don't have the exact statement from Twitter and Facebook on it that's the only thing see if you can just google statement from Twitter was involved the free thought that wasn't in the article they just threw it in the middle of the article it was like Facebook and Twitter purges accounts for I don't know if it's at an authentic behavior in the title but it was in an article somewhere so you really think that there's some sort of smokey backroom deals where they say listen do you you guys are making tons of money we've got a bit of an issue here let's work through this this is what we want removed these people are causing us a bunch of problems I don't know but I do know they did that in Israel I do know they do that in all these countries where the government say hey in order to function here you have to do XY and Z right so why wouldn't they do that in the US hmm that's what I would say to that but what groups would want the free thought project or police the police removed well you got to remember a lot of these so the police accountability groups I mean it's pretty easy law enforcement would want to remove right what do you think law enforcement has the kind of poll to go to Twitter and snot like though you know whatever the Police Department in Alito but if the FBI may be sure or the CIA or you know whoever major law enforcement central law enforcement the thing that people kept going to with Alex Jones was Sandy Hook Sandy Hook he said children didn't yield you don't have to defend Alex Jones on the merits of that point because he's dead wrong on that point where understanding is the principle of letting somebody speak I understand yeah that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is there's no thing that they're going to on this so it's like there's already been a precedent set they could just remove people so they remove him they got this really got here it got sloppy er yeah well it got more clandestine because there's no there's no big smoking gun there's no nothing it's just false in there yanked yep that's right and again no major mainstream media outlet in the u.s. reported on it RT is Russia today Jamie's got some okay this is of all media by Facebook yes that's pushing back just a beginning censorship inspector they may cite the Guardian article in this article as I saw this article when I did vote that came out it's us at fishing back today from today this is from today today okay I saw a different RT article on the same scroll down and make that a little bigger please hmm so that so people are starting to catch on to it scroll left so we could see there we go the latest a parent of an apparent censorship of political speech online us-based tech giant's this month shut down hundreds of user accounts some belong to well-established alternative media outlets with hundreds of thousands of followers like the freethought project or anti media senior fellow with German Marshall Fund leading think-tank advocating us global supremacy seems to have at least partially taken credit for this it says in quotes Russia China and other foreign states take advantage of our open political system Jamie fly said they can invent stories that got repeated and spread through different sites so we are just starting to push back just this last week Facebook began began starting to take down sites so this is just the beginning okay so what they're say that these websites have been infiltrated by people from China and Russia is that what they're saying but scroll back up again please stop it said China and other foreign states take advantage of our open political system Russia China and so that is that is somebody from the German Marshall Fund elite instinct tank advocating US interests saying that because we're so scared of Russia Russian Chinese Russian and Chinese infiltration that's why we got to pull down so in other words they're saying hey maybe these accounts like the free thought project are run by people who are trying to destroy America because we have to pull them down exactly and beyond a preposterous argument this is what they're saying they're saying they can invent stories they get repeated and spread through different sites so we're just starting to push back just this last week Facebook again started to take down sites this is just the beginning so they're they're blaming the influence of Russia and China and that they're saying that this is their excuse for taking down these pages because these pages are being compromised by foreign agents it's the oldest trick in the book to say oh these foreign entities are sowing discord in the United States so therefore we're not going to allow this dialogue to happen in fact I remember they blamed Russia for black lives matter Facebook pages during the 2016 election but what's fucked up about this is there's not even any smoking gun there's there's no evidence they just say it right they're not poor but they're not even pointing to a specific example yeah that's right any example yes you're correct scroll down and see if there's anything in this that makes any sense according to the account fly complained that any person with an email could set up an account on social media and potentially reach a wide audience you're complaining of a long global struggle to fix the situation Jesus Christ oh great he started his career in the US political circles as an advisor to George W Bush administration oh it's always trust those people right also a foreign policy and national security consultant for the Senator Marco Rubio these are the geniuses who should regulate the internet right these guys been wrong about everything reliably well this is the thing if you could just say oh the Russians have influenced the the Russians are a part of this the Chinese okay pull it it's hacky and it's partisan and it actually works on four on the left and the right sometimes it works on corporate Democrats and people who want to blame Hillary's election laws on the Russians and it works like that played that let's hear him talk see me a little bit of it can I jump go to the bathroom real quick okay I'll be right back as one of our greatest strengths and therefore one of the best ways to weaken us so I think that that's one of the key things to understand here is Putin's acting actually out of weakness and why have we Jaime not come to understand or at least the consciousness in this country does not necessarily view Putin aligned with other strongmen figures this has been a long-running problem in American foreign policy this is not just a problem that started with President Donald Trump I served in the Bush administration President George W Bush tried to form a relationship with Vladimir Putin to get certain things to advance US national security President Obama tried the same thing with his reset of Russian us-russian relations so it's not unusual that you have an administration that maybe doesn't necessarily view Russia as the threat that it is I think the the politics of this the public opinion right now it's very interesting because you've actually seen a shift over the last several years more Democrats now actually think actually view Russia and Putin as a threat compared to where they were stopped here's a copy boy this gives you it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth is that the idea that these people are just deciding to remove pages and they're going on television giving these interviews saying that it's because of Russia and Putin without any evidence so creep maybe they didn't share the evidence but you got to say something man I mean if you want to be if you believe in a free society and you believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression and you censorship censor people or shit bro what's going on here I'll fix it I would only go with that and maybe that um what happened nothing they don't have a fix for the for the way that it's happening so if you show the evidence then you're literally like showing the criminals how to how to do this and it could just run room or ramp it and they got to plug more holes well that would be the devil's advocate position but you in order to take people down the thing is if they're doing it and no one's pushing back you're just gonna be able to do it with anybody that disagrees if you were anybody that's going to be an impediment to your political campaign or anyone's get in the way of anything that you're trying to push through and this is this is a giant issue with people that have that kind of power that can influence Facebook or Twitter and if that's the case and look we don't know we haven't talked to Zuckerberg we haven't talked to Jack Dorsey we don't know who's who's pulling strings or who's asking them to do things or what evidence they presented to them but that's just very uncomfortable it's very uncomfortable to see that guy talking and bringing up Russia and Putin because people bring them up like they're the boogeyman you know this is what's with Russia and Putin they're they're they're interviewing with our democracy interfering with our issues here in America and they will they want to ruin democracy and bring our country down from the inside yeah it was like the internet went through a phase of like just totally free and open wild wild west type thing and now it looks like they're trying to reel it back in and it's like that's the view does the public square it's supposed to be that these social media outlets which are so gigantic and so powerful that this is now the public square so to be able to censor people in these in these forums should be considered unconstitutional coordinated inauthentic behave oh you found it you found Arden spamming hmm but again the like the websites that they actually pulled down that totally destroys their argument even if you buy into the premise that these are this is a good reason to pull somebody down I mean some of the people the the pages they pulled down were so well established and there are of course not inauthentic in any way it's people who are running these pages that really deeply care about these issues and want to get this news out to people fuck this is a good quote here drawing the line between real and inauthentic views is a difficult Enterprise that could put everything from impartial political parody to genuine but outlandish views on the chopping block and by the way you there are politicians in the US this happened during the debate between Ted Cruz and bethe O'Rourke all at the exact same time with the exact same hashtags there were protec Cruz things tweeted out at once so what that is they're bots that they bought to help Ted Cruz win the election that's election interference that's inauthentic behavior and nobody is talking about pulling down those accounts look at what says here in a statement posted online newsroom facebook says it purged those pages because their owners were using fake accounts sharing the same content between multiple pages and linking to ad supported websites it calls ad farms so what does that even a controversial this is where it gets interesting it says but what the social network calls spam the owners of these pages call standard procedures for operating on Facebook yeah that was like I don't even think if the argument from Facebook is correct that that really is a reason to pull them down we're good it says here nearly all the page owners contacted by the Guardian say they use backup or fake accounts hmm along with their real ones they do it in part to protect themselves from being targeted by political opponents and having their real accounts end up in facebook jail reverb press a left-leaning news site whose Facebook page disappeared yesterday so this is on the left and the right they're censoring people because you got snowflakes on the right there's another one right wing news that was pulled down stop scrolling please but but look at this this is really interesting there so they're admitting to disingenuous behavior though they're using fake accounts to protect themselves from being targeted by political opponents well it's so but that's if that's the case they are violating facebook policy so I've seen this on Twitter I know people who have gotten their accounts banned on Twitter but they create a new account and they stay on Twitter and that's technically a violation to Terms of Service but it also is something that I don't think is egregious at all right but a big difference between someone getting banned and then starting a fake a second account this is not that they're they're using multiple accounts at the same time and some of them are fake look I'm not I'm not justifying their being banned but I am saying that they violated certain procedures and they did so in order to public publicize their ideas and they did it to try to make their ideas more you know just more project them more have more more bandwidth but according to Facebook should you not be allowed to have like three or four accounts where you tweet the same stuff or post the same stuff because this means ice book said though what Facebook said if you scroll back up to the beginning scroll back up to the beginning please the top the top top see what it says a coordinated inauthentic behavior and spamming so they were spamming and that does sound like coordinated inauthentic behavior if they have a bunch of alternative fake sites and fake pages that they're using to spread their stuff look I'm not saying that they should have been the this is I think better would be to say hey you can't do that you got to remove these fake pages that are publicizing your ideas and just have your real authentic page but what they're saying is that they're they're leaking to ad farms and that they use this to publicize their pages and that everybody does it so watch everybody does it you're not supposed to do it so why wouldn't they pull that so let's say the free thought project had three or four other things where they were posting the same stuff under a different name why would you not pull down to three or four other things and leave up to fit the free thought project I think they're saying cuz the free thought project violated their Terms of Service you're not supposed to do that they don't want them to do that I don't know see here's the thing would they have pulled the free thought project down if they had engaged in any of these forbidden behaviors ah my opinion is I think yes maybe that's what I think maybe but that is gross you're not supposed to do that and I'm not saying that they they should be pulled they shouldn't be pulled but maybe they thought this is what they have to do to get the word out and maybe Facebook is like hey you fucks or spamming and you're you're linking to these ad phone arms and these ad farms have been known to you know be influenced by Russia and China and all these other organizations you're doing it just to promote your sights but we're saying that we can't allow that kind of behavior it just strikes me as very strange that when you have examples like the one I just gave wear during the Ted Cruz beta or Orton to me they all tweeted the same thing at the same time it was obviously paid for by some right-wing think-tank you never hear the story of something like that if it's benefiting a u.s. politician or something like when Mitt Romney bought like a million fake followers on Twitter in the 2012 election you never hear about like okay we targeted that it's always like oh just happens to be these independent alternative media outlets that are spreading information that the government doesn't want people to know well it could be that these people are saying hey look everybody does this we're gonna do this and they're saying we don't like them there oh and look we caught them doing something we we don't allow yeah let's sweep them but that's possible but is it possible that they wouldn't have been removed if they hadn't done this shit they're not supposed to do it's possible but I don't think it's likely I don't know though because here's the thing how look if it's only people who have engaged in these forbidden behaviors that get removed then Facebook has a very good argument but if Facebook is saying this but then people are removed who are straight above board doing everything the right way just have their own page posted information on their own page and they were never removed but these are all political and alternative media which is interesting so they were targeted yes right so they're targeted but in the targeting them they found a bunch of shit that you're not supposed to do and that's what got them removed I think that there is a good argument that Facebook could make which is very much a nuanced role Terms of Service argument but I think it's more of a veneer or a facade than the real horn of why they did what they did but again my opinion I'm not stating that as a fact I agree with you I mean surely what they should have done especially given the popularity sites is warn them and say hey you've got to stop doing this because if you don't we are going to remove you you were violating our Terms of Service you're linking to ad farms and you have posted from multiple fake accounts stop doing that just use your one authentic account we support free speech that's what we would both like right yeah sure yeah I mean it could be also that they feel like the right-wing sites do this we have to do this too this is how people do it in 2018 is how you really get the word out true yeah you know I just I found it interesting that it was all alternative media medical accounts Andrew short left it was just did the the main thing that seemed to be the connecting tissue through it all was relatively anti-establishment right right it's gross it is gross man have you been following what's happening with Iran at all no I have not there's a little bit of ramping up of tensions now so of course we pulled out of the Iran deal the nuclear deal I don't think that was a good idea because according to the IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency they verified that six different times Iran was following that deal and Trump pulled out of it anyway that hurt our you know diplomatic talks if you will and then this story broke a few weeks ago the International Criminal Court so Iran sued the US and according to the International Criminal Court they said hey we can't we're not allowed to sanction them when they allow any humanitarian goods so our response to that was to say fuck off International Criminal Court we're now pulling out of the International Criminal Court so talks have basically totally broken down and now the fear is that we could be on the road to war because we have neocon john bolton who's in the Trump administration who's always wanted war with Iran we have Mike Pompeo who also wants war with Iran and it's just it's it's not a good situation because we had a pretty solid deal there and now it's more likely Iran gets a new kit and the tensions are ramping up and if they blocked it because Iran's economy is imploding right now and if we block their oil exports that's when you know that we're about to do some sort of regime change action over there dude I have to end this unfortunately you have anything happy to say before we wrap this up no I don't for ten secular talk give out your YouTube address again sure it's youtube.com slash secular talk and on Twitter on kolinsky Kyle we got to do this more often all the time I don't know but next time I'm back I'll definitely be on thanks brother okay shit you man thanks man appreciate you appreciate it all right folks we'll be back see ya [Music]
