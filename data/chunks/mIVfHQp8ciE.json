the gyro can experience I here's how so so I've got just about been open for nine years with CSA we had 0 members when we started I've got about 39 so what was the motivation the motivation was that I spent it was always a passion I was doing martial arts when I was a child that was fighting I just wasn't making money doing it and then I got into that other life and did that for about 15 years and I was being paid to protect people that could afford it but maybe didn't deserve it for a very long time unfortunately that's the way it works it's a true way of looking at it because I was doing it at the highest level you know I wasn't doing security work at the you know Kids Choice Awards standing right you know I was Jim Carrey yeah yeah for two hours saying I'm Jim Carrey's bodyguard right so it's one of those things where I saw it at the very highest level and it just it turned me off after a while because you know you you're just you're you're being a babysitter to people who have money even with the biggest threats you know from Iraq Afghanistan Haiti run down the list it wasn't about helping people and always wanted to help people yes so when I when I opened the gym that was the goal was to help people and it turned into that gym and this is why I feel that our gym model is successful is because tonight at 5:30 during a boxing class my professional fighters are going to be in class with everyone else there's no pro team only practice everybody trains together everybody works together the model is for people you want to get in shape wonderful you're gonna get into shape you want to have stress relief wonderful you want to become a fighter wonderful I don't have a fight team practice tryout or any of that you come to the gym you put in the work you support the team you train side by side with world champions you get better you have a good time it's a huge family gym it's a huge family environment and the mixture of the self-defense and the fighting and the fitness one doesn't need the other so unlike like an aka and I love hobby but the is about the fighters and if fighters lose that's people go out the back door for me I can have a fight or lose my memberships not going to matter why people are still going to come they're still going to train they're still gonna support they're still gonna buy tickets and that's been the recipe and because the gym is that way it's allowed me to have this model where I don't charge Pro fighters you're remarkably normal oh thanks I know people are we struck at how normal I am I'm like it's like wow really I think my main issue the maze I guess seeing a famous child and yeah yeah that's a very unusual maze yeah my life is unique to me that's what I like to say you know yeah and I'm almost like a peerless person like to a certain extent there's not too many people I can look left and right and we you know I I'm like we have similar experiences yeah is there anybody that you ever contacted like Jodie Foster or someone who has made it through and seems pretty put together not really no not really I mean it's kind of a weird cold call you know hey Jodie Foster such a small clan of people like if a comic called me that I knew you know they wanted to talk to me I would talk to them because it's such a small kind of people I mean we do have our weekly therapy sessions yeah Jodie Foster you know yeah like we all get together and yeah we we weep you know it's actually do primal screaming that's what we do I was describing what it was like I have a friend who Ricky Schroder who is yeah obviously he was very famous for news young as well and one of my favorite theme songs TV theme songs and I was saying like the way you developed is not like the way the recipe calls mm-hmm like the recipe calls for you to have a childhood and try to figure out life and then become a man and try to find yourself and then try to find your path and by the time you became a man he was already famous and the same thing with you you were already famous hmm as you were developing and learning yeah you know yeah IIIi don't know exactly how to like kind of even describe it because it's always the way my life has been kind of thing get in the same way that like a lot of kids like you know they go out and they you know catch bugs and place a lot baseball or whatever like yeah just like yeah like that's the way it is like you don't really realize how unique the whole situation is until you have perspective because you have nothing to compare it to really other than I guess TV shows and movies Lang's like that so I knew that my upbringing was unique you know I knew it was different but at the same time it's kind of just it's not until you get some perspective some life experience but until you really realize that oh wait this was this was particularly weird so you brought up an interesting what would Leopold do and yeah I mean this disciple you know father of modern wildlife ecology started the first program of wildlife ecology at University of Wisconsin in the 1940s populations of deer in the northern part of Wisconsin were growing by leaps and bounds and they were dramatically changing the landscape you know denuding the landscape you know eating the eastern white cedar and deer in northern latitudes tend to yard together in the wintertime and so Leopold knew that this was you know deleterious to the long-term viability of that ecosystem soon he took people out landowners out hunters out into these deer yards in the spring to show them how there was nothing to eat within reach of a deer on its hind feet and there were bodies a dead deer that had starved through the wintertime in order to demonstrate to them the consequences of mismanagement of deer herds so he he was a real proponent of showing people the results of doing things the wrong way in education so I think you know it comes back it's what we're trying to do not saying that you know we're Leopold Ian or anything like that but education getting information out getting accurate information out it's maybe one of the biggest things we can do like no one ever feels like they're anything special and you always like if they're any good they don't know and you always ruthlessly self-critical and trying to get better I mean I work with big actors big big rock stars and the big rock stars like one big rock star once one time said to me I opened he said is there anyone out there I said like nineteen thousand people you smell the wd-40 that's how they got the last thousand people in are you kidding he said I'm always worried that no one's gonna show up I said when has that ever been your problem he said well never but who is this Aussie Jesus Christ yeah who's just one of my favorite people Jesus he's another guy he's honest how many people were like in some Floridian megaton and he goes out there and the place goes nuts this show was great of course and I said you worry about people don't show I'll get really depressed man okay and you know I did the Beacon Theater once many years ago in New York beautiful room loved that place I I was I was a few days later I was at MTV doing something with like Matt Pinfield or somebody I was living in New York and I'm leaving and the courtesy lady she said hey George Carlin is in the greenroom and he wants to meet you and went wait a minute dumb question the George Carlin because I've been listening to that guy since I was in eighth grade class clown and occupation fool actually came out for me to go to the record store they were not nice price records they were what was on that's how old I am memorized in my eighth grade of course and I said George Carlin wants to meet me okay walk in and there's George Carlin he's there to promote his next HBO thing and he's gonna do like like multiple nights at the Beacon Theater place I would never sell out he was gonna do a monk there or whatever and he said ham I said mr. Karl Azam I'm George I'm like wow he said oh you did a book signing the other night at Tower Records I said yeah ah man was so close in line for like half an hour and finally I got so cold I went home I said you waited in line to meet me like yeah I'm like why don't you just walk in like oh I can't do that man and we and he said so you just worth the beacon I said yeah I was amazing he said did they get the jokes I said oh oh okay I'm not that's not really what I do I said I'm sorry what do you mean he goes like did did did can you get to the audience from that stage I said it's actually a pretty big place it's a lot of feet to before the first row I said yeah I said you're George Carlin I think you're gonna do okay but he was sincerely wondering like is it gonna be okay in there I'm like are you kidding you were handcuffed with Lenny Bruce in the back of a cop car and you're asking me if it's gonna be okay yeah it's a great book it's in that great book ladies and gentlemen Lenny Bruce Alex Jones cannot now go I'll just go to the other YouTube hey just go to the other Facebook there is another so we have to recognize that the way we are organized as a society that the town square is now owned by corporations who'd that need to be regulated right like if like before if you know when AT&T was the phone carrier for everybody they couldn't go I'm not gonna give Alex Jones a phone service because I don't like the shit he's saying okay that so you know we you can't deny services somebody all that stuff that's not really valid comparison because the phone service wasn't distributed information to people right the phone service is just a method of communication it was just a utility with what he's been able to do through Infowars is if you've got him on your platform he's gonna say some things and he's gonna use your platform to say some things that you know might not be true it might be crazy so you got to decide like when does it become a problem and I think where they drew the line with Sandy Hook so here's what I say Joe we need to treat these as public utilities because they are right Facebook there is no alternative there is an alternative to YouTube we need to regulate them it's long overdue by the way and they are monopolies we that's obvious to everyone that their monopolies but you know when you when you invent something called whatsapp and then Facebook vices for twenty billion dollars there's AB innopolis there's no way there's no way to to compete with these people so these are monopolies they need to be regulated and people need to be protected it it that's how that's where we need to go because right now we're leaving it up to the whims of a billion I'll you say hey if Alex Jones really did some shit that was wrong and he should be taken off or his free speech should be a bridge for it do it let's see it go to a court or go to a thing or good people go well he docks his people and it is if Daxing is illegal he should be prosecuted if that's what happened but you shouldn't take away did he docks people that's what they're saying they're saying he's died he's wanted he docks people from Newtown or whatever from the school shooting so that's what we talked about the individuals that he gave their addresses in their lamps that's what they were saying that he ducky but let's let's find out if you actually did that does that sounds crazy i i'm i don't know if he did but they're not saying what he actually did this is what's crazy i keep hearing that he promoted the idea that Sandy Hook was a false it was false and that it was a false flag and that these were all actors right i don't know if he actually said that I think what he actually said was I don't know if that happened I think that's what he actually said and people are saying well that's promoting the idea that that it was a hoax so but I want to know if that's what he really said see I don't know if that's even the case because I've heard it I've heard it written that he promoted the idea that Sandy Hook was a conspiracy but I they're not quoting then when they say that there's no quotes there's no Sandy Hook was a hoax those kids were actors those kids are not dead I don't see that anywhere right but they keep attributing that to him without quotation but again if this if there was some kind of process due process we could go back and look at the transcript and we would notice not only that if during this whole time where he's being tried he was still labeled to be on YouTube and have his videos he could show in his videos that he didn't say that he could show what he actually said and tell you what he actually said and show clips he can't do that anymore so now the narrative is completely in the hands of the mainstream media a hundred percent so the alex jones narrative is being taken 100% out of his hands and now it's in the mainstream media and now there's a Sandy Hook denier conspiracy theorists right-wing lunatic all these different things which Mayor some of it mean Alex my fucking nuts [Applause]
