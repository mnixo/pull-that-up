these are pretty cool and we're live hello Steve yeah that's the Kanye one that's the most recent that's us guy past a cell phone Tran he creates all these hand paints each one yeah he sculpts it and then he makes like a mold and yeah and he's got a bunch of dope ones it's all online and you kind of book bro I do call that noise blue the color of noise yeah what's this about it's my memoir it's um talks about the beginnings goes through my process it goes through a lot of differents things I mean at the end of the day it's been more so it's more about it's less about what's happening now and more about like how I got there you know the story and different piecemeal stories that that are thematic and you know with this overarching idea of blue which is like the different shades of blue of my life it's my favorite color and actually my last name is means blue tree really yeah yeah so it's like there's a lot of synergy with the color so when I was coming up with the idea to name the book you know I had to think of like you know something that relates throughout my whole life so there's so many different shades emotions feelings that are represented and all these different stories do you have you always been a writer I'm like yeah I guess like a piecemeal writer you know I I needed help finishing this book there's no doubt about it I had so much it's like you know cuz I still like you know of the pen and paper still you know like I grew up before before computers and all that stuff I was when I was writing lyrics for my bands I was always like a notepad so I had just so many different stories I didn't know how to put it all together I started the inception of writing you know these different stories of my life six years ago and then I shot a documentary for Netflix and we dropped it called it's called I'll sleep when I'm dead we dropped it three years ago four years ago for 2015 to the sixteen I think and and I after I saw the reception and how people responded to the dock then I knew that like you know this is really gonna take shape this is gonna be front centers finishing and and writing a proper memoir so the the idea of writing a memoir is only the idea of writing and writing about yourself it's only to write this memoir you sound like you you write on a regular basis no no no I mean you know like I am actually coming up with some new ideas for the next you know conception of what I would put out there in book form because it's a different process for me that's quite exciting just so like the challenge to do something like this because I'm my natural way to express myself is through music and and I love being able to step outside my comfort zones I think at the end of the day when you do that enough you just you just get better as a human being yes and try you know if you always do the same thing over and over again you're never really learning so it's uh it's it's been like a great learning process you know putting out this memoir and and and in like actually opening up there's a vulnerable side to who I am that I don't necessarily I don't talk about really you know people that know me like my fans or my music fans or anyone else that knows Stevie okay they don't really know what's in this book you know they might have a glimpse of it for my documentary which I did because I talked really deeply about my relationship with my father and and like this drive that I have as a kid to make it and and it shows you enough where it's okay now I have a little bit more than my live shows and what's already out there but this goes you know obviously a lot deeper because it's a book and we're going through emotions and the vulnerability and and and I want to tell stories of the hardships and at the end of the day I want to speak to young kids out there you have young people out there even older people that are trying to figure that their own thing out and and because the documentary related in so many ways on the personal level that I shared there this is how I wanted to share that through my own words do you find that writing these things down and just thinking about your life and and trying to express it in a way that's gonna resonate with people that this helps you think about it and helps you sort of categorize it and put it all in your head and cuz do you know any Wang do you know what that is yeah yeah chef yeah yeah yeah his friend of mine great guy and writes every day and I asked him why I'm like why are you writing he's he's written books but he's he writes to sort of collect his own thoughts yes yeah hundred percent it's like once you that's the trigger for me because even when I read I write right after like what I gained from it almost like it's like my note my homework yeah for retention on on what I gather it took away from what I'm reading so I'm always like reading and writing or writing scribbling in my in my book or or like writing off the side in a notepad or like now like you know I look at a tablet or something but it's like you need to gather your your your headspace so you have retention yeah you write to understand right yeah and any right to express it so that other people can understand yeah and in that process you kind understand yourself better right and that's that's how sort of Eddie described in when he said it to me I was like god dammit I don't write enough like that I write more comedy stuff I'm trying to write material and essays on things and pull jokes out of them right but like I think there's probably a great benefit for anybody to just sort of write about your thoughts yeah your diary you know you know I mean there's something to that because in that time I mean you could speak to this cuz you've written a book on yourself but in that time of writing about yourself and reflecting upon your life you probably learn a little bit about who you are and why you're the way you are yeah and you know thinking about this I never really thought about it to this point or have found the the parallel here but when I started seeing a therapist to go into my past and try to break down what like why make the decisions I do or like why I spiral out here or do something that I'm not comfortable with or I want to change a lot of that I'm able like after these sessions I go and start writing you know and a lot of that you know eventually makes it in the book do you write longhand or do you write on keyboard I would do both now I do both but like I have scribbles and stuff everywhere you know but then I'm it like at the end of the day for organizational purposes it's just got to go and like yeah how'd you put it in the computer yeah you know but um yeah this is a very this is my own therapy you know as you could say it's like it is putting all these stories and these memories and the feelings and the emotions and the hardships whatever might be you know it's like I think the hardest part is like picking the right ones you know the other day when you've put all this stuff together and you spend so much time on this do you find that the process of that and anyway enhances your music yes it does because I mean when I think about first of all I think about the process of making music I think about it very simple similar to what you're doing when you're when you write for your comedy skits and you're efficient you're like okay this is gonna work as I'm going to be able to share it this way you're not just running your thoughts down okay so like when I'm in the studio I'm very efficient you know I'm like I'm going and going I'm gonna make a club banger just for the festival so the crowds go crazy and it's less about the emotional message you know what with this being able to talk about that side that's that adds that other layer that that I'm seeing now more than ever in the last like three or four years when I started making songs with lyrics that actually you know I've you know I've seen the fans come out and drove saying how much it's gotten them gotten them through hard times because of lyrics were able to speak to them a certain way so it's and that's the essence of collaboration at the end of the day you know working with songwriters and singers and and being able to be pulled in that direction is incredible as an artist you know instead of just having like alright we're making this record to make everyone go crazy even though essentially electronic dance music is all about the music you know it's not about you know the touching layer Erick's they might be like the flavouring on top but the the foundation is all about the beat you know but now it's like about mixing both worlds as much as possible you know at the end of the day when you think about my shows it's a very full-on experience like when I when I put on a show I'm trying to like I'm trying to come compound all the senses you know I want to be entertaining as hell I want it to be fun engaging I want you to leave knowing that you saw a Steve Aoki show so that's why I try to do different unique things like you know I cake people I don't know if you know this pie cake people at my shows take them you hit them in the head cakes yeah I would say the head but yeah but this is all consensual by the way so Munoz story this so you know I think as you are on the stage all the time you want to make your skits do you want to make you everything that you do unique to Joe Rogan you know like you don't want to be like oh yeah he's a copy of this person no one wants to be that you know so I'm thinking like what am I going to do is going to be unique and different engaging hey ho you know like everyone's doing that everyone sit down everyone jump so you know I'm like you know your brains always thinking so I got an idea after a song that I really sell my label I have my own label and we we released this artist where the video was cakes exploding in people's faces super slow motion high-def really beautiful and then I was like you know what I'm gonna go to a bakery I'm gonna buy a cake scribble like the song on the top of the cake and let's just see what happens it'll be funny little thing you know and I brought the kisses 2011 mind you so this is seven years or however long ago that was you know a long time ago didn't do the math anyway so it was a long time ago and I walked around the front of stage and won that one of the kids in the front one of the guys front was like why is he walking around the front like am I supposed to like grab it and then he just starts pointing at his face and then all his friends around him are pointing at him and the whole place was just staring and and watching and wondering what the hell is gonna happen so I caked him we filmed it before this is pre Instagram put up on YouTube it's like I gotta do a seven show this is incredible and then six months later people started coming out with cake me signs six years later okay here we go so six years later like if I think I've caked over 15,000 people now you know you had it right in the mug too dude perfect shot I'll tell you I mean you know it's just practice makes perfect you know you've thrown 15,000 cakes I get together you get a feel for a look at her she's dancing yeah wiping it out let me see more time this is like that was ultra oh my goodness we have a cake rider we have very specific cakes that are you know at our show you have it's like a special aoki cake what is in it the strange thing is there's like not as much cake as you would think it's just like frosting it's just so it just explodes everywhere so it's less bread yes just so like less carbs more sugar well you diabetic just get out of the front roll please crazy thing for people to enjoy - yeah caked in the face yeah it was having a good fucking time yeah that's good that's the most important thing at the end of the day is like it shows cake me with a bull's eye okay this is very normal for me to see you know like some cases there's like 50 50 people with signs up no crazy look at that cake face yeah I mean it's just of it's a signature part of the show it's fun it's exciting dude I need to go to one of your shows because everybody that I know that's been says it's a wild experience it's not just music it's just there's something like you're doing something transformative you know that people come out of there they're just like wooo they're buzzin yeah yeah I am that's the goal you know and if I if I feel like I'm doing that if I feel like I'm really having this impact then I go that not that's why I end up doing like so many shows because I on average I'm doing about 250 around the world every year that is so crazy and I do this I've done this consistently for over 12 years so it's it's a it's not like an artist that just drops an album and then they tour like around the world for a year or two like I'm on I'm on a worldwide tour you know every every single year is that sustainable how's your body holding up yeah I work out a lot yeah you're really in health and wellness and all that stuff but that seems insane particularly with all the travel it does I mean you have to you have to like treat yourself at like an athlete that's for sure the way I think about my regimen is different you know and I and I'm like obsessed with trying out new ideas using myself as a guinea pig to work with different scientists sleep doctors you know different people and if you are testing new ideas to like deal with jet lag or things that I am dealing with there on the road that that can wear you down and make it not sustainable due to IVs like stem-cell no no like a vitamin like my mom's right like that not as no I don't but I you know like at one point I was I wasn't down the same road as rakers well doing 250 vitamins a day but I was probably you know experimenting with about 50 have you met him I have here's an interesting dude yes he has quite a trip he behind his eyes there's a lot going on yeah absolutely and am I so like I have a whole album series called neon future so I have neon future one two and three that just came out my out my albums in each album I actually work with a scientist on a song oh wow so I'd Ray Kurzweil's on on one so he's talking on a song about like life expansion and life extension I'm big singular not necessary singularity nut but like I'm a big fan of the idea that we can live indefinitely on both enthusiasts of that world I might not not definitely not an expert but I'm an enthusiast for sure yeah and I got JJ Abrams on to I got I'll be degree on - OH aging f5 mom's well yeah yeah and like I interviewed him I went to I went to Ray's rakers Wells apartment in in the bay area was yeah yeah so I mean would I know that we have lot of synergies on the science and tech stuff and three at Bill Nighy Wow and four which is coming out next year I'm having my favorite author on the album that I've read so far so I'm very excited of III you know I might as well now I might as well announce it here if I'm going to announce that anywhere okay I haven't announced it yet but you've all her re oh wow I love that guy yeah sapiens is amazing yeah savings my favorite book I'm on the second one right now yeah I just finished homo Davis and I mean he has a very like see I think of the future very positively it's a neon future yeah he doesn't think so Rosie yeah but you know I like his I like his uh his analysis and you know the way he's trying to understand how we've evolved or pushed out outwards you know and I agree with a lot of what he's saying well one of what he's saying is irrefutable but what's interesting is the way he sort of coalesce is it the way it combines at all and you really get a sense of wow this is what a person is like this is how it all went down you know he's a brilliant guy too I've seen him interviewed really fascinating character ya know yeah yeah I'll be do graze it trippy dude too because he drinks so much I know I've hung out with him and like pint after pint I'm like hey man aren't you supposed to be the fucking wellness longevity God yeah he's so in entrenched in science that he thinks that the solutions are going to come through the laboratory right he he he doesn't seem to exercise if he does I think he just Rose a boat have you seen that like he like Rose boats around the harbor wherever he lives in England and he drinks I think it's in his beard though the booze the beard the beard is's his like magical wizardry you know actually that's against science but but uh yeah he's a very interesting guy he jump in in my house he jumped in my foam pit watching my 50 year old man with the beard down to his blows nipples jump into a foam pit section pretty cool that is cool a scientist as well you know just like you know it's cool you want to be silly yeah yeah exactly you know like and I have a you know out the Aoki foundation which I'm wearing it's um obsessed with the human brain so all of our our money that we raise goes to brain research organizations brain science orgs and but also like orgs that deal with anti-aging or anything that's interesting that relates to you know living longer healthier lives and one of which is ascends work which is Aubrey's org have you ever heard you know who David Sinclair's remind me he's a Harvard professor he's on the podcast next week he's been on before but he is at the front of the line of anti anti-aging technology and the podcast I did with him was incredible he's brilliant brilliant guy dealing with things like nmn and you know on nad and all these different drip infusions and concoctions and molecules that lengthen telomeres enhance the you know the the the body's ability to regenerate and age much slower really interesting stuff oh that I mean I love that stuff yeah yeah so how did you get in this because you're thinking about your own mind or was just something you've always been fascinated by I think it it started when after my father passed away seeing the death of your father he died of cancer but it started with hepatitis C from a boat accident he had in like the late 70s the boat accident gave him happy yeah blood transfusion and then he I mean he was surviving with Hep C for four decades changed his his uh interferon and the things that were keep him going before there's a vaccine or cure this is all before then I'm not sure if there is but I'm almost positive there is but um I think the reason yeah very expensive involved process but that that die hurts you know what I mean it's like if someone dies close to you and then like something like that happens you know so this is all happening right and I see him dying I'm also like you know I think I know about health I'm vegetarian you know this down the other I'm like sort of healthy but after I saw him die I read books on cancer I started reading like try to research like what could I've done to help my father and I still have people in my life to absolutely love that I want to learn and share like my mother like you know anyone else that's like close to me that's getting older and then it just I just I just went on this like bender like you know reading books on anti-aging and then you know I'm really big sci-fi nut so if anything I loved living between the world of science fiction and science fact and finding out in that gray area what is going to be science fact in our you know in our though as long as I'm alive you know and there's a lot of things happening because I do agree with that that uh that curve that we are not moving at a linear rate you know we are moving I don't know if it's exponential but it's definitely between linear and exponential with technology with what we're learning in science and medicine and as I'm learning more about this stuff my music career is also raising my platform as a personality is is also getting raised so then now I get to go and make a phone call to Ray and he'll answer and I could get to meet him and and then I won't have fun - mmm so I'm like let's make a song let's do a video let's do an interview so I created this hole in the on future session so I can meet you know Stanley rest in peace like I got to meet him hang out with him did an interview with took some photos Emily Stanley Marvel who's Stanley Marvel Stan Stan Lee the the Marvel comes Stan Lee yeah I'm just going across who's Stanley Marvel but you know I'm like I just went across the board of all the people outside of my music space so I can talk to science people science fiction people JJ Abrams to like whoever might be even authors of books I've read like Richard Dawkins I flew to Oxford University and I sat with him oh that's great and and I talked to him and he is he was like I don't know why I'm here with you but someone told me I should be you know the same response he's supposed to be coming on next month yeah and talk to him yeah it's like you talk to him after a stroke no this was uh I remember him riding his bike to to the interview which is kind of cool seeing Richard Dawkins ride his bike I felt like Albert Einstein was coming at me or something you know because he's kind of like that kind of like like he has a lure with him yeah he does but that was 2015/16 I think so those sounds like around when he had a stroke okay me I mean I've actually wouldn't find out when he had a stroke he's recovered very well though apparently he still has some residual issues oh wow so this is definitely pre-study 2016 yeah so this is pretty sure the the the the crazy thing is I've did all these interviews with all these different people didn't didn't actually post them up online why we did two with Wired magazine we did the one with Ray Curtis well in one with Stanley and I had like the rest lined up but we wanted to you know like present them the right way and you know yeah oh wow that's actually you're great on the Internet Jamie's the best it's cool is that in his office no we got Oxford University gave us this room you know and I took it over that's awesome with him when you talk to Kurzweil did you get into his idea of being able to download consciousness no we didn't get that far but I would love for you to tell me more about that a weird one because we went to this I think it's called a 2045 conference in New York City and the idea behind it is that they think that somewhere around 2045 there's going to be some sort of technological singularity with the exponential growth or perceived exponential growth whatever it is the leaping the new innovation creating these new possibilities that's somewhere around 25 2014 to be so many changes in so many new innovations that they believe they're going to be able to put your consciousness either into some sort of a hard drive some sort of a quantum computer or perhaps even a physical embodiment of a steve aoki you have an artificial steve aoki like a sleeve yeah and then you're caught your actual brain right inside this thing so as your body dies now you will exist in this whatever the fuck it's made out of right you know and he thinks he's going to be able to do that you know he's got a really bizarre motivation to his father died when he was young and he didn't really get to know him that well and he has all these images and all these two and he thinks that he is going to be able to in some way shape or form recreate his father and have some sort of reasonable facsimile some sort of yeah like a way to communicate with this his dad well yeah actually have his with all the memories that he has of his father all the the video and images and actually recreate his father to have a communication with it's very weird stuff yeah well I mean I think a lot of these those those storylines get drawn out in in sci-fi yes because that's essentially where we want like we want to go without any issues and problems and and backfire and and know like Black Mirror episode you know kind of blender because I mean it we are we are definitely going in that direction we're going somewhere weird for sure we're 100% going there and there's no stopping it no way yeah backwards buying new phones and new technology and we're pushing it as far as we can there was a guy I think it's from the University Connecticut he is the preeminent researcher on time-travel and he is right out of a fucking spider-man comic book his dad died when he was young same sort of situation and he wanted to figure out a way to go back in time and save his dad so he's literally trying to come up with a workable theory for time travel that's the gentleman what is his name dr. Ron mallet yeah dr. Ron mallet and it's right now I mean he's got a working theory but it's it becomes a matter of having enough energy to actually pull this off but the idea behind it was all inspired by his father dying and he thinks he's going to be able to or someone may be able to go back in time but when you hear stories like this right when you hear the story because I know you did like this is like what you do you get to talk to all these people do you believe them to a certain extent and then you like you go because for me I need the scientific understanding I you know yes I'm not too much into the paranormal I need to like understand to see if this is actually is conclusive well I think he found out something unfortunate in that the idea as far as time travel as we know it will only exist from the time the time machine is invented forward and backward to that moment the idea like Terrence McKenna described it the idea that you cannot travel where there are no roads and so once a road is established then things get really fucked up because if you create a time machine as Lisa's in terms of what they understand or what dr. Malak believes about time travel right now and I hope I'm not butchering I'm sure I'm butchering but I hope that you can only travel back to the moment the first time machine is invented so once that door is open then time ceases to become linear anything from the end of time till the events of the time machine happens all at once because anyone can come back to that moment because the time machine exists now it's made so of course they're gonna innovate anyone in the future is gonna innovate these people that do innovate are gonna have a much much superior version of this time machine everyone is gonna be able to go back to the moment that the time machine is invented in any point along the way from the end of time to the beginning of time from the moment that time machine is invented so in that case if that really is the case has a time machine been invented I don't think it has why well I could be wrong yeah but what's your like I think every dog is gonna be completely fuckin gonzo you're gonna have people appearing and disappearing and and and showing up and going and it's a normal thing it's like oh yeah he's traveling through time it's just not only that like all events say if like you would would you know dive but what if he was a world war five a hundred years from now and you were like fuck this I'm going back in time a hundred years before World War five and I'm just gonna live there and they do they decide to do that or world war three or World War 4 they just keep going back in time and forward in time you could go if you had a time machine and the time machine was in again I'm butchering this imma moron I'm outside if you had a time machine and time machines existed from now until you know the perceivable end of the lifespan of the earth right when the Sun supernovas and there's no more life left on earth you could kind of go anywhere you want from now to a million years from now as long as there's a place to go right as long as there's a time machine available and the idea is that time as we know it will cease to exist because our time now is dependent on you know our biological entities waking up moving forward what time is it oh it's 3:00 are my meetings at 5:00 better hurry over to downtown traffic's rough this time of day all that stuff's gonna be nonsense if there's time machines because you're just gonna be able to move anywhere you want at any point in time sounds ridiculous but so does the Internet have you brought the internet up to some guy who lived in Victorian you know time's right and say look at this this is my phone and you can ask it a question it'll give you all the answers yeah anything you want that would be the most astounding form of witchcraft ever invented now my 11 year old daughter has one of those yeah you know I mean she she asked that thing questions all the time she gets answers to stuff all the time that we used to have to go to a library forum she would watch videos that just come out of the air yeah that's magic yeah and but it's we're accustomed to it we exactly so the idea is that what this would do is change every aspect of reality as we know it in terms of like linear time it would no longer exist but what would only those people that know how to use a machine have access to it well I mean wouldn't it be like cell phones eventually everybody gets one and we're talking about time right so if everybody gets access to it a year from now or three years from now it doesn't matter because the time machine's already been invented so they could travel back to that moment and forward from that moment so the moment they turn that fucker on everything goes haywire well so so let's not turn nothing on oh it's weird and it's inevitable it's good yeah well they want to see if they can even make that happen I used to have a bit that I used to do about the Big Bang because they were truck everyone's always tried to figure out like what was the universe like before the Big Bang like what what happened how was it created and when you look at the progress of Technology my thought was that if you look at where we're going and we're constantly innovating and people are constantly coming up with new and more impressive forms of technology that one day we're gonna create a Big Bang machine and that this is what happens every five billion years or so things get so intelligent they develop a big bag machine and they sit around these dudes are on Red Bull and xanax and simulation and one guy goes I'll fuckin press it and he hits the button and boom the whole universe starts all over again and if you had a Big Bang Machine and you knew that if you pressed it within five billion years humans would create another Big Bang machine this is an endless cycle would you press it fucking for sure there's someone that would press that button yes 100 a person out there that would press that button yeah no I I heard more about the simulation idea well that's another that's another idea but that's Elon believes that he believes that it's very possible like like one of the things they said if you could ask AI what would you ask you said what's beyond the simulation like he believes this is a simulation but if you're Elon Musk of course you'd believe it's a simulation people who letting you drill tunnels under la and shoot Rockets off into space like an electric cars I mean he's he's literally living like some character in a movie that's her ex or something yeah but if you're in a simulation is nothing you can do about it right so just might as well just do it we do it all so it's a great way to think like what is a simulation if everything is a simulation it's still life right like the existence exactly everything you're accustomed to and everything you experience and if it is a simulation at least some aspects of this are comfortably or comfortingly like obvious like work hard you can get better things right you can you know be nice to people they're nice to you you like B be a good friend you get good friends eat healthy food you're healthier there's there's like some comfort to the lack of meaning that there's there's certainly some variables that are very difficult to account for but there's also there's a surprising amount of life that's pretty straightforward so it is a simulation it's not the most difficult one to follow it's pretty crazy and chaotic but there's there's a lot of comfort in it like as much as we try to dwell on the horrors of humanity and certainly a lot of them disguise a lot of beauty and people do and there's a lot of cool shit in people yeah I mean when you focus on that then yeah then there's real growth I was at the Comedy Store last night till like two o'clock in the morning in this comedian's bar just hanging out with all these comedians we're just laughing and talking and there's no no audience just a bunch of people that get paid to make people laugh on Jon Stewart was back there Michelle wolf and all these really funny comics we're all just laughs and having a great time and talking and it was I was like wow this is so nice and reward so fun it's rewarding it's like there's cool things in this life yeah if you can find good people and friends and and communicate and and and spread love and have interesting fascinating thought-provoking conversations there's a lot of really positive things right so this is the simulation pretty badass adverse TV oh yeah Joe Rogan you know making a brain foundation I mean what a fucking great simulation you're in absolutely I think yeah it's like you you can make what you want of it I mean it's not it might not be the dream like the Elon Musk scenario right away but it takes time to get there well you don't want that dream I don't want his dream yeah exactly his dreams crazy well I mean his dream of like I mean like you said he's just like almost the superheroes is Bruce Wayne you know doing whatever you know he's he's Iron Man you know well you know some some cars have small engines right there's Honda Civics out there and then there's fucking rocket cars he's got some sort of crazy quantum rocket car engine for a brain like yeah have you talked to him no I haven't he's a trip he's actually on the on the list of people I would love to be in the studio with to make music with and you know just get into his mind a bit I've been putting that out there to the universe he's one of those guys when you're talking to him you have this feeling that he's running code in the background wise time I think he just gets bored with like regular mundane conversations and he's got 50 million things going on constantly and he's also trying like he was talking about it to me about how difficult it is to manage his minds like you wouldn't want to be me he thought he was crazy when he was younger cuz it like so much was bouncing around in his head and he realized that other people weren't like that and it's like oh no I'm alone yeah I mean like literally he's probably alone who the fuck is like that guy right in terms of like a public intellectual who's responsible for so many groundbreaking technologies you know the number one electric car in the world like SpaceX tunneling under la yeah boring company it's a fucking he's a crazy man yeah fast thank god he's around though yeah I like that it's so cool to have like a true outlier someone who's just really out there and oh man he's constantly attacked and maligned and people are misrepresenting him and you know people like all the crabs in a bucket don't like it yeah I got a poem down yeah too goddamn smart all these people that fancy themselves smart you meet that guy like oh okay there's levels to this game yeah no he is he's like my the top of my list just so you know being his presence but I think it'd be very exciting to try to do a song with Elon Musk I'll ask him well after the podcast might expose yeah so he's probably busy yeah yeah I could I could always make as easy as possible just go to SpaceX or Tesla where yeah so what do you in particular you doing with this brain foundation I mean I think one of the most important things has inspire people more about brain the brain you know like I mean obviously it's to raise money for brain research works for one finding cures for degenerative brain diseases and to just understanding the brain more working with orcs that that want to understand the brain more so that we can expand what our limitations are you know in the conversations that we're talking about you know bring some of the science fiction and science fact you know a lot of this idea that like you know telekinesis is when you can move things with your mind as soon as possible it already is really not like in the supernatural sense like Magneto well you know it's like you know there's I mean it's happening like five years ago people moving wheelchairs but there with like implanted implanted yeah exactly I'm not sure that the right terms but I've seen the videos you know like a monkey being able to move an arm to its mouth to eat the apple yeah those were happy those that happen like two thousand thirteen or fourteen or fact-checked that but it was not 2019 it was like years ago so whatever they're doing at DARPA whatever they're doing it like Google what whoever's got these research orgs and labs I I wanted I would love to jump in there and just like put my ear out there and just listen and find out what's going on and you know cuz I have my own interest and passion on what's what the breakthroughs are and I would also love to try some of these things do you think they let you sometimes I mean listen they're you gotta try this Boston Dynamics might be your best bet the rock the robot people yeah they might let you in but DARPA is that DARPA DARPA won't let me in obviously it will not let me in sign some paperwork yeah but I want to get in to as many doors as I can on any of this kind of stuff and that's like my own personal gain but also with the with the brain or get just the brain foundation it's just a like you know help out the smaller orgs too that are that are one finding the cures because at the end of the day what I've learned is that if you don't die of cancer or heart disease you're gonna have a brain disease you're gonna you're gonna go crazy you're gonna you're gonna lose your memory unit deteriorate yeah and you know you know years down the line we're gonna be able to literally turn our body into like a used car and change all the parts you know but you know if you start losing your memory then you start losing who you are did you talk to Kurzweil about those yes it was years ago so I'm trying to remember even like the interview that we did but I'd you know I went in deep on a lot of the anti-aging stuff and you know I think the struggle that he's gonna have as if he's gonna make it to 2045 because he's 70 or something right yeah that's and he has a heart he has a genetic defect with his heart you know so but I mean he's just like one of those like those heroes of mine that was lucky to be in his space you know playing on his Kurzweil keyboard yeah the synthesizer that was that was a moment we're both on this Beach to text to didn't he yeah I think I mean he's invented more than a hundred really significant inventions yeah fascinating guy absolutely yeah but can we squeeze 25 more years out of him yeah yeah his biological life to get to 2045 because if he's gonna like he's gonna be the one that's gonna really push that envelope part I think he's if there's anyone out there that's well I'm I you know it's clearly obvious why Google picked him up you know you know and had him like head the whole I forgot what the department's called but you know wellgood didn't Google by Boston Dynamics as well they bought a robot company I know that which is like what are you guys planning trouble everybody's email you have the number one search engine on the planet Earth you have the number one browser like what are you guys doing what are you doing over there yeah you made robots are you oh but don't you want to be in the room yeah if you want to be in the room but you know some of their choices are a little bit questionable it's there's so much there's there's science but then there's so much there's social decisions you know that they're making in terms right like what people get to see and talk about in here and a lot of is based on the zeitgeist it's based on you know the current state of politically correct ideology what you can and can't say or can and can't do and that becomes really dangerous because you're kind of controlling information you're throttling information like you know Tulsi Gabbard is suing Google for what is it like fifty million dollars or something crazy like that they say that they purposely stifled her search engine results so that people wouldn't be able to find her as easily and they've she's apparently proven it well so it's not a pure information based company there's ideology behind it there's motivations behind it that you know politically leaning motivations right yeah so no yeah when he goes out when he goes into that world um yeah like oh I forget about that sometimes when you're like I want to be in the beta break their rooms you know well there was an internal memo that were they referring to ben shapiro and someone else I think it was Jordan Peterson and maybe Dennis Prager as Nazis which is hilarious because both Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager are both Jewish so it's like their their perception of who person is this was brought up this is brought up by people in Congress like they had to have hearings on it trying to figure out like what is Google doing like what are you allowed to how are you allowed to define people internally in your memory memos and then of course once you call someone a Nazi then you can act as if they're announcing and you know stifle any sort of search on them or stifle results or you know yeah point point people in the direction that you think would be better for Humanity versus just pure information and it gets it's very weird you know but as a technology company look they're amazingly just what they're doing with Android and Google searching and Google assistant and Google Maps is by far the most the superior map application on the planet Earth and it's constantly getting better and constantly gathering up new information I mean part of me loves the fact that they exist and part of me is like John is too much power has too much power for one right one company to be able to influence people one way or the other so what's uh what's your silhouettes that Joe Rogan's solution is something like that regulations no well I'm too stupid for this this I need to rely on people that have actually spent real time studying the effects and understand it from a very deep level I don't I understand it that it's I understand that it's problematic I just don't understand what the solution is and I don't know if it's even it's just a free distribution of information across the board because then what do you do about actual Nazis like if you find the act like yeah there's a new Hitler and he arises and really does want to exterminate the Jews what happens there you just allow that guy to be on Google easy Google Hangouts with Nazi hangout they're planning on exterminations and where the right where's the next outwits you know no I don't think that that shouldn't be the case yeah so what is the case do you allow white supremacists on there to organize rallies fuck where where does freedom of speech end you know yeah it's very complicated questions yes we're all learning to navigate yeah I think in many ways and this is a weird thought that I have and I repeat it over and over again but I think technology is going to provide us with a new way of communicating that's not dependent upon language but rather can read actual intent like an actual mind-reading technology and I when I see ilan some neuro-link this thing that he's trying to do were there opening up the bandwidth to humans and information through use of implants and some sort of a Bluetooth wearable device like that I think is like a step in that direction and I think Elon in you know in many interviews he said that he thinks that human beings are the organic biological bootloader for for artificial intelligence so if we're a bootloader for AI the way to sort of combat that buzz bootloader bootloader yeah like like a computer boot loading oh okay okay yeah with a biological well the way I've described it is that we're sort of an electronic cocoon that's about to make the butterfly and that we're we're the caterpillar that's making the cocoon and we're constantly in pursuit of Firefly is the AI yes the butterfly lucky if you see a caterpillar right that kettle girl doesn't know what the fuck's going on it's just making a cocoon that's what it does yeah and you know is that's what it knows to do is yeah and the ideas that we don't know what the fuck we're doing either like why do we need 5 G's 4G not good enough goddamn I get on the internet pretty goddamn quick what are we doing what seems like 5 G's better than 6 she'll be better than 5g yeah if you want to get that mind reading software you gotta get 7g yeah we're gonna do this to the point where one day there's going to be a real thing sitting oh we will merge with the AI because that's I mean that's the future that I hope for you don't lose yourself in that you know like you're are you yourself once you've merged with the AI and then what's holding you back God all these emotions are bullshit that's getting yeah alright let's get rid of those yeah let's just have pure people yeah pure people now available through Nabisco it's interesting because I cuz like my whole point with neon future is the convergence of I mean the ultimate goal Z of convergence of technology and our humanity to the point where we live you know forever through you know this downloading system that we're talking about earlier on or yeah or you know whatever seemingly makes sense in the trajectory of where technology is going you know so we do live indefinitely you know I mean that's like for me as well you know my insurance policy for if I don't make it to this point like my dad didn't make it to that that cure is you know obviously uh cryogenically freezing the bra to do that while I'm already signed up so you know cuz I feel like I mean if we are really this discussion is are we gonna make it there in our timeline I'm 41 so I have a better chance of Records well obviously yeah so if I really believe that you know I guess it's hopeful you know that we'll get to this point in our generation that will help make it it's that close right so either we make it and then I die and then everyone lives forever do I want to be that generation that of people that die or the generation of people I go oh death is as a cure we just we just found we found a cure for death just like a cure for cancer just like a cure for whatever what if after your biological body ceases to function you move into a new realm of reality that is a completely different dimension that's filled with love and understanding like the after death yeah what is that we don't know there's no biological shortcomings there's no emotions and there's no fear none of that and there's there's no bodies you just you're a soul in another dimension and then someone unfreezes you like well like Eve wanted to be unfrozen people like fuck man I was I was there I was on the other side the other like you'd be like click opt-out no I can't believe this and so then you go well I'll just die again well here--here's okay this is this is what I know cuz I don't know I mean we both don't know what's really gonna happen it's that's likely I mean anything is likely okay I'm not saying that I'm not like I don't believe in God or I do believe in God I just don't know what's really happening afterwards but I know if I know that what I've seen as me what I understand of what's around me and my feelings is that if I wake up tomorrow or if someone I love wakes up tomorrow with an incurable disease that's gonna kill them it would be the most horrific thing and I think at the end of the day the human race is going out to find cures for those kinds of situations sure so that's like yeah suffering pain I mean that's what we do we try to stop and elongate our life you know essentially we all want to live indefinitely you know like through finding cures for all these issues so we want to live healthily yeah yeah exactly you want to be a wheelchair like for 50 years just like staring at a TV Mike Hawkins yeah yeah which is maybe he found all the silver lining I'm not sure but you know if you're healthy and moving and then boom night and day are there of course it's awful but at the other day you just don't want that you know like I mean I mean you you don't want that kind of thing to happen so for me it's like I would rather opt out then have someone make that some like disease make that decision for me yes the suffering thing is the thing that we all want to avoid we want to avoid discomfort and pain and also causing discomfort to our loved ones like one of the scariest thing about dying is leaving behind grievers leaving behind people that are sad and miss you terribly yeah it's like when you've seen people with their loved ones have died it's it's you know and why I've lost loved ones we all have and it's a weird void it's a that's horrific it's traumatic and it's you know that's where my conquests are my interest in passion led to anti-aging the future you know and then building on that for the ones that I love that are alive now you know and doing whatever I can to like share the information so that they live as long as they possibly can in the healthiest way possible you know so like I'm like just gathering gathering information as I go you know and it's exciting because of those things as I get bigger as a personality you know sometimes I do jump into these rooms and in one case just recently I as a doctor that that just that I've worked with you have your guns done some stem cell injections with them in Denver and he came to my house he was with some other doctors and they're like oh yeah there's a doctor convention others in Las Vegas those conventions all the time there so they all came over and like hey you know there's some breakthrough groundbreaking stuff just happened this year you can now find out on a cellular level of cancer detection for at least 16 different cancers you know so like it's like very very preventative you know more along the line so I was like I want in so I got the information and I just like that was a Christmas present for everyone what kind of stem-cell procedures are you going I mean the first time was through through Dan Bilzerian he he's introduced me to the one in Panama so I went down there dr. Neil Reardon exactly but my mom was just down there oh yeah last week yeah I've sent him down there twice that's great and it was in the verge of getting a knee replacement and her knee was really bad and eight months it was took a while you know cuz my mom is 73 and within eight months her knees stopped being in pain and she was able to walk and she can you say they went to the Grand Canyon and hazing yeah and now she went back again to just get a second dose and juice it up some more it's incredible I just know when I was there I saw a lot of kids in there but the one in Panama because it's it it grows muscle or does something I like I don't want to say one thing it regenerates tissue right so kids with muscle dystrophy kids with like where they can't walk anymore they get the stem cell injections and they can walk for and then after six months you know the the stem cells do leave your body or like the didn't stay with you Manish right so once again I don't the scientific terms I could be off but they have to go back in get the stem cells and they can have you know as you know that kind of life instead of having me in a wheelchair so I went I went in there because I just wanted to try it out my friend also came with me has asthma knocked out his asthma he never had to use inhaler for way past six months really yeah because the stem cells also really affect the lungs the umbilical cord cells they they travel the lungs first from what this is an IV IV version yeah an IV we did IV I did shoulder my shoulders because I have I later got a rotator cuff surgery because I had like a bone spur going into my tendon but I tried to use the stem cells too so didn't have to go the surgery mm-hmm but you can't erode bone right so yeah so you got it shaved down and so what they did exactly yeah and but I just like my performance level went out the like the general kind of markers of what it's supposed to do actually increase actually right after right after that I went back then when I went back to Vegas met up with Dan and we did to work out it was like it's just you know two times more and he you know it worked like you know it did what it was scientifically supposed to do for me for my stamina my energy yeah and you did it for three days did you three days yeah three days and three days of IV and then injects into different joints and exactly and I did that and then about a year later I was with dr. Grossman he's the doctor I work with and he wrote the book with Ray Kurzweil called I think it's the sub the sub text of the book is stayin alive until we get told tell who you reached singularity or something like that and it's a it's like a a book on being healthy basically anti-aging book he wrote that in with with Ray Kurzweil so that's why I heard about him I went to him a few years back to get like the full blood work going for me and my family I want we did like two days of testing all kinds of stuff to learn more about our bodies and see what we're deficient in what we're not what vitamins we need to take to supplement the things that were deficient in and I came back just you know maybe a year ago to do his version of stem cells because in America is a different kind of thing like Panama obviously out of America so they're doing the umbilical cord stem cells or they harvest the stem cells from kourt's so they have a zero stem cells he's doing stem cells it's almost like a plasma therapy when they took my blood spin it and there you know pulling out the stem cells from my own blood so it's 41 year old stem cells but his point that he's saying is that the size of the stem cells they're much smaller so they're able to travel past where it ends up clogging which is like the lungs and like certain areas of the body so it does travel more just it's not the day zero stem cells but it's still effectively doing its work when you think back to like 20 years ago there was no discussion of this so this yeah this is completely you know I've added stem cell shots too and I had a full length rotator cuff tear in my right arm that's gone just sealed up well healed yeah I was having real problems with his arm when I was thinking I was gonna need surgery now it works great no problems at all hit the bag lift weights and you you ejected intravenously and into the arm yeah I've done both yeah exosomes I've done there's a new thing called Wharton's jelly that I had a pretty profound effect it's a very potent mixture of stem cells we're getting close to the point where you don't have to go to Panama but going to Panama right now is the way to go so that's why you want your purple no I didn't go to Panama did it all in America where Santa Monica medicine yeah I have to try that out it's a place that originally started going to for Regina Keene do you know Jenny Keene is where Jenny Keene was originally invented in Germany and a lot of guys like Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant they had to fly to Germany back in the day to get this and what they do is it's a more advanced form of platelet-rich plasma right like they're taking your blood out they spin it in a centrifuge and heat it through some process and they add things to it and in the process that creates this incredibly potent anti-inflammatory agent that's from your own blood it's like this yellow serum then they inject this yellow serum directly into areas where you have injury and/or inflammation and has a radical healing effect and it's really really good for bulging discs people that have disc issues and back issues and I had a pretty bad one in my neck that was keeping me out of judge itsu my hands were going numb you know because the the Bulge was pushing against my nerve now it's gone like I've got it I got MRI six months later after the procedure there's no more bulge now most of the time when you have a bulging disc sometimes it can go back and heal but most the time it does not and most the time what happens is you wind up having to get a discectomy where they go into the disc they remove the offending piece that's sticking into your nerve but now you have a smaller disc you have less disk tissue so your discs start to collapse your your actual spinal column you know the the actual hard bone moves closer to the other hard bone and you know becomes real problem arthritis forms scar tissue forms the more disk tissue you have you know that the better off you are and they're able to do that now to the point where they increase a disc tissue well it would it doesn't decrease it okay so when the disc is bulging it actually gets to go back in it gets it to retreat the stem cells as a blood plasma therapy Regina keen okay but stem cells have been shown to start to do that too they've actually started injecting stem cells directly into dix disk tissue and I was talking to dr. Roddy Magee out of Las Vegas he's he's one of the guys it's really at the cutting edge of all this stuff well I'm with UFC fighters and they're doing that with them and he was the guy I originally went to to treat my shoulder because of dr. Davidson from the UFC who's the the main doctor for the UFC he was telling me he had shoulder surgery he's a little bit older than me and his shoulder surgery took but he was still having issues with it he was trying to figure out what he what he should do because he was still having pain when he was swimming went and got some stem cell injections all the pain went away so he was telling me about that he's like you know you got some pretty significant tears he might really need surgery but maybe this will help you for now so I went there and the the amount of help that it the the amount of alleviation of pain and discomfort was stunning how's air can you believe this is a real thing you just shoot this into whatever it's bothering you and then all sudden like four months later you're like where's the pain I'm a fucking pain anymore new meat can you introduce Kentucky oh yeah that's great yeah yeah I'll give you his number either great I send people to him all the time but he's on the cutting edge of everything like anytime he's a young guy and he's a really enthusiastic and super brilliant and anytime there's any sort of cutting edge medical practice that guy's he's on it like for instance one of the things they're doing now is when people get ACL tears which usually when you get an ACL tear usually you need reconstruction and what usually with that reconstruction is either a cadaver graft where they take the Achilles tendon out of a dead person and shove it in your knee and then your body repro liberate that with its own cells it takes about six months and then you have a functional tendon again it's great I had it done myself well but now they're able to reattach the actual torn ACL would they have some special technique they do and they've had people tear an ACL and then compete in the Olympics four months later Wow which is fucking bananas that's crazy yeah and he showed me this procedure and how they do it then he showed me this guy four months post-op doing all these box jumps and shit and I was like this is nuts it is nuts well yeah so there's a lot of hope in terms of regenerative medicine absolutely yeah and thank God for people like dr. Reardon and dr. McGee and dr. Ben Russia who's the guy that I go to in Santa Monica I mean these guys are just on top of this incredible new wave of regenerative medicine yeah I'm obsessed with that world so I'm talking about it it's like a it's very exciting yes well you're in Vegas you got a visit rowdy I would love to meet all those great guy - yeah you would love him yeah and he's like super enthusiastic about it if he finds out that you're enthusiastic about it he'll geek out with you yeah what else have you had done stem cells shoulders shoulder I had I just had focal surgery vocal cord surgery whoa did you get polyps or something yeah I did yeah polyploid on my vocal cords Isis sing in a band I said I used to be it's like in a scream a hardcore band or a few of them I mean that's where like that's my roots of who like my where my music was as far as what led me to DJing was being in in these like hardcore punk bands so that's a lot of screaming lots of screaming yeah and then I carried that through when I finally like but when I finally you know retired that hat and I started DJing years and years later and I started doing these bigger bigger shows and started doing the festivals I brought out that same energy again and I started you know when I started producing the music electronic music I was bringing in guitars I was streaming on some of these songs so I'm bringing some of my past in with my music and I'm back again but in a different world and and I just I'm not I'm not a trained singer you know so I destroyed my vocal chords and I was just like raspy as hell like I was just like an old Italian man someone shows and and then I saw a doctor he's like you know I'm a choice you're gonna have to like you have to take a break and I'm you know I'm doing like 250 shows a year so it's like huh stuff for the month and and and and not talk for a month that was crazy not talking for a whole month yeah imagine Joe Rogan not talking for a whole month but a lot of people but I had to do that that was very hard I actually saw a life coach before X I'm like I'm terrified I don't want my like demons or whatever anxiety or whatever things that I have like creeping up or they're like okay you're mine now you can't you can't talk to someone about you know yeah like I'm scared you know but I I got through it I just I'm a very busy body kind of person so like I just scheduled it was like going back to college but with things that I needed to train and get better at like get better at piano get better at meditation get better at you know twisting the knobs engineering whatever it might be that I wanted to be better at I just brought more people into my world then I finished like an album a month making music with different people just was just so focused on creation and and learning and reading and you know all that good stuff so when I left I was like okay now I know how to do TM meditation or Transcendental Meditation and you know I'm more comfortable doing the things that help me that be a better artist well it obviously worked right but what was the first sound that you made after a month what was the first word I'll tell you something that that's really interesting I know now to do the most hygienic sneeze that you can possibly do tell us because now I can sneeze with no visible vapor residue because you know what people sneeze you can see those videos it's like it's like this cloud of trillions of bacteria floating in the air yeah of course if you do that to me you'll probably see some vapor but you don't feel on your hand if you sneeze and you just like you're it's all like gunky and you know what happened sometimes right yeah well now I can sneeze because I'm not using my vocal cords so as I sneeze I blow out really hard because I had no choice I couldn't COFF I couldn't actually use a vocal cord after the surgery or what have you had to cough so okay whoa so when I sneeze I sneeze like that I go so if you do that sneeze was that that's how you do it that's how I sneeze I almost want to get some dust yeah if you could make me see I will show you and then basically so you just breathe out yeah it's it's the cleanest sneeze you could possibly do no yeah so that's one very important thing I learned through this whole but the first sound I mean I don't remember scared to say a word like when he ever DJ's result yeah yeah it's probably just you know you know you also whispering is really bad whispering span like that yeah like yeah so you know with Springs not good for your vocal cords you think it's like gentler on them but from what I was told to not whisper so I literally was texting all the time for mmm you know until I had to make that you know if you probably develop some fucking lightning-fast thumb yeah I wanted to get things out but that's what you did most the time just text people text attire it's called text to talk when I was in my meetings cuz you know I've run various different you know businesses and I have to you know be on calls so I'm like texting and talking I was Stephen Hawking yeah you know yeah yeah yeah but if we come back to yeah the agenda for today yes they apparently wanted to give him a better voice and he didn't want it yeah he's like I likes that mother more see real ike voice yeah no sorry I didn't understand you know you can get Syrian nice English voice yeah he was not interested he likes that he liked while he was alive that weird rough computers he I mean from what I heard about him each as his sense of humor was was very funny and he's just a very sarcastic guy seemed he seemed like a really interesting girl yeah who also really liked strip clubs no I did not yeah Eric Weinstein told me about that remember see but there was a really interesting article written about him that he would love to get wheeled into a strip club he liked he enjoyed it and like liked being there but I guess that completely makes sense if you lost control of your body still were attracted to women you have still found them amazing you'd want to see them naked dancing in front of right it's like it makes total sense yeah you know yeah because you want like I mean exactly you can't get it but you can at least be there yeah what do you out Jamie there it is acclaimed physicist Hawking a regular at California he's a regular Wow it's hilarious I am proud to say that I saw him speak when I was in college oh wow no kidding yeah look at him when all the strippers Peterson Stephen Hawking's go strip clubs look at him that's amazing what does it leave a smile he looked so happy he looks so happy well we'd hate absolutely yeah yeah I would I would imagine that would be a very trying 30 days so when it came when it was over was your voice normal did it come back did its it was different but I was warned that it would sound a little different like you sound different now than you sounded before the operation I'm used to what I sound like now so I almost forgot what I sounded like before but I think maybe a semitone differently you know but you know it's like you just get used to the new you like if I was gonna be half cyborg half half man I'd probably just be like okay yeah this is me you know like you just get to that when you've when you've situated in that the half cyborg thing is gonna be really weird when people start replacing legs because I think if you could develop a leg like a cybernetic leg that's better than a normal leg someone's gonna say chop my leg off and give me one of those someone someone somewhere is gonna do that and if that becomes seamless and you know you get some Steve Austin Six Million Dollar Man type shit going on things could get real weird that's uh what you've all talks about and how it is you know that whole idea that like first we use the technology to heal the people that need it but at the end of the day it's going to be used for advancing humanity mmm you know like there's like you know the you want to save you want to help people that that need to walk first right yeah but but then it's like just like you said if it becomes very normal then the upgrades will be used as well to advance the people that don't need it yeah and then we get to a point where you're unscrewing your head taking your brain out but and and it's that's also what's interesting is that when you say that you know now it sounds crazy it does but it doesn't yeah well to you it doesn't yeah but to me doesn't either but that's exactly what you're saying about the phone too you know or like what you're showing someone in the Victorian age yeah it's about the internet right and when we get to that place it's gonna you know it's gonna feel like oh well everyone everyone did it so like when Luke Skywalker got his arm chopped off in Star Wars and they put another arm on me that's really quick remember yep yeah that shit's gonna happen I believe it yeah I don't think that's so I don't think that's too far away I think that's probably 25 years away I hope so I think I hope so too yes we are seeing some pretty advanced artificial limbs so there was a guy who got his leg and his arm bit off by a shark and I met him at the comedy store and he has this carbon-fiber arm and a carbon-fiber leg the guy doesn't walk with a limp he walks completely normal and he shook my hand how scared don't crush my hand because he's got some fucking Iron Man hand and he's have like the look like a hand or is it just my own hand well yeah I got black carbon fiber hand that articulates it moves because they're I think they're they're starting to make it where you can feel yes I think they are yeah so that way right there Wow yeah we've actually mean that's the next level right it's like when you can make an arm that has nerve joints into the this artificially intelligent and artificially connecting with your with your brain yeah he's he's an interesting character because that arm I mean it it's you will you really get this I am robot kind of feel yeah I'm seeing his arm and his leg like cuz it's I mean I'm sure he would tell you that he's much better off with his arm and his leg back yeah but when you see the guy walk around man he fucking just walks around he looks normal I mean what they used to have in comparison to what they have today I mean it is leaps and bounds and I'm sure the future so that's his actual arm well that's what it looks like Wow shark bit his fucking arm off that's a I mean I I wouldn't want to put the arm and lake yeah that was a Hungry Shark asshole yeah it's uh you know it's interesting because this is that we're in we're in this new frontier of what's possible I'm sure they're upgrading his stuff all the time as well you know and what's or what's available to someone I can yeah but it's exciting to see like when you when you like you know when you see it firsthand you see him not lipping and you know where we're going you know like like I'm saying like all the sci-fi films that we see that some of them are gonna have very real you know scenarios in our life for sure yeah yeah are you a technology geek outside of the sort of thinking about the body as in I mean I am of course I definitely say I'm a tech geek yeah because you kind of have to yeah if you're you create electronic music yes I'm a gadget guy - you know I love like gadgets and trying new little things that are out there I'm you know like I just want to try it all I want to like experience things in different ways to enhance my experience overall yeah creating music electronically is it's kind of polarizing to some people though right because I mean I think your music sounds fucking amazing but for some people they want to hear an actual sand ring of a guitar the rap of a drum the you know like people have this like very narrow I did true music is it's true and you know I think that there's two layers to - like electronic music you know you have to first of all make the music so you're you're all you are making the music in one form or another with you know I don't actually don't use like live instrumentation so much but sometimes I do and because I come from that world it's natural for me to bring a guitar in but it's not necessary you know everything can be made from a laptop you don't even actually need very much anymore look at me you can make like a like or higher song yeah Garage Band I guess would be the rudimentary for use Windows to use a Mac I use a Apple Ableton Live and that doesn't live as a software yeah it's like the DA the that I used to create the music but you know you can literally you don't even need a keyboard you don't even need a mouse well if you really you just need a hard drive of samples or you know having enough that you can build off of and your keyboard becomes you know you know how you're gonna paint your notes in so you can make it that streamline if you want it to now having like this big studios it's great and I have a really beautiful studio in my house but it's more about the energy of the room for me like I want to go in there like going I'm gonna work 12 hours and I want to be excited to do that all the way until whatever time it's that Las Vegas Vegas effect of being in a club or being in a casino and you don't know what time it is I want that same effect in my room to be like energized and also energized people that come in but if I'm on the road like you know making an idea and just like strip lining it I don't really need much you know and I think that's like your setup right there oh yeah yeah dude what a fuckin badass room carpet yeah I call it with that it's a you know blue obviously my book my books called blue is my favorite color and I want the the feeling to feel a futuristic so it's the neon future cave and if you look up at the ceiling if you scroll up in a picture whatever you'll get to see maybe it's not in that picture but I have yeah so you have like these like LED lights coming through the ceiling as if you're in like a cave well and and then you're looking at everything in this enormous projection screens out what that is yeah and it's and it seats a ton of people so you know just I mean I'm releasing my my next singles with the Backstreet Boys so I can fit all the Backstreet Boys guys in my house in my studio and we could you know do what we do have you always lived in Vegas I moved to Vegas in 20 I bought my house in 2013 what made you move to Vegas I was living in LA and my career broke in Los Angeles so it's no doubt about being in LA for as a musician as an artist someone in music that's where you if you want a break you can have all the connections and build your network here fastest than anywhere else in the world New York I feel like is the media hub or fashion and then LA is as a music hub and then Atlanta is like the hip-hop hub Nashville's country but I broke in LA and when I started touring 2009 10 2008 9 10 11 I was just gone I start I wasn't like living in LA the way I lived in LA going out to all the places that I love to eat all the culture of what LA offs offer I was only there 50 days of the year maybe so I was like well just sign a residency 2 in Las Vegas when the nightlife boomed for DJ's and from 2010 it was a big shift of of what nightlife has to offer in Vegas and DJs were a big part of that and I started a you know a big residency deal and then I was like I I mean I'm here more than I am in LA and you know it's a good tax situation there there's no state tax there and I'd have to leave LA my my home turf but I'm not even there right so I just moved ship entirely bought a house bought the dream situation house that's notice that like there's so many perks for me because LA I had like a 2,000 2,500 square foot maybe 3,000 square foot house which was nice million dollar house in the hills and that's when I finally made it before I lived in an apartment on DeLongpre in El Centro East Hollywood I guess Hollywood and Vine area nine hundred dollars for 900 square feet that's where it all started for me that's when I first moved to LA and I started making money it took time to get there I kind of talked about that in the book like the hardships to get there because one of the best lessons that my father shared with me was this tough love attitude where you know he was a very rich flamboyant restaurateur Benihana had fancy cars was very fly she's very American he's a one that broke through the American Dream the the Japanese though one of the few Japanese people that actually did that so he's just like y'all look at me with you know flying hot-air balloons offshore boat racing and and then like you know I guess a traditional thing is like that he would financially help me you know because he has the money to do that but one of the most powerful things he did was he just financially he didn't financially help me and I had to figure though my issues my hardships my business plans my financial issues that I was going through on my own so I had to start there and because of that I was able to succeed through some of the hard stuff and and have that drive to want to make money for myself so during that time in LA you know I'm kind of like dressing here you know I lived in this apartment for about seven years and then the DJing my first priority of my record label that was like why I moved to LA sign artists developed them helped them and then I was deejaying building the brand of the label and we created a really cool scene in LA and we were breaking some of the the biggest acts not breaking where we were we were the underground hotbed you know like I say like the comedy shop or something where like everyone would hang out so like Lady Gaga was playing for free at our shows Skrillex was there every single week will.i.am was dancing in the corner and then going back to the studio making Black Eyed Peas hits because 2007 through 2009 Black Eyed Peas were the biggest artists LMFAO is there every single week this is and then they became the biggest acts so we're like this hotbed of music culture in LA but it was my party's Wow and and then that's how I you know made a name for myself is that I was throwing these parties and I was DJing them but no one cared that I was DJing them the only reason why they were going is because these acts would always be there and then the celebs would come in you know that's when I met DJ I am in 2006 2005 and then we got together and he brought the celebs in so now like there's a spotlight of pre TMZ kinda like oh what's going on over here with this electro sound and with what you have like Daft Punk their unmasked and and like really cool underground like Kate Cuddy their and Kanye West coming through and then there's Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton and all these different people all like in this small room and people wanted to know what the hell is going on in that in that little space and this is what's what's great about this time was that it was pre snapchat pre social media it was just MySpace so you had to be in that room to experience what was happening so people would fly in to just be in that room to hear what was the cutting-edge sound that was going to be eventually popular you know people wanted to play in that little 300-400 cap room did you film any of that there is always one guy filming I mean that's the thing because back then there's no phone so I could films like razors and write you know like like blackberries that you know you just can't hide kicks yeah it's like it's the worst quality so a guy have to bring a camcorder in right and this one guy Glenn Jame and he would always film those parties but a cobra snake my he was my best friend he would just run with me to all the shows and parties cuz back then I would play like five nights a week in LA and and he would photograph and he would document and that's how you would find out about the lifestyle the the clothes like this the look of you know what it was to be on Cahuenga in hollywood and that whole you know and then you see Kid Cudi there and you see Kanye West there and you see you know whoever else that was just like hanging out absorbing the culture that we were that we were like creating there and and then eventually that was what got me out of my debt bubble that was you know cuz I was a pretty bad businessman I was running Dimock I thought I was doing shit right because I signing acts that actually mattered and we're taking off but I just didn't know how to you know I was just spending spending like yo we keep going with this and then you know then I start bringing the right people and I was like okay I need to build a team I need to build some people that have some sensibilities in this world while I'm creative and then the DJing just took as I was getting more into production to get anyone to remix in getting more into creating myself as an artist and then that is what people know about me now but really it was people knew about me because of the dim lock and and it's a it's interesting health sometimes the evolutions of the errors of who you are you know of change over time and then you know fast forward 2013 is when I was like okay I got ya la helped grow me to Who I am my management my label they're still la you know but steve aoki it's gonna be Las Vegas so I would love to see a documentary on that to see that would be an amazing film like to see how that all was going down right now like if you have video footage if you get somebody to edit that and put the other a documentary of that time period because it's a really interesting time period yeah you know for the the creation of electronic music and and what you pointed out that's so interesting was that 2010 was really somewhere around the time Vegas started becoming these these electronic music shows started taking precedent they're the biggest fuckin thing I was staying at the Wynn recently and the hotel room we were at was overlooking the pool and I forget who it was that was playing there but it was fucking chaos yeah and like you don't and especially when you're you know we're like above like high above looking down yeah bird's-eye view it was so crazy it was so loud and so crazy and there was everybody this never existed yeah I mean it's totally Vegas for a long time yeah this is a new thing it has a new thing over the last nine years exactly and it's overtaking Vegas everywhere you go there's these gigantic billboards with you there your face on it or whatever other DJs in right place and who's the guy with a fucking marshmallow head there's a guy at marshmallow yeah well I hate that's marshmallow yeah you know Kay that's like the unknown comic that's got a marshmallow on his head but there's so many I didn't even know who that was like my kids are explained to me my 11 year always explained to me marshmallow fuck do you know who Mark and and we're there and it's just it's everyone that's going out in Vegas but it used to be Vegas used to be like a cultural weird void yeah right you would have some big acts that would come through there but it always seemed like they were at the end of the run right yeah yeah yeah you had to be at the end of your run yeah like when Michael Jackson was considering doing Vegas it's like okay he's like finally saying that this is the wrong run or you know it's like you see how it did like Celine Dion you know did a residency in Vegas like she's probably just tired Donnie Murray yeah you know metal oh yeah Barry Manilow you know like Carrot Top does the residency there I mean he's doing really well it's not it's not a knock yeah I know it's not it's really not but it's that's what it was but then all of a sudden it became electronic music and it's like wow what is happening like the you know these things are enormous like there's so much bigger than any other kind of event that you have in Vegas other than like massive sporting events like brycie or someplace yeah well it definitely it's it's provoked by energy to you know like and it's that's infectious yes yeah it's a fucking great time yeah if you go to see Barry Manilow or you know whatever who there's no knock on them but you know I'm saying it's like I'm sure it's fun it's mellow it's like whatever you're into but when you're seated you know like you're seated for a reason because you're there to like sit and just enjoy yes there's no seats at a steve aoki show I mean there are they're like the tables and stuff but no one's sitting down right it that's the that they'll be strange to see someone unless service passed out drunk or something but for the most part everyone's standing and jumping and being part of the moment and that's that's my job yeah I need to make sure everyone's attention is on me and then I'm taking them to this next level I've always wondered what it's like to live in Vegas though like I've never lived there you know my good friend Dana White lives there he loves he raves about it but I've always liked like Vegas okay so is it for me so I'm la guy right like my heart and like you know I love Los Angeles I know LA so well and you know with LA you have your limitations its Los Angeles you can't like if you want to build your dream house you can't have a lot of money to do that in Vegas when I moved there in 2013 I got a sick deal I bought my house 16,000 square feet whoa 2.8 million I think - hilarious yeah 2.8 it was a short sale as a total steal I mean like the guts were not good like it was like one of those like prop homes almost so I had a Regan like I spent like 5 million into the house and it was more about building my own dream house as I would want to have it I have a foam pit in there with a trampoline room I have I the pool in my backyard was too far away from my house so I filled it in and I built a pool at 16 feet deep right next to my patio that's 20 feet up I built the patio out so that way I can jump into the pool from from the top I'm like kid and basically a big kid and I just think about how I want to make my house fun interactive for the artists that come there for me I have a fun gym I've you know I got my own like chess station backgammon station have a poker room you know it's it's the most hospitable house you know and I have all this space I have like a big shoe room a big shoe collector I got a crazy library with books and records you know I have a Bruce Lee mirror room a mirror room it's my closet but it's just like you walk in it's like LED strips everywhere with mirrors and you know I'm just having fun I'm having fun with my house there's a mirror room I have some really crazy really beautiful art but I got this amazing Banksy piece and so I've you know been starting to collect art there's my shoe room and there's a Banksy get mad if people buy a shit I bought it from him oh you met him tell us what he looks like he is a he's a girl just kidding I never met her but uh with I you know I got in through his some people to get into is he definitely a real person you know I don't know yeah it's someone in 2019 it's managed to stay that secretive yeah it kind of amazing credible because he's a cultural phenomena yeah I mean he's I mean everybody knows what banks he is yeah right or you know of the oxy I should say but no one knows who he is which is crazy who the fuck has ever pulled that off right yeah unique human being yeah it's true how does that work how do i it's not sure that i think yep i mean it's it's like his he's always seeming to find a way to troll people in a social or political critique just like he did with the the art sale of the shredded paint yes how amazing was that yeah that was pretty crazy yeah but watch those people after they paid it and see the the thing dropped it alright but let me ask you this though i don't want to go too deep into this but because i don't know if i'm like stepping on anyone's toes here but if this is really suffrages or you know what like a real auction house aren't they going to look at the painting or the piece are they going to open up the frame and make sure there's not some weird drill going through like i think they would ever expect that to be the case i mean but your but your and your antique you should be checking everything making sure everything's authentic no well if it's an authentic piece and they somehow or another some reliable source brings it to them as an authentic piece they just accept the fact they don't check the details of the piece I mean what can they do meanwhile by the way I'll take that and fucking glue that bitch back together believe it that well you want to like that that's so player it's like what makes the value is it right let it actually have it hanging there that's why you want it in your house really you want it just like that yeah look at the people's face sometimes I forget that I got a phone oh no Oh No Thurston we've lost the piece yeah you know I I wish like it's funny that we talk about this because sometimes I forget like you know we're having a chat and I realized oh there's a lot of people listening in on this so maybe I should give away some of the stuff that I've learned about it but um yeah anyways we'll leave it there well he's definitely unique human yeah so let's get back to Vegas so you don't feel weird living there cuz the one thing that I've felt about Vegas is I always enjoy going there and enjoy leaving more I'm like gimme home but that's because you go there with that intention like for me I built my compound right so it is home it's 100% home it's it's exciting to be home and the best part about it is like first I built the compound this dream house to invite like all my friends I'm a hospitable guy so I like I want artists to come there my friends had come there stay there with me with family and the next best thing was calling my mom and my sister who lived together and I said well you moved to Vegas will you be in my neighborhood and they said yes and that was the best money I ever spent was buy my mom a house and they you know like they live around the corner my mom's cooking like by the time I'm home I see my mom all the time and I never had the opportunity we had this ten plus year gap where I see her like once every six months because I'm just touring like a beast right now I just see my family a lot more you know like it so in a way I'm trying to bring my family all to Vegas my cousin's moved from from the East Coast with his wife and his mom to Vegas you know before my mom so I have my cousin there I have my mom my sister there with their daughter my brother Kevin who's a restaurant tour as well he's you know planning to make the move because we're gonna open up some restaurants on the strip dan you got your fingers in a lot of pies and on that pie note I do have pizza okey yes I do I have 19 kitchens now Wow yeah it's been about about year in two months and we're growing at a rapid rate and I would imagine 19 and 19 19 kitchens most of them are in Los Angeles because that's you know like that's where we kind of broke ground and we're just like opening up kitchens in all the areas that that uh post space was giving us information like yo this is where it makes sense to do that so we work with all the delivery hubs and it mostly delivery thing or do you it's just yeah I do have two dining locations but the whole business model is about delivery really yeah it's all about delivery and that way my costs are very low and then I could be effective like I'm not really spending much money on marketing and and what's funny is is that people love to post about pizza and Pete's Aoki is a pretty fun concept dude fight companion Pete Aoki Saturday let's make it I will send as many Pizza Oh keys you guys need like whenever you wanna a live fight companion for the UFC this Saturday it would be like 11 a.m. in the morning because it's in Abu Dhabi so we'll hit it up make that happen yeah oh we got all kinds of pizzas but most importantly you know the the idea of pizza okey might sound like a gimmick and you're like okay I'll try it out but 60% of the people or in Pete's Aoki are returned so we know that it's quality you know I would imagine that you doing anything half-assed no so do you do you get you know so you've essentially like created your own world in Vegas so everyone's there that you know and you could take the thing about Vegas right is like the allure of the strip but you're kind of removed from that anyway you don't do drugs you don't drink right you don't fuck around with anything no yeah that's like one of the things that we talk like oh you know when we talked about how I'm sustainable is that you you have to not do the certain things that that make it unsustainable right so I never really got into drugs I do talk about my book my first acid trip when I was 13 but that scared the living shit out of me it's to stay away from anything loosens genic and like literally got 13 so I just stay away from drugs that's a bad time to do acid it's a very very funny story but it got to the point where I just became this this straightedge hardcore kid I became extremely religious because I was in this like I was 13 I was looking up going I'm gonna be fucked for the rest of my life like when you're on acid you're like fucking out there you're just so fucked up and and when you start thinking like this is how I'm going to be forever you're clinging on to anything that can get you out right and for me when I grew up as a kid I'm almost putting me into like Catholic schools and one of the best thing the Catholic schools do is indoctrinate kids on fear and so we you know like you know I remember going up to the drawing board like there is like a drawing of what hell is like guess who's going there forever people that don't believe you know and you know when you're young you start seeing that and and then when you get into a place of vulnerability where you're like where I was I was like scared shitless I was like I'm gonna go to an insane award when I'm 13 because I can't gather this acid hell trip how long did it last I guess like what seven eight hours but every second is like a minute you know because you cannot sleep you cannot stop thinking about what you're in I mean there is like it's like this exaggerated emotions like the first part of my acid trip was like I was so funny I was laughing at everything it was like the best thing ever did oh my god everything is so funny I'm just laughing I'm like in pain because I'm like so just laughing and everything just everything's joyous and then like I went into this upside-down world like stranger things when I got dropped off at my friend's house and everyone went dark and my friends were my friends 14 he doesn't do drugs so he was and his mom must come down okay everything's okay no no they knew I was on acid but they're like you're like I'm like a 80 pound Japanese kid you know five foot it's you know like a little kid like what the hell is my doing acid for you know I do talk about like where that came out but um yeah so like when I was when I got flipped in that world then everything was like I saw Street Fighter I like fireballs from Ryu coming at me like when I close when I close my eyes it was very very vibrant and vivid and I mean it was it's it's a trip for sure so once you regain sanity you're like enough of any of this nonsense yeah yeah once I was like oh my god I'm back this is this is for real like I have fuck drugs fuck this shit you know like and then I was like I'm straight edge cuz that's the music I was starting to get into and then I was like I'm all about God and Jesus it's gonna save me you know like he saved me so like as a kid I was very religious going out and that you know start exploring more about the world and and then went more from this face or faith based concepts of living through life to you know things that needed me more it needed to make sense for me I'm very much more scientific on like the understanding of how I want to see things where where did the change take place when did it take place uh that would happen to be college and post where'd you go school UC Santa Barbara so when you went was great and I love Santa Barbara it's like the hidden gem of California right yeah so sweet out there yeah so you just became educated started learning more about things and it's yeah it I don't know if there was like one spark that happened it was just kind of like I just had questions about why things happen like what what is religion like what you know you know how things work in the world how societies are built did you study theology a little a little but I don't know if that would be like the philosophy classes I was taking was not really the the crux of it sociology was my major I was Women's Studies and sociology when I was in college women's studies yeah well yeah well yeah I have to say like strangely nothing that's the first thing you think about right why is a guy in women's studies like trying to understand I mean the reason why I was in that department is because my favorite teachers were the ones teaching those classes so I just was like all right I'll try this one and then Oh like wow this is a pretty interesting I'll try another one and and then I was like well I'll just I'll finish off the major and uh you know I'd have to say like the stuff that I learned in school it's in large part of how I kind of looked through kind of like navigate through our life like sociology I am a sociologist I've want to study people like why they do certain things you know like how do i navigate them in different directions well and then you've become a purveyor of great fun like that's essentially what you do profession you give people a great time yeah your shows are this wild extremely energetic experience for people and they leave there's a certain level of transform ins right I've watched some of your shit online and you do these enormous crowds man and it's so epic and you see all those people going fucking crazy and dance along to your shit I mean it's got to be a wild wild feeling knowing that you're giving this really positive experiences right thousands and thousands of people that are just roaring along to your music yeah Wow ya know as you say I'm like you know you know like because it's exactly what you're saying and that's why I'm I guess you can say I'm addicted to that and because I care so much about that I have to be sustainable you know that goes back to what we're talking about like what do I do is you do - there's no fucking way you could do 250 shows a year and get fucked up 250 oh yeah because there's a lot you know in that business especially you know the business of electronic dance music there's a lot of people doing Molly right there's a lot of people doing all kinds of amphetamines and all kinds of crazy shit and you know think like you do that every night man you're gonna look like an 80 year old man 40 years old because you've literally burned the candle with a blowtorch you've used that Elon Musk not a flame thing you know I mean it's but you know what I always say if whenever I have the opportunity is that for the people in my crowds and I had to say country-by-country they're very different as far as like what I think if they're doing drugs or not where they do the most drugs um no I don't think so I don't but you know it's hard like it's like I'm just judging right I don't know like what people are doing out there I could judge by how interactive they are that's the best way I can tell right if they're like yeah that's the worst that's the worst like subject to play - it's like literally playing at a cocktail party when their backs returned to you it's the same kind of thing for me so if they're already high and they just like loss in their world like it's no fun for me plus I spent so much time making like my sets so interactive so engaging and entertaining like it's bit disrespectful but like you know some people are gonna do it you're not gonna be like the debbie downer be like yeah everyone drugs get the hell out of here what percentage do you think in Vegas would leave oh I don't know I don't know I know you want it I don't even want to know I don't even want to know honestly nice weird weeds different though yeah weeds more like chill you know like but if you're so like highs went off your head where you can't you don't even know where you are what's going on then like you just lose the whole experience I mean a lot of times people like what happened yeah well I mean what's the point of you know the experience if you're so blitzed out of your head you don't even know what's going on so allegedly during the experience they're having a good time and yeah yeah but I mean that's it's a well it's a really wonderful way to make a living it's a it's like literally the dream come true you know to make people happy get to be I always say like I feel like I'm the chef in the kitchen making the food and I go out and I get to watch people eat my food and then they're like oh this is really good I'm like I'm like yes you know like since I see that feeling I'm like let's go back and make more food but we got to sprinkle more truffle on that and then let's deliver and then get a C and then they're like you're the you're the chef Mike that's me you know like so like it's like I get that luck lucky position to be able to to make my music and then share it and hope that they have the same feeling that I have sharing it so how many shows do you do in Vegas and how many shows you do abroad uh around 40 in Vegas so to ten forty a year forty year so how do you when do you they're like how do you still have residency is where Hakkasan omnia jewels smaller club of theirs and and what Republic so there's four properties that I play which is nice because if I had to play 40 shows in one I mean it wouldn't necessarily be that bad because thing about Vegas is a transient crowd right so it's always no matter what even on one weekend I might be playing possibly three or four times for one weekend right and every show I do while there's a day party in a club that the club is a complete different influx of people coming in because let the people that saw me the day party are gonna go see chainsmokers or a marshmallow or you know whoever else or Calvin Harris or whatever is playing out on the strip the competition is as thick as it gets every night there's the biggest DJ's playing alongside you know each other is amazing if you stop and think about what a crazy change that is to an entertainment environment like the Vegas the transformation to that electronic music around like you said 2010 there's not a thing like that that you can point to anywhere else in the world where like all the sudden this one dominant form of entertainment has taken over the entire nightlife of a city right like other than a big some sort of big event that's in Vegas the fucking rodeo or the UFC or something like that where everybody comes in to see that right you guys are what's up I mean that is what's up in Vegas it's the it dominates it what how did that happen that's a crazy thing it really is yeah when you say it like them like no place like if you go to New York if you go to LA if you all places all around the world there's no other thing that has transformed the nightlife of a city the way electronic music has transformed Vegas transformed changed everything went from non-existent to number one with a bullet like there's not even a close second it's all electronic music Anthony Bourdain used to hate it it was you know he was like it was old and crotchety be if these places all the music and it just wasn't his thing but he still was in awe I love that happen I love that guy yeah I never met him but he was awesome yeah yeah there's a plenty of people that that do go to Vegas were like this is so annoying and kids running around like kids but like young adults running around you know especially they day like in their bikinis right I mean I guess probably people would like that but in any case it's a yeah it's also different for the casino operators because they're dealing with this younger generation of people - right and they have to think differently about how they're gonna get them to you know do what Vegas is meant to be you know with the economy is serving gambling yeah well they're paying to see you as well and alcohol sales as well yeah I think alcohol have become a large large portion of their revenue right I think that like I could be wrong here but the gambling side is actually a smaller portion then the everything else I think that's true I think that's shifted I've read something about that recently that Entertainment has become the primary revenue source in Vegas whereas it used to be gambling right but it's you know there's they're still gambling but boy it's hard to just convince young people to start gambling yeah it's easy to convince them to start dancing yep you know yeah it's like it seems normal its natural there's also when you're young you don't have the money to just risk but you have the money to go and like experience fun yes yeah you know like when you're older you're like okay I can I have some of like flexible income streams I can put down on some blackjack what I would have loved to seen the Sinatra days like Vegas when it was run by the mob the Rat Pack and Miss Jean I just would love to been in the room and watch watch one of those shows and then you know come to today and see how things have changed I mean I think that's like the Bourdain thing like he had been there when he was young and then see it changed now right but I am fascinated by change I don't resist it and I don't I don't say are the good old days that don't mean shit to me I am absolutely on the same page as you yeah I'm interested you know I'm yeah I'm always interested in the next thing I want to try the next thing you know and you know you want to enhance your experience you want to enhance what you're doing to make it serve you better but if you went to someone in like 1985 it said hey man guess what 2019 electronic music shit people go what are you talking about get this guy out of here man there's one one guy that did say that though who Jim Morrison did he really yeah so like he did a prediction it's like somewhere I'm sure you can find it but you did a prediction where whenever he was alive I guess I guess probably 70 60 or 70 so he said like the future will be one one person with some sort of computer or something it was that's going to be devised electronically or something like and that one person will be making music for people and and performing that now watch a video so remember yeah so I I forgot what he said but he said something to that effect and it's like it's crazy because that was what 50 years play this take it from the beginning music indigenous to this country are the black music blues and the kind of folk music that was brought over from Europe and when I guess they call it country music or the kind of West Virginia a higher lonesome sound those those are the two main streams of route American music then we have these others I don't know but uh like ten years ago what they called rock and roll was kind of a blending of those two forms I guess in four or five years the new generations music will be it'll have a synthesis of those two elements and some third thing it'll be entire maybe it will be it might rely heavily on electronics tapes I can kind of envision maybe a one person with a lot of machines tapes and electronic setups singing or speaking and using machines yes from what his mind says of what he can consider is what that would be it's you know he did predict yeah I mean where it is you know like I think that's what happens when you do acid correctly [Laughter] get those sort of visions yeah because I mean also Jim Morrison like you could tell he's he's such an artist that you know he could after the doors you just be himself yeah you know he would have done in Jim Morrison album or he's made all the music he's done everything he would be exactly what he's saying he's basically predicting what he would have in my opinion what he would become and he was probably like 25 in that video which is even crazier yeah and we died at 27 that's that's crazy nuts yeah nuts I mean that whole era of the 1960's fascinates me to no end I love the cars I love the sound to this day most of the music I listen to is classic rock I mean I listen to a lot of new stuff but man I will pull out some fuckin classic rock I love it I love listening to it yeah there's something about it that makes me it just makes me realize what a profound change it was between the 1950s and 1960s that the culture exploded that something happened something happened and the the clothes and the music and the sounds and the fucking muscle car it's like everything went haywire like you went from 1950 to 1960 and just a rat shit right right there's so many great artists you know Hendrix and yeah the whole idea of like like okay now it's time to experiment and to free ourselves from the confines of what like you know it's yes Yeah right the doors wide open I think Buddy Holly was great I loved Buddy Holly but if you go from Buddy Holly to Hendrix you like what you know that's what acid trip actually goes right like you're say they said used to put acid in his bandanna I don't know if that's true yeah that it would seep into his skin as he was planning he's just like lighting his guitar on fire and picking with his teeth man how much would you love to watch that guy live oh yeah that was been incredible to be in the presence of something completely unique you know this hippie black dude who's the greatest guitarists of all time still still yeah there's no one like there's some amazing guys today Gary Clark jr. and of course you know Stevie Ray Vaughan was amazing there's a bunch of great amazing guitars but also the showmanship though you know the outfits the like it's like all of the combined not just his his technical ability yes the fact that he was doing these these things that you're like you know some of the guitars won't wouldn't do that that's not part of their like you know protocol but he was just like on another world yeah and it should be a part of that you know see that it's incredible a complete outlier yeah yes and again like no one was like that before that and I go to the 1940s it's only 20 years I mean 20 years ago is you know we're dealing with you know 1999 that's that doesn't seem that long ago yeah but 69 to 49 you might as well be from another world yeah you really might as well be might as well be another planet so what do you think was one of the bigger cultural shifts of why that happened drugs simply hundred percent yeah hundred percent yeah I mean obviously when we talk about Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles and The Beach Boys I like whoever else is like yoges yeah adores Joplin drugs yeah drugs The Doors drugs right everyone drugs they were there taking mind-expanding psychedelics and the culture had shifted to embrace these mind-expanding psychedelics and there was also the resistance to the Vietnam War there's this rebellious movement there's these young compassionate people that were trying to figure their way through life in a way that didn't resonate with the way their parents had set boundaries and standards and they wanted out of all of it that Goldwater Republican shit they wanted to be free in fact our children and hippies and yeah then Woodstock and all that craziness you know yeah and what's amazing is how quickly it ended you know yeah so many things case right so many things the deaths yeah the death scared people you know like you know at the end of the day like when when they're dropping at 27 yeah you're heroes Morrison Janis Joplin Hendrix all 27 and and like they're the leaders of this experimental revolution yep not good it's gonna end things pretty quick I think there was that there was also the sweeping psychedelic Act of 1970 that made everything schedule one and they were locking people up in jail they were also passing laws directly was there was a civil rights movement was having at the same time and they were passing laws that were directly targeting the people in the civil rights movement because they knew that they were smoking grass and they were doing mushrooms I say we're going after them with these drug laws and then you know they would arrest one person they would turn on everybody else and then you know they would do like mob tactics well and you know the whole thing they just poured water on it it took you know it took like 10 or 20 years before shit started popping again yeah you know in terms of like the influence of psychedelic culture again really more like 30 years you know it's like the 2000s where things started happening again or people started becoming more and more aware of the positive benefits of psychedelic drugs and altered states of consciousness not trying to escape reality but trying to get a grip on reality from a different perspective you know that's an interesting like like when I think about psychedelics in that regard of mind expansion or you know if you at the same time it's like this uncontrolled situation that like okay we're gonna jump in this world but there's no way to really control your lane it's just like this yeah it's like yes we can go there well it might not end up you might get stuck there that's my problem yeah with that you could get stuck you know I mean like you you hear the horror stories and that scares the hell did you like this guy's still on an acid trip for 25 years walking around that you know thinking chasing him pass it in particular yeah like shine on you crazy diamond and I think there's there's people that have a predisposition towards psychosis there's certain people that have schizophrenia in their their their genes yes in their answer and for those people it's very dangerous you know what else is very dangerous for those people edible marijuana not just like what you think of as hardcore psychedelics but I've known acquired quite a few people that have eaten edible marijuana and a blown fuse Wow yeah there's something I just recently did which is pretty exciting for me was um you know once again a scientific information I'm just gonna wing it but I I tried this brain cap on okay this has all these nodules like that can read the neurotransmitters in my brain and it's connected to a computer and you you sit there for about a minute and you just you I kind of meditate on really focus on one one thing so it could start like reading your your brain basically your neuro transmission signals and it's kind of like neural feedback on steroids if you know anything about neural feedback and it gave me a list of categories of what I want to know about Who I am I've no I always thought that I had a slight a TD I never was diagnosed because I have like if if Joe Rogan's boring me I might like turn over here you know like the my intention is normal yeah I know right but I was like I don't have that bad of a TD where I can't concentrate to get things done because I get things done but I do have I do think about a lot more things and I think I should maybe so anyways I was I did this test and it shows like your signals coming and and it has all these different things like anxiety delusion schizophrenia you know attention so forth you know absolutely incredible I was like okay I'm scared to press this button schizophrenia I'm really scared but I want to know so it gives you the feeling of being schizophrenic tivity if you if you have a tendency to be let's get a friend I thought you were saying like there's a way for the that's that's like futures but like I want to see if like do I have the the neural pathways that that a schizophrenic person would with you know how they would think about the world you know so you know I clicked on that I'm like I'm good you know I'm good okay good so what about delusion okay anxiety low okay so I got a lot of information out of that so I guess the reason why I'm sharing that is that you know you should try this out you think it's something that that I think you'd be interested in interested yeah do you mind you know the name of you well they they flew to me just like I'm saying like I love to meet groups and organizations and research researchers and scientists and these people knew I was putting out to the world they came they flew all to me like some from Colorado some from Toronto and and and they they did this test on my head on my brain yeah so I'll get you information on that we're gonna try it out and see if it's something that that that's like interests you but I'm sure it will I'm in it's very exciting stuff it sounds I hope I'm not crazy fuck what do you do if you find out you're really insane you need to be locked up and all sudden people come well you wouldn't even know right if you're really crazy you like you think it like you know the five people are on the corner chasing after you they're always there real or is a beautiful mind cut a bit about the problem with dumb people's that they they're too stupid to know they're dumb so they think everybody else is dumb yeah if it's a problem yeah so if you're crazy you might think everybody's crazy right even though yeah like the brain scan is making you crazy it's like what you might think that everybody else is crazy right now and you do the brain scan like no no it's you yeah you're tricking me you're you're doing something to me I have you ever met people that blame everyone else in their life yes all their problems yes sure yeah and they can't see what we can see yeah I can see hey man it's you yeah you are causing yes of your problems yes but yes you never are self-critical yeah looking externally for all of your issues you're criticizing everyone but you are the architect of your own demise right and you don't even realize I think that is one of the the biggest problems for like why people are not finding their own success yeah you know because they keep blaming other people for problems when they could use that same time to actually focus on a small success that's realistic in their trajectory or whatever they're doing yeah and I've seen that a lot with my you know some people I know just it's it they get stuck in that that that framework and then there might be people that enable that same mindset yeah its patterns as well like sometimes people develop these defensive patterns in order to protect themselves from reality and they put up these psychic shields to sort of protect themselves from self-critical ideas or externally critical ideas and they just don't want to deal with change they don't they want to pretend that they're the fucking man they're the coolest everything else is dumb yeah and God it's such a toxic way to view the world it really is and the people that have that view gain no traction that you almost always fall apart yeah it's just it's unsustainable it's not a way to live your life no yeah it's it's fucking hard to see to man it's hard to see you if you know someone that's like that you almost kind of gotta go away yeah anymore yeah well I think also for them they see the success of other people and they're like like they want to be that but they're like yeah you know they obviously can't with they just blame everyone that they can't be that person right now instead of just like going well you gotta take these small baby steps to get out of this funk and then eventually you know stop comparing yourself to other people but compare yourself till you're yourself yes no look at yourself critically but I think another thing that's really important is to enjoy other people's success instead of being jealous which is a really common easy to understand sort of an emotional reaction to other people's success you what the best way to look at it in my opinion the best way to look at is look at someone else doing amazing things I go fuck this is amazing yeah well they've done right be excited by it and then be inspired exactly you can use it as fuel in a positive way and then also there's no negative feeling like that person doesn't have to feel like you're you're fucking giving them the sour face because you're you're jealous and bitter and weird and you're looking to be critical of them and find flaws in them look at what they're doing like look at like if you were a guy who's coming up right and you wanted to be a guy who makes electronic music and I'm sure you have haters oh my god they're lined up lined up I'm sure yeah why why do you haters because you're fucking awesome that's why is what you're doing is fuckin awesome so instead of saying man this guy is inexhaustible is excited about what he's doing he's got a real passion for creating things people love it and your attitude about making these shows and giving these people this amazing time and how much focus and energy you put into it what a should look at that and go this I gotta do more of that I gotta do more that I gotta get more investments but instead they try to poke holes right that is a sore spot for people to sore spot for assholes yeah yeah nothing you can do about that you just have to you got to keep on being you but yeah they're they're they're hell and their prison is that they're focusing on you yeah you know they're hating and focusing on yep yeah true words yeah it's um it's a weird world being an entertainer isn't it yeah it's a different kind of lifestyle you know it's you know I mean actually the strange things when I think about like like Fame or whatever is celebrity hood when I walk through certain areas I get like I have to just go okay I have to accept the photos I've to accept like people coming up to me I want to be the asshole because I've been that kid going up to someone and they're mean to me and I'll be like oh that guy is a dick you know and they'll think of you that way for us if even if you're just in a bad day or some you know you just the one that was me the most people coming up to you while you're eating I had a guy come up to me right now last night in the middle of like literally cutting food and in a crowded restaurant yeah and he's hovering over the table trying to get me to get up and take a photo I'm like dude what if I did that for everybody like what if I just yeah right that's a ridiculous request yeah like you shouldn't do that like yeah what did you say did you say okay let's take a picture I said yeah we're in the middle of them yeah not like that we're in the middle of Andrew Schultz my buddy and we were in the middle of talking to ya this guy just interrupted the conversation wanted pictures like there's a time and a place for it right if you want to say hey when you're leaving can I get a picture sure yeah sure yeah well you got a mouthful of food and you're cutting food and somebody come on you can't interrupt meals yeah it's a ridiculous that happens to me all the time it's what's stupid but you know what's really weird in LA doesn't help me that much well many people are more accustomed to seeing famous people yeah and they're like I don't want to you know they just get it they don't to bug you some but everywhere else LA New York I'm not really bothered as much everywhere else it's like it just is just gonna just have to accept it but you can't interrupt people while they're eating when I'm talking to my kids right it's a stupid thing to do yeah you have to have manners you have to have some sort of an understanding that this is a human being right is living their own life and even though you're a fan of them you're being a fan does not take precedent you you can't just don't owe you this right no can't just interrupt their life and you shouldn't want that yeah didn't want to interrupt someone in the middle of a conversation in the middle of the meal in the middle of talking to their children it's a foolish way to interact with them I remember one time I was you know in a deep conversation just like you're talking about with someone outside of the casino about to leave and the sky is just drunk and he's just like like staring and like wobbling and like you know doing his thing and I just see him hovering and I'm not gonna engage with him I'm just talking and finally I'm like hey man I'm just in the middle of converse a and you know well I didn't say we'll get a photo later I'm like well talk to you later because I didn't I don't want to like be presumptuous and I got done with the conversation and and he was just very aggressive and I just I just ran I remember I ran to my car and I'm like I just don't want to get into this you know like and he's chasing me oh my god chasing me and just like fuck you I was your fan you've like treated me like shit you treat your fans like I'm like oh my god this is just too much you know and like and it stays with you you know like even though I don't know that's a problem Vegas - yeah people are at it's like they're at New Year's Eve level every night you know I stopped doing shows a couple years ago on New Year's Eve because every time I was doing was like why does everybody think it's okay to be an asshole tonight yeah people want a heckle they want to yell things out I was like on New Year's Eve I'm just gonna stay home yeah I'm gonna hang out I'm not gonna do shows it just seems too chaotic right never feel that feels like a real show well Vegas is like there's a lot of people that are running around like every night like just going crazy it's yeah it's such a wild place it's a Hall Pass it's like okay we got to go big we're here 24 hour drive right yeah free booze of you gambling yeah wacky thing when they give you a drug that fucks up your decision rate and then you're gonna gamble everything you have yeah how is that legal you're gambling an or massan's of money and they're giving you alcohol right it's just so crazy I don't know but I love it I love that it exists I love that there's a city where everything is kind of wild where everything is like things are okay I play pool in Vegas is one of the rare places where pool halls or 24 hours a day so you could play pool - a 5 o'clock in the morning 6 o'clock in the morning you know you and there'll be good players in there yeah and you know people really appreciate pool and you know everything 24 you get good meals like really late at night yeah that's that's for sure yeah yeah it's a wild place it really is but you because you're a clean and sober guard you avoid all the pitfalls yeah yeah I think that's like how it works for me because I'm not like I'm not a strip club guy you know I I just I don't I've learned my lesson on gambling I guess that was my gamble I did I did but um blackjack mainly and that's just the worst thoughts for you it's the most you've ever lost in the night 50/50 K Dana White told me lost a million bucks one night yeah I'm not at that level he won seven million and then when he won okay baby he's as far as like my date is crazy but they kicked him out of the casino they said he can't come back yeah that's the problem you actually win you like do well for yourself when the odds are stacked against you and they kick you out that's crazy well the crazy thing is he's just gambling yeah he just happened to win what are we doing is this really gambling or drugs dealing money from people yeah what are you doing yeah the guy won and they like where you're not allowed to play here anymore right you know he's not stealing yeah Dana White yeah you know he's rich yeah exactly you know he's just a gambler yeah so this is like real gambling this is not like some guy with some sort of a scheme is cheating yeah someone's doing something with exactly actually gambling yeah and you're mad at him right back because you lost yeah that's I know following the rules they'll ban you from the casino yeah I almost wish I was like can I get to that level that's like can I get there where I'm I've just won not much but interested I don't gamble at all I used to gamble on fights yeah um but then I was like maybe I shouldn't be doing this cuz I'm doing commentary in these fights yeah conflict of interest but that was the early days like the early 2000s like 2003 and 4 and shit like that yeah because they wouldn't have some wacky numbers back then to like guys would come in from other organizations and these odds makers didn't know who they were and I was a fanatic I knew who everybody was I mean guys are fighting in Japan cuz there was times where a guy was the favorite and I was like that guy has no chance he's gonna get hurt Yeah right and I was right like 80% of time like my friend Aubrey and I've given him tips guy give him tips now cuz I don't Campbell myself right but we're like a 86% we know why stop then because of because you're commented I don't there's no law against it I can't affect the outcome but I don't want to be psychotic psychologically I don't want to be subliminally influenced right or subconsciously influenced like yawning someone to win yeah like if you've got $10,000 riding on a fight yeah you're gonna want that guy Yeah right right how much of a professional you are yeah you know when someone loses you're gonna be like you're supposed to be there to do justice to the experience of these two guys going at it and giving their all right supposed to be hoping one guy yeah that's true it's also really hard for me when a friends fighting you know yeah Daniel Cormier fights is very hard for me to see him very hard yeah my last fight with steep a and I love steep a too but to watch steep a beat the shit out of Daniel was rough it really hard yeah because Daniel is such a good guy I love that guy and to watch him eat those left hooks to the body and then get beaten downs like oh that must be hard and I'm commentating on it like it's an amazing thing I'm watching right right it is amazing so it's hard to separate you know when Brendan Schaub was fighting it was the hardest that was the hardest cuz I was good friends with him yeah I knew he really didn't wanna fight anymore and I was like God god that's that's really that must be really hard it was when he doesn't want to fight anymore and he's just getting beaten he was getting beaten and he was getting beaten bad and I didn't I didn't see an end to it who's the guy with the nose that went crooked like this recently Mike Perry oh that sure is crazy Craig I can't believe someone can continue fighting when their nose is literally across her face that dudes a savage I mean you have to be a savage like 100 percent bona fide dyed-in-the-wool like he literally like imagine what he's fighting through when he has his his his nose over here it's his faith has to be completed numb well well no no no no or I be I don't know I don't really know pain okay massive pain the sinuses are one of the most sensitive areas of your face when you get your nose shattered first of all you can't see your eyes are watering and his nose is pouring blood Oh mines getting choked right he's in the middle of getting Chuck nose like oh that is the worst fucking nose I've ever seen in my life of all the years of calling fights the only thing that comes close is Rich Franklin when he fought Anderson Silva pull up rich Franklin's nose versus Anderson Silva and you'll see similar but not quite as horrific but the thing is about Rich Franklin was bummed out about his nose whereas you know Mike Perry was like fuck yeah he didn't you look at the one the far left right there far left far left far left right there click that one that's the one where Anderson Silva sort of reconstructed his nose it's hard to see in that picture make it larger so that that's his nose after yeah it's all shifted off yeah that's you know looks all fucked up Wow with that ain't shit compared to Mike Perry so Mike Perry's is the worst nose in the history of the sport today I mean what does he look like now who's that guy's nose click on that one in the middle above above let's think Gronk a little bit Jesus Wow whose fucking noses that Jesus it went up into his forehead looks like this worse nose breaks in the UFC who is that dude yeah he looks like looks like half his nose is a up in his eyelids oh my god that's just swelling right but look how March shift Ryan mcgillivray whew that's rough Wow Jesus Christ Wow yeah yeah not still smiling nose he's still smiling there's Shogun Shogun's nose got fucked up too I think that was against John Jones yeah Conley their Congolese nose got shattered yeah man and then you got to get it all reconstructed and they got a sort of Stitch the bones back together again because if you get this bone shatters I make oh man there's not much there you know it's such a tight if you feel that bone it's like so gentle right so delicate yeah if you take a knee they're like oh that's how they're breaking right yeah he's all right now well it looks pretty good damn they did an amazing job freaking straighten pizza I mean yoki pizza haha but the crazy thing is his nose was look like the worst situation that you could possibly get in and his nose now looks pretty normal or the other guys as noses are just like that one guy with the bolt right by his eyebrows like and his nose is still curved to the right and you smile and like you assume Mike Perry would have that kind of nose after that that kind of guys right after the fight you know Mike Perry had to go through extensive surgery yesyes well I was where does that fight take place Uruguay yes oh yeah South America yeah so he had to stay there and get really extensive surgery was there for several days just to try to recover before he could fly home the scary thing is he's gonna get back in the ring fuck yeah is loves it and then that that bone that he's gonna have is gonna break down again is it gonna be weaker or is it gonna I wish I could tell you I don't know you know really because imagine if it just shatters again he's got to do it again yeah we got his nose reconstructed who's what is this not a UFC but it's called UFC kicked in the face oh that's the worst nose ever oh my that's horrible oh my god yeah that's the one that said oh there the guy in the bottom is a guy who got his nose damaged somehow or another and they grew it on his head oh it's a hard business man what kind of exercise do you do I'm I like hit training high intensity yeah high intensity and it you know kind of like blending two worlds I'm you know I stopped gambling the casino but I love gambling with my friends and I love making profits on you know just my recent one was a body fat challenge because I was a 19.6 April 14th 9% yeah and then I dropped to well by the bet list if I can drop til ten percent in three months well that's easy well maybe for someone that really understands how to do that but like you know I I wanted to get there and I just like when I work out I kind of work out just on being healthy and cardiovascular and just like you know just staying in shape but I didn't I never thought I'd get below 10% but you must have changed your diet pretty oh yeah cut out sugar cut out bread exactly all that stuff stay below 80 hundred calories and you are your vegetarian still no I eat chicken and fish but I stopped eating I don't eat any cows or you know Cal's pork pig or lamb or anything like that but I'd pretty much stay with the chicken and fish my proteins and are you what are you there I think I'm 12 really right there yeah cuz I you keeping your fat in your brain that doesn't make any sense you know it's it's in my eyes I mean I'm probably where I am now because I've you know the bet ended in July 14th but I did win the bet so I made 15 grand for my friends but you know that's like how I'm motivated to do things I'd like to make bets with people to have these little challenges and then with that timeline then I you know work with my trainer who was you know holding the towel down and and he trains me every time I'm home and he gets me on my meal plans so I deal with him all the time do you do like a meal prep service I do it through his company oh yeah so I design company diced diced kitchen I think dice kitchen he's your friend huh yeah but like you know he's like it just gets like my assistant puts it in the fridge but you know it's all like chicken and vegetables yeah pretty much turkey chicken fish and then and then veggies and you drop down to 1,800 calories a day drop down to 1,800 calories a day and this is the hard part is I'm on the rode like you know more than 60% of the days when I was not touring across Europe and when I'm touring across Europe all summer long I'm gone so how are you getting like really healthy food every meal when you're doing this I round ball you know i ball kind of my calorie count whenever I eat and I have my fitness pal as my my judge you know is that My Fitness Pal is on an app it's an app yeah Under Armour app that okay that like I just put in all my food so you just use it to just make sure that I'm eyeballing this 1800 calorie deficit kind of diet and then you know just avoid the over starchy over carbee foods and focus more on eating the proteins and the veggies and the netic vitamins or supplements ooh yeah like I try to try to switch it on and off like I said like before after after I met ray I was like okay I need to just find out what I'm deficient and I'm gonna just load up on those and then I went to see dr. Grossman who kind of gave me my like 22 page pack of of my telomere links to cancer markers if I have them you know to like what I'm allergic to to when i'm deficient in and then and then i followed that regimen of what the vitamins i was taking some of which was i still take like one is called seller gin it's kind of like a you know the closest thing to a stem cell-like injection if you can if you swallow it it's like you know it's got this and a lot of anti-aging properties in it seller Jen Selter Jen what's in it look it up and you could do your joke and research on that and give me some card but I just trusted my doctor on this one but it's expensive it's like ten dollars a pill really pull that a seller Jen and I take me a skeptical hippo face and I also take a website Prager pro-gard's yeah so it's a one trillion probiotics Wow it's a little like I take that every day really you know for the Bao Swiss cell therapy seller Jen hmm hello there thank you for visiting seller Jen's online store popup window boink so hmm this is what is it two thousand dollars for six months damn it is expense it's very expensive and what is it backed by lu lu marine complex peptide II collagen bio DNA hydro m and peptide sounds are you gonna piss hot sir other include lutein grape skin extract selenium which is important coenzyme q10 I take that that's one thing that Ray Kurzweil's really pushes is that that q10 yeah it's great for cognitive function yeah you fuck around with mushrooms at all I mean like healthy mushrooms like lion's mane or anything like that no really good stuff that's what I've been drinking this is all Lions made elixir now try that I drink the shit all the time it's supports brain function yeah that's like anything that's about the brain I want to know more about yeah that's one of my sponsors this is for sig manic I'll have them send you some of this to please please and then we we actually have lion's mane that we put in the coffee too yeah and then Laird Hamilton's superfood shit have you seen that coffee machine that I have on yeah oh I'm gonna get you something to drink on yes yes I do okay we wrapped this up I'll make you a nice cup of tumeric coffee oh I love Tamara cough yeah well he's sent Laird Hamilton has this amazing machine out there that he gave us we got one of the first machines and it's he mixes coconut oil coconut milk turmeric organic coffee and it's fucking delicious and it's actually very good for you well and then he also has like this bag of mushrooms cordyceps mushrooms and lion's mane you could scoop that in there but lion's mane in particular is what I'm really interested in because it supports brain function you know and if you've seen the work of Paul Stamets do you know no I'll turn you on to him and send you a link to the podcast I did with him he'll blow your fucking mind when he's talking about the power of functional mushrooms not just mushrooms like psychedelic mushrooms which he's into that as well he thinks that psychedelic mushrooms in low doses are like one of the most powerful nootropics that you could have like micro dosing yeah yeah but instead of getting blitzed out of your mind and going into another dimension you take it just a little bit every day just a little tiny bit and it gives you this like overwhelming feeling of operating at a very high functions weird feeling but it's that micro dosing psilocybin thing is swept through the fighter community there's a lot of Fighters that are training while they're micro dosing mushrooms Wow yeah it's very interesting why they're doing that why why is it trainers why well Donald Cerrone he's really into it and a few other fighters have followed suit and Donald I think started doing it because of Joe Schilling who's a world champion kickboxer and he's fighting for Bellator now and they just find that there's something about the way it interacts the way the psilocybin and particularly in low doses interacts with your brain that it just seems to supercharge your ability to understand what a person is doing likes especially specifically according to Joe when he's sparring with people well says he like almost can like read their minds Wow yeah that's really interesting yeah very very interesting I know a lot of people's a lot of skiers skiers like to microdose it's becoming this a thing where people try to take like a functional amount so like you're not getting blitzed you just take what is it functional not it's a good question good question at East like a like a stem like a little drop no that's even I mean the best way to find out what it would be would be to grind it up so you know the exact ounces and then right in a capsule yeah and then figure it out and I think that's what a lot of these guys are doing it's just very unfortunate that that is a Schedule one drug yeah right a natural life form that grows on earth it's a fungus yeah it's on a drug yeah and it's got some pretty potent positive qualities to it right but outside of you know anything that's psychoactive or psychedelic that lion's mane stuff is the shit well let's put it as water right now that Sun it's gonna be a it's gonna be my Elan musk smoking weed moment right now thank you so other than that other than this sell stuff what is it again what's our job I wish I had like my someone from my team kind of give me my whole list cuz I take something for I think a lot of brain cognitive stuff that I know that objects not some might can be considered that way but it's for my doctor that you know in you know from what I I do enough research to on the doctors and they they tell me kind of what I should take and and I go ok let's try this out and see if and like you know my my performance increases and then I stop so I'll do it for like a month and I'll stop and I'll take a different like you know I have like two different routes of vitamins and I'd take a different route and see if that changes my patterns or how I'm you know what my performance is like and I kind of like just experiment over again over and again have you ever done the isolation tank floating in a yeah yeah I love that do you do that I did it twice it's very new to me but it's like it's incredible yeah you need one of those in your life yes she can't when I was in your crazy fun house I know I was thinking about that there's one place in Henderson where I live that does that saw was gonna first do that first there yeah do it man we have one here yeah I mean like the last two years like the ice plunges I'm I just learned that the wim HOF method I love that love that's amazing I've been I've all I've never met him in person but that's great yeah I you know I know he's in your in your lane friends he's a character man yeah I've seen the documentary he's like that's what the what the vice documentary that guy just died at all that drinks beer needs spaghetti like he's fuckin for dick but he doesn't give a shit he goes to Everest fucking barefoot yeah clients ever AZ yeah climbs ever in his shorts it's like it's too easy yeah but he gets other people do with him show that like anyone could do that yeah it's incredible here's a unique human being like a really true truly unique human being in in the sense that he's just talking about breathing he's not talking about doing some sort of incredible athletics that you know a rare few people can achieve no he's talking about concentrating on your breathing and understanding how you can inhale like deeper breaths and concentrate on the breath and that in doing so you're changing your physiological state and there's got a whole program that shows you how to do it correctly and it enhances your immune system and enhances your awareness and it's wild shit it's incredible yeah yeah I mean I try to do that breath work whenever I possibly can i there's two people that I've worked with that that trained underneath wim one of one of them's in New York of Spain so whenever I'm in my Orca Spain I meet up with him we do the breath work holding breath exercises and then we do the ice bath and then I've one that's based in San Diego this woman and she comes out to Vegas and then I'd like to do the group dynamic ice bath so I have this like pool that's not an ice bath bus 50 degrees so it's cold enough to like feel it that's fucking cold yeah exactly so I get like whoever wants to join me but you like this group kind of you know huddle we get get in there we come out we do the breath work hold our breath you know and it's it's a great way to get people together and experience them like that - no that's awesome man the UFC training center of the performance Institute in Vegas has this hot bath right next to a cold plunge and they have people going back and forth between and - have you ever been to that place yeah I shot my music video they're excited Bruce Buffer featuring on a song of mine called it's time I didn't bring that up earlier because you're so tied in with UFC but we shot the video there I was training to fight the other DJ that we I made this song with and and Bruce you were trying to fight a DJ well I mean the video is like video you're trained to fight right okay at the UFC facility and this legendary UFC fighter facing his name he was training me so it was kind of cool to have him there with me what do you look like well you'd put up pick up the video okay can I can I run him use the bathroom yeah sure sure go ahead here we go so we're watching it on the video Aoki vs. Luke is Bruce Buffer so who's training him though there's all these people running around Bruce Buffer who is uh who's training him I don't see any UFC guy training him but you keep jumping ahead we're not gonna see you not focusing on there yeah it's too quick yeah but who's that oh it's Ken Shamrock Jeremy goes to say oh I'm eventually here oh there you go ken shamrock screaming in his face with sunglasses on he's a trip wasn't he he's a very interesting guy cake me oh my god that's hilarious okay he's um it's it's so interesting when you see all these different people of these different paths in life and you go oh okay you could go down that path too you know like the Steve Aoki path is so different than most paths and I think that one of the cooler things about talking to people is you you get this sense that the the the way you can live your life is not as rigid as people would have you believe did have you believe that there's only a few different ways to go about this this is not that much variability we're saying nice things about you you just returned we watched it was Ken Shamrock he was though yeah yeah yeah he was like you know when you do yeah we're watching it sunglasses screaming at you exactly do you do any martial arts training um you know strangely enough like my my biggest hero growing up is Bruce Lee so you know in the beginning I started wanting to learn jeet kune do-- and you know once upon a time in hollywood not yet there's a scene in there that's very negative about Bruce Lee I love the movie I really enjoyed it I'm a huge Tarantino fan I think is awesome but there's this controversy around that I didn't see that very very controversial because he made Bruce Lee look like a buffoon that's really arrogant buffoon Wow and I don't think there's any evidence that he was ever really like that yeah but you know Tarantino sort of dug his heels in and sort of defended it but I don't think he knows the culture because he's not a martial artist I thought he looked at I think he looked at Bruce Lee as sort of like this historical figure that's you know kicking people's asses and movies and I think to understand Bruce Lee the way you do or the way I do where he was my childhood hero as well it's like he's the guy that's really responsible for mixing martial arts when you talk about mixed martial arts like all credit has to go to the Gracie's because they're the ones who you know Nelson Gracie and whore Ian and hoist and Hickson and that family was responsible for really showing people jiu-jitsu and also Horry and invented the UFC so without Horan and his contributions mean we might not have ever known what we know today right but Bruce Lee was on that path a long time ago yeah he had figured out a long time ago that you got to find what's useful in all different styles of martial arts exactly he's also deeply entrenched in philosophy yeah he was a brilliant guy so they made him look like this buffoon and then that sucks I didn't like it that's like one of the main things about Bruce Lee that I loved about him was that his philosophy I had a lot of things to say about life yeah like the martial arts was one thing that's like what made him cool made him just about us but it's his philosophy the words behind all that and how it can reflect on everyone be like water and the best part for me is that he's an Asian face because I mean at the end of the day you think about what's out there and then in the media and popular culture you don't see an Asian face this lets loved and by all different ethnicities yeah he's the number one he's the the like every doesn't matter if you're black white brown purple yellow whatever you are you like yeah you have to honor like one of the greats everybody likes Bruce Lee and he's Asian so he represents something very powerful for Asian people how many Chinese dudes got laid because of Bruce Lee how many Chinese he's bold that they got laid with non Chinese women oh yeah yeah that's like because that's the other day like the women love Bruce Lee everybody yeah everyone everybody yeah and there hasn't been someone like that you know that has that striking feeling that's Asian in popular culture like that you know so also like the first guy that was really shredded in movies you know he take his shirt off now you definitely got that stance that he's just like yeah he was fucking shredded yeah and you would look at him he go God that guy's body's ridiculous everybody wanted that body yeah everybody wanted to be lean and muscular and that's where I got my room for my house that Bruce game death right yeah that's end of the Dragons at least for me I got the mirror room friend of the Dragon but that the mirror room scene is way more mirrors like kind of mmm in different degrees and yeah it was it was into the dragon right yeah yeah fuck that was a good movie and for the time those movies you know people don't like them or do like them what's interesting about Bruce is the style of fighting in those movies like jumping flying kicks and all that stuff that's not what he advocated at all he did that purely for the cinematic value right he wanted to make it exciting and flashy yeah he was all about kicking people the knees you know he was about like really effective techniques yeah that you could use to end a fight in seconds that was what he was all about yeah but what he did do was there was like two big bursts in martial arts and Bruce Lee was responsible in my opinion for the first he was responsible for getting people excited about training martial arts and seeing this guy that could kick everybody's ass and like this guy was like he was quiet and and humble but you know when it came time to throw down and take his shirt off and fuck everybody up yeah and then the next stage was the UFC those were like in my lifetime just too big and really culturally the two big leaps in martial arts was people getting into Bruce Lee because of getting into martial arts because of Bruce Lee movies yeah of course Chuck Norris movies yeah and then the next one was getting into martial arts because the UFC right so was bummer it was a bummer that they made him look like a dope that sucks I'm was excited to watch that movie because I thought that Bruce Lee was gonna look like about us because in the in the trailer yeah you're like oh no all Bruce Lee's in there he's gonna be cool with with Brad Pitt Leonardo DiCaprio Quentin Tarantino this is gonna be epic it's a fucking great move yo don't let it hold you back cuz the movies funny shit I really enjoyed it it's a fun look I liked all his movies I loved hateful eight a lot of people don't like hateful a no I loved it I think his movie sir if you're into like a Tarantino movie like I like his style of Mako fiction yeah Django yeah they're wild yeah they're good rate films yeah absolutely great films such a fan I'm just glad he's out there because it's like there's there's moments in that movie where I don't want to I'm not gonna give anything away but there's moments in in Hollywood where are you going I can't believe you could still do this in a movie like on this day and age like you're allowed to do that in a movie he goes hard while in the paint yeah but the Bruce Lee things you know wasn't real the real Bruce leaves with yeah interesting and exciting to me right you know I mean that's worth like my record label Dimock it's you know you know what Dimock is yeah I mean it's not necessarily tied to Bruce Lee but it's my way of like you know instead of calling it Bruce Lee records or I love Bruce Lee records I was like well this is this mysterious death touch and you know there's like said that this mystery around that that's connected sort of to Bruce Lee there's yeah it would be really interesting if there really was a dim Macha mysterious yeah death touch if it was it was real but a lot of fucking people believed in it if you ever see those videos on when they and then that old man of to have to fall down yeah yeah there's a McDo Joe life on instagrams got a shitload on this guy collects them all and there's so many of them are so ridiculous I posted one a couple of days ago of this it looks like an Aikido guy and he's just like doing this like watch watch this video guy comes out and he's like pushes them away oh look at them you Wow Wow no power here it's so it is it's playing use it yeah it's so so fucking it's like those evangelical preachers that like they touching someone's head in the guy's like falling over yeah it's you know and they're all practicing it look like they're all practicing all this nonsense so we'll get you killed in a real fight yeah and these guys are leaving their house they're putting on their fucking outfit right it really think that this is real this is actually happening yeah it's so corny it really is what you're gonna do Melissa man I really enjoy talking to ya thanks for having
