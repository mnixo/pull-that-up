the girag and experience you know what's amazing is how well kids can manipulate their body - my daughter can do what is that called when you put your feet on the ground your back bends and you put your hand yeah right there little spies are so incredibly flexible and you know and she can go up on their tippy toes and she's only six she can also climb a rope I have a rope in my garage you see my garage previous healing great she grabs that rope and climbs all the way to the top and I was watching her do that I was like how many women can do that like she's not a tiny little girl she's six like how many grown women can support their own weight like that and climb my boughs grow today do it no I'm all screaming like yeah most grunting man they couldn't climb a rope of their life actually depended on it yeah and that's odd it is said and that's one of the best things I ever did for my kid I just hung a rope in her foyer of our house we had like one of those cargo architectural II design houses that the kitchen went up three floors you know mm-hmm with like a bi-level type thing split-level and took my life in my own hands with my drill trying to hang that damn rope man I tied myself a with much it's about and was leaning over the balcony trying to find a with a beam finder in the you know got the drill this all while the ex-wife was out of the house and she comes home she has his rope hanging down in the middle for foyer by her kitchen and you know I got both kids climbing that rope is that the beginning of the divorce proceeding I probably my whole from from the moment I said I did was the beginning of the divorce position that's how it works I'm dying at work sometimes it's just the idea of getting married Colette's we're gonna be normal we're gonna be like everybody else we're gonna get married well work out what's were married work out it never does man I prefer an unmarried right and on marriages where I have my money she has hers I got my credit cards she has hers I have my possessions she has hers I don't tell her what to do she doesn't tell me what to do you know it's like an agreement we're together because we want to be together we don't need a government agency to tell us that we can live together and we definitely don't need a government agency telling us that we're allowed to be a partner well that doesn't sound very I don't know what kind of woman's can accept that but I'll tell you right now I am NOT going to I'll tell you right now Steve I want a traditional marriage I don't will tell my friends that I'm married that's the other thing chicks love to tell their friends are married very few guys like you're excited to tell their friends they're getting married like see I got her she's marrying me I did it you know they go yeah we're getting married like well congratulations but it's never like this milestone accomplishment like wow you pulled it off but a girl will like look I'm kidding but like oh my god I can't believe it girls get so excited I'm so happy for you the hug it's a two completely different experience for the male women have got it in their head or some I should say because of movies and of stories you know this romantic happily ever after idea that they have to they have to get legally bound they don't think of it as you know it's you the way you look at it is so harsh and so jaded it's not a legal contract it's it's a beautiful agreement and it's you take your relationship to a next level yeah until you hit those divorce proceedings and then you realize oh this is a contract like this is a legal contract with the state and now I got to bring in lawyers and we got to figure out how to fucking divvy up my money and the lawyers get a giant chunk of that action that's the big scam that's what's when um Phil Hartman before his wife killed him when he was trying to get divorced shot him in his sleep he was ranting to me by go just fucking give her half who's like it's not a half that's the thing it's 1/3 because the lawyers get 1/3 - you lose 2/3 it's not half pretty much man is just steaming that's why I like the the non marriage you know that's nice the non marriage yeah what everyone keeps their own personality and you don't like just get all reptile see this guy Jaime's show me these yesterday's Russian oligarch Oh 4.5 billion I in a divorce of course I guess when you have billions and billions is probably not that big of a deal it's a big deal no matter how much one you got the idea that some chick is gonna be going off banging other dudes with your money and riding for Ahri's and flying private jets everywhere and buying castles all with your cash why because you had sex with her I guess they don't have prenups in Russia or if they do he didn't get one I mean you just maybe thought he was going to be different man fuck all the other 50% of the people that could make it I'm not even hedging my bets I'm all-in pushed all his chips on the table and you know the thing that I think sours a lot of marriages I can speak from experience because I've been married divorced three times this was read times time you fucking crazy man man I came back for more I finally got smart you know I ate pretty crazy but so many of us guys we we get we get the a woman who is the what I call the girl you know really fun to be around very you know feminine just you relate to you together as friends and then what do we do we turn around it's change her into a mother mmm you know and mother is a whole different animal a whole different being than that girl that they that that young girl that was carefree and you know and fun to be around and you go to the movies and you go out and you'd play and you just have a great time and all that just goes right out the window once you turn her into a mother I'm not even talking about kids mm you know I've seen plenty of people without kids that the woman still becomes the mother oh yeah yeah like a mother substitute well they become a dominant role in the man's decision-making and they sort of control him in a very motherly way I think that becomes very unattractive to women too like I don't think a lot of women like oh they don't want that man they don't like that role I mean they don't want to be put into that role you know a lot of women you know they they like a strong guy that kind of take care of him right well I don't know I mean I wouldn't want to generalize but I the the what I've seen from the women that dominate the men they like the guys that I know where the women tells them what to do and those guys also have a hard time getting sex like almost universally so it's almost like a rule like if the woman dominates and the woman tells you what to do and the woman just control your spending and controls you know what your hobbies are and tells you what's going to happen and where you ago those guys don't get much sex and I don't know if that's related to a like a woman being attracted to a man that she can't control or not attracted to a man she can control rather well the mother doesn't like sex the mother is against sex and that's what happens so often these marriages and you know I've had a lot of women that are masseuses and you know they body workers and man when you know that they tell me it's uncanny how many other male clients will always proposition and try to rankle sex out of them is illegitimate by the way I'm not talking about prostitutes right right right and I mean it's pretty common guys are just sex starved in their relationships and their their marriages but the thing that really used to rankle me most more than anything was the way women would not want to be they would want to separate their guys from their their their friends yeah and they really resented the fact that God has come to shitzu training as I gather unto Jesus go man the the wives and girlfriends would give the guys such a hard time about going and training if anything they should be encouraging they got to go as much as possible you know and you know they pulled these guys out of there and it's that's a day I'm shamed into that you a guy it's also damn shame for a guy to pull his woman out of something that she loves to do oh whoa yeah of course I'm gonna be fair of course yeah it's it's a terrible thing when people try to change the person who they're they love and control them I mean could you imagine your friend doing that to you like a friend going come on man you're not gonna work out what are you working out for I don't want you working out hey I don't want you working out you're my friend you're coming with me like what like I don't like you camping why you camping you know I don't like you going to ball games you'd be like with a fucking time yeah you're crazy but when that friend happens to be someone that you have sex with or you're romantically connected to the girlfriend fiance wife whatever you want to call it that person all of a sudden has some sort of a role they can dictate like your actual day like dictate what you do whether it's a guy doing it to a wife or a girlfriend or a woman doing it to her husband or a boyfriend it's a weird thing that people just sort of accept and then it happens so often and it's always gross it's no wonder that divorce is at its all-time highest rate fuckin idiots all of us you too I was Indian rep I did three times what did you think about on number three when that one failed me like motherfucker what's wrong with me why did I do this three times pretty much it was like damn was I ever thinking I had a lot of shame actually and a lot of feelings of unworthiness or whatever you know like a feeling of being a failure and all that and then I just realized well you know some people just aren't cut out eyes should have never been in that situation the first [Music]
