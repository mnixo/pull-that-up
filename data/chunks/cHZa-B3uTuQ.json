the gyro can experience watching I'm gonna say this and then the ideas can be there all the business guys take off their jackets you know they have the shirt and ties and they throw them over the back of their chairs mm-hmm I'm gonna invent suit jackets that aren't real once they just cover the back of your chair so you see that as a piece of your suit but you don't have to wear the jacket what the fuck is wrong with you you got you're talking about thank jackets are never a good idea John Heffron everybody they're gonna go in the back by yourself too long virtual fist pump no you see jackets bro that are gonna go on the back of because here's the thing when you do those you don't have to wear dress pants because they can't it they're like newscasters so the new look you can go board shorts flip-flops maybe a nice shirt with the tie fake jacket cover over the thing you look like you're wearing a suit you got a problem brain dog guys are NASA vets in the beginning show brain doctor you need to go see one telling you you're gonna we're gonna see it you're John have fun I'll be willing to bet you an insane amount of money that fake jackets that you put on the back you're sleepy will exempt head Shan okay cuz he will just cuz I'll create them okay you will it will exist and there will be a money pit of disastrous proportions for you I need a size your design need somebody is a direct message me I need a seamstress what does it like dealing with those people in that world and doing like squeaky clean comedy only and not being able to take any chances up there or go into any weird directions what does that like I've always that type of comedy so it's not we've haven't you do you your comedy has I'm a dolt but I'm not you know I don't get ever Supergrass I'm I believe you can turn a clean bit dirty just buy things then vice versa but yet you are one of the most preferred to people I've ever met my great plus I think it's weird when you have jobs that then affect you like when I used to do morning radio with Bonaduce we were on a soccer mom station hey you guys want a soccer mom station yeah we would like whoa Danny tried to get in a fight at a matchbox 20 concert oh so that shows you what kind handsome try matchbox in a fight and dogs he it was a great he took off his shirt and was gonna fight the entire road JJ at Pine op why would the shirt off because he in the bathroom and ask I think this was back when Danny partied I think Danny met up with a listener and he disappeared Oh whatever happened so he came back in an altered cocaine no he was never that type of guy liquor I know he's talked about this story so I'm not thinking but it was that date rape drug but everything he did GHB yeah yeah yes oh yeah but but Danny scar tissue he did admit to all the stuff I don't know how that guy but so he did so then he came out crazy did you say Danny is scar tissue his whole body is or there's no way you can be alive with all the stuff that he's done really there's no way you you have to be totally embalmed what did they do that with frogs so the bodies preserve yeah formaldehyde yeah his but that's his entire body really oh yeah he's a zombie you can't he's not alive what's wrong with him he's just done so much stuff to his body what was it like working with that guy how long did you work with him never kiss him five years five years on the radio yeah every morning about 3:15 in the morning in Michigan which means that's when I scraped off the ice on my thing drove 45 minutes how many months years it snowed like that in Michigan you start December and go to like May June yeah I mean it's so it's a long you know drive a June 7 months like April yeah half year it's cold and crappy yeah okay so cold and crap you get up at 3:30 in the morning you do a stand-up at night still yeah round town but it was Austin cuz I would sell out I mean there was some benefits I wasn't there for and I was 25 26 why would you ever want to sleep right so then you go we do like radio power appearances you know like I was that guy movie premieres but he got paid a lot of money that's how crazy was there beyond crazy because the thing with Danny is you never knew which guy you were gonna get you can have a guy that you work with that's a consistent ass but at least then you know how to tiptoe other times Danny be the coolest human being you've ever met and then you come in the next day and you'd go he's gonna literally slit my throat the only advantage there I mean did now we're really good at first he he hated me he wanted to hate you well I never did radio before I met him I was just a comic around town and I didn't know how to talk with that person it's trav in our conversation with him it's tough so imagine being a 20 year old kid not you know I was like but what time I you know I just didn't have my rhythm I just didn't know so he hated you because I hated me like I did working with you hey didn't just yeah yeah he didn't want to work with you know wanted me fired I just moved back from Los Angeles so I moved to from Detroit to Los Angeles and then got that job and moved back to Detroit and then got fired maybe three or four weeks later and then did he get you fired yeah he got me fired and then we went to Chicago together it was odd for some weird thing and then we he then suddenly liked me and then then I was on the show you know what what do you talk about we did a radio show together and for some reason why we were doing it in Chicago something clicked where he's like oh I get you now that friend okay you're in anyway so I'm so confused yeah you started off together in Michigan you did a radio show we got you fired and they got me fired con and they were gonna give me you know did you go to Chicago what is this Chicago trib oh I got fired on a Friday and we were gonna go to Chicago on Monday to do hid this loop the loop in Chicago okay so we do it as a permanent gig well Dean what the anything was hey I can't believe he did that you know why don't you come to Chicago we'll do the show Monday so they put you up I didn't still confuses he's still doing the show in Michigan and he

aigis like flying a fake yeah and he would do it every day back and forth and then do his radio show hold yes you afternoon Chicago yeah you gotta give the guy credit for that no wonder why he was on drugs so he got to be so I was fired but he didn't tell me that it was he was like I can't believe he did that that's like so he didn't I didn't tell you that he got fired okay so goes why don't you just come to Chicago this weekend we'll party that just sucks have friend but you know well so he's kind of like probably felt guilty I would let you party in Chicago with me and then you're gone for life okay did the show with him on that Monday and he's like you know what I'm gonna make a call like we had cuz he never listened to me well yeah I mean like what's the problem on the show if you would just listen to me he knows so anyway long story short I came back and like yeah you know we won't fire you but we'll give you you got to take a pay cut cuz I was making if you know keep in mind I'm 23 24 morning radio in Detroit making $150,000 I mean that's like a million dollars to a 2324 you was this because why were they giving you a pay cut what are they doing you know because I was I had no management or anything and they're a huge corporation they're loud you get the gig in the first place this huge radio guy dick Burton in Detroit was leaving the radio station and he suggested to that management you need to bring this Heffron kid in keep in mind I'm just you know so then they go it you know do stand-up comedian yeah and I was on a show and he is probably the most famous radio guy in Detroit so they hired me just because of that and put me with Dan well but the end of crazy Dan yes well Danny's the guy who and I've told well anyway he's the one who got me into fighting um he was really in the boxing and stuff so then what he did was he came to the radio station and he had like headgear cuffs boxing you know gloves and says you know I'm friends with Jackie Kallen we're gonna go to her place and we're gonna want you to learn the box so I have somebody to spar with so we bought me all my apartments you bought me all my equipment got me crazy coaches because that friend I'm gonna kiss each other box so I have somebody to and we're gonna spar every day from from 12:00 to 12:00 to 3:00 that's ridiculous long time to get good at boxing kid just starts bar and someone's been doing it forever well yeah so I so I got the stuff and then then me and Danny fought and I would never been more afraid in my entire life like there's a thing about fighting you can be a really good you go to class you learn everything but you have to have that thing in you that makes you want to kill people which I've never had I enjoyed fighting and I learned learning stuff but I don't have that yeah there's that thing Danny is a complete psycho he completely has that thing and will kill you that's when that shortly after that's when he gave me a concussion hit me right in the back of the head do people punch it on you dude yeah I know that's right Danny Bonaduce oh that's when we so he hit me in the back of the head I went home the girl was
