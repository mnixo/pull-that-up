congressman how are you sir I am doing well Joe good to see you again you look official bro you look very official you have an American flag in the background you got books have you read those books be honest me yeah it's a good question I mean this one's like a congressional cookbook look I'm not gonna read that though obviously some of these I have or at least I dabble in books like I'll look over a book mostly I've definitely read my book that one's up there I've read that way too many times I hate reading it now and that's the one that's out writing it I wrote it that's the one right now that comes out yeah that comes out uh I don't know when we're posting this but Tuesday April 7th that's tomorrow yeah that's exactly when this will come out so perfect fortitude we need that right now and we do we do know the rest of this I just kind of set up for this uh I found that weird ass painting right there it's some like flea market in San Diego back when I was stationed there it's like a it's like a Shh it's a bunch of ships it looks like a horrible idea for a tattoo you know sometimes people have those really bad old ship tattoos yeah I feel like there's worse tattoos you could get oh yeah I've got them is there what about the typewriter do you use the typewriter no that that is a legit typewriter that was my granddad's old room so I I say that they kept in pretty good shape I didn't really have to do much restoring but you can still buy the ink for that and actually we would uh we used to have it set up in the house so one guest came over they could like type write a message and so it's like a guests log it's kind of cool that is cool thing so what's your take on what we're going through right now Dan for everybody in the future this is a day it's basically a month into like extreme coronavirus lockdown for the country it all started sort of in the beginning of March now here we are in the first week of April and everybody's stir-crazy and weirded out by this including me yeah and I'm sure you as well what is your take on this Wow gun really speaking I remember I remember the weekend where everything all of a sudden shifted it was the March 14th weekend I remember that weekend because it was my birthday and I remember how everybody was basically still going out to bars and restaurants and then all of a sudden everything changed I think the entire paradigm changed and I could go through a long timeline of how we got there there's a lot of finger-pointing right now a lot of opportunism the reality is a lot of us didn't pretty much everybody didn't know a whole lot and then we ended up in this situation where and now my general take on it we we are in a what I would call a tactical retreat so I'm going to use a military term there to describe what we are doing we all of a sudden ran into a hail of gunfire okay like and I think about this in military terms were on a patrol we run into a hail of gunfire we're not really sure what hit us we have a basic idea we know who they are we know generally what the enemy is but we weren't quite sure how to combat it so we took a retreat tactically speaking that retreat looks a lot like a lockdown okay don't talk to anybody don't don't touch anybody maintain that social distancing lock things down we have to slow the spread and allow our backup our public health system to catch up at a certain point we have to come out of that tactical pause we have to come out of that retreat and start engaging in the enemy a little bit now we do that slowly when we do it carefully and so I think that's the I like to look at it that way as the conversation about how to reopen society at a certain point we have to move away from risk containment and room move into a risk mitigation strategy and we're ramping up our production of things like ventilators of PPE of testing capability in order to do that now there's some talk of when this is going to end and I don't know how you even make that distinction how does one make a decision and it seems like one of those things where once it starts once you lock a country down and tell people stay away stay home don't go to work don't do anything unless it's very essential like grocery stores hospitals media there's certain things that are allowed to be done right now when is that end and how does one decide when that ends yeah there's a lot of different ways to think about that from from the public health perspective I hear them say certain things like after 14 days of a downward trend in cases then we can start reopening when the R is less than 1 then you can start reopening so R being less than 1 means for every contagious person they infect less than one other person right now that numbers are at just over 2 ok so there's there's an obvious spread that occurs that I have I think those are valid assumptions I definitely question using those as our standards I would like to see us use other standards as well such as are we at a point where we're testing enough and we have enough ventilators and hospital bed space and PPE to actually fight the virus alongside reopening there our society because I think we have to come to terms with a very certain truth which is we cannot indefinitely lock down those costs are enormous and they're not just cost to our 401ks and our jobs I mean there's a public health cost there too you know I speak with doctors here in Houston we don't we don't have a huge case number in Houston where our hospitals are like 50% empty right now and they can't do much needed surgeries procedures because you know what's called an elective surgery is gonna be kind of a gray area so a lot of stuff isn't getting done from a public health side also there's there's there's I think the obvious public health crisis when people don't have jobs there's divorce race there's suicides we have to really take all of this into account as we as we talk about when to reopen society yeah we you and I privately had this conversation through text messages about the way reporters are using this moment to criticize Trump with in ridiculous ways and one of them was this questioning of whether or not he should describe these drugs that have some promise which many doctors are describing hydroxychloroquine with z-pak and zinc apparently is a combination that keeps getting brought up and there's a doctor that has been using this to some reported success in New York City but what drives me crazy is that these are rare opportunities that someone has to talk to the president and they're using it to chastise him for bringing up drugs that do show promise and hope he's not telling people to go take it he's not advocating it he's not pretending that he's some sort of a medical professional he's just talking about some things that show promise in the medical community you know what what is your take on all this because this is a it's a weird situation that he finds himself in with the press this very strange and antagonistic position yeah you know the press needs to figure out who they want to be and it's actually like chapter two in my book it's called who is your hero and that in that conversation is about who we think we should be like what what kind of people do we think we should be what does it mean to be a good American a good citizen the press believes it is their duty to only be adversarial to to politicians mostly conservative politicians they don't treat Democrats the same way but and that is their job okay I wish they would treat all all politicians the same and intuitive to an extent that is their job to be adversarial to question what is coming out of government but I would argue that their main purpose is to simply educate the public educate the public with full that's a fax full context full understanding of what's going on I think on that point they're utterly failing I'm into to a huge extent I think I've been feeling for a long time but in a time of crisis where it's so important that they actually do that that that more important thing of informing the public they're really failing and they they do they completely waste time I mean how many reporters actually get access to the president I bet there's hundreds of thousands of reporters out there good ones who would who would love to be able to be in that press briefing room and actually asked legitimate questions that would inform the American public but but they don't they play these gotcha games you know the last questions like what do you want to say to people who are upset with you right now it's like what how is how does that a good question how does a news right in the middle of Japan I mean I mean it was it's so utterly absurd and an unnecessary actually whole list of questions I don't wanna read of all but they're there they're a complete waste of time and I think they're failing us miserably and then there's the opportunism that occurs like listen there's if you're writing an op-ed if you're a journalist writing an op-ed we'll say an opinion journalists especially I fully understand why you you might you might say you might write in your report okay the president said this today but three weeks ago they said this so there's been a change that's fine that makes total sense that provides context of the reader even it might be biased and that whatever but but but - but - onlys do that indirect questioning with the president just to try and play this gotcha game I it's not helpful it's not help at all and it's not informing anybody in the least you know you mentioned the the president talking of a verbal II about the chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and you remember the the couple that ingested that out in Arizona because that something something similar to I think it's a core chloroquine phosphate or something like that it might be Mississippi cane its points like that's ending yeah it's an ingredients on fish bowl cleaner yeah fish tank cleaner so they saw it and they ingested it which was obviously a terrible idea nobody would nobody told them to do that and then the media the media instead of saying wow this is a shame that they did this they blame the president and they blamed the president for talking about what what is a at least anecdotally a proven way to to combat this disease we don't know through clinical trials whether in mass it'll actually work but but to express optimism over it seemed to be a punishable offense but the outraged mob is it was fully invested in this kind of outrage reasoning to to tear down the president over this and it's just it just feels so unnecessary I mean oh it's right it's why I wrote this book but the book is about outrage culture an hour an hour like this sort of weird new cultural need to just go after each other in the worst of ways it is there's a new ability to do that I mean this is what is with these new to that people have through social media and through making these viral video clips which is what each reporter is hoping is they're going to accomplish by being combative with the President and trying to catch him on something they're hoping that they're going to create this viral video that's gonna accelerate their career it's it's very self aggrandizing it's and it's disturbing that there's there's not someone who stands out that does these sort of press junkets that doesn't do that yeah and I actually write about that exact point in my book like this what we've begun to do is reward this sort of I would say overly passionate emotional behavior so we've replaced sophisticated reasoning with outrage you know we we've started to change who we actually view as heroes this is how I describe it we all have hero archetypes okay and like and we grew up this way and there's there's like fictional characters like the Jedi like it so that's like a hero archetype or Superman we kind of look up to this person or or like or like real characters like Rosa Parks or Jesus like there's there's people that we actually look up to and we identify with and there's certain attributes that we use and we say I want to be like that and so when I act in public I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to access that attribute I'm gonna be better and according according to that archetype and we sort of turn that on its head and in our in our current outrage pop culture like we see somebody who plays the victim and we cheer them on well reality what we used to do is see somebody who overcame adversity who was the true hero and then we cheered them on we've totally reversed that yeah and like so and so until you actually get more points if yours more snarky if you're meaner if you're if you're if you're playing this kind of cheap-shot game and like in my book I use this example of like these is this group of veterans they they were waiting for me at my office I was going and I knew something was off because veterans my age they we never we're the like the ballcap you know looking with the gold letters that say veteran on it we never wear that but these guys were wearing that so that was that was my first sign that something was different about these guys but they just asked for a picture and I figured that was it no we'd keep going but uh the second thing that was off was like they they weren't they weren't looking at the camera they were fiddling as I was like posing for this camera for this photo and I thought that was strange and it turns out they were just getting their own video camera ready to record and then they start following me and like just go nuts like they lose their minds I'm talking about Trump and you know betraying the country and just all this nonsense and so they were just trying to have a gotcha moment with you yeah yeah yeah this is what they do they're they're an activist group and they'll corner people like me and try and get like a viral video going and and then you know it's up to me at that point to just like understand what's happening it just kind of walks silently and I kind of engage with them and some funny ways but they were they were becoming extremely emotional I mean their voices started to crack it was which was you know and what are they saying about you or to you how could you how could you let how could you betray the country by supporting the president I mean things like that it mostly sloganeering like this wasn't a like a deep conversation by any means but but that's the point the point is is that they're rewarded for that like overly emotional in motion like you know filming while while walking type of type of scenario and then they like and then there's this whole deal where I have to get in the elevator because that's how I get to the votes like I I leave my my office on the fourth floor and Canon I take the elevator down in the basement I walk across like that's just my route and so but what they do is as I get into the elevator they're like Joe he's hiding from us he's running away from us in the Newsweek like writes up the same story like there's this there's this entire culture behind this notion that you think that you that you have to use as much emotion as possible and as an express your anger in in the most exceptional of ways otherwise it's not worth listening to but we haven't stopped as a cold Stern we have to stop rewarding and that's what I talked about we have to stop rewarding that kind of behaviors that it actually ceases to control us that way well they accomplished what they wanted to do we're talking about them right now although you didn't give up their name good for you no but you you talked about them and that's what they wanted I mean there's so many groups out there that are I don't even know if they have an end game the end game seems to just get attention and you know and shine the light on these atrocities or whatever whatever they feel like is an atrocity it is attention it happens on both sides I'm pretty careful in my book to actually criticized both sides on this one because it ways I do see it in the conservative circles it's it's different the the kind of outraged culture that happens in conservatism is certainly different and less widespread then then happens on the left it is more about attention seeking and and I always tell people that if you're gonna if your main goal is getting more followers and more clicks than you know you have to reevaluate what your priorities are and I worry about the activist community as well which is activists sometimes don't want to win they don't actually want to win the argument and that should concern us because at least politically speaking my goal is to win the argument and to win the argument I have to actually persuade people and like that that should be the goal we those lengthier conversations again it's why these kind of podcasts are so prevalent so I do my own podcast because I wanted to dive deep into some of these issues on a substantive level well I do appreciate your reasonable and balanced perspective because you are one of the rare guys that's on the right that does criticize the right and do and you do it fairly and objectively which i think is very important in this day and age you know I I'm on the left but I find myself more and more getting confused like a man without a country or man with you know without a side rather without a team there's there's so many people on the left now that wanna silence people freedom of speech was always a core tenet of what this country is based on the ability to express yourself but there's so many people that want people deep platformed for having views that they disagree with or ideas that they disagree with and this is an enormous problem obviously in social media well bringing it back to coronavirus there there was there was certain messages that were being taken down by twitter if they were and I and I think these the type of messages or articles that were being promoted along the lines of hate there's there's too much economic cost we need to mean to reopen the economy and get people back to work if it was things like that Twitter was taking them down they're still doing that but I but I heard reports of but and on a broader scale yeah the the attack against freedom of speech is is by far one of the most concerning elements that concerns I think classical liberals and if that's how you would describe yourself I don't know what but to all of us in the political world Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great mystery and frankly we kind of like it that way it makes you it keeps you out of the fray it's more than missing as I said that I wouldn't vote for Biden that I said I would vote for Trump over Biden all these people went crazy everybody but let me let me you know what I'd also vote for Whoopi Goldberg over Joe Biden I'd vote for Mike Tyson over Joe Biden I just don't think it's a good idea to take someone who's struggling with dementia and put them in one of the most stressful positions the world has ever known that's what I'm saying I mean it's not an endorsement of Trump is it is a me saying you shouldn't have a man who's clearly clearly in the throes of dementia I mean there's I'm not a doctor but when you can't form sentences in public and you forget what you're talking about and you you're you wander off into these conversations if you're not smoking pot you're not high if you're not on pills like what's going on well there's cognitive decline he's an older man that has mental issues and you know not to be cruel to him he's he's suffering medically this is it is the real issue and the Democrats want to sweep that under the rug and Trump is already chewing him apart he's already dismissing him I mean there is a recent thing that Kyle kolinsky posted a video on his Twitter talking about this is what happens when you don't discuss the elephant in the room and it's Trump saying you used to do it during a press conference and they asked him a question about something that Biden wrote he goes I didn't write that he's like he said that's a democratic operative he didn't read it he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now and he's gonna he's gonna continue to do that and it's it's such a point--and i I don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone who's clearly got a problem and this is I mean I don't want to be mean to the guy we've all seen it that's not normal it's not normal to forget like when he's talking about the creator and he literally loses what he's saying he's like you know the thing like the Declaration of Independence yeah I mean that's a very simple document there's a bunch of those things like when he was talking about the cure and losing what he's saying that you have to take care of the cure and he's he's struggling the guy's struggling he's tired this is his extremely stressful process to run for president and the idea that he's going to be able to get through this and be okay on the other side to run the country for for potentially eight years is crazy yeah and on a more from a policy perspective if we're looking at the coronavirus in particular and the handling of it you know this is obviously the subject of hot debate you know there's there's plenty of bad faith journalists out there who who continue and politicians including Pelosi who continue to repeat that Trump has the the deaths of thousands on his hands I think that's a horrible horrible overstatement I mean to say the least it's just fundamentally not true but we need to remember Joe Biden just recently acknowledged that he now agrees with Trump's decision to close down travel from China in January and I go through a long I've recorded a podcast I almost have as many subscribers as you do now I'm sure ya know I don't where I go through a timeline of what actually happened right like let's let's actually look into this debate in an objective way of who knew what and when because you can criticize people for sure and cuz hindsight is 20/20 but it's important to put yourself in the moment and what we all knew at certain times the certain decisions were made and I have to point out that that when we did this travel restriction from China in late January at that same time the World Health Organization was saying that was repeating Chinese claims in mid-june worried that this virus couldn't even be transmitted in human to human contact you know and Trump was ripped apart for that but I didn't ripped him apart for that but I didn't continue to rip him apart for that up until a couple weeks ago so like you know these decisions saved countless lives and and it's pretty obvious that Biden I mean he said it so of course it's obvious that he would have made a different decision and we would be in a much different place right now to put aside all of the issues that you pointed out those are those are certainly issues and I don't need to repeat them underneath to go into it but it's um I feel like we do it is obvious but that's crazy that this is the guy that's running for president you know and then when people got upset at saying that you know me and me saying that I would vote I'd probably vote for Trump before I would vote for Biden I'm literally saying I'd vote for anybody that can talk I mean anyone who's not in in severe cognitive decline I mean pick a person should I vote for Hillary before I'd vote for him literally I mean I just I just think the poor guy shouldn't be in the position he's in I don't understand why they're doing that I mean anyone else could have been Tulsi Gabbard Amy Klobuchar people to judge pick a person they all would have been a better choice I mean this is crazy and I don't know what their strategy is I don't know why they decided to do this it makes no sense to me it's very very confusing yeah there was a there was a couple days where it all happened where you know behind the scenes all of these different candidates basically basically said okay we're all gonna quit because we are so afraid of Bernie winning they don't think Bernie can can win the Democratic nominee or to win the general election I tend to agree with that and I'm I you know I'm very much against Bernie winning the general election but that's not the point the point is is that the DNC didn't want that they and and they made moves to make that happen and the Democratic Party as a whole is trying to find out who they are you know I look back in time and the Democrat Party to me seems more like a Labor Party and that changed over time into a highly progressive activist party where the labor side of that is really just an afterthought and in and it has really become this sort of well a Democratic Socialist Party when do you think that happened to make its toll very recently because I wouldn't even describe President Obama as I mean he definitely he definitely paved the way for it he's definitely way more progressive than Clinton but it appears to me that it happened very recently another furious that how this happened I I think I think the kind of language that is often used by by a lot of well-meaning Democrats over time and in this sort of Labor Party era let's call it the Bill Clinton era and before that the language they used was still rather radical and revolutionary and kind of you know coming up from the the children of the 60s and that kind of revolutionary feel there's this this idea that a progressive utopia can solve more and more of your problems if you just expand government control that we put enough experts at the top we can figure all this out and we can make your problems go away I think for a long time though they had the Republican Party to always just be against that and and say hold on wait a second there's there's there's other consequences to do it not and it was almost like there was this sort of this sort of unspoken balance the thing and I'm not even sure that they believed it themselves but over time their young people did believe it and so now you have a Ossie who I think truly believes these things it truly believes in the virtues of socialism I think Bernie believes in the virtues of socialism I think he's dead wrong on this but but he believes it and I think a new generation billion II generation of progressives are true believers in a way that I'm not so sure they were before and they're much louder because of their platforms on social media and they're able to change the direction of their party in a much more powerful way than I think they they had been able to in the past and we see that in Congress to an extraordinary degree where where somebody like me now views Pelosi is sort of in the middle between moderates and extremists and and you know ten years ago we would have we would have described Nancy Pelosi as an extremist but now I view her as sort of center-left and the extremists are even to her left and she's deeply afraid of those those that progressive squad because of their power on social media and media in general so it's an interesting battle do you think that this shift is because it seems like nothing works perfectly and this hasn't really been tried or implemented on a large scale in the United States democratic socialism they don't think of it as socialism the way birdy describes it when you talk to him in person it sounds very reasonable he says it sounds like he's looking out for the rights of the workers and he the way he described finding this money just taking a small tax on speculation Gamble's that Wall Street does do you think it's because nothing has worked ideally and that this hasn't been tried before so they look at this as this could be the solution that solves all this for us and sort of balances out the economic playing field yeah well I mean I would of course he was making that argument he does I would simply say of course it's been tried before that's the same kind of rhetoric that was used to to move into the socialist policies of the twentieth century we're tens of millions of people died and we're also I would also put it into this other way of thinking about it yeah you can you can put forward these these seemingly innocuous ideas okay we're gonna we're gonna tax a little bit here and on that specific policy by the way that that's not what people think it is you tax a little bit there that has wide-ranging effects on every single transaction that you would make in the stock market I think this is the Warren and I think Bernie Sanders has the same policy that you're describing but I remember I remember analyzing Elizabeth Warren's policy which is again the same it would have drastic effects on everybody swore oh one K's on pensions and these are working-class people that owned these things this isn't just the wealthy that they that they describe it as so on one hand there's always a lot more there's a lot more layers to the policy that they put out then they're then they're really letting on and there's a lot more second third order consequences than they're letting on on the other hand as far as it not being tried what they're describing is a is a fast path to the the nationalization of production the owning the means of production setting price controls and they talk about setting price controls okay setting setting wages is price controls setting prices well is price controls I mean we passed a bill out of the house HR 3 which they claim lowers people's drugs drug prices and these evil Republicans like us we're all against it because you know because we just don't want people to have low drug prices of course that's not true the reality is is that when you analyze what it means to implement price controls you lose supply that's just economics 101 that that has to be true it always is true but that's why people starved in Maoist China and the Soviet Union because they put price controls on food and they did production quotas and they believed they truly believed that the government could figure out how much to produce and what price to sell it at and that they would be a perfect utopia after that well of course it doesn't work even for simple as something as simple as farming and food production it doesn't work at all people starved as a result and so it's even more unlikely that it would work for more complicated parts of the economy like wages and drug prices because the reality is in the Congressional Budget Office confirm this many other studies confirm this we would have up to 30 less new drugs over the next couple decades if you implement that kind of legislation and so they forget to tell you that you're actually making a choice between these price controls and actually having the cure in the first place and what I tell people is like the affordability is definitely important and we should continue to tackle that problem and and there are ways to do that but the thing has to exist before you can afford it it has to actually exist can I pause you for a second then how do you implement that without making putting a cap on the amount that a drug can cost I mean how do you make it more affordable well so like well there's other bills that we're in favor of that do that so one way is is improve the way that generic drugs get to market so just like any innovation there's a patent okay well once that patent ends what happens is some pharmaceutical companies do take advantage of the system and maybe they continue to put out different drugs that are slightly different than the last one it extends their their their patent or they'll actually pay off generic manufacturers to not produce it so there's a lot of these little loopholes that we can actually tackle surgically and make sure that doesn't happen we also have to remember the a lot of these stories are are anecdotal they they they are they are about a few different drugs and instead of instead of wide price controls on everything that a pharmaceutical company actually creates we should be looking at some of these life-saving drugs that we want people to have but we also want to don't want to destroy the foundation of innovation and research and development that it took to make that drug in the first place and so how do we do that well I mean there's ways there's there's ways to reinsure it at a certain caps equipment when insurance companies don't want to pay the exorbitant amounts that it would cost you know there's there's other options for reinsurance but it's it's you have to tackle it one at a time there's there's more complicated ways to do it with the way that pharmacy companies do rebates with the insurance companies that gets into a really complicated discussion but there's ways to do that for instance for insulin that was a Republican bill that we tried to pass in ENC that got shot down but it would have it would have driven down prices for something like insulin was there anything else you catch to that I mean wanted to get shot down that was just an amendment because people don't understand it listen I I think I think Democrats they they love the idea of these very simple fixes we want things to be cheaper so they will just be cheaper by law we want people to make more money so we will just make the minimum wage $15 we'll just may get it that way and everything will be fine but we know consequences to that know second third order effects but there are second and third order effects and when we ignore those second and third order effects we ignore them at our peril and in the case of the $15 minimum wage well you can't ignore the fact that companies are just gonna hire less people you know their their budget doesn't change just because you change the minimum wage with respect the drug in a they're just they just won't invest in something and it takes billions and billions of dollars to invest in these drugs for the massive amounts of cost that it takes to to do the clinical trials that take years that I can't remember the average on top of my head but it's enormous and an enormous amount of time and so you're not gonna get somebody to take that risk if there's not any payoff at the end and I think that's that's what we forget we have to balance that quite a bit I would also remind everybody of this with respect to the drug price discussion that bill that HR 3 bill it won't become law because the Senate won't take it up and the president will sign it but if it did it wouldn't hurt big pharma I think Democrats would like to believe that it would hurt big pharmaceutical companies it wouldn't it would put all of the smaller start-up biotech companies totally out of business because they're the ones who actually they start that innovation just this just like happens in Silicon Valley these startups start and then they get bought out by the bigger companies that's sort of how the system works and it's a very dynamic system that's it's it's why we are the by far the number one innovator in the world no other country innovates like we do they don't do the research like we do if we implemented the price controls that are inherent and medicare for all or HR 3 there wouldn't be anybody else in the world doing what we do I can relate that back to the coronavirus discussion too on because there's the there's like a there's a big discussion about you know should we have Medicare for all doesn't coronavirus prove that everybody should have free health care and again what I what I have to remind everybody is is that if we had Medicare for all what we're basically talking about our price controls because Medicare already pays the low average payment for for anything well for whatever service were over for whatever doctor visit it's about 60 70 percent on the dollar what was that stop your return Medicare is available for whoo right now what was the seniors the Medicare is a senior program but it's so what it what age is it does it kick in is it 65 I believe so I yeah I don't want to confuse it with Social Security so the I for older folks we should give them healthcare and make sure that their basic needs are covered in terms of sickness illness injury and such yeah yeah I mean the entire you know we could argue that we could we could even debate the merits of Medicare on its face but Medicare for hire would be available for everybody now if Medicare for for all was available for everybody what you're saying is it was essentially you you would fix prices on everything in terms of medical treatments and and that would be a problem because of what well so okay so once you fight once you fix prices well imagine this and imagine if if if the government said that your podcast could could only take a hundred dollars per ad and that was just the price fix from now on what incentive would you have to really expand your audience what expensive ones incentive would you have to keep going or expand the business you wouldn't be able to it's similar under any industry once you once you fix that price you're going to reduce the supply that goes into I stopped doing that analogy yeah here's the problem with that the difference is if they would have to be a reason why they would say that I could only get a hundred dollars for add the reason why you would say that things shouldn't cost too much for someone who's injured or sick is because we want to take care of each other as a community and the idea is that health care should be something that we provide so many services to people that we we are United right who are you the United States of America we're supposed to be a gigantic community and one of the great things that we could do for each other is to make sure that if someone's sick or injured and something's wrong that we can take care of that we would like everybody to do their share and we would like everybody to chip in so that this is possible but there's a big difference between that and fixing the price on an ad well no but not economically there's no difference morally there is and I agree with you morally we do have the we have the same goal of getting everybody out of quick care right but standpoint but from an economic standpoint my point still stands and you can apply that to any industry I see what you're saying but I think we're looking the medical care is a basic human right instead of just an economic issue the reason I don't describe it is it it's not in your write it is both a moral and an economic issue further i argument that you will reduce supply that is fundamentally true it is fundamentally true we see in other countries it's why as we compare ourselves to other countries right now all these places with socialized medicine it's it's important to look at some stats and actually I have them here I could take the time to pick them up but I'll but all but I'll give you the bottom line up front we have overwhelmingly per capita more ICU beds in this country than any other Western country overwhelmingly per capita we have more ventilators than any of these other people we're all we're all freaking out right now because we're worried about our ventilators and in our ICU beds on a per capita basis our system has way way more than the UK then Italy than Spain and Germany all of them like like orders of magnitude more okay so okay also we're the ones who innovate I mean the vast majority of research and development new drugs that come out that comes from this country so these are these are facts that we can't escape if we do price controls and medicare-for-all is fundamentally a system of price controls if we do that economically speaking we absolutely will reduce supply I understand the moral argument you're making which is we still want to help people yes we should we should be looking for the ways to do that but I want to be able to do that in a way that doesn't undercut the foundations of the good parts of our healthcare system which is quality and innovation if we undercut those things we're the last country doing this we're the last country in the world and truly doing innovation the world is left out to dry see there the this what you're saying makes a lot of sense is there a way to do both is there a way to provide health care to everyone but also encourage this innovation encourage profit so you encourage these companies to do all these great things that you're describing and and and maintain this incredibly high level of healthcare that we have right now that's certainly the goal right and that that should be the goal and this is why I think there's there's got to be room for compromise on the healthcare debate because you can't compromise with the other party if the goals aren't the same like I've come to believe that our goals on immigration are actually not the same okay so it's hard to compromise on health care they should be the same like because we we we want everybody to have access to quality health care now they have a very different way of getting to that point we have probably a much more complicated we recognize how difficult it is to get to that point while also ensuring that we maintain quality and an innovation and so what I'm working on personally is is the primary care side of things okay so primary care doctor is your that's your first point of contact in health care and the system that I think works best for that is direct primary care so direct primary care basically means that you Joe you're a doctor you can handle about 250 300 patients at a time they all pay you a subscription fee of about $75 a month and they have full access to you so it's like less than a cell phone bill this already exists this model is prevalent it's growing I would like to see it grow much faster okay how do you do that well we can't subsidize lower income people in order to do that how we do that is very complicated that's what I'm working out and within our complicated system but that's an idea to one make that free market model actually take off so that people who don't need help with their healthcare costs like like you and me we can still afford that just like we afford any other monthly cost and you have access to preventive medicine you have access to telemedicine you actually have a doctor-patient relationship that makes it a lot easier to start solving the rest of the problem making our insurance market more competitive making putting more choice in it directly subsidizing those who need it but in a way that looks a lot more like Medicare Advantage so Medicare Advantage is a part of Medicare that basically forces competition and choice between insurance companies it came out to be a lot cheaper than we originally thought it would in the early 2000s when when this thing was created this was a Republican plan because there's certain foundations that I think we have to adhere to any time we want to problem solve choice and competition are among them you you can't escape those things and I think when we talk about Medicare for all it tries to it tries to move past these essential foundation and whether of a free society that we have to adhere to and and because the other thing I I push back on a little bit is the health care as a right statement and I push back against that because with that when you're calling something a right what you're effectively saying is that somebody else has a obligation to serve you and it's hard to call something a right when that right requires the service of somebody else don't make picky don't we already do that with the firemen don't we do that with the police department don't we do that with public schools not exactly no I mean we have public services that I would I would distinguish those public services from something like a Rex quantum of care and I would distinguish them to an enormous extent like but you and here's why you can add a few hundred thousand more people to a you know to to the nation's population and it doesn't change the mission of the military right like it doesn't it doesn't take an away thing away from them but these but because of this sort of non-rival ii and economics term but the sort of non-rival attribute of these things it is different right because there's only a select number of doctors and we've already said that once you put price controls in there's going to be less doctors because doctors will be paid less they'll get burned out more they'll then Possible's will be able to actually never finish that point the reason price controls reduce supply and we reason we see supply reductions in other countries is because well hospitals don't get the same amount of money they're not going to invest in that extra ICU but they're not going to buy those extra ventilators they're not going to hire those other doctors a doctor doesn't want to be a doctor because they don't make the amount of money that they thought they would make they're doing extra work because there's more people who now have access to them but there's less of them so wait lines are huge and then and they're seeing multiple more patients a day doctor burnout increases quite a bit that's the quick answer as to why why that happens but does that kind of answer your question it's getting really that does yeah the human right issue we we kind of moved around with that this the the idea that it's different than the fire department or police department or well it's not a right either actually the the fire department is not necessarily a a right as we would but it's a public service that's provided to everyone now it is but it but understand so let's call it a public service then and let's call doctor healthcare a public service okay well if we were to do medicare for all but wouldn't the result be the same if it's provided for everyone not from a practical standpoint just because it's much easier again you could add a hundred thousand people more to your city and the fire department would have marginally more more work to do you know compared to like a doctor for instance does that make sense like you just it doesn't I think on a if you're trying to compare them in that sense that that non-rival attributes matter it matters quite a bit if I'm describing that so what you're saying is because competition is necessary with medical innovation and also like doctors profit off of being exceptional so you you they have incentive to being exceptional no no what I'm saying is if you have if you have ten doctors that's that are serving a community every time that doctor is serving somebody it means somebody else can't see them well isn't that just as a signal that we need more doctors and more hospitals it is their understanding it it would be yes but I'm saying that's how it's different from a fire department which is sort of lying in wait for a fire to occur well if there was more fires yeah but it is unlikely most of the time I'm just I'm trying I'm trying to distinguish why those why those aren't very comparable things like what why one is more of a public service that that we see to work well while the other wouldn't necessarily be in friction and you kind of just said it yourself it would be a signal for there to be more doctors which is why the free market price price points are so important because the only way to signal that is to actually that demand raises prices when the government tries to do that now there's this theory of the socialist that they would say the government can just figure that out I would say that they've tried that in the past it never works it never it just it never ever works the government can't possibly be so omniscient as to know every single price signal and and anticipate every single piece of demand and production that is therefore required and so you know it's not just healthcare that this is a problem it's it's every aspect of society so if I can go back to what you're saying earlier you so what you're essentially saying about socialism that socialism looks at this problem it says hey let's make the government take care of everything let's take money from the wealthy people and pour it into the government and that the government will then have resources take care of these issues and you'll you're just looking at the first step of the problem you're not looking at the secondary or tertiary the instances or things that are going to go sideways once you do implement that first step is that we're saying it's a hundred percent what I'm saying I would I would add social needs out some very important things like like human nature for instance and and this the this notion that we need incentives socialism doesn't believe and incentives doesn't believe that we need incentive to do things there's there's this there's this utopian belief among the most hard-core socialist that that humans will act in this in this kind of philanthropic manner no matter what like we're going to do the most amount of work even if that reward is is overwhelmingly taken away from us and redistributed but of course that's not how it would actually function in reality yeah you would start to you it just wouldn't right and so you're now maybe for a few people a few altruistic people would be the ones you know doing all the work while everybody else is like pretending to work which was it happened in the Soviet Union you pretend to pay us we'll pretend to work right look that was the saying from the Soviet Union that's I I think we intuitively understand that and and and and when that happened again the same thing with Medicare for all if you're if you have price controls your incentives change and if we're if we're not really serious about understanding that aspect of these of these policies then we're not thinking through them correctly and I don't understand a lot of Democrats would say well it's Medicare for all it's not socialism and I'm like yeah but it but it has very socialistic tendencies and it has these qualities that I've described of not taking into account the second third order effects of removing human incentive of of forcing somebody's services and because you're calling it a right which means that you now have a right to somebody else's services like these are these are things that have been proven not to work and and I think we and I think we have to understand that as we try to move towards the mutual goal of getting everybody access to health care well it doesn't with everything but it doesn't that work with the fire department isn't the fire department in a lot of ways a socialist institution no no I again I still say it is not because it is not under any obligation to serve everybody that that demands its service right it's therefore specific emergency service as a as a public good but it's there for fire if there's a fire they come in and help you there's not a financial incentive for them to do so right but I mean but but on a practical level on a practical level though imagine the scaling that has to occur if you're if you're doing that with medical with medical care and I and I think that's and I think that's the difference with from an economic point and a practical standpoint right so we're talking about over what you're talking about socialism overall not just over I'm not just involving medicine you're talking about socialism in general and I'm saying isn't the fire department and an example of socialism that works it's definite not an example of socialism I think it's an example of a public good the way the military is an example of a public good the way the highways are examples of public goods the way parks are exam right but they're funded by the people it's funded by people overall it doesn't cost people money to use them and the people have these as a basic part of our society and our civilization no I understand that and I have nothing no promise that I just I just would not call them socialists to call the fire how does it get funded it's a public good how does it get funded it's a public good it's if it's funded by the public right and it's just it's not it's but it's not relying on these sort of it's not relying on the tenets of socialism to function and so that now we're now we're kind of having a discussion of definitions and this is an important discussion to have because oftentimes even Democrats aren't really talking about socialism well even during a Bernie Sanders doesn't call it socialism he's talking about democratic socialism and he makes some very clear distinctions between the two of them which I think you could apply to things like the fire department or the police department yeah there's a lot in that so I think Bernie yes he does say democratic socialism I think he does mean much something much much closer to socialism and that's just me gleaning from his policies because he does talk about putting you know government control on corporate boards Elizabeth Warren talked about the same thing so now we really are talking about nationalizing things when you're talking about mass price controls across all industries on wage controls you really are talking about more of an actual socialism again going back to the weather a fire department or a park or a public highway or the military is a socialist institution again I would I would I would really push back against that that is a that is a public good we've never in our culture in our economics we've never defined these things as socialist institutions now socialist institution effectively means you're not you're you're you're seizing the means of production and you're forcing everybody into a centralized planning State you'reyou're you're telling people what they will earn and and what you will pay them how much they can sell you know you start to take more control over the economy a lot of the policy set out by Bernie Sanders are movements in that direction the fire department is is really not that again that is that is a public surface it has a defined you know it has a defined budget it has a defined role it doesn't it doesn't meet any of those other attributes or elements that I that I described when I described what a socialist is and so this gets into another question like well why maybe Bernie just means the Nordic countries right and you know I remember the foreign minister from Denmark came to Harvard I think he gave a speech as a few years ago and he said stop calling a socialist we're not socialists where we're probably with it and I would agree with them all these Nordic countries have frankly more of a free market than we do in many ways when we look at their regulatory standards they're they're quite liberal when we look at their corporate tax rates it's very low they don't have a minimum wage in many cases and so you know they're not socialist countries what they do have is a very generous welfare state and and that's different than even that is different than socialism it's a giant welfare state now I'm still against that in many ways I think there's consequences to that giant welfare state that that they now have to suffer with as a result and and if you've noticed too that they did they actually used to be very socialist countries but their economies Craster as a result in over time they became much more free market we see the same thing out of Israel we see the same thing out of India used to be much more deeply socialist countries a lot of them have just maintained their big welfare states which they are having trouble paying for just like we're having trouble paying for our big welfare state which is mostly based on Social Security Medicaid and Medicare when you say public good right this is what you feel that the fire department is it's a public good right what do you think that it's possible to implement something like that within regards to medical care yeah yeah I mean so this is a discussion if we get our definitions straight we're just saying okay we just want another public good and a medical so that's it's a more accurate way of describing it I think people don't care about what's called right we just want health care no right but but then we get back to the discussion we had before okay what if we did that well there's a cost to it and it's a hell of a lot more than the fire department and police department the cost by by most estimates is in the mid 30-something trillion dollars another cost on for over ten years so about about three and a half trillion per year so that's basically doubling our budget just every year that's in addition to what we already spent okay so that's additional federal spending some some people try to massage those numbers and say oh but but that's actually cheaper than what we have now if you add it all together that is false that is that is completely false again I have a whole podcast where I actually interviewed the guy who made that study the Economist who did that study and that's not a controversial study everybody basically agrees Elizabeth Warren's plan was 50 something trillion dollars that's adding what we already spend to the new spending that would have to occur so what does that mean in practice it means doubling or tripling your taxes unless we try to deficit spend it which I think would be crazy so it means doubling or tripling your taxes and so then and then the question is okay fine well I do want to double or triple my taxes I mean some people will say that I don't actually believe them I I bet once they got their taxes they would totally change their mind but let's say they're totally into it okay let's say they actually want to do that then you have the second and third order consequences which is okay what are you getting for this what is what is this new utopia that we really live in where healthcare is free and then I go back to okay in order to meet that price point of the the Brina app trillion a year that's that's by the way assuming that we continue using Medicare prices which is what all the plans do assume by the way so for doing that we're drastically cutting prices that we pay doctors and hospitals if we do that we drastically cut our supply of doctors and hospitals and we and we and we cut off and choke off the innovative capacity that we do have so we're losing those quality those quality points again so how do you get people care well the main problem we have with health care in this country is that it cost too much that's fundamentally the problem it is too costly and so from the Republican side what we'd rather do is actually target the source of the problem make it easier to get insurance cuz right now I mean you know it's for so many Americans that insurance is just too expensive if you have it through your employer it's usually pretty good people are pretty happy with that but for the most part it's too expensive which is why I go back to my direct primary care idea because once you hit once you solve the direct primary the primary care issue you make solving insurance much easier you can talk then you can still protect people for existing conditions we like things like either high-risk pools at the state level or reinsurance program you you can make this you can continue to make improvements to the system that make it affordable for people and get people off access that they need well I read of that sorry Brooke up there for a second this whole connection of doing things remotely sucks what did you can you say that last night statement again just still the last few words you said you were talking about surance here's my question yeah the whole thing like insurance still has to pay for it then it's still paying someone's still paying for all this health care if the insurance companies aren't making any profit cuz they're paying for all the health care then what happens then do we fund the insurance companies I mean how does all this stuff get evened out are you referring to cases where you know that the cost of somebody's care is so astronomically expensive that even the insurance company can't afford it well look here's the problem right people can't afford health care so we get them insurance insurance takes care of health care how did the insurance companies make any money then well I mean they make a profit just like just like anybody else but but they're also that they're they're also what we found is especially with our experiments with Medicare Advantage is when you pit insurance companies against each other in a in a free market they lower costs you know they they are a natural there's different there's different elements of the health care system on one side is driving up costs you know because the doctor wants to keep doing more tests or whatever it is or where a patient wants to do more things the insurance company's job is to say hold on a second why are you doing this what is the reason for this what's the outcome that we expect from this so that naturally drives that's that's a natural you know bulwark against higher costs the government was in a medicare-for-all scheme the government would simply replace that insurance company we we should be very careful when assuming that the government will somehow be better at that than insurance companies I'm not saying since companies are great at all everybody doesn't seem to like them but I also don't want the government doing it I don't want to be in a case like in Great Britain where where the government will say you know what your Grandad's not on the ventilator anymore we're done with that or your baby can't get that care I mean we've all seen these stories and we don't have that issue in America but can I pause you don't we have a problem with insurance companies not want to pay for certain things they might but they still but the care still happens the hospital has to eat that care a lot and there's there's different funding mechanisms that reimburse them yeah we have a really I'm not defending our health care system I want to be clear about that it's definitely not perfect it's a huge patchwork but no that doesn't that not the way it happens over there because over there like in Great Britain if you actually nationalize the health care system the way they do its when they say you're not going to be on the ventilator anymore there's no choice like that's that that is that is the decision and then that's what they have to deal with and so it's it is different but don't they have some private health care over there as well I think they might have elements of it and same with Canada but but but not for basic care like so you can eat fur for other kinds of health care surgery sorry leo yeah like elective stuff orthopedic surgeries yeah and I'd have to really get some details for you on what each country does but it's it's it's limited they limit what they can actually do I don't want to get bogged down too much in socialism but one of the things that you said you said socialism has been implemented before but it's never really been implemented here right thank God but this is what I was saying before that I think that when people look at it as an attractive notion one of the things that attracts them to it is that our system doesn't work that great and that maybe this would be a system that does serve people and there's a bunch of buzz words and people use you know wealth disparity economically disadvantaged you know the working class all these different these are words that they use that this is maybe maybe socialism would benefit those people and there's more of them than there are the elite and what do you say to that I would say that there has been times in this country where we had astronomical tax rates and higher government control and some things and we ended up with skyrocketing inflation and downward growth so I'm talking about the 70s and the when Reagan came to power we reversed a lot of that and we've been in a pretty good good trend ever since I I know that what I know what people are saying and you repeated it which is our system doesn't work well well I want to actually want to push back against the premise that our system doesn't work the evidence for that is not great I mean I think there's a lot more evidence to suggest that we live in the best time in modern history in history in modern times it's it's hard it's hard to argue otherwise so I would agree there are certain there's I mean there's certain problems that people point to especially Millennials my people my age housing is it is more expensive our purchasing power isn't as good with say things like housing and health care these are true statements it also depends on where you live the problem Joe is people are identifying issues they're not putting them into context in perspective but even if the right about the issues like hey our purchasing power is lower with respect to housing and health care two very important things people are misunderstanding why that is people forgot to ask the question why is it why is it that I can't afford this people are instead jumping to a solution that is frankly very shallow and simple which is make housing cheaper make healthcare cheaper how write a law say it's cheaper well no that's not how it works we can't just do that we have to first ask the question like why did this happen so in California let's talk about housing for a second California and Texas don't have the same problems and housing in Texas is much easier to come by than it is in California why is that well as it turns out we don't have zoning here in Houston you can build where you want to build it's a much easier I talk to developers who who develop here and develop sometimes in California it's like four times more expensive to develop because of all the regulations in California which means the housing itself is going to be more expensive so what is it government too much government control frankly in San Francisco you can't build anything else they don't allow building high-rises full of apartment building so it's no surprise that the supply is too constricted and prices have to go for the limp the intense amount of demand that's out there we don't have those same problems in Texas okay so again it's like why is this happening same with health care health care is not a free market hasn't been and basically forever and prices have gone up as a result now health there's a lot more complicated than housing and we've spent a lot of time talking about it already but we really have to ask ourselves why something is is so expensive what we're getting from that and then and then we intelligently look at what are the solutions to solve it California's a mess in a lot of ways there's a lot of problems but you really feel like the the reason why San Francisco's housing I mean it's gone up radically with the tech boom I mean I think a lot of it is supply and demand a lot of is just what I mean but it's also people that have ridiculous amounts of money and so the wealth in San Francisco is so off the charts that people are willing to buy a stupid house for you know three million dollars that really should be three hundred thousand dollars in Texas yeah I agree with you it is a supply and demand issue and the supply hasn't caught up with the demand that that's not that's what I'm saying is like the the government won't allow more supplies to be built well the city to those yeah that's fair but that's a and that's totally fair and as a as a city people in San Francisco might just decide we don't want anybody else living here and we don't want to build anything out but what's weird they have no problem with homeless people I mean the homeless we've been to San Francisco I it's been a while but but I have been there quite a number of times and I was gonna say like I spent ten years in San Diego San Diego doesn't have these no well it's a far more communal place and they just they let big buildings get built you know like I used to live in downtown San Diego and when I was there it was one way and now there's like 15 more high-rises and the rent is basically stayed the same so which is good for renters it's bad for owners and developers but you know but the irony is like the populist kind of left and right like a really mad the owners and developers the owners of capital right like kind of Marxist screaming and yelling is all about but the irony is that the policies they want to implement help those people and if we let more deregulation occur you're helping the renters whose rent hasn't changed in years and I know this like I follow the market in San Diego very carefully because we're still property there and so I rent out to people I haven't been able to I have not changed the rent in years years and that's because of upward supply and so again so I guess my you're completely right it's the supply demand issue in San Francisco I thing is is like you have to choose one or the other if you want prices to go down you have to allow more supply if you're comfortable with prices the way they are and you don't want more people moving into San Francisco well then fine but you have to be comfortable with the price is the way they aren't coming and then deal with the homeless population on top the homeless population is insane I mean you've never seen anything like it Los Angeles as well go to downtown LA and drive around it doesn't even seem like it's real it does it seems like it's a movie it's it's it's really sad and there's there's no solution that's on the table there's nothing that anybody's like said that lárgate this is what we're gonna do and this is our ten-year plan and we're gonna clean this up and we're gonna do XY and Z we're gonna take care of this because there didn't used to be 70,000 homeless people in the city and there is now so obviously something went wrong and over a period of ten million years or ten years rather 70 million people or seventy thousand people and how many I'm thrown out a bunch of numbers here that don't make sense how many million people live in LA it's like 20 million people and there's 70,000 homeless people right is it something like that that is a crazy number 70,000 is a smile it's a good-sized town it is and I wouldn't say there's no solutions although there's no solutions being proposed in California I mean you're correct about that they shake you're both solutions and make it look to Houston for some ideas what have they done you well we we took it seriously one thing we do is a housing first type of policy so you you offer services but after you've gotten them somewhere and maybe that place is a warehouse but you actually you all have to have a forcing function so there's there's also a degree of allowing this what is basically a crime to take place in California whereas in Texas we don't allow it we're saying okay you just can't up on the street yeah right it's just you so that's the first thing like you have to actually make it illegal but then put systems in place to actually help them but it but it does have to go in that order in in California their main problem is that they they allow it and in Austin we have this problem because Austin is a very liberal City and so their instinct was to do the same thing that they're doing in San Francisco in LA the governor stepped in said ok you know what no we're actually just going to solve this we're gonna put everybody somewhere else we're gonna take them away from you know cuz people are camping out right outside businesses down I can't right and so we took them out and but but made sure that there was some kind of access to hygiene to porta-potties and then and then access to you know social services that you know get people back on their feet there's also a good private like there's a real like nonprofit sector in Houston that works together very well with the city over time a lot of private investors I mean I went toward this like this shelter it's mostly they try to maintain it mostly for families but this shelter with looks iceman you go into this thing it looks like a like a new college campus how nice it is and this is 95 percent privately funded they take some HUD money to to fund some of their more longer-term like apartments that they have there for people but this is how people get access to new job training and you know in this so that's that it has to be a public-private relationship and you have to have some leadership that says we're just gonna we're actually gonna try and solve this problem is there anything on the table like that for California I don't know man I'm a I'm a Texas guy I there should be I don't know I don't I don't know I I could guess but I'd be speaking out of turn I really I don't know what the what the deal is I just know you guys are sheltered in place it's growing like barnacles here it's really strange I mean I've been here since 94 and I've never seen anything like the current situation and like you said it's a crime they're allowing to take place you can't litter so how come you could just leave your shit under the underpass I mean you can't walk under under passes and a lot of Los Angeles and I mean I'm not exaggerating there's needles and cans and garbage and cardboard and tents and bikes it's nuts I mean it's really really strange almost every underpass in in certain parts of LA you'll find homeless encampments yeah I mean it's it's just it's a it's a stain on what are they doing right now during coronavirus lockdown that's a question I don't know that horse we're locked down so I don't mean I go here I go to the grocery store I go home that's basically all I've been doing for a month and it's most people that are following the regulations it's all they're doing as well so I don't know what they're doing I haven't seen any talk about it I've seen the fact that they had to shut down beaches because people were just getting silly and they're using it like a day off and going to the beaches and being on top of each other so they had a shutdown parking at the beaches and they've slowly tried to close the loopholes the loopholes for knuckleheads basically yeah is there is there an end date to California's believe they're talking about having it the end of April but I think there was some talk about it now being the end of May I don't find out that out Jamie is there Jamie doesn't ever left laptop in front of me because we're doing this yeah I don't know you know I don't I don't I mean I think it's flexible too because if the if the case is keep rising or they stop falling I mean who knows there's you know health care and this is a health care issue obviously is so complicated and there's so many levels to it but I mean I think one of them that we really have to address is diet and obesity there's there's a giant problem with diet and obesity in this country healthy food eating eating the proper food and you know I had a friend who said they were talking about people who do drugs and people who drink and you know maybe they shouldn't get access to those same health care and maybe that's a good incentive to stop people from drinking and doing drugs and I said yeah what about people who do fad would it be up people who were fat like you're gonna use the same logic with them because you can't fat shame so can you tell hey hey fat so you can't get the same health care that a healthy person does well if you got a healthy person who likes to drink and they run and they they jog but they do like to drink and they occasionally smoke a cigarette what are they healthier than someone who's morbidly obese yes they are so would we have a problem as people who don't self care we have a giant problem with that people who don't take the necessary steps personally now is this because of education is it because of ignorance is it because of a lack of awareness of the consequences of of a non healthy diet or eating poor foods or consuming large amounts of alcohol or tobacco products I don't know what it is but that is a massive part of our healthcare system as people who are not doing the proper things to their own body in terms of eating nutritious foods hopefully that they can afford in terms of exercise which is free for everybody you know there's a lot of things you can do that are free to take care of your body yeah I agree well I think it's indicative of a problem in our culture where we've started to sideline this notion of personal responsibility I Chapter seven in my book I forgot I got to talk about my book at 42 available well now order from your local bookstores you run anymore any more help than Amazon did you read the audiobook version of it yeah good thank you for 14 hours very important and I enjoy that some other dork is reading for you I'd be very upset yeah no I was very much against that and so yeah we got it done chapter 7 is called a sense of duty and you know part of the part of the deal when we when we when our founders wrote out the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and and and built the framework for this free society that we live in where government's role is to protect your rights it's fundamentally the government's really god-given rights and and and these these are life liberty property effectively speaking life liberty and property that's and the Constitution the Declaration they Jefferson wrote the pursuit of happiness and they choose these words really carefully now part of the exchange there is is a necessity for citizens to live with a sense of duty and to live as a citizen that this idea of citizenship and to do what is right to do what is good it's hard for me to imagine that people are just so uneducated that they don't know that they're unhealthy you know I think I think I think they know it right the problem is that they don't care that's a problem and you're getting at that problem I don't know if I'm true I don't think it's that they don't care I think they have no discipline I don't think it's that they don't care different well there's there's a differences they'd have never been taught to push themselves there's a lot of people it's just so easy together well that's one of the reasons why I love the title of your book fortitude is what people need and and also they need to understand that there's a great value in doing difficult things and this society what's a chapter is that is it well the name of the chapters called do something hard do that for you well listen man that's true look you're a Navy SEAL man you you know it you get it you live it this is what we need we need more people who understand that I know it's hard to get up I know it's hard to do things I know it it's hard for me to but I still do them and you should do them too I mean it should be something that we encourage everyone to do and that we we all talk about and that we all praise each other for and we all get excited about accomplishing these things and taking care of your physical body taking care of your meat vehicle if everybody just did that we would have health care cost in this country would be radically decreased well that's a fact yeah that that's a fact that's a nap that's an absolute fact if more people had discipline and more people just went out and took care of themselves and then had disciplined to not overeat and that discipline to to try to choose the right foods to make a meal plan write things down I mean it can be done these we're not talking about breathing underwater we're talking about things that can be done by the average person well III don't think the the notion of personal responsibility is talked about enough as it's almost conservatives talk about it all the time things I appreciate about conservatives but it's it's kind of used against us a lot right it's almost like we're accused of being immoral and unfeeling and uncaring when we say you know in this whole like oh just tell everybody to hold ourselves up by their bootstraps and whatever and like not that we even used that term but but the point is is that it's actually important and I don't think conservatives have done a good enough job over time explaining why it's so important and personal responsibility to as a as a foundation of our culture it's important because it leads to empowerment it gives us the agency to control our own destiny it's if you're constantly in victimhood if you're constantly being told that you can't control your own destiny well that's fundamentally disempowering that's a terrible psychological state to be in and the other thing I tell people is that is a fundamental American attribute there's there's some interesting polling out there although I forget the numbers right but I always I always have them in a speech that I give and when when you ask people what's the exact question it's it's like do you you know do you have the things that happen to you are they within your control or outside your control it's something like that in Germany the the answer was was overwhelmingly things are happening to them outside of their control right like like do you understand what I'm saying in America when the same question was asked it was like you know 30 or 40 percent of people said yes versus in Germany it was like 50 or 60 percent this is a pretty market difference and that's a uniquely American thing that we believe we are in control of our own destiny we tend to overwhelmingly say more than European countries that if work hard and and play by the rules and do what's right that we will get ahead that we will find that opportunity and I think that's I think the world recognizes that too when you when you go around the world and you ask people where would you rather be - you know - if you could immigrate right now what's your number one destination well it's the US of A like overwhelmingly the second place is Canada and Germany at like six percent of respondents the USA is like twenty one percent of respondents so second place isn't even close and so for all of the left-wing like anger and always saying how bad it is and how nothing works here and everybody's just in in crisis all the topics that we're in a crisis technically right now of course but this this rhetoric was was was prevalent before all this for all of that commentary it's it just it's just isn't true and so and then the reason they use crisis language okay the reason they tell you're gonna die in 10 years and climate change the reason they're always telling you that corporations are taking advantage of you and the 1% is just got you under their Putin all of this it so it's a very victimizing language and there's a reason behind it because they want very they want very very extreme policies put into place and you can't justify you can't justify revolutionising the whole system unless you convince people that the system is so bad and so corrupt that it needs to be revolutionized and and what's that's created is a real undermining of this notion of personal responsibility because you have to tell people they're victims if you're going to convince them that they need you to save them and when you under my personal responsibility you dis empower people and fundamentally to me that's what socialism does because you're telling people there you know each to each to their need each to their ability what you're telling people is that they don't have to work that hard that they deserve they have rights to all of these other services from other people it's their right and we should distribute that accordingly everybody's perfectly equal what that does is it removes agency from people and it's truly a disempowering thing and we've seen this throughout their throughout history you know just talk to Venezuelans and Cubans and they're so happy when they get here they're so happy because they just want to work hard and move up and they're just so excited about this meritocracy that we've that we've that we've built into our into our culture well Cubans are such a great example that my friend Andrew Schultz who's a hilarious comedian has a great bit about how communist Cubans come to America and the moment they step foot on soil they become Republicans it's really hilarious and it's true yeah and they do appreciate that that aspect of this country I think one of the things that you said earlier is that we live in the best time ever in history and I agree with that the consequences of it being such a great time are it's far easier to get by because it's far easier to get by people look for things to be more difficult than they actually are they look for things to be more stacked against them than they actually are they look for more of a woe is me standpoint when you find people that actually have a real difficult life they don't look for things to be hard they find hard things everywhere they look and oftentimes you find that those people that have a real struggle that it's there's a great documentary called happy people by Werner Herzog it's about people who live in Siberia and it is a brutal difficult existence in extreme cold but these people are overwhelmingly happy I mean it is a really crazy documentary because their physical and their struggle just for existence just to survive is so difficult that they've found this sort of perfect vibration of existence where they're in the wilderness they're out there trapping and hunting and fishing and and farming and gathering up enough food to survive in the extreme winters and it's it really shows you that human beings need difficult tasks we need things to be tough to do and we need to actually go out there and do them to have a feeling of satisfaction and have a feeling of personal responsibility and the fact that you've actually done the things that you needed to do in order to survive it's built into us yeah it really is this is why I wrote a whole chapter on this do something hard is it is it is a real deep dive into the benefits of suffering yes and and I distinguish between just going through something hard like getting blown up in the face like yeah that's suffering but it's not self imposed I wouldn't wish that upon anybody I'm not saying you need to get blown up in the face and lose an eye to have this sort of spiritual awakening and how good it feels to go through something hard but you should you should have bitch Lee move into a self-imposed suffering you were about to say something no I wasn't no okay but you know but you just by virtue you're like you're a seal and seals people that are special operators people that have gone through just whether it's military or first responders really difficult physical tasks to get to where you you are just that alone creates character creates a different kind of person and the type of people that gravitate towards those endeavors those they're special people they are but everybody you know I didn't write this book for them and I wrote it for everybody and and what I what I point out is listen skills have our hard thing and it's buds you know it's just such as an acronym it stands for basic underwater demolition slash SEAL training it's six months of hell and it it is it pushes you beyond limits you you ever thought you had hell week especially and and when you're done with that when you when you come away from hell week there really is this sort of spiritual awakening it's that you have higher confidence you feel prepared for anything even in the some of the worst situations you can think to yourself well it's not quite hell week is it you know and and so you you you you're able to have a much more perspective we're lacking in perspective quite a bit also chapter 2 is called perspective from darkness and I point this backed out that too many of us have have gotten so comfortable we removed suffering from our life to such an extraordinary degree and that's not a bad thing okay that's that's that's an that's a that's a that's an element of the modern times that we live in and I'm happy we live there but the reality is is that my ancestors were like struggling through Texas trying to find water on a daily basis and and in my life I'm complaining because when I'm at 30,000 feet flying through the air the Wi-Fi isn't as fast as I'd like it to be like so we have very different complaints and it's good to every once in a while just think you know what I have it pretty damn good and to remind yourself of that again but do something hard chapter is it's one it's a deep dive into the psychological literature which I just enjoy doing there's there's a lot to back this up whether it's modern psychology the history of stoicism or or the Bible we've all of these all of these texts these these ancient pieces of wisdom that have been around for a very long time they all talk about this they'll talk about the value of suffering the value of enduring and hardship how this builds character and and how this actually quite literally makes you stronger in both something built a metaphysical sense in a psychological sense and a physical sense actually actually go into the to the science of it as well and like how the the changes in your brain what exercise does what hardship actually does both physically and metaphysically like there's real there's real benefits to this but you have to do it and and it doesn't have to be Joe Rogan's life okay I wonder if a lot of people look at your life and they're like that guy is too productive for me and and you know that it's just too intimidating and maybe that's so but don't compare yourself to other people compare compare yourself to who you were yesterday you know and I think that was it's not a jordan peterson that might be a jordan peter say yes i think i just quoted that but but but the point is is like these things are true because they're true like that's why Jordan peterson says that because it's true like you know III don't pretend like I'm the first one to come up with these ideas I'm just trying to put them into language that people can understand and and use my life experiences to bolster those those lessons but it just has to be harder than what you did yesterday and maybe it's physical but not everybody can do physical things maybe it's hard for you to finish a project at home just do that maybe take a cold shower and you see you can like kind of you feel tough for the rest of the day because she's like you know what I just sat in ten minutes of icy cold water I didn't do that the day before but I did it today and now I still it might more like a badass thank you know and I feel like more like a badass than I did yesterday it's small things it's the self-imposed suffering is so important for our lives like me I for me it's usually physical right like I want to do this challenge of a workout you know that kind of keeps me sharp or maybe it's like running for Congress or something like I don't know like we all have something and I'm just saying you have to find that and make it habitual it can't just be once either his seals can get soft too yes we all know that you know we know who those guys are and it's because they stopped they stopped listening from the lessons from buds into this this value of self-imposed suffering yeah I feel that resilience is almost like a muscle it's something that you can build and it's also something they can get soft and I think that I look I love comfort don't get me wrong but I don't appreciate it unless I've done something difficult you know if you look at like all the different things I do and say are you real productive and that's nice dude I also like to watch TV I like to put my feet up I like to kick back like to have beer I like to relax but I don't like to relax if I'm not doing shit I know me and I get mad at me if I'm not doing anything I don't like me when I'm not productive but when I am productive I also can enjoy to relax I enjoy relaxation and I don't enjoy it unless I've earned it and I think that's what people need to do they they need to earn their comfort you have a proper sense of shame which is what you're describing that's chapter 6 it's called the right you're describing this stuff because you already know this like if you read my book like you'll be like I already know all this but because it's true all right now I'm trying to give these lessons out in a clear and coherent kind of fun way but these things are just true you feel bad when you don't act the way you envisioned yourself to be like you you have this hero archetype and I talked about here are archetypes before you have this idea of like what you think is the right way to be and you're trying to live up to that at all times we often fail and you've built that archetype over time maybe looking to others is like the right kind of hero maybe you've seen how how successful people are and you're like I want to be like that I'm sure maybe you're doing comedy or fighting or whatever it is like you're like they have a way of doing something that maybe I shouldn't mendicancy built this overtime and you know when you you know only you know really when you when you don't meet that standard when you don't meet that standard there should be a degree of shame that you feel and and I and I again this is a problem I viewed in society where I don't know that people are feeling that shame anymore it's almost the opposite and when you when you don't feel that shame you can't feel a sense of duty to be that citizen that we talked about earlier and I find this to be a big problem even with the small stuff like in and I use examples in the book like you should feel shame when you're that person who doesn't put the shopping cart in the little shopping cart section yeah parking lot and said leaves it in the parking space absolutely no it's easy and you're like ah somebody will do it there's people there people who take care of this well but like why why don't you just want you just put it away and worsley and if you don't put it away because you're in a rush you know because your kid is screaming and maybe have a good reason not to put it away but the question that to ask yourself is did you feel bad about it right did you feel bad about it and if you didn't feel bad about it what the hell is wrong with you yes these are very simple lessons that we have to start small have to start small the shopping cart one is a great example that's such a good one this is a classic it's so good this makes you mad that's like I've found the greatest parking spot and then that damn carts like it's like so easy to do just just put it back bitch just walk it over there put it in the little stall and you feel better you like look I did it I you know what I do I bring it all the way the fuck back to the supermarket copper stuff I put it back in the thing right in front yes I don't even put it in the stall I walk those extra steps and it doesn't take much time but I feel like I did something even if it's just a trick the grocery store doesn't even have to put those little sections out in the parking lot they could just tell you to put it walk it all the way back walk the door bitch leave but the reason why I like the little stalls is because of people they do have kids if there's a mom got a baby with her gray give her an way out or hire some kid to gather those things up while people are walking out with them fine but you know if you're just a guy and you you know you're shopping for yourself and you don't put your car back fuck you you know and that sense of shame that you're talking about that that really is important people need to feel shame if you've come up short like that because you can do better you can do better and you should want to do better the way to get back the way to get ahead in life is to do everything that way the way you do everything is the way you do anything the way you do anything is the way you do everything I mean that's really what it is if you just do the right thing do it the way you're supposed to do it you can do it and you'll feel better if you're supposed to get a workout in today like fuck I'd rather just sleep in no just fucking get your ass up and do it and you'll feel better when it's done you're like damn I did it I can do this tomorrow too you can and it's momentum and just developing that momentum it's a skill it's like everything else it's like learning how to be polite it's like learning how to be cordial learning how to be a nice person these are learned things you can't just accept that you're a piece of shit and this is just the way you are no just look at yourself as if you are another person judging you like as if you are a person who's like a life coach judging you what would you tell you to do that's exactly right and the the the reason I reason I wrote about this was because you know throughout this book I'm identifying a problem and then trying to come up with a solution so the solution is effectively saying what you're saying and I write a lot about it I write about the psychology behind it but the problem is is like we I feel like we've removed shame in our culture to a huge extent to where it's where it's almost celebrated to you know to like do these wrong things we've started to change the definition of what's right and wrong then this sort of kind of post postmodern society and we never think with some examples of what I mean by that well in and one part I do bring up the example of of how we view you know assistance like government assistance and there's a the movie Cinderella Man where a Russell Crowe plays the whatever the name is the boxer yeah that's a and you know he gets a welfare check the beginning the movie by the end of the movies pulled himself back up and he returns it and that's sort of like our classic heroic thing to do like you know what like we believe in helping people to need it but we also believe that you shouldn't take it if you don't need it it seems like a pretty good good piece of you know civic duty to live by and then I look to my own experience leaving the Navy where we were actually encouraged to get on Social Security disability insurance as I was leaving the Navy so I was in a classroom full of oh fellow of Navy service members none of which were seals none of which had been in combat none of which appeared injured in any way I was the only one with like a visible injury or it's obvious as to why I'm being medically retired and so we're all getting medically retired and by nature of getting medically retired from the military it's guaranteed that we have some kind of benefit on the back end of that you know what I would call a very generous benefit you know people would disagree with me on that but I think it's a I think we get a generous benefit and - on to say on top of that that we should also take money out of the Social Security trust fund for disability insurance even though every single person in their walk right out of that classroom is perfectly capable of working was so frightening to me that it would that it is so ingrained in our new culture that that it was actually in the curriculum at a government classroom um and and this time of stuff is cheered on you know and I see this a lot people will tell a story of victimhood and be cheered but we're not supposed to cheer for that we might feel compassion for them but to cheer for them and this this explains why we're seeing these sort of hoaxes that we've seen like why did Jesse small that feel that he had to say that to Mogga guys and Chicago beat him up why did what was we we didn't ask enough what the underlying psychology behind that was think why do that and I think the reason is because we started to elevate victimhood to elevate this sir shame will be hate and this is what I mean by we sort of changed the definitions of what it even means to feel ashamed and what it means to feel like you're doing the wrong thing because we've changed the definitions of right and wrong and I and I see a need to get us back to some traditional definitions before we all just lose our freaking minds yeah I think that's that's a very good point I think what you're saying is absolutely correct I think victimhood should be look if you are an actual victim I mean I feel for you it's terrible but if you're not a victim and you're playing up victimhood it's disgusting it's one of the grossest things that you see in our culture especially when we're talking about how easy society is and now when you have a person who is affluent and successful and famous like Jesse Smollett who does that and you're like Jesus Christ man like boy did you miss the point that's why it's so foul for us when we see someone who's just trying to for their own personal gain they're trying to game the system and make it out like they're a victim it's one of the grossest things that you could see in a successful culture I mean there's people out there that really are injured like yourself from combat there's people out there that really are sick there's people out there that are really victimized by violent crime and to fake it it's such a it's such a disgusting insult to people that actually are injured yeah and that's that's like the most extreme I think that that's the extreme consequence of this victim agriculture because there's definitely difference between real victims in victimhood culture you have to distinguish between those two things and we have to respect somebody who's actually a victim yes you know in my case and the disability insurance thing I didn't take it but what concerns me is that if I had taken it and in if I had gone on and said in and sort of proudly exclaimed that I got this and I needed it like shouldn't somebody call me out for that you know and the reality is is I don't think people would I don't think I would be called out for that you no I'm a perfectly capable of work yes I'm kind of blind and like I can't see even out of my good eye but I can work I mean I've shown that I can work why would I take that that that wouldn't be just that would I think that would go against our classical definition of what is fair and just and yet in our current culture I do I don't believe that anybody would call me out for that and I should be called out if I had taken that money I really believe that just because I was already getting benefits right I'm not saying it shouldn't get anything I was blown up and then had to get out of the Navy as a result but but i but I feel our cultures a little bit backwards on this and it worries me a great deal we've changed we've changed a few definitions like what it means to be a victim I think we've changed that definition overwhelmingly and we've changed the definition of justice also an injustice and what an injustice actually is we forget how did we've forgotten how to distinguish between discrimination and disparities like just because you don't have the same thing does that effectively mean there was a some injustice that occurred there we're not asking those analytical questions and I think that's a real problem and it's it's made debate very difficult it's it's made debate with my colleagues in the Democratic Party very difficult because every disparity is assumed to be originating from some kind of injustice you know every time somebody is welder than somebody else the Assumption nowadays is that well it's ill-begotten money and that there's some kind of injustice that occurred you know when we were when we were voting on this giant stimulus package not really a stimulus package one of a rescue package remember how this happened there was you know we were negotiating through this thing and was actually looking pretty good Nancy Pelosi comes in says hell no blown up the whole thing and we're gonna protect workers and damn you know not these damn corporations okay so you know you fast forward a few days ended up passing basically the same bill anyway that's a long story I'd happy to go into the details of that politically if you'd like me to but the point is this there was this outrage from the populace right and the populace left against anything that had the name Corporation attached to it and we've forgotten how to ask ourselves like why is that did they do something evil what would it what exact is evil about these entities you know they they employ lots of people to create lots of wealth in this particular case they're not being bailed out they didn't do anything wrong but we're really mad at them for some reason we really hate them because there's this sort of cultural movement towards towards feeling that anytime something is successful like our reaction should be to punish it and that cultural movement worries me a great deal it worries me a great deal it's I think that's what leads to these sort of topics of socialism well I think that that is one of the bad aspects of the ideals of socialism is this inclination to think that when there is any inequality that then inequality is because of either corrupt corruption or greed there's also inequality of effort people do not put in the same effort and when you put in more effort you're more focused you're more disciplined you do more work you should be rewarded and there's people that don't like that idea and they don't like that idea because they're fucking lazy and they're weak and that's a fact and there's people in this world that are weak and there's it's it's an unpopular thing to say because we want to say that no they're they're economically disenfranchised and there's some people are yes some people are and there's also some people that work like a motherfucker and those people get by and they get ahead and those people should be rewarded for their effort one of the problems that I have with people that espouse socialist ideals is that they don't want this competition aspect of our culture in our society to exist where you put in more work you get more reward that's my whole life that is my whole life I mean every everything that I've ever done I've realized oh all you have to do is work harder than everybody else all you have to do is put in more time all you have to do is be more obsessed more focused and you can get by you can get ahead well the people that don't like that are the people that don't like competition they don't understand it it makes you feel bad when you lose everyone should get a trophy everyone should get a participation trophy that is a giant problem with our culture and this inequality yeah there is income inequality some of it is corruption some of it is bad some of it is inequality of effort and that needs to be addressed as well and it's not a kind of this blanket thing that all the people that run corporations are greedy and all the money that they have acquired is because of ill-gotten gains it's just not true it's not true and it's it's anti-american frankly yeah I I list a few tenants of a culture that make it a sustainable successful culture the first one is personal responsibility I went into detail on that the second one is mental toughness which I wrote a whole book about so and it's important for that you said it exactly how I described it when I give speeches on this which is we need mental toughness because otherwise how do we survive in a free society where we have to compete because the only alternative to a bunch of mentally weak people is that we do live in a society where competition is not necessary because the government will just give you everything but I don't want to live in that society and frankly that society can't function very well because nobody would actually do anything and you have to be mentally tough to deal with that and I think the American spirit and the American our history as a culture is a really really tough bunch of people and I just want to remind people of that and I want to remind people that it's something to aspire to like this is a good thing like it's cool to be tougher it's not cool to be a victim right right but we have so many like post modernists who actually again it's going back to this victimhood culture they want you to be that victim and then they'll celebrate you for it yes people tell their victimhood stories they're cheered but it's like wait a second where's the where's the part where you overcame it I thought that was the story we're supposed to cheer well they also you know connect they also connect competition with cruelty and I think that's that's foolish as well yeah it feels bad to lose but that's just because it feels great to win there's it's a it's a peak in a valley thing and you have to understand that and look every competition that I've ever had any anything that we're I've ever competed and lost it has fueled me beyond measure it is what gets you by it's what makes you better there I mean one of the reasons why I understand this is because of martial arts in martial arts you have to train with the best people you can and it's it fucking sucks you get your ass kicked it's part of the but that's what makes you better you need those people you love those people they become your brothers it's very very very important the bonds that are formed in jiu-jitsu gyms and kickboxing gems and martial arts gyms with the people that you train the men and women that you train with the this is an intensity to those bonds that's almost indescribable to anybody that hasn't experienced it I mean I'm sure it's not as tight as people that have gone through combat together but there's something there's something in those people they they fuel you they help you and they help you by trying to kick your ass they help you by trying to be better than you they help you by trying to be the man they they want to be the best they can be and you think about those motherfuckers when you go to the gym you go goddamn it Mike is here shit and you you get fired up for that person that you know is gonna kick your ass and they provide you with fuel people that are better than you provide you with fuel competition provides you with fuel it doesn't mean you have to be mean it doesn't mean it's cruel it doesn't mean it's insensitive it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that it just means that competition is good competition is good for you it's good it shows you your better abilities it shows you that you you can aspire to greatness you can aspire to be better than you are you can do this and you can do this by looking at people who also do it they are your fuel inspiration is fuel nobody gets inspired by Jesse Smollett putting the fucking fake noose around his neck and walking into a hotel still holding a Subway sandwich nobody's inspired by that maybe you're inspired to never be that guy and that but it's a weak inspiration you're inspired by greatness you're inspired by great people stories great people's autobiographies and documentaries and stories of them putting in that work and I mean that that's why there's so many people that you know they're there Instagram existence is essentially just all they doing is just providing inspiration to people like David Goggins that fucking guy every day I mean that guy's whew millions of people just by being a badass just do it just life is hard motherfucker stay hard and just getting out running every day just by doing that ok I I need I don't know him who is it was filming these his way owes like his wife she run ish this isn't a car or something she's in a car but there's been other instances where he's like climbing a mountain I don't know it's a very it's a very smooth like maybe she's a stabilizer I guess oh yeah one of those there's there's been some instances where I'm like okay this seems like a car but this seems impossible to film and without like some some better equipment than just like a selfie video you know well he's got a lot of money I mean he sold the shit out of that book so it's a fantastic book and I can't recommend it enough and you can't hurt me it's called and the audio version is even better because the audio version he actually gets somebody else to read it but then he comes in between and discusses each and every chapter so it's like the audiobook and a podcast together you know he lives an incredible life and he's that guy is an amazing source of fuel for people but is an amazing source of fuel because of his own competition with himself and he's a guy that's talked really openly about being weak at certain points in his life and being fat and lazy and that he got through that he's in he hasn't he wasn't born this fucking warrior that came out of the womb running a hundred miles he became that person and he became that person from being a slob and he's real open about it he's even open about his own weakness currently he's like sometimes I'll stare at my fucking shoes for a half hour before I run my shit I don't want to do this fuck but then he'll go out and do it and while he's doing it he'll yell you know like that people like that or fuel and there's certain people that don't like people like that because they make them feel bad they look at themselves they go goddamnit I don't work as hard as that guy I don't have that kind of mental toughness and then then you try to find something wrong with it but it's it's because they're they're not willing to look at themselves objectively they're not willing to try to be the best person that they can be yeah I agree with that I want to shoot ahead yeah yeah where does he live he's in Vegas now Vegas yeah one of you guys um you want to bring it back to coronavirus sure my I would love to because this is I mean I I think there's the thing I wanted to maybe discuss is is the balance that that needs to be talked about and we this is where I would have taken the conversation from earlier about the media what I feel about swinging the way Sweden is handling it because we're talking about balance Sweden has got a very different approach to it their approach is essentially listen old people vulnerable people please take care of yourself stay home they'll provide assistance they'll get you food they'll do whatever they can to get to you but people that are healthy they want them to go out and live their lives they don't want the restaurants to shut down the pubs to shut down this is a disease that you know it's ravaged people of all nationalities and all age demographic groups but their their ideas take care of your health be careful but let's get society back on its feet again and they're widely criticised by that I would love to hear what you think well I think the jury's still out on whether that's a good strategy or not there's three different strategies okay and there's a Harvard white paper that delineates these pretty well I spoke with one of the professors from the center of ethics that that was an author of this and you can describe these three strategies in the following way well one they call freeze in place it's just basically what we're doing right now it's what most countries are doing a hardcore quarantine of course that's different depending what part of the country you're in the second well let me jump to the third one the third one would just be surrender okay let it happen we'll deal with it as we go but we're not keeping anybody you know that's effectively what Sweden is doing the second option would be sort of a mix of the two which I think will end up being the American off or better well should be where we have a defined period where we remain in place but then we we confront the enemy and like I said we're in a tactical retreat right now but a certain point we actually have to come back out swinging and we need to be prepared to do it Sweden took on the 3rd approach which is like basically they they think they can deal with it and we're gonna see now their cases are jumping up pretty dramatically I don't know how much they'll continue jumping up the Swedes are also very good at culturally following the rules you know like Americans don't like a lot of rules so sweet the Swedes will well we'll stop at a red light at 2:00 a.m. even though there's like nobody around ok same with people in Switzerland ok this is this is we have deeper cultural differences I think there's social cohesion and their ability to follow rules how like the Koreans is is different than our culture where we are we are just way more individualistic and we're going to do it over the hell we want we want to flamethrower in our office we're gonna have a flamethrower at our office I'm like don't tell me I can't have it right I mean you can relate to that I have a flame right behind me but I have a lot of guns and their battle I'm not they're better having yeah situation now they're always better unless you want to start a fire well that's what I mean that's the only situation is sometimes the situation unless you're in the movie alien yeah each dude are you the point is is you need a diversity of weaponry that's that's that's the truth right um and so it's okay so this is a three options I think the jury's still out on what if it works for Sweden or not I think it can work and I would like to see us move to that rather quickly now we need to be careful about how we do it but I'm very I'm very concerned about these indefinite extension of the timelines of stay in place I think I think we have to start having reasonable conversations about the costs of that and the costs are a lot more than just dollar signs the costs are held a lot more than just people's 401ks tanking the costs are actually people's lives also whether it's mental health or suicides or divorces or putting off all of these all of these procedures that were just putting a freeze on so like in its and I have a lot of problem with this I mean in places like Houston our hospitals are not overwhelmed or 50% capacity still because we're not just not getting that many more cases but why should then is why do you think Texas is less prone to this well I guess I'll answer that question by stating why I think New York is the way it is and and New Orleans is the way it is New York is the way it is because it's a it's a giant city with enormous density the most it's the densest city in the country by far it's also the most likely pit place that a lot of international travelers are coming in and out of and so I think there were I think it's safe to say there was multiple hot spots that occurred within New York City and then it spread wildly because people ride subways and elevators I mean it's not like Los Angeles it's not like Houston where we take a car everywhere no matter what there's natural social distancing that already occurs in New Orleans well they had mati girl I mean no naughty girl you know a ditz there's explanations behind these things and I do worry sometimes that our modeling is using these numbers in the wrong ways and not taking enough into the account into the fact that that we just we have very different lifestyles in different parts of the country and also take into account that we can target certain solutions and so regarding the Harvard white paper that says the second solution is mobilized in transition once you've slowed the spread by doing what we're doing again I'm not against doing what we're doing I just think we need to stick to the timelines and maybe make those timelines sooner than later and then come out and fight and what it's fighting mean well while we're in weights where basically we're ramping up production of protective gear we're ramping up production of ventilators again our system is amazing we are producing we're gonna be producing but I think next week or so up to 7,000 new ventilators a week we haven't run out of ventilators I went through the numbers before we're talking about socialized medicine like one of the benefits of our system is we are actually way better prepared than people realize now we have a big lack of PPE there's a lot of reasons for that and I can go into one reason is that China was upping export from 3m from Goa wanted China to wrote the rest of the world back in January February all right this was dis just came out and in an article that was written I was confirmed by you know three aminal on people in government they were preventing the export history M produces a lot of it in China they were preventing those exports because they wanted to hoard the supplies then they act like the good guy and go around the world giving it out I mean China has to is we're gonna have to really look at the our supply chains and our relationship with China after this but that's one of the reasons we didn't have the proper amount of PPE it also depends on the hospital again like there is some accountability that has to take place with specific hospitals and specific cities and why they didn't prepare but what I've noticed as of late is this strange belief that the president is everybody's micromanaging boss and that's just not how our system works nor should it and there has to be some level of accountability of the local and state level - again I just got the phone with some of the doctors here at the Texas Medical Center and I'm like how are you guys on PPE and they're like we have so much PPE because we're used to disasters here we prepare and so they're just not worried about it we've supported set up the supply chains in advance like there has to be we have to work together there's what I've noticed and all the finger-pointing and a lot of it's just political opportunism I don't know if you if you like if you if you put these people up to a lie-detector test I wonder if they really think it would be the president's fault that this happened like I don't I don't think they could pass a lie-detector test you know I think it's I think it's a lot of political theatrics but in any case it's it gets us away from the right way to look at our system which is local and state government are our managers they manage on those smaller levels like if California wants to try a single-payer health care system let's see it work in California or a smaller state and then let's swim then let's scale it hell let's let's see if it works in a city and then let's scale it you know like there's a reason federalism is the way it is and it's hard to compare us to different countries in so many ways because these countries are like the size of our city you know like LA is bigger than most so many countries like it's it's it's it's a map the scale matters to a huge extent and it's like socialism works if you've got maybe like 50 or 60 people because you can hold each other accountable there's a little bit easier than maintenance as you scale it out you just can't right that's like coops exists and you know in this country like Bernie Sanders look blah blah you can make it work if you can literally see everybody all the time BAM a family unit is a socialist unit teach their own teach their needs teach their ability when you scale things out it dramatically changes things and we have to remember that as it pertains to dealing with the pandemic and dealing with public policy as well the point I was making about the media a second ago one of the problems it's not just that they're not informing people correctly which we discussed earlier the other problem is that they're preventing us from having the right discussions because we do have to have this discussion that we're talking about right now which is how do we how do we responsibly move into a into a system where we're simultaneously combating the pandemic but also reopening our economy and we have to have that and and the natural reaction from disingenuous people is oh well how many lives is it worth to save a job and I'm like okay that's that's not the right question it's a very dishonest question and you know first of all it assumes that somebody going back to work will actually cost a life you can't prove that I mean if we're gonna we're gonna play this dishonest game of counterfactuals but also it misses the point you know we live in a world where we take risks and and we have to take those risks and then mitigate those risks accordingly and we can better mitigate risk and we better understand what we're dealing with and when we're better prepared and those are the two things we have to do over the next month is get better prepared and that's and that the answer there is test more people especially test people with antibodies so that we can see who's actually immune wouldn't give them like a certificate or something they can do go do it over they want getting where ICU beds where they might be needed getting more ventilators getting more PPE so that's the preparedness side and on the other side we risk mitigate it's just like you know like you explained in Sweden let's keep sick and vulnerable people away let's target our efforts a little bit better let's take a more vertical approach as opposed to a horizontal approach we can do this we can do this if we give each other the grace and the space to do it instead of like this bad faith finger pointing up like oh you're just gonna kill people you don't even care well it's like that's that's a terrible way to think about it I mean I could moralize this situation say well I could I'll save thirty thousand lives this year because I'm not gonna let anybody drive and I'm a better person than you because you have the blood of thirty thousand people on your hands because you want people driving that's a great example one that is a great example I'm the more roll yeah and that's it's not it's not at all no you're you're absolutely right and I'm worried about that when we do go back I'm worried about that finger pointing I really am because I think it's just gonna muddy the waters and I'm also worried about it being used as political opportunism and it's gonna scare people Ernie hey yes it's already happening I have a bunch of quotes I could read you please read some okay hasn't been published yet but um you know I note some of them there but I will Nancy Pelosi last week said you know there was responsible for the deaths of people the where is it it's this is why I said maybe I won't because then I have to actually look for it here I wrote all this stuff down but there's a lot of quotes out there from media and from okay from from pundits from Twitter users but I only quote people who are well-known either they're well-known journalists or they're politicians but it usually goes along the lines of exactly what you just said you were worried about which is Trump is more concerned about the the stock market than people's lives all right that's the kind of the typical one you hear and no it's certainly been been said quite a bit and my fear is that it continues to be said okay I you know and it prevents us from having a reasonable debate because we we truly need to have that reasonable debate the other the other thing that frustrates me about these kind of bad faith arguments is that the people sang them made the same claims themselves like a February 1st Washington Post here's a headline get a grip America the flu is a much bigger threat than the coronavirus ok February first USA Today coronavirus too scary but the flu is deadlier and more widespread ok February 3rd Washington Post why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to coronavirus and so these same papers are now destroying the president all you didn't act early enough you didn't do anything it's and you have the blood you have blood of people on your hands but like that's amazing ideas yeah the hypocrisy is insane and like I've so many more go ahead New York Times who says it's not safe to travel to China so this is following president Trump's extremely at the time a very bold move to restrict travel from China and you know and of course all of these papers and prominent people are now saying something different I go through a timeline to where I look it because again my my Democratic colleagues are very quick to continue to accuse this administration of just dropping the ball doing all these bad things but I have to remind everybody how this is this is a good one on the same day that that Trump implemented the restriction on travel this was it's the January 27th okay and then they announced the they announced the ban on travel as well as the the task force January 31st oh sorry the 34 the 31st the Trump administration implemented the restriction on travel January 31st and also declared it a public health emergency on that same day Nancy Pelosi talked about a bill promoted a bill called the no ban Act which would limit the president's ability to impose travel restrictions so they get you just you just can't say you just can't say that this guy wasn't acting in the public's best interest and then then have facts like this when I I do remember this too and I pointed this out at the time because you know a lot of people were not talking about coronavirus in February and on February 28th which is a few days before February 28th the the Trump admitted the 24 the Trump administration asked for two and a half billion dollars from Congress to combat the spread so that was a money that had already been spent by HHS by CDC that needed to be reimbursed so the Trump administration has already been dealing with this and they're like hey Congress we need more money we need more supplemental funding he got slammed I don't know if everybody remembers this but he got destroyed he got told he wasn't taking it seriously why isn't he asking you for more money the president's response to that was okay fine give me more money like I mean just write something that that week you know if we voted on in the House floor we didn't vote on more money okay they had days to give more money because this was earlier in the week we actually voted on that we close to 339 which is reversing the youth tobacco epidemic act that was a bill to ban flavored tobacco according to House Democrats things like hookah grisly wintergreen which is maybe what I might like is now illegal now it never got into law of course because I never went through the Senate but I want people to understand like I'm not I'm not blaming Democrats either because there was a lot that we all just didn't know and I just want I just want to point these things out because it's important to give each other to grace to be like hey not everybody knew what was happening it wasn't until early March that it was exploding as a virus in Iran and Italy and South Korea these things happen and it wasn't it wasn't clear that there should be massive massive lockdowns of society those are very bold moves and it's so easy to have this 20/20 hindsight and and and and act you know holier-than-thou and point fingers but it's it's highly disingenuous and I and I built this whole time light out to show it and I also point out that the timeline can end you know the from here on out we could just we could just give each other some grace and solve these problems together because it will be very easy to blame each other for the deaths of Americans no matter what the decision is it will be easy because the counterfactual is impossible to prove and the fact that it's so easy that political opportunism is so easy is is what worries me the most and like we have to have those conversations though about reopening society and when to do it and we have to have the conversations about this political opportunism and and shaming it and calling it for what it is and and really being honest with those quotes from the Washington Post The New York Times USA Today and letting people know no we didn't know what this was we didn't see it coming and when it was coming we were real confused as to what the consequences were gonna be and we're also not getting honest data out of China right China China is just they are not honest about the body count they're not honest about any of it we don't really know what happened over there the version that we're getting is got holes in it oh yeah let's talk about that I did find the quotes that I told you I had don't want to hear that sure they're from people like Jen Rubin like CNN so generative and Trump death tall equals Trump dead lives that would have been spared had he acted on warnings the rest of victims the rest are victims of Trump's stupidity and narcissism this is from a prominent Washington Post columnist again I'm not choosing random Twitter users you know from New York Times President Trump was so focused on fabricating threats involving Central American caravans that he was oblivious to the real threats so again I could keep reading I have a bunch but let's talk about China yeah so I just mentioned that one that story that just came out which is that they actually prevented PPE from being delivered outside of China so that you know we are our companies 3m they produce it there should have been exported out they prevented that there was a study that showed that if they had if they had actually been honest and given us given the world three weeks extra notice 95% of the spread could have been contained okay Wow five million people left Wuhan they allowed travel out of Wuhan five million people right traveling all over China all over the world the reason this this became so bad in Italy and Iran is because of the belt road initiative these are major hotspots for China's economic development and the belt and Road initiative so then let's get into the World Health Organization there's got to be a come-to-jesus moment on the World Health Organization again mid-january World Health Organisation says that says that uh or they repeat the claims made by China that that um that it can't even be transmitted human to human contact On January 30th World Health Organisation says something along the lines of there's no reason to be shutting down travel or limiting travel so they are directly controlled by the Chinese government the World Health Organization it should also be worth noting I forget the guy's name who runs at the director of the WHO but he's released from Ethiopia Ethiopia is one of these countries that is a huge and it has a huge investments from the belt and Road initiative and so I mean we need to be calling for a complete complete change out in leadership at the WHL I mean we see that while we're they refused to acknowledge he refuses to acknowledge the existence of Taiwan he wouldn't even say it the one that keeps questioning him and he shuts his his camera off yeah it was like when you asked me about marijuana use and I pretended I couldn't hear you you were joking though we were right in front of each other joke yeah that's different yeah he shut his connection off and then he said China's doing a great job let's move on and you know like what very way it's so deeply corrupt is so deeply corrupt and I mean you know I don't think that who will ever have the standing that it did before not without an immediate and serious leadership change because they've they've lost all credibility and then move on you know fast forward the Chinese were perpetuating it's unclear whether they started this route this this talking point or whether it was the progressive left and the Chinese just repeated it and latched on to it but this whole notion that it's racist to call the virus the Chinese virus was it was such an utterly absurd thing that we were focused on as a country when that just doesn't matter I just didn't no matter no matter what your opinion on whether it's actually racist or not I mean I personally don't think it is there's a G there's there's a history of calling a virus some kind of geographic name based on where it's from that's fine the point is is that Chinese authorities were tweeted we're spreading that quite a bit in February so they're doing things like that then they claim that perhaps it was the u.s. army that had started the virus in Wuhan they haven't let international inspectors go in and investigate the the origins of this virus so that we can better understand it they've I mean that's there's gonna be well there already is quite a few things that we're looking at is what we can do to one rebalance our supply chains that as a country we need a better industrial policy on bringing a lot of important manufacturing back home and being more competitive in that sense there can I ask you this is there any evidence that this was a man-made virus you know this is the big conspiracy theory that there was sort of a level-4 bio weapons lab in Wuhan yeah and I just don't know I mean I I could pontificate but it is true that there was a bioweapons lab yeah one yeah I don't know if it's meant for weapons but there's certainly a lab there that would have housed viruses like this and oh yeah we just we just don't know the answers and I don't you know especially in my position I don't want to of course of course I don't want to I don't want to assume do you think that this because of the consequences of this virus and all this that this awakens people to the need to manufacture things in America particularly particularly medical supplies so many things that we rely on China for 100% and this is this is some Trump has been talking about forever and I think both I think he's received skepticism from both the left and the right on that for different reasons mostly from the right because you know we we have and the Republicans need to come to terms with this is what we have really adhered very closely to a more libertarian mindset to free trade where where the more free trade the better where where if somebody else can make it cheaper then then we should just have them make it this comparative advantage theory and that's true in theory it is true but but we can't ignore the consequences and I I think we have ignored those consequences for a little too long like what what happens when you when you close down that Factory yeah like your t-shirts are three cents cheaper per unit which is a really big deal for the margins of your company and yeah that company can hire more people and you get a cheaper t-shirt but but we kind of miss those manufacturing jobs like there if you there's there's also a there's like a moral or immoral but it's like a psychological benefit to these manufacturing jobs as well you're creating something people like that people like to feel like they're producing something and that they have meaningful work that pays pretty decent and so there's consequences and there's consequences to the efficiency that has occurred and then there's national security consequences and we're learning about those right now it's not just medical supplies that we need to take a look at I'm from Houston so our oil and gas industry is in a big big dire straits right now we risk we risk the possibility that we lose energy into between Russia and Saudi Arabia now hopefully I think the administration's values and diplomatic pressure and and figured that out to it to an extent but there's we have to come to we have to decide whether we think there's value and doing things ourselves that's the ultimate question and I would answer that yes there is now do we take it to an extreme no but are we out of balance right now maybe yes and maybe we do need to look at changing our supply chains maybe that means some things are just slightly more expensive maybe that's what it means but for for a lot of element for a lot of items we have to be looking at that we'd be thinking that way well I think I think also when you look at what are the consequences of allowing us to have things manufactured over there what kind of karma do we take on for when you look at Foxconn those buildings where they manufacture iPhones they have Nets around them to keep people from jumping off like yeah how many people have to jump before you put nets up and like what what what has to happen there where you your life sucks so hard to make an iPhone I mean how much would it cost to make those here is it worth it for us and you know is there so the real value in that the label that we used to love to look for made in America that's that's not really discussed that much anymore but I think it would be wise for all of us to invest in that idea again yeah and the problem is is like we we hold ourselves to those standards of good labor conditions and good environmental standards and we but we punish ourselves almost out of business completely and so we punish ourselves out of business usually for through these specific regulations or labor or environmental but then we also engage in free trade so it almost guarantees that we lose out our own manufacturing base or sometimes the energy sector whatever it is because we we simultaneously make ourselves less competitive while also forcing our people to compete against people who are who work their employees so hard that they have to build nests around the office yes they throw themselves off of it that's such a good question by the way like how many how many people actually jump before they cook the Nets what is the number that is just a crazy reality and it's also one that we just accept because we want an iPhone and I mean apples one of the most profitable countries the main companies rather the world's ever known I mean it's a spectacularly profitable company and like and and there's there's a whole of government policy and a hostess I don't say government it's really society that we all have to kind of collectively look at this and it's gonna take the private sector as well because Apple would tell you okay I'd love to do I'd love to open up a plant here and they do but they'd like to do more the reason they don't is because when they put out that job application nobody will show up or at least not enough people and so and so what what does that tell you it tell you is that we're not educating people in the skills that are necessary to engage in these jobs there's a lot of technical skills that we are not teaching because so this gets to education policy why aren't we promoting more stem why aren't we promoting via the you know the federal loan program student loans why are we promoting things and majors that actually get us to a higher paying job why you know why why should the taxpayer be on the hook for a major that is guaranteed not to pay anything once you graduate like what are you gonna do with that degree and it's whatever who knows like you can name but you know what I'm talking abut right gender studies whatever it's these are not high-paying things and they're not useful for the economy that that we want and so what kind of incentives need to shift is my is my point to encourage more of that so that Apple when they do look at a place to build a new factory they can be they can be confident that people will actually show up to work there one more question Dan before we go when you running for president I know you're gonna I mean I'm in my thirties I come on I got I got so much time for years well yeah I mean technically yeah but but no I know how old you I'm really I'm really not planning on that come on stop line 36 you're 36 when you're 40 I'll be perfect that's that's the time I mean I I do like being in politics I like having a voice it's a place I never thought I I would be the day before I decided to run for Congress I was about to take a job working at the Department of Defense I'm just kind of moving along my same trajectory and like the national security space but I I like this I I've always loved policy I've always loved thinking through these things and kind of the foundations of what makes this country great and you know I think we've got great years ahead but yeah I'm not I'm just answer your question super honestly and it's not not thinking about it there's no much change in politics right now so much so much changes from year to year thank you so much it's crazy how how it's not like a there's no pipeline in politics it doesn't work that way you know whether you're running for the time or whether you're trying to move up to a different position it's just like you just got to do what feels right and when the people want it the people will let you know what they want it that's a very good diplomatic answer and I think you uniquely qualified for politics I appreciate you I appreciate how reasonable you
