the Joe Rogan experience because of Kevin Pereira just signed up for it like that night at midnight he was on the computer signing up for Obamacare and I think he pays like $200 a month or $300 a month for like really fucking awesome insurance because of it now but it doesn't start until January I guess you have this is January 1st it's this is the signup period they're trying to get everybody but like there's all these ads on TV telling you that it's bad and that you shouldn't sign up for it they have ads to try to encourage young people to not sign up for it because they have a what young woman is sitting in like a gynecologists office with her feet in the stirrups and then the gynecologist has a giant ugly Uncle Sam paper mache Uncle Sam head that rises up and like looming over her vagina like trying to tell young people don't sign up for Obamacare because then they're good then the government's gonna tell you what you can do with your vagina what was that true there's a government has vagina agenda well the thing is is they some argue that Republicans do are are you know do have a vagina agenda but it's not - it's so weird that they basically just flipped the script like it's supposed to be that you know the Republicans are anti woman but they're trying to make it look like Obama isn't really the one that wants to tell you when what you could do with your vagina so it's just manipulative it's about health care period so they use it to like sexual health care they go to that right away baby's vagina your wife's boss yeah well because that's what the Democrats have been using they've been saying the Republicans are anti woman so this so they're just using the same approach but saying but putting it on Obamacare hmm and Obamacare is anti woman it's really fascinating that they're allowed to do that it's really fascinating they're allowed to editorialize at all that there have allowed to have like any sort of dramatic influence at all in their commercials it's so crazy like you're allowing people to manipulate you know Doug Benson has shown time and time again he doesn't care about the people of Los Angeles Doug Benson promotes smoking marijuana for underage children in blue your children Doug Benson is not a good American in fact he would live in Canada if it wasn't so fucking cold Doug Benson they almost can say that man they're so dramatic it's not facts like very clear simple vetted facts that have been verified on both sides and agreed to no no no nonsense hyperbole drama dramatic writing fucking manipulation the truth all that standard fare and oh by the way we've been paid for by giant corporation it's a language they they had an amazing spirit experiment in this book where major league baseball players almost all of them are off the charts visually they have 2010 2017 there's almost no really great hitters there I don't think there are any who have even 20/20 vision they almost all without a doubt have vision that is off the charts they're in the 1% I'm talking about all major league the hitters and and the book is very eloquent about this and so they took Albert Pujols and who and Alex Rodriguez and some incredible hitters like the best of all time of their generation and they had and one of the things they found is that when a baseball comes at you at 95 miles an hour from 60 feet away you have to guess where it's going you're not gonna see it you and I cannot register in time to actually see and hit the ball so what great hitters do is they're able to actually see the seams on the ball there'd let's see the seams on the ball and through years and years of how those seams are rolling and how that pitcher throws the ball they're able if they're very good if they're very good 30% of the time they are able to predict and start swinging basically when he lets go the ball so that's where why curveballs and shit work yes because they can change where the balls gonna they change direction but also the way you hit a curve off you're really great is you you can see the way these guys can literally because they're such good eyes can see the pattern of the red strings coming at you at 95 miles an hour they can chunk all that information quickly enough and start swinging low as opposed to high and connect so you have to guess now they take the greatest hitters in Major League Baseball and they take a female Olympic softball pitcher who pitches underhand now the distance is about 40 feet a little bit more than 40 feet the ball is coming over at about 60 miles an hour not 95 miles an hour and she pitches under him now these are the best pitchers and they hit a much smaller ball at 95 miles an hour she struck out every single picture over and over and over again because guess what they're a novices cuz you know why they couldn't guess they were looking at a very different ball they didn't have the strings and she was pitching underhand so there was no way for them to predict anything they were swinging blind and they were as bad as you and I how about that so the more you learn the more we learn not only about you have to have a certain hardware we know as an athlete you you are never gonna be you and I are never gonna be sprinters like sorry shit the coverage from her they learned from Ross Perot tell you what Ross Perot duck and billion-dollar monkey-wrenching and their fucking plans did folks who were young and full of life you don't remember Ross Perot Ross Perot cost George Bush's second term yeah Ross Perot was a bad motherfucker it's why Clinton won he came around Ross Perot came around and all of the sudden there was this billionaire dude explaining how the government works explaining the federal debt explaining the the federal bank explaining taxes and you're like wait what the fuck is going on he took time on network television that's what's so gangster about him because he was before the Internet this was not going on when everybody was online this is like early 90s yeah you know what was I remember here was it the Clinton guy the election was 92 right yeah 92 yeah man I remember my friend John was like helping with his campaign you ever help with anybody's campaign he's like this motherfuckers gonna get rid of all the crooks he was so excited about him people are excited about Ross Perot was like the original Ron Paul right but Ross Perot was way more gangster cuz he had all that cash had the money any other way of talking say there's a problem okay fuck from down in Texas can tell shit out what yeah yeah that was a real interesting thing so from there they changed the Commission for presidential debates or whatever they call it which is a privately funded institution you know this corporations back it's not it's not like it's a government program so they can decide who gets a debate who doesn't there's a Ross what's crazy my process in Washington where after you've served for a while you can become a foreign lobbyist make thirty thousand dollars a month then take a leave work on presidential campaigns make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out if you just want to get out of brace tax first thing you ought to do is get all these folks they've got these one-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas we'll take the same deal we gave you and they'll gridlock right at that point because for example we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply you say if it was a two-way street just couldn't do it we have got to stop sending jobs overseas it's probably the audience your business paper really otherwise we'd be occupying China right now and you can move your factory south to border pay a dollar an hour for labor hire young twenty five that's assume you've been in business for a long time you've got a mature workforce pay a dollar an hour for your labor have no health care that's the most expensive single element making a car have no environmental controls no pollution controls and no retirement and you don't care about anything but making money there will be a giant sucking sound going south so we if the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2,000 page agreement and make some real I won last part here I've called I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it so I called a who's who the folks have been around it and I said why won't everybody go south I say well be disruptive I said for how long I finally got them up for 12 to 15 years and I said well how does it stop being disruptive and that is when their jobs come up from the dollar now they're $6 now and I go down to $6 an hour then it's leveled again but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kinds of big O's holy shit Thank You mr. holy shit Ross Perot was calling shit in 1992 he was a gangster I mean how correct was that though you're a fucking human being
