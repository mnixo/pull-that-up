five you get less enthusiastic with after it's been a few times you're like you're not really we're live all right we're live what's up man how are you guys are doing this thanks for having me my pleasure sorry for the false starts we've been having issues with our equipment good to see though man what's up good to be here and talk Hunter Thompson my pleasure so your book freak Kingdom you know we live in interesting times right now it's kind of a kind of a shit show at every campus moment about a fist from your face pull that sucker tango which sure with my hand should I put him on you do whatever you want with your hands I shoot with this one what is all this you got a lot of writing well well when I wrote the book I wanted to make sure my sentences never sounded like constant sentences right so I didn't write out a lot of his sentences but this morning before coming on I went and got some of my favorite quotes I'm just weird about longhand to get a sense of what is uh what his perspective was rhythm once again didn't he do that with the great gatsby he like a few times yeah a hand he like typed it out yeah I loved that idea that he was trying to find like the rhythm of the words that's such a fascinating notion because comedians do that in the early days of comedy like a lot of guys in like before they ever start killing onstage themselves they'll imitate their favorite comedians bits like they'll do a Richard Pryor bit and they'll do it to their friends and they'll get get a sense of the rhythm and the timing and get those laughs from doing a Richard Pryor bit to their friends and then they get that bug it's like part of what infects them I mean that's the hardest thing to steal we're not plagiarizing but we're trying to understand what decisions they made yeah beautiful work yeah I'm sure he wasn't plagiarizing but it's it's so unfortunate when when someone does yes you know when when you have someone whether it's hunter or Richard Pryor anyone has just got a truly exceptional and unique mind or someone who doesn't like our president and decided when he ran in 2016 to plagiarize Richard Nixon's 1968 convention speech it directly really yeah that was the headline in the fucking times that said Nixon's inspiration I'm sorry Trump's inspiration Nixon is the one so the lies about crime and like barbarians at the gates crime law and order those were all from Nixon's shitty but successful 1968 Miami convention speech and Thompson you know top some knew how effective that that was yeah I wonder if he did that on purpose because he was so good and one thing that Trump is so good at he's so good at getting the media to talk about him and like one of the best ways to get the media to talk about I'm was give them something to be angry about that no one else is gonna give a fuck about he was like oh Melania plagiarized but I plagiarize much better for initiative that's right so what I loved it Melania took some lines from Michelle Obama's yes right yeah and you know if you plagiarize Nixon that's okay I mean so well freaking them the book about unrest Thompson I mean it's really about taking the fucking emotion of living in this present looking back at Thompson's career and then trying to write it like a novel to dramatize all of the experiences he went through that hour today so applicable to us and just show his perspective that's so applicable to us today what do you got here Jimmy from New York Times convention Biddy inspiration Nixon i was like i if you're running on nixon wells what you're running on here are some parallels you know i mean do you remember when when hunter got together with Bill Murray and Bill's brother and they did that thing where they were trying to get people to Nixon got a bad deal we got to bring him back and people were going along with that oh yeah yeah remember that yeah like that there's a lot of parallels with Trump in that regard I mean it one of my favorite quotes by um Thompson is like you know Richard Nixon is with this Barbie doll family and his Barbie doll wife is like America's answer to you know it's as America's dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde like you know he is the werewolf he speaks to the werewolf in US and Nixon chose to hide that werewolf his whole career until it finally came out because he was insane with power Trump ran on the werewolf he's like no I'm not gonna hide it that's who I am that's what I'm gonna use to try to get elected and like George Wallace did like other politicians did it had resonance and it happened with Trump because of our media environment because of the place we live in narrow to amplify him all the way to the most powerful position in the world which is insane it would be really fascinating to see if hunter was alive and in his prime now how I think his take on it was very similar to Matt Taibbi you know like Matt Taibbi and is in my opinion our more reasonable more put-together version of Hunter Thompson because he's more sustained when long career he's like rational and he's there all the time like I'm sure you've heard the recently uncovered recording of Hunter calling in to some company that installed a DVD player and he's fucking screaming and yelling it's like 15 minutes and then he like it's lost the fucking player doesn't work my fucking cords maybe that was in the nineteen eighties were not the best you know I think what Taibbi does is what Thompson did very well Hunter Thompson was really good at looking at Nixon saying how are you manipulating the way we see you did a version of you out and Taibbi looks at the way the media gets played he looks at the way that an administration manipulates the media and he dramatizes that well everybody else just gives us the information the administration is giving us and that goes back to Thompson with Nixon Thompson had space when he worked for Rolling Stone he could write about how Nixon made everybody watch his speeches the press on a closed-circuit television and they made the press just like Trump off in the corner when the plane arrived you know being berated by everybody it's very similar to what is going on now and again we see people giving hot takes or we see people doing op eds we don't see people dramatizing how manipulative these corrupt administrations are and were and Thompson did that beautifully Navy does that beautifully was Nixon being berated by the press is that why he chose to I thought he was I mean he was a crook so he doesn't want the press to investigate him like he you know he was a crook with San Clemente like his loans with bebe rebozo and all of that he was quick the way to use the IRS to investigate his and it means he was a crook when he tried to break into the Brookings Institution to destroy and vom evidence like he didn't want the press around him because he had committed very serious crimes that I think that's similar that's what we see now I mean as people said on the show no president wants the a journalist you know digging into their lives specifically because it's you don't want chumminess with journalists but I think Trump and Nixon both knew they had so much to hide that to actually have a journalist like Hunter Thompson who was a good investigative journalist to have like Matt Taibbi around that's dangerous for them they'll go to jail which Nixon should have yeah perhaps should well who knows what's going to happen how did you how'd you get involved with writing this book well I mean I've always loved unrest Thompson in I was hurt you get exposed to him you know in in you know I was 17 years old in a Catholic High School at Bellarmine college preparatory up in San Jose and we had a counterculture writing class and so I read some of it there and then a friend had an audio book of fear and loathing and so I just remember the first time hearing that old audio book of fear and loathing and we're somewhere around Barstow at the edge of the desert and then in my 20s I really got into some strange rumblings in özil on which is about a conspiracy within the Los Angeles Police Department regarding the death of Ruben Salazar I'm a prominent journalist and I read that I'm like oh my god dude this isn't somebody that's just dancing on stage or like performing a road narrative this is an investigative journalist who's going to the most powerful people exposing things they don't want us to see and in a sense risking his life to do so because he says in a strange room only was an awesome song which is in Rolling Stone in 1970 he says if they're willing to kill Ruben Salazar who was the most prominent journalist in Los Angeles you could argue at the time what the fuck is to stop them from killing me Hunter Thompson for asking these questions well I think that's what a lot of people are saying today with Jamel khashoggi you know mmm Jamaal khashoggi 'he's death has got a lot of journalists really freaking out like what you know what am i doing if I'm criticizing world leaders and talking about international politics if this could happen to me political violence is effective because it's used to silence either opposition or journalists and so for me writing this book and I tried to dramatize it like a novel it's quick it's like only 220 210 pages and then it's like a hundred pages of notes so I excited every sight smell or sound so that's somebody that knows Thompson really well it can be like where the fuck did you get this information and somebody else can if they have questions just go back and look but long story short for me the crux of the book was in Chicago in 1968 where Hunter Thompson had a press pass he went to the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night Mayor Daley gave this order to clear the intersection of Balboa in Michigan because there is a protest going on five ten thousand people Thompson was standing next to the Haymarket in which was on the ground floor level it was a plate-glass window he was standing with delegates from the Democratic National Convention standing with their wives and the cops charged they did like a double pinch of formation like Hannibal in like come on like fucking 100 BC and they split the protesters in half beat everybody hit Thompson over the head he got his motorcycle helmet on just in time so he's not gonna cussed he can see everything that's going on in the entire plate glass window behind him shatters everybody falls in cops jump in are beating everybody and he's looking around and he's sure that snipers on the roof are gonna open fire at any moment so he runs to the Blackstone where he's staying across the way shows his room key gets beat up by the cops he's trying to get in he goes I live here goddamn it I'm paying $100 a day let me get my fucking room and he barely gets in and he just sits on his bed afterwards and he says they knew I was pressed they saw my press pass they hit me because I was pressed and if that's where we're at right now with journalists you know if political opponents and journalists are being clubbed to keep silent and to not respond then this is not the democracy we know yeah his ex-wife talked about that as being like one of the only moments where she saw him cry for two weeks she's cried afterwards for two weeks he couldn't stop it's crazy Wow it was a crazy time right I mean that that time is very similar in a lot of ways to what's going on today it's just today there's just so much more information and so much more people have so much more of an ability to communicate yeah and I think it's almost easier to coordinate violence I was just talking to the head of the proud boys you know Gavin McInnes is a group um I'm Enrique otário and he's like you know he's he's saying he's using the language of the left he's like I'm a victim I can't buy groceries they've taken my big accounts my platforms but when he talks about violence he's like who the fuck are you and he fell like I'm you know you're a hundred twenty pounds in wet like we have civil war you're gonna lose and I was sitting next to under in the podcast and basically what I said was if we have a civil war you're gonna be hit by sniper fire from the fucking roof you're not going to be in a fistfight with antifa across the way and I think there's this idea on the right that we can push towards violence and we can get very close to it with our rhetoric or with our actions but that it won't spread like the conflagration won't keep going yeah I don't know if that's isolated to the right I mean with India on the left too and that's why I love Thompson was as hard on the left as he was on the right when he wrote that was so important for his intelligence as a writer but I think just even the left and the right in general for a lot of these people is just an identity and a gang that they belong to and I don't think they really understand violence you know you want to talk about violence talk to a military guy you know talk to someone who really understands what violence actually is and they don't have this empty rhetoric like these fools do there's a lot of these people that are calling for violence like you know you should be calling for camaraderie you should be calling for communication we should be calling for some way we could all work this out where the civilians this the civilization that we live in that we are we all can get along together and most people don't want to impede you from living your life and doing what you want to do most people the vast majority hundred also believed in working within the system you know you believe like it might be a fucked up system but you can still run for sheriff in Aspen and you believe once you resort to violence that means the conversation is stopped and it disfigures you so he cried for two weeks that was the most surprising thing for me researching this book and writing it was to see how much the violence affected him that he experienced at Chicago you can speak to someone who's done and I'm a fighting who's been punched in the face as hard as somebody can punch you most Americans haven't had that and that changes your ability to articulate something back in that moment it means you if that's political if it's a police officer or a political opponent that uses violence instead of an argument to respond to you we've left the realm that we recognize and we're not going to be able to communicate even in the limited way that were communicating right now and Thompson do that so that's why after Chicago I loved that he went back to Aspen anything I went to fucking Sheriff you know I'm gonna do a mayoral campaign in Aspen and that was brilliant because it was his way to control his environment knowing that Mayor Daley's not listening to his nonviolent protest Richard Nixon is not listening to his nonviolent protest Thompson needed to find another avenue to try to work within the American system to make things happen and a great contrast is his good friend Oscar Zeta Acosta there's a wonderful PBS documentary eight rise and fall the brown buffalo by on philip rodriguez a great director and it's a kostas life that's who dr. gonzo for infinity and you know Thompson had more advantages than Acosta and Acosta was being Christine by the LAPD was eventually set up by them and for him working within the system he ran for sheriff it wasn't an option the cops set him up for a high-speed bust you know like the cops had the cops had undercover agents from something called the special operations for conspiracy which is a fucking department in the LAPD at the time and they were trying to use those provocateurs to incite violence against the plain clothes please so that or the normal clothes police so that lethal violence could be used to silence a civil rights movement robbery so they used agent provocateurs to make it look like they're a part of the protest yeah there's an age-old tactic that's how you destroy a civil rights movement because the most effective weapon in silencing civil rights is lethal force and you can do that in another country as the US has done but the US can't use tactics like my lie like Thompson writes about this in the US unless you have a provocative reason unless somebody that's undercover attacks a cop and so the cops then like what happened on August 29th 1978 during the moratorium riots can just flood East LA whoever they want they can they blue ribbons hollers Art's head off with the teargas gun Wow yeah those are darker days when you couldn't communicate as well and I think that's one of the reasons why hunter decided to run for sheriff in Aspen is that he felt like he could control that area like it would have a direct impact on his life the local politics have a real impact in your day to day existence whereas what's going on in Washington for the most part it's not affecting you if you live it in Woody Creek yeah I mean there were people that had Nixon's point of view in Aspen who are like let's develop this valley beyond what it can hold in terms of its environment let's imprison hippies because they are going to take away from our tourists on you know economy you know let's you know not have or not adhere to normal like civil rights laws and so Thompson you know in a participatory democracy almost a Jeffersonian democracy way ran for sheriff by emphasizing personal agency and most of all trying to get out the youth vote like people who had left the political system but we're living in Aspen a lot of people who like hippies who had fled the cities in the late 1960s and we're living you know in the West and he got them involved and they should have won the mayor may campaign with Joe Edwards that Thompson was the director of that and they lost by like six votes and when you ran for sheriff it got really bad and he talks about this in fair another thing on the campaign trail later is that a few nights before both parties the Democrats and the Republicans freaked out and so the Democrats said all right we'll kind of throw our weight behind you the Republican Sheriff and then you Republicans will throw your weight for a county manager behind our candidate and so Thompson losing by like two or three hundred votes and so in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas on the campaign trail in 1972 he's at the Nixon campaign Nixon's giving his acceptance speech at the convention Thompson's with the Nixon youth who are about to do a demonstration and he says like you know I'm not a journalist you can't kick me out like I'm a political observer he's like have you ever run for office and then Nixon guy is like no I have you in Thompson's like sheriff and I would have won but the Liberals stuck it to me it was long-haired opponent my London I mean that is a great that debate like so in the book I recreate that debate a lot like because there's transcripts of it that debate is brilliant Thompson is amazing it yeah the guy's like I've only used my gun once in ten years but I like to have it hung it's like well if you've used it once in ten years maybe you don't need it we could try not having it you know and his gun rights views were very complex and changed after Bobby Kennedy's death but he was so intelligent on stage when this sheriff who's like I just want this job real bad like gulping like you know it couldn't this was Visser rated by Thompson yeah you know it's a it's a really interesting the the documentary that follows the campaign and when you get to see him you know heart felon when he loses you got a sense of what that there was real hope back then like that if these guys could do that and what's interesting now is you know back in the 70s they really did have a freak community in Aspen that shit's gone now I don't know what a billionaires have replaced the millionaires place man you go to Aspen you see there's like 20 million-dollar houses and people like it's one of the rare places where people still wear fur coats you know I think not ironically or fake but real fur coat well if you wear a fur coat in LA first of all it's never pulled it off your fur coat but if you did you might get fucked up thrown on you go down you know like you you most likely nothing's gonna happen but there's a possible chance which is really weird because if you wear a leather jacket you have no problem yeah it's weird you know I mean Aspen's weird because a lot of the Thompsons friends like Lauren Jenkins a great journalist they moved down to basalt they had stayed down Valley so I was out there with his um his son Juan Thompson is a fantastic writer he wrote a book called stories I tell myself about his relationship with his father yeah I'm in contact with one through email he's a really good writer and he's a really honest and brilliant writer he seems like a good dude and he seemed like a really good dude in the gonzo documentary as well he's that was a great document yes yeah I'm a big fan of Gibney he he always kills it I am I went to the the tavern and Woody Creek when I wasn't felt like if I'm here we gotta go I gotta go there that was weird it's weird being there man when did you go how long ago was that I just was a year ago you're now dead there were people on bicycles just riding their bikes by the whole time it's on this huge bike route so I was cold as fuck it was the winter we were there for a ski trip so what did you think of it well it's just cool you know it's like there's places you go to where you just you just kind of you know I was with my family they didn't give a fuck my kids have no idea who he is the children here need to know who he is my kids will learn eventually but they're just eating enchiladas yeah but it's just it's to me it you know represented a big part of who he you know this is like this is his home base he came out to San Francisco and there's a picture of me there I think there's a picture of me there on my Instagram I was a special place for him when he was in San Francisco was like being on the central nerve he was there from 64 to 67 and I were 66 and he saw the first Jefferson Airplane concert right next to the matrix he went out every night to like 5:00 a.m. but here's what the Hells Angels that's awesome another respect quite a few margaritas here he could divide his life up look the power you know I've seen the background that freak power the yeah the sheriff's campaign symbol but he moved up wood Creek and he suddenly had you see it in his you see when you interview people that knew him you see it in his letters he had space again and being in the city was hard for him because I write beautifully about the Hells Angels about the countercultural scene he was at war protests in the Free Speech Movement with Mario Savio he was there but it was burning him up you know it was using him up and I think when you went to Woody Creek he learned that all right I can take a plane to Chicago get my ass kicked but I can come back and if I want to have a drink I can go to that tavern or I can go to the Jerome hotel yeah that's a good space and I think that was a good space for him yeah well I think that's a probably a very intelligent move on his behalf and a lot of us I think that are involved in day to day chaos would probably benefit from something somewhere I mean I just don't think he gets enough credit for his effort you know one thing I found when reading the book I interviewed many of you Bob Geiger whom fear loathing is dedicated to and who was a doctor that I was a friend of his in Sonoma and Geiger initially was the one who prescribed him dexedrine and so people think Thompson was just doing acid and writing or whatever and maybe later as a caricature whoever he became that might have been part of his persona but when he was writing from the book of Kennedy's assassination to Nixon's resignation he was working so fucking hard like he was working harder than we can ever imagine Douglas Brinkley is the presidential historian who does his literary estate talks about Thompson wasn't as fun as he seemed during that time he took dexedrine to write and he had a drinking problem this is some sort of an amphetamine in general adderall that's cut differently with salt so it's a little bit like you go a little higher and when it comes down it's a little harder while adderall was Oba trawl which was an old diet drug and then was repurposed in like 96 that is a little bit smoother in that sense but it's very similar to what to what Thompson took he had a great editor named Margaret Harrell who was his editor on Hell's Angels and he didn't know she was 27 when he was 20 or any thought she was like 55 because they would talk on the phone every day to edit the book and he sent her she still has the letter I've done some events with her she still has the actual letter he sent her a five milligram dexedrine he's like hey it's going to be hard the last just edit take this in focus so she still has it this orange little five milligram dexedrine for 4050 years she's that's crazy yeah the that Gibney documentary is really fantastic it's probably one of the best introductions that anybody could have to try to get a grip on why after all these years hunter resonates with so many people I mean I think that the give me documentary is brilliantly and perfectly done I think that Thompson means something different with Donald Trump as president of the United States to me you people could see before give me sought before other like brilliant writers saw before Taibbi did but when Donald Trump became president of the United States it was a lens onto the past I felt like and you know I was a I mean I'm a bitch-ass liberal like I was fuckin upset and so one of the ways I dealt with it was to just remove myself to 1968 1967 1969 and I took the emotion I had in the present and I realized that Thompson is such a voice right now for people that maybe don't know him only know him through Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Terry Gilliam's film mm-hmm I would like freaking dude to be a lens that now if they read that they could then read his work in perhaps you know what his timelessness will come through it was more it was an attempt to focus that timelessness and that what helped was the fucking terror of our present yeah you can see the definitely see the parallels and in his work you know who also rings true like that is a lot of Bill Hicks stuff on the first Gulf War you know and and Bush as a president and you know which obviously people today would probably be dying to have Bush as president you know he carried his book around for two weeks at least he carried a book well Herbert Walker the main the older Bush was uh you know much more of a reasonable gentleman you know yeah well that's our discourse today to where there couldn't be anything said reasonably about him when he passed away or even in his life I mean I think it's not he's not very favorable right now but one of the Hunter Thompson's main influences was Norman Mailer I don't think Norman Mailer writes well about women you know I think that's I think Thompson wrote better about women Thompson didn't just what's rebus is amilia with well mailer whenever he writes about a woman it's like he's watching the sunette get off the Nixon airplane he's like there were 33 redheads like five had long legs like this like - it's like male you didn't need to write that fucking passage you're writing about power and people more extreme than you so I think Mila writes beautifully about men that have more power than him and so he writes about 1968 in Chicago where Thompson didn't because Thompson was beat up and he writes about that moment of where Thompson's being beat up I'm confuse him of the way he's writing about women just he's describing them physically the male gaze is that he will he stabbed his wife he stabbed his wife in the heart did he really yeah with the pen knife what yeah he went to Velva night he went to Bellevue for 14 days it was the 1960s it he missed it yeah I know he went to he did a psychiatrist i key at revaluation instead of going to jail well I think they stayed married yeah what a reasonable lady yeah gender politics later but I would say that Thompson wrote well better about women because he understood that writing about people with more power than you was really important and when a male there writes about people with more power than him when he writes about mayor Daly beating the shit out of everybody he writes really beautifully and that's somebody that's resonating right now with what Trump's doing with the violence that we're seeing on the right and on the Left where Mahler was sitting with Pat Buchanan who was Nixon's main aide in during that moment in Chicago when the Haymarket in shattered and everybody was beat up and they were looking down from the 17th floor and mailers thinking like well this is what happens if police take over Society and he writes beautifully about how the police came and split the protesters because he's so high up writing in Hortis and Buchanan would write later like I knew that Nixon was going to be President of the United States because of fucking Hubert Humphrey that gutless old Ward Heeler can't control his own convention and his own party how is he going to be able to run the country and so as soon as Chicago's violence erupted the Nixon campaign knew they'd won the election Bobby cannon it's really interesting because even though hunter would shit on him papica it was actually a fan they drank they did a water gate like they sat there and went deep like all night but he definitely Hunter definitely shit on him oh he's shit on them hard I began to shit back on him hard now the first night they met was at the Nixon at the at the Holiday Inn in 1968 in New Hampshire during Nixon's comeback campaign and Thompson walks in and petty candy goes who's this damn guy with the damn ski jacket walking through our goddamn Lobby and talks it's like I have a press pass like I'm here to do this and so they like have this big moment and then later on that night Thompson goes to a party with campaign people and with Buckhannon and he brings a big bottle of Wild Turkey and so began as a young journalist at the time he worked at the st. Louis post-dispatch I think he'd gone to the Columbia Journalism school he's working for Nixon as his main policy guy he looks at Thomas he's like that's the fucking the ski oh you got a bottle of what oh if you got a file at Old Crow like no will drink that and so they stayed up all night they talked about the Vietnam War and Thompson you know talked about how it just figures us to be in a foreign war that's unjust and it destroys our democratic ideals to be doing that and Buchanan was like containment nuclear war we're trying to get out of it and they listen to each other till dawn like that first night that they met now what was your idea behind writing this book like what would compelled you I think we've mistaken Thompson I think that we see him more as like a doonesbury character I mean people who know him really well don't but I think that most people through whatever cultural forces that we've had well he's a boys because a lot of people don't know the comparison what the doonesbury so I think in the 80s are seventies eighties 90s the cartoon doonesbury by Gary Trudeau it became there was a character on it called Uncle Duke an Uncle Duke was based on Hunter Thompson and he was kind of an exaggerated version of Hunter Thompson he was a cartoonish version of Hunter s Thompson and I think Terry Gilliam did a wonderful and kind of authoress job on like a brilliant job on fear loathing in las vegas but that's also an exaggerated version right Hunter Thompson and we forget today the amount of work Hunter Thompson did the effort he put out we forget that he was a straight journalist where he did the freelance assignments he wrote the straight articles for years to make money for his family and it wasn't until he had his breakthrough with Hell's Angels that he could develop the style that we identify with today and so it kills me that we identify him more as a clown or like you know more as a cartoonish figure as opposed to a very serious political thinker political activist and serious writer who can give us insight into fucking shit show we experience every moment today well I think the the perception of him is fairly nuanced I don't think that everybody thinks of him as a cartoon character although particularly later on this life he was relegated to that because he really didn't speak well you know later on in his life and he was just the drugs taken over alcohol and his son writes about the alcohol one read so beautifully about the total alcoholism took on Hunter nest Thompson we couldn't talk anymore I mean when he was deep into his 60s his heart wasn't it was so hard to even understand him there's a awful piece that he did with Conan O'Brien or Conan went to Woody Creek and shotguns off the back porch with him and you could barely understand a fucking word hunter saying that's why I tried to end it with Nixon leaving because it was really sad when Nixon resigned Hunter Thompson was at the Connecticut Hilton which is a hotel right by the White House any Leibowitz on the photographer with Rolling Stone was calling him and saying we need to get to the White House Nixon is a leaving like he's gonna get on a helicopter and Thompson just laid in the grass and he didn't go you know and that was heartbreaking and he didn't end up writing the a page spread that he needed to instead it became any liebowitzes photography which was a famous and in retrospect like huge move for her career but I think that that pain right there of thinking that he'd spent 10 years I mean he hated Nixon since the checkers speech you know when Nixon was a VP for Eisenhower he hated Nixon since 1962 when Nixon lost the California Governor ship and said you in the press you'd be giving me the shaft for so long like you won't have dick Nixon to kick around anymore like Thompson had seen that Nixon was somebody who said I'm just the poor son of a butcher I'm just this like very hard-working you know American that represents all of us we're behind that like he was a politically you know ravenous monster who was anti-communist who would go to any extent to win and Thompson saw that and Thompson knew that other people saw in in 1964 the Barry Goldwater convention in San Francisco my favorite li named arena of all time the cow Barry Goldwater was gonna speak to accept the nomination and what happened was Nixon was introducing him it was Nixon's way back from the wilderness Thompson was a few rows back for the first time Thompson I think was that close to see him live and because like you know I'm poor son of a butcher don't think about me just think about Barry Goldwater mr. conservative he'll become mr. president and Thompson was like fuck everybody here knows he's lying but they think that that act of lying is a skill and the way a used car salesman who lies but he making a lot of money off it was Gil for the way that Trump by selling steaks to people and then they go bankrupt and he gets rich that's an American skill and Thompson sense that from the start with Nixon and so I think he battled against Nixon for a decade for a lot of years and when Nixon left I think he felt spent and so I tried not to focus on the later you know I ended then in 74 because I think it it's he wrote some beautiful things afterwards he was still aggressively he definitely had some moments where he decided to not do the assignment that he was supposed to do and it was kind of sad like the ali/foreman fight fucking floated in the pool yeah float in the pool with a Nixon mask on flew all the way to Africa I miss one of the greatest sportsman moments it was like Game six of you know you know the Boston Red Sox versus the Reds I think Ollie was something different to people than I think it's I don't think we have someone like that today so it's very difficult for us to understand people today look at ollie and they go oh he was a heavyweight boxing champion he was way more than that he was a cultural figure that represented the resistance to the Vietnam War and represented it with the biggest loss that any public figure had ever shown and willingly gave up three years of his career in his prime from age 27 to 30 from 1967 from the Cleveland big cat Williams fight he didn't fight again for three years he didn't train he didn't do anything they kept him from his career why when he was in his prime when he was the best heavyweight of all time and he spoke publicly and often and he was fucking hated all over the country but he represented something different like my parents were hippies and when I was a little kid he lost to Leon spanks and the rematch was on television my parents never watched TV and they definitely never watched boxing and they sat in front of that TV to watch that I remember thinking I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match like this is crazy it was probably like I don't know maybe eight or nine years old or something at the time and I just remember thinking I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match and that's really when it sunk in to me at a really early age that this guy was not just this heavyweight boxer he was he was a cultural icon he was a historical figure he meant he meant a lot into Hunter he meant a lot he meant something something much bigger than just just a boxer and so Hunter thought he was going to a death sentence George Foreman had crushed Joe Frazier he crushed everybody I mean he was so powerful George Foreman to this day is one of the all-time scariest heavyweights of all time with without a doubt he he could hit so fucking hard and literally pick guys off their feet he hit Joe Frazier and lifted him off his feet with a punch and everybody was convinced that that was gonna happen to Holly that Ali had been past its prime and look just look at what George Foreman had done to Joe Frazier what is he gonna do to Muhammad Ali and I only just rope-a-dope him until he got tired and then fucked him up in front of the whole world that's one of the greatest athletic moments I mean we forget that athletes others like Curt Flood you know they risked losing weight Curt Flood was the American baseball player who challenged the reserve clause because baseball you weren't allowed to get free agency for another team and Curt Flood was this great player and he was like I'm gonna sit out and I'm gonna wait athletes like Colin Kaepernick they've sacrificed a career it's not the same with Muhammad Ali who was like Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds and like everybody combined at that one moment Ryan but he was risking it's the opposite of Trump Trump used his celebrity to become this even more mangled version of himself and get more power well he used his celebrity to speak for his virtue and his value and his beliefs and sat like Thompson was really good at understanding what people sacrifice you know people have to give up the wager you know between what that act will be what the results will be they may be later but he knew that and so his respect for Olli from giving up those years of his prime you know was was enduring he keep Thompson came back from that fight and he gave his son um one boxing gloves that or Alize boxing gloves Wow yeah it's a very very unfortunate that he missed that fight because it would been fascinating to hear his take on under me I'm sure he would have been so moved when he saw Ali win but it wasn't I mean that's a good point it wasn't ticket evoke the stress and the pressure that the last decade covering Nixon had taken out on him well there's a little bit of that but let's be honest he was also kind of a fuckup I mean when he was writing for Rolling Stone and they gave him that that early fax Joe yeah and he would fuck that thing up he would unplug it and plug it back in he would do it just so he could go to the bar and say this thing doesn't work but that was the end I think of his arc where he was still on point he was still playing the role of a serious journalist and he would use that persona as a fuck up and there's letters by yonghwan or being like you cannot turn in your articles three hours before we go to press I know you made it this doesn't fucking work and so he was beginning to break down then he was also I think on the tail end of his decade of being a journalist who had met every deadline so that he could fucking feed his family and he could afford our farm like there were there's moments where before he got the contract for Hells Angels in 1965 he was ready to be like a longshoreman he was going and looking for work in the mornings in San Francisco you know to try to support his family he was willing to give up writing and instead that article blew up and he wrote all these beautiful letters began to arrive at 319 Parnassus he lived at UM at the hot top of the Haight Ashbury in on San Francisco hmm and you know that opened up his chance to continue being a writer but money was the main motivating factor and so I think once money like unfurled once alcoholism I think took its toll and once he couldn't walk around anymore at a political convention without people just like grabbing his shoulder and saying you're Hunter Thompson or unless that happened I think things began to change yeah that's one of the things that he talked about that I thought was really interesting that he became a part of the story it wasn't just that he was covering stories he couldn't be anonymous anymore he was in many cases more famous than the people that he was covering yeah you know like when he would go to meet Knicks and all Nick Nixon Secret Service agents wanted to meet them and they wanted to get an autograph from him and shake his hand and it was just too weird everything they got and then there's the alcoholism that alcoholism look it it's a depressant it wrecks you and if you read you know we me and Greg Fitzsimmons on a podcast once read off that one journalist who had detailed hunters daily routine yeah and so we read the daily routine and they put a techno beat to it it's fucking hilarious that was that's a set those are so it's so funny because those seem funny you know now but they're they're kind of a death knell like I mean that that daily routine that was the the biography hunter it was in that and it's just it's heartbreaking I mean we got to remember that the dedication to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was he who makes a beast of himself gets rid the pain you know man and I think the world was painful for Hunter Thompson he was people to see powerful people abused the weak you know and like take what they wanted brazenly without being held accountable I think was hard to deal with shitty editors who cut half your fucking essay on Nixon or half your story it made it into something that had nothing to do with the effort that you put out yeah you know I think it's hard to pay your bills and you know live the way that you wanted to live and I think a lot of that gets undermined I I just want people to realize how much effort he put out especially during those years where he was like all right I want to be a great journalist I want to have a voice in our society I want to participate in our national conversation my only path towards that is to work harder than everybody else maybe it places when things happen when they matter and he sacrificed a lot for that but he was there and he's a voice in a light that we can have in this moment which is another troubling moment in American history yeah his voice was very unique too and that he decided to combine fiction with nonfiction in a very weird blurry way I think it was so one thing I think of is he usually gives you a cue or what he did was he dramatized people didn't dramatize oh wait a minute he made shit up he didn't just drama there's a rich doctor I didn't say that there he did able gate I said there was this is about Ed Muskies campaign I said there was a rumor in Milwaukee that he did it again I started there yeah I mean that's what he says but when we said that on a Dick Cavett show yeah later and I think Matt Taibbi on this show talked about it well where one thing is that muskie was already out of the campaign when that came out must get already lost and so muskie had been a fucking monster and a terrible person on that campaign and so Thompson used that version of muskie and wrote as Taibbi said in a very straight way that it became story and so if you had a sense irony you kind of knew like you're not really thinking that this is a guy who did able gain so I think there's cues in there for a listening audience but what I think is even more you know what I think he dramatized the way other people didn't he would say I look left I look up I see he came down to me and then he said people didn't write like that in journalism they didn't go step by step and he did and that was really important what I think is more important than the Iligan story so the emmagan story in the background is Ed muskie was the frontrunner for the Democratic primary in 1972 he fucked up his campaign afterwards Thompson talked about how he had heard that there there was a rumor that this candidate was doing it began which is like ayahuasca or well though he said that they know it's not like ayahuasca it's not no it's very different elusive Ettore it's a self-exam Ettore but he said they brought in a Brazilian witch doctor yeah yes it's a gain is not even a Brazilian drug from Africa is this something I got it but what I think people don't remember is before that and this affected the election and on February of 1972 Thompson was in Florida he was on something called the Sunshine special it was a whistle-stop tour that muskie the front-runner had a good chance to beat Nixon poll numbers wise was going all the way down the Florida peninsula on to try to win the Florida primary and Thompson was like this is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen like at every stop muskie gave the same shit speech it's like somebody should be a president namely me and it was repeated the reporters were like fuckin this is terrible muskie was secluded in the back of the car he didn't interact with anybody they had his political operatives come out and make everybody like seeing the song like about like muskie like sunshine in his hands the whole world in his hands it was terrible and so that night Tom pulled into a Florida town it was a second less stop and he in this young political reporter named Monty Chitty we're going to get a drink at 2:00 a.m. and this guy walks into the lobby he's like 6 6 250 Peter shared it and he he walks in and he he says he's looking for the muskie campaign all these different things he ends up going out with Hunter Thompson for a drink and Hunter Thompson finds out that Peter Sheridan had been a good friend of Jerry Garcia had hung out with the Hells Angels in California had been de la Honda where Ken Kesey was and was actually a pretty smart guy who was out of his mind in his mid-20s they stayed out and drank all night at the end of the night Thompson's like so what are you doing tomorrow were you going and Peter Sharon was like wow I'm going to Miami and Thompson's like we are too you don't have to hitchhike fuck that and so there's a really good journalist outlaw it's called outlaw journalist by Bill Makena another Thomson biography talked about how Thompson took his Thompson took his Press Pass put it into the elevator press the button sent the press passed down to the ground floor Peter Sheridan got it so Peter Sheridan could ride for free on the Sunshine Express down to Miami the next day so Thompson oversleeps because the fucking muskie campaign doesn't like him anyways instead Peter Sheridan gets on the Sunshine Express with a hundred Thompson press badge and Peter Sheridan goes on to order 12 martinis and he goes give me a like a triple gin bucks and hold the book and he runs up and down the car and you know muskie has been a really shitty candidate at this point he's not been engaging people he got in this weird fight I'm with his wife at a um a campaign event where they like put cake in each other's face and it's been really weird and people aren't reporting on it like other reporters aren't saying Muskies unstable and so muskie at the end of this Whistlestop he spent all his campaign money to go up and down and try to do this Whistlestop like tour he gives the speech at the caboose and jerry rubin and the anti-war activist who was one of the Chicago seven um and was it has come to heckle him is in the crowd and he's saying a muskie so why did you support the Vietnam War in 1968 like who do you think you are and so muskies yelling at Jerry Rubin he's saying young man keep your mouth shut beneath muskie reaching up from the bottom of the caboose Peter Sheridan is holding a gin bottle and grabbing at Muskies leg as muskie tries to give this speech and then muskie falls back and the whole thing ends like the whole press conference is over like Women's Wear Daily reported this and it came out that Hunter Thompson had had 13 martinis and run up and down the train and had interfered with it and muskies campaign really believed that Thompson was working with Donald Segretti and Nixon's creep Watergate crew to fuckup Muskies campaign and that actually changed the course it like Thompson helped expose how fucked up muskie was as a candidate at that time and Thompson had never forgiven muskie for being on the probe yet non-war platform at the 1968 convention and so we talked about the ibogaine aspect of changing the campaign but that report and the way that disseminated through media the way it was picked up by other newspapers really did help change the people's perception of Ed muskie at Big Ed muskie as Thompson called him at the time now he when he wrote Hell's Angels he hadn't really totally formulated that sort of gonzo style of journalism but he did have a little bit of fiction mixed in with that and that sort of ran him a foul of the hell a Hells Angels they were very upset by that right like he did write some things in there that they claimed or not accurate I think that when it came to Hells Angels what Thompson did really well was what Joan Didion did really well he took the way the media was portraying somebody and he stripped that off and said this is who they actually are this is what they're actually doing Joan Didion when she writes about Jim Morrison and the White Album she's like Jim Morrison was like sex and death in his leather pants was the best thing ever everybody loves Jim Morrison and then in the scene in the White Album Joan Didion writes about how they sit at a recording studio for two hours and nobody says anything and they thought of a paper bag and it's a fucking nightmare Thompson knew that the media was sensationalizing the Hells Angels he went to them on a cold night in San Francisco down by the waterfront and he said hey here's a Newsweek article here's a time article here's how everybody's writing about you all I want to do is write the truth about who you are and he did and he ended up writing with them and he ended up speaking about them I don't think they got as mad at him about the way he portrayed them I think they got mad that he began to make money or that he became famous Hells Angels five hundred thousand paperback copies that is almost impossible to imagine today five hundred thousand paperback copies of a literary book and the angels were pissed off about that they felt Thompson owed him more money or owed him something for that did he get it at all did he give them any more Sonny Barger Sonny Barger so ridiculously Barger said he owed us a keg and he didn't give us a cake that's it you know and the the famous story at the end of it is that that it I mean really like when they go through it what he said that he said that Thompson was doing this objective version of us but it was at least close to them the shitty Newsweek and time versions right and so Thompson at the end of he'd finished the book barely made the deadline had to go down to a hotel in Monterey lock himself in state for a hundred hours straight and write it in March of a 67 to finish it so it turns it in makes his um advance deadline in September they're like here's our author photo and it's shitty he's like fuck this so he goes to a Hells Angels rally he doesn't know anybody because he hasn't been with him for six or seven months he's taking pictures that's when he got beat up I'm learning about the Hells Angels and he tiny his friend who later committed suicide after Altamont after being involved in the Altamont security situation that's the rolling stone one where the youngest yes where Meredith hunter was stabbed but tiny it was a woman that got stabbed man Meredith honor Oh was a man named Meredith I was back in the day where you can name your kids Meredith right like Marion Marion's another one Lindsey Lindsey some guys were Lindsey give me one Jamie oh yeah but Jamie's normal well if there's a lot of Jamie's that future man scene where it's like it what's his name is like my name is Susan in the future men are named Susan I know it's a girl's name in your time by her Edith is a weird one though you must hate your fucking son of a plan but lose an argument with your boy that but that I lost a lot are but that poor guy was but Thompson was there and tiny grabbed him after he was beat up there was a guy holding a rock to drop it on Thompson with the Hells Angels mm-hmm tiny was like alright I know him I know the rest of you don't and he grabbed him out and tiny was this like enormous Hells Angel who had been you know Thompson was very good at empathetically understanding their flaws and their perspectives he'd never I think made excuses for me said that their inherent perspective is fascistic he writes that you know he says they used violence to respond to where they were in society their idea of total retaliation the Hells Angels or any offense like looking at you funny or being like dude you drink it could be met with everybody beating you up because they got to determine the they got the Hells Angels got to determine the offense like that was fascism to tell them and he wrote beautifully about their reliance on violence because he they felt the Hells Angels they had been left behind by our moderated society like there's technology there's all these new jobs if you came back from the war in 1950 you had a chance in Oakland to have a middle-class life in a beautiful house in work the rest of your days and have a family that will then go on but by 1965 that was no longer an option and the angels were a violent response to that very similar what we're seeing now and so the way he wrote about the Hells Angels so he similar the way that we see violence within groups that are supporting Trump you know Anna left and the right did he ever wind up resolving his differences with the Hells Angels I think so Sonny Barger how they nose got fucked like rightly so the Hells Angels were you know pursued like a mob like a like a mafia group people went to jail Sonny Barger went to jail I think they at the end appreciated his representation of them because it was better than any other one right there's no better representation of the health ain't no more sympathetic for sure yeah are just no more accurate don't wonder straight yeah no more like again I gets to Thompson's effort if you ride for six months with somebody mm-hmm and you're an honest like putting up your hands you're not trying to fit what you see into a thesis you're doing the opposite trying to look at the reality you have in front of you and then form an argument out of that yeah go here that's what Thompson's gift was and very dangerous to to do that I mean I mean he did get beat up taking those folks I was really bad motorcycle accident with his friend on the Pakistan broke his leg like it was sort up that's why he left like get the fuck out of San Francisco yeah Reese looks amazing like temperatures amazing it's a it's a fire that you're putting your hand on - how did it burn - he was coming down it was mayor of Richmond he was coming down a slick road and they had hit like something was wet or an oil thing and it went out the back tire so Thompson rolled it was fine but his friend's knee hit railroad tracks so his friends need rope really badly it was the mayor it was the mayor of Richmond and that's continued riding motorcycles though I yeah he did he would get an accidents at what he Creek he was pretty careful like so I love that scene in Hell's Angels I don't know if readers our listeners know this but the edge you know and that's a major part of the book where Thompson's fighting with his wife Thompson's finished his book but he's breaking down because he worked so hard to do it and so he takes his BSA out and he goes if you know San Francisco he goes out to the park he hits the Coast Highway and he comes down it and he's like I'm so overwhelmed everything is so fucking terrible he's going as fast as he can and he talks about how his eyes begin to lose moisture you know the scene like it's this beautiful scene he's looking for sand pits because he hit a sand pit near the zoo you're fucking done yeah and he gets all the way to Rockaway Beach which is in like halfway down to Santa Cruz and he turns around and what he talks about is when he's at a hundred miles per hour I think he was near death if he was really overwhelmed he says um you know the edge the only people that know it are the people that have gone over the rest the living don't have any understanding of it you know all we can do is approach it in this way and it's this beautiful end it's called midnight on the coast highway it was a solid eyes did Tom Wolfe you know and yes beautiful so he comes back and he sits at his desk and so he he had a view of the Bay Bridge he could see its two flashing lights the whole time and he had broken the window in a terrible fight with his wife like three weeks earlier and so he sits the broken window and he writes out that scene right away with his eyes still scoured wasn't the broken window when she wouldn't give him a gun because he was on acid and he threw a shoe through the window there's three there's three versions so I do it and then I give the three versions of the notes so I go with the three versions that I've heard like I heard it from jazz car you know she wrote I really respect sandy like deeply she wrote at the a few years ago she said I'm done giving interviews what about Thompson that was my life that was then she's given so many interviews up to this yeah good versus that that exist and so I wanted to respect that didn't we do more than anything and just use the information that had you know and let the reader know yo here at three other versions here's the best version I could make dramatized look left throw do this did you talk to Anita um Anita's been great I had to talk to Anita later but the book ended so early that I did there's a beautiful our need as a second wife or home yeah Anita Thompson is um she runs Alf Arne she runs kind of his legacy she does the Facebook page she does a wonderful job but what is our farm today did she still live up there if she's gonna make it into it like a writer's retreat she's doing a wonderful job making it into our writers retreat and also a like a museum and it's taken a while but to honor his legacy as a great political like thinker and writer like a great literary light but since she didn't meet him till the 90s I wanted to focus on the time that I was in and so I I think talking to Bob Geiger you know his friend then was close I was really lucky Bob Tigers in his late 80s mm-hmm he was able to go through like because I had I believe if you interview somebody you need to read everything that exists already you know you need to read everything they've already said you don't want to ask them questions that would I do interview for research that they've already supplied answers to yeah so this bob guy here I could see the holes or things I didn't know and I was able to sit with him talk about throwing a football with Thompson you know talk about taking the dog to the beach like all these other things that's the football thing is an interesting thing he was obsessed with football and that's one thing that he shared in common with Nixon and so when they went one time they were going to the airport and he hitched a ride with Nixon and Nixon wanted to talk to him about football he said let's just not talk about politics when we talk about football and so he taught my favorite the whole side it was it was a 1968 Pat Buchanan had help set it up it out that week they'd become friends and so they come to Thompson like all right the boss is gonna take a plane to Florida you can come and talk to him and so later Thompson said later was like they told me not to talk about any about football but earlier Thompson said like I was just really awkward like this fucking guy they're both in the back bench of a mercury and so it's before Secret Service so it's just a cop driving and it's like Pappy Canon in the front and it's Tom so then Nixon in the here next to each other and Thompson's like well you know earlier in the night you'd said that you know the Oakland Raiders had a good shot to beat the Packers in Super Bowl - can you talk about that and he was like NYX is like my good friend Vince Lombardi had told me to watch out for the AFL because they pass they can be very effective and so Thompson then like remembers that guy Bob Geiger had been a professional quarterback he had taken Thompson to his first football game and Thompson said NFL is better than the AFL and Giger's like shut the fuck up let's go to a Raiders game and they went in 65 and the Raiders won on this beautiful pass Tom Flores a beautiful goal line pass and Nixon was saying the same thing and so then at that moment at that moment Thompson's like oh yeah it was the Miami guy Miller Miller who'd caught the pass and Nixon goes taps him on the knee and Gus you're right and goes oh what a beautiful moment it tops it's just like what the fuck is going on so Nixon apparently they were talking about like college draft picks and all kinds of crazy shit like Nixon was deep into it it was the only moment Thompson said that he knew Nixon wasn't lying I could talk about football and that in that instant it's fascinating what people they're so diametrically opposed to each other but they find common ground Thompson did a great job of that and I think we've lost it today I mean you have to listen to the other side too if you if you politically want to beat somebody like Pappy cannon you want to defeat his tactics if you want to defeat him you need to know how he's thinking of what he's doing Thompson knew that bikina was listening to the left to defeat them I saw Thompson listen to P Keenan what led him to move to Colorado oh he was losing his shit in San Francisco it was that night on the fucking motorcycle well I mean but how did he choose Colorado so this is a great story and like the early 60s Thompson had had a chance to drive I don't know some sort of cargo I got friend's car out to Colorado on his way to San Francisco in 1960 he ended up doing a road trip up and down San Francisco after he passed through Colorado but he stopped in Colorado because he had to drop off a friend's car and there was a woman there Peggy Clifford who was a journalist and was his good friend at the Aspen I'm Daily Times and she was older she saw him like after driving 20 hours she's like hey come on my house hangout she lived right in Aspen and Woody Creek and so then in 1963 after sandy was pregnant Thompson came back from South America where he was a reporter and did a wonderful job like reporting on how democracies were falling apart down there him and sandy wanted to move West because the National observer was the newspaper Thompson worked for they wanted to give Thompson a position to be a Western reporter he was thinking of one in San Francisco but instead he chose to stop first where Peggy Clifford was were stopped in Aspen and Woody Creek and so he was living in announcement and what he Creek from August of 1963 to February of 1963 and he was there this is where freaking them begins he was there when John F Kennedy was assassinated and he's sitting in his like living room it's you know 10:00 a.m. 11:00 a.m. Pacific time he gets a knock on the door and it's this Rancher named Wayne Wagner which is an old Aspen family and that ranch is like the president has been shot like what's more he's been murdered he's dead Thompson just like let's how to sob then he begins to fucking swear and then he fucking calms down and he goes downtown I'm Morty Creek he goes to Aspen and he just gets notes from people what their responses are and so when he then went to San Francisco to become the correspondent for for the magazine that he was working for he was having a tough time he was already wanting to flee because he got Hells Angels he was able to stay in San Francisco longer write report on them by 1966-67 he was like this city is not a good place from he has a great quote about like what would have happened if he stayed in the San Francisco from c7.r he's like no it burned up I would have been a mole ated right there yeah so when it was time to leave he thought again of Woody Creek and of Aspen which was so different then than it is now and that was a place that he decided to move in rent for a little while at first but then because of the success of Hells Angels he was able to buy our farm mm-hmm Aspen is very different but Woody Creek is not that much different Woody Creek is still pretty it's great basalt Morty creeks are great yeah there's a great this place called the temporary they did an event with one Thompson and I like did a reading at it and like a lot of Thompson's friends were there so I'm like I'm some fucking young I got I didn't know Thompson like I'm an interloper you know like I'm out there and it was really great to talk to everybody that knew him and to go through it and that's why I that's why this book almost killed me because I did a note for every sound cell our site or comment like if I wrote and then at the moment Thompson felt what the fuck am I doing here I had the quote where he said I looked around then and I felt what the fuck am I doing here and I had that in the notes so people could see it and it was because I wanted those people that knew him well and respected him and trusted him to not think that I was in any way trying anything but to make good art off of his life and who he was trying to respond to my fucking view of Trump right now and my love of his work in this moment um why do you say it almost killed you it's not possible to write a narrative and then also cite every detail of the narrative so each day I would spend nine hours researching and outlining with citations every wanted to write like a novel I wanted to be like you know and at that moment I felt like I nice the Machine oil from the bay was coming off I wanted to read it vividly mm-hmm I knew that I had to support all of that and so I would spend eight or nine hours every day just on the pure arrangement in research and then for the next six or seven hours or eight hours I would write the narrative and then I'd sleep for five or six hours you know I'd get up and I would do it again and I did this for four or five months you know after I was deeply into it and I don't think that's sustainable I think it's better in retrospect to go and report somewhere you know to like go and be in the middle of Congress and take notes but to try to write something with the dramatized nature that I think Thompson wrote well and having my prose having nothing like his you know I wanted my prose to sound nothing like the way he wrote but then to also have almost as many pages of notes showing my work you know like showing the math that went behind so if I'm wrong I'm wrong but at least you can see it I think that was morally correct but I think that was too much effort when it comes just because you were trying to do it in a short period of time did you have a crazy deadline or something yes but I also had a year and so you know and I had a family and I had a professor like I just I'd never when it came to writing had to do both those things which was to try to write in a in a novelistic way but then to also make sure that any question the reader would have but like why did you think that the dinner was at 5:00 p.m. you know or like you know why why did you think the Sun was coming up in this way at this moment to make sure cuz out of respect because what Thompson talked about was people making money off I'm like doonesbury yeah you know like that's what he talked about was people trying to make money on phone and if I was gonna write this book it could have it couldn't be in that space didn't he have a lawsuit against Gary Trudeau he thought about it I think though I don't I ever did it he talked about a public yeah and he was just well that he became that guy unfortunately that's what's really weird what happens become a caricature of ourselves it's really scary do you know um well it it's what's weird about it is that he kind of knew that it was happening like there's that famous interview where he's talking to that British guy who did a documentary about him breakfast with hunter maybe or no but yeah one of them yeah one of them but he's he's rolling a joint on the grass somewhere with that Las Vegas visor on and he's you know talking about how he's really become this caricature and it would be actually be better if he wasn't alive anymore you know then he's breaking up with his wife during that it was really sad there's a scene in that where he hides where he's at like a parking lot he doesn't want people to see him and he's standing against the wall and people like come on we got to go he's like I just don't want anybody to see me right now it was really sad and then I I tried to take that tragedy - and he wrote great things afterwards he was a great friend of people after his like Ron White had this wonderful poet from Louisville was a dear friend of his like all through his life but the tragedy of how much effort he put out - if we want to write about Trump if you want to go after like Taibbi did about the financial institution the way Thompson did it was to kind of wager time later for time now and he talks about that he says you mean by the chemical speed he says doing dexedrine being an alcoholic instead of changing his life and his rhythms he said I'm wagering time later for time now I'm using up energy or things that I might have by burning the candles so brightly at this instant because I believe I need to go after these moments and I later I'm not going to have it but I'm making that gamble I'm putting the card down right and I think that's terrifying and I also think that he gave us brilliant writing over one of the most remarkable spans in American history because of it that's a weird tradition and journalism right destroy your body while creating your art and I think there's a according to my friends with journalists there's a big problem with adderall today and there's a lot of people that are using it to write and it's fucking speed and you know you get addicted I mean adderall makes everything in front of you closer have you done it yeah so my first book was called hyper my personal history of ADHD so was about being medicated as a child you were medicated yeah I like having pills forced out my throat like also olya six when I took weirdal in for the first time and I had I had a suicidal moment and like six years old Wow the first time you were six you wanted to commit suicide I held like a butter knife to my wrist I don't remember it but yeah I kind of remember it but yeah it was on ritalin which I've taken now as an adult and I always feel startled when I'm on it if I ever take a Ritalin now why do you like no I I take it - right like this world is incredibly painful so I take out a role now and I take it - how often - yeah every day I take like 30 milligrams a day really and I take it - I take it to go into a library and this is what David Wallace wells was talking about I think like two days ago on the show was how do you read really shitty academic articles where you need the information from them I'm not good at that I'm not good at even making like a car reservation you know like a car rental reservation and so this world's going to be painful no matter what but there's a functionality that adderall allows and it's always a wager or Thompson writes about is whenever something is given something else is lost you never get anything for free in this world Thompson understood that better than anybody so with him with dexedrine I'm not gonna say Thomson was hyperactive I'm not gonna go into that but dexedrine like Geiger was like yo you're breaking down like you're 26 you have a wife you have a very small child you're writing right now you want to have your career go forward you're not doing well he Geiger was like I'm a doctor I I had gone through med school you know I did it I'd been overwhelmed like you got ran every morning you know he did he did other things but he took dexedrine so he gave it to Thompson and for that small period of time it helped I mean for me it's like I I I'm not a good researcher and maybe I would be now but the only way I can write about something like hydros Thompson where I didn't know him I have no experience with him is to read everything that he's ever written or been written about him and then go out and interview people and so effort is my only path forward and what a Darrell helps for me is to take the pain away of that effort but it doesn't take it away it shifts it around to other aspects in other parts of life and I think Thompson when he wrote he who makes a beast so himself escapes the pain or gets hurt the pain at Bingham man we don't listen that like he was like this effort is hard he's like I'm struggling with this effort I'm trying to make these beautiful things I always think a James Salter fiction writer aspen resident wrote beautiful novels he wrote his whole life till he was 90 his last novel was at 87 he wrote a memoir at 76 about being a fighter pilot among other things in the Korean War lyric literary he did it his whole life he didn't he didn't burn out for a small period of time he's the antonym to Thompson I think when it comes to effort and literary work right um do you just take it for work yeah I mean you don't have like an issue that you need to take it for oh my I mean where we were I think that well whenever we have something like chemical speed whenever we have something like alcohol whenever we have something that's not like marijuana where at least marijuana cuts your mania you know like whenever we have something else like alcohol or adderall we need to ask a question or is it is taking the pain away and being productive through those actually hastening your own doom and I think with alcohol is very clear it is adderall it's more complex I think if you do an amount of time release you can make it work how many Americans do that out of the percent that are prescribed you know I don't know 10% 20% like it's dangerous how often you take time off I'd say maybe one or two weeks of every three or four months and when you do that do you feel weird no I just watch movies you think I just don't do anything it doesn't don't have any productivity I don't I don't wanna reduce so the only way you produce is on speed the only way I produce the way I want to right now is on speed I didn't start taking it till I'm 2010 dude it's crazy that we're talking about this because there's so many people like you it's um it's so common how much of the work that we enjoy today especially literary work is written by people journalistic work is written by people that are on speed that's not new I mean that's what Thompson and Burroughs and southern like this has been I believe that our American society the situation I'm in I have created a situation where I have too much work and it's my fault I should not be trying to be a professor and also go report at college and also at George Mason in the creative writing program you know and also then be hosting like people coming out and also then like be trying to research something that might be my next thing that's too much and the way Thompson saw dexedrine was that he could make reality match his effort so there was no longer the limit it was the American Dream idea it must put out enough effort you'll get it and that's why I think he so brilliantly understood the toxicity of the American Dream is that the effort is what destroys you mmm just because you have a path with the effort to be richer be successful that doesn't mean that's a good thing right that's what will actually dismantle you yeah it's putting it out and I think we forget that do you one of the things about Hunter that's really intoxicating is that his sort of self-destructive path becomes romantic when you read it and you get involved in his work and you kind of mimic it you know it's a that's the greatest fallacy I think I think what he was trying to say with self-destruction was that this was an incredible threat to our American democracy not all meaning on I mean I mean his there's no romanticism chewing his well I mean the romantic aspect of it was that his work was fantastic I mean when it was till it wasn't it was fantastic till it was it wasn't I mean it's why he understood what in the failure it wasn't but he lived in with he spent much more time within the consequences yeah of that binging than he did within the success of the binging right and that I think he knew that mm-hmm it is letters it's really beautiful and heartbreaking and in his writing too I mean I think that's what's been missed about him is there's romanticism self-destruction right towards the end he definitely lost his productivity and yawn Werner talked about that in the Alex Gibney documentary sticky-fingers was a great the document out of the new book on the new book on yawn winter has great moments of Thompson the 70s just being kind of lost yeah you know and I think I think we got to remember that we have incredible times in American history we have times that are gonna burn brightly and it's up to each writer to decide how they like to burn next to it and yeah gonna burn brightly they may not have other times and that's I think an American thing where you can wager that bright flame which means you may have nothing left afterwards but Thompson knew that he may have to live in that kind of afterlife but want wan Thompson writes about it so beautifully yeah stories I tell myself there's some some footage of him when he was writing for I forget what newspaper some what was it somewhere in the Pacific Northwest what what was he writing for who's the author of playing off the rail Google playing off the rail there's a guy who was a journalist what year do you think it was what David McCumber yes David McCumber David McCumber employed hunter for a while when David was I forget what publication he was working for but there's some footage of them community communicating together and you know I was trying to get hunter San Francisco was in San Francisco and hunters just out of his fucking mind I mean it was younger you mean he wasn't even that old but he was just wrecked he just couldn't communicate he couldn't talk and you know I mean a bit he makes a beast of you escape the pain of articulation you escape the pain of saying this is what's wrong in American society for him to say the way he did one of his great essays is from 1964 it's about going to Hemingway's um Ketchum Idaho on grave in Hemingway's house and it it's gorgeous because it talks about Hemingway was a good writer one of the best writers when he was writing about a period he understood in the 1940s 1930s when there was a firmness to the reality that he could articulate one of the writers goals is to give a pattern to chaos is to give an articulation to cast about what happens in the 1960s when the chaos is multiplying repeatedly somebody like Hemingway becomes a literal relic like his narrative no longer fits into the president that he's in and Thompson saw Hemingway his decline and he wrote about Hemingway's suicide I mean by his narrative doesn't fit Hemingway's idea of what America was and what a man should be fit perfectly with what I think the 20s to the 40s when we experienced but I think in the early 1960s with our social upheaval of civil rights of uh you know political upheaval Hemingway it was confusing to him it didn't it didn't fit anymore like his way of operating no longer articulated the president's right and so Hemingway his last act was to take away his ability to say anything at all that was his only the last thing he ever said was to say I'm not going to say anything anymore was the suicide that Hemingway committed and Thompson wrote about that gorgeously yeah when when I was young when he wound up killing himself it was almost unsurprising you know when when I read that he had died I remember going man well I guess yeah you know man I mean it's like you knew that he was deteriorating rapidly you knew that he had really bad hips he had hip replacement surgery the Ralphs and leg yeah Ralph Steadman had drawn this very crazy image of him with the artificial hip and yeah it looked like pain you know I mean but I think that it's not my place to even deal with that because Warren Thompson's book writes about that moment where one Thomson was in the house you know and that's that's that's his but and one writes beautifully about the stakes of it how painful it was to the people that loved him corners everything about it and how that even if that's a logical outcome that that's not no it needed it so it's interesting I would say read stories I tell myself with that moment is so honestly and brilliantly written by Warren know I'm sure but Baum oh I was getting at is that at the time of his death you know he was in just sort of a he was deteriorating so badly he was wearing diapers his entire because of his alcoholism his ability to control his body was gone hmm and so one gave this wonderful speech at George Mason when he came out he's like how do you write honestly about your father and he asked the question of like should I include this detail and he's like if my father was alive I couldn't include that but that's why I chose in a sense to write my book where my father was dead because I think my father would want me to write honestly but also not want me to include that if he was still alive and so he included that detail and he talked about that the struggle to include that detail which I think brilliantly articulates what you're saying which is the deterioration yeah and the sadness of it and I mean we have finite amounts of energy or effort we really do we have to take care of ourselves if we don't we will pay that price at some point we're gonna pay it anyways we're all headed to the same place mmm we want to or not you know and so I think hunter is a really terrifying a beautiful example of one wager of chips that were made for the 1960s and 1970s mhm and I think the best way to honor that is to you know apply the brilliance that he forged and carved to the situation we have right now with corruption Donald Trump of an attack on American democracy where American democracy is basically it's like what early on says democracy is a train and we arrive at the station we get off like they basically used the ladder to get to the Attic and now Trump's pulling up the ladder mm-hmm and I think um someone understand that really really well and I think reading him now whether you know him or not helps you and that's why I wrote free Kingdom was so that it can be a lens on his work going back or just on this present right now there will be regardless of Trump I think what he really represents is a brilliant historical time capsule and he he sort of captures that time period that upheaval pre-internet where the world was in chaos like no one else he he he encapsulated this very strange moment in history which I don't think is nearly as strange as the moment were going through right now I think this is probably the most strange moment ever yeah but he he nailed it and he nailed it in a very very unique way that still today I mean well that was another thing I want to ask you about what why did him in Tom wolf like Tom Wolf's got some of his tapes from some of the was at La Honda the Hells Angels pose dangerous parties and some crazy orgy that was going on and he gave him the tapes to this like what was all that about so when Thompson was covering the Hells Angels they believed the counterculture at the left in the 1960s 65 66 we're talking about Ken Kesey we're talking about the anti-war movement the free speech moment with Mario Savio they believe the Hells Angels were on their side there were fellow countercultural lists that are also outside of the ball game and so Kesey and Thompson we're having a drink after being on like KQED or like some local TV show in San Francisco and you know Ken Kesey's background is he was a wrestler at Oregon grew up on a dairy farm he come down to Stanford to write for what is now the stinger fellowship but back then was the graduate program at Stanford he had moved up to LA Honda on the success of his first book on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and it just written another beautiful book and so Thomson was like yeah I'm writing about the Hells Angels in Keyes he was like yo or I'd like to meet them Thomas was like okay and so Thompson knew how dangerous the Hells Angels were at war I think people either romanticize them or exaggerated their danger he's like okay I'll set them up and you know he contacted the chapter with Kesey so on August 7th I think of 1965 like the Hells Angels came to LA Honda Allen Ginsberg was there with Kesey Alpert was there you know who liked all of it all the Stanford intellectuals were there and they made a huge banner that says the Merry Pranksters welcomed the Hells Angels and Thompson rolled up with this isn't this isn't the Gibney documentary Thompson rolled up with his family Juan was a child baby in the backseat and he was in the front seat and he pulled up in what Thomson saw was Ken Kesey giving acid in red cups like red cake cups to the Hells Angels Thompson was like well we're getting the fuck out of here and so he grabs his wife and his son they go to San Clemente which is on the other side they have like a big picnic and on the way back they're like well let's just check it out let's see what it's like and they kind of pull in he's driving this old like roadster they pull in and everybody's watching on a giant trampoline screen like the five hour stream of consciousness footage from the Merry Pranksters trip across the across the US which is what Tom Wolfe wrote about and Thompson's like all right they're not eating each other's skulls like we can hang out a little bit so they hung out and it was interesting how acid pacified the Angels instead of made them violent and that's what acid you know of course that's what else it is but they spent the night hanging out there Thompson was writing so he's like I'm not gonna do drugs he's like I'll have a few drinks he's taking notes for his book later on in the night him and Allen Ginsberg and this is something I cut out of the book are like let's go get some beer as the cops are staking out the property and Ginsberg and Thompson get pulled over by the cops Thompson's sober he's talking to the cops he gets a ticket because his red lens for his back taillight is cracked and he's like come on day that's three in a box like I'm a journalist the cops are like why are you writing about them and they're talking about like people being taken away to jail and kids burgos what's in what's uh what's in Redwood City man how she goes it's called a jail Allen and that goes back to talking to the cops and all of this and Thompson was friends with Ginsburg and so they go back into the party Thompson realizes that Neal Cassidy who's blackout drunk who is Dean Moriarty and on the road by Jack Kerouac that's the character on who it was based his two or three girlfriends one of them is having an orgy with the Hells Angels at this cabin off to the side and Thompson sees it and he describes it in two ways when he writes about it but he did audio notes so he did audio notes of step-by-step uh-huh and he describes us like just horrific where she's barely awake I'm like she's she's catatonic and they bring in Neal Cassady to hook up with her to it's horrific and he articulates his horror I had a friend who's a good feminist writer like whose dear to me she's like deny me you wrote about a fucking white guy like whatever she's like he did most of it right she's like you excused Thompson in that moment you should have just let it stand and write about it in the book instead of try to talk about how upset he was saying it Thompson was really upset so why did she say that that doesn't make any sense because I think she thought that I was making the experience less authentic by trying to qualify it for our current times but why would that be the case when you were just explained explain oh I should have just allowed Thompson helmet no but I think I should have let him stand more instead of showing or amplifying his emotion too much but he's saying the based on her criticism not personal opinion no I think that he was really upset but I think him being really upset is secondary to whatever she was experiencing right but you're writing about him yes so I stand by it like I thought about that what I wrote it yeah I stand by it but what was what is her criticism again that by amplifying his upsetness by showing how upset he was that that's too much of an excuse for him just just write it where he was think he should have done stepped in no no no no nothing like that she was on point she thought I shouldn't she felt the effort on my part to try to explain his upsetness instead of just having him be upset with one sentence and then go on she thought it was over writing I thought it was a fair criticism where I over wrote it but long story short Thompson goes back and he goes like he's eating goes this is one of the worst things I've ever seen this is in the documentary right that's the case then why would why would it be that you were overriding it that doesn't seem like you overrode it I always worry I'm over writing this one it might create it's one of my great fears is that if someone sees something like that I think it's important that you accurately relay the emotions that they experience when they're watching a horrific event I mean he did to survive it as horrific but how much of it is my cultural perception of this moment that I'm giving too much to Thompson and how much of it was what he accurately experienced but he's talked about so I think just giving his words instead of a saying a little bit you know going okay I don't know what he said yeah yeah and so but he goes back in heat on his notes that night these are the notes he gave to Ken Kesey I'm sorry these are the notes to him to Tom Wolfe he says he's gave him the recordings no I don't think there were actual recordings no I don't I think that is Rob Wolfe so no that's what one of the documentaries said Tom Wolfe said he gave me there were the notes of it so I'm gonna be the notes of what happened and Tom Wolfe I know what those notes are used those notes okay to recreate that scene in electric kool-aid acid test mmm and so this is why we talk about truth later in life Thompson some biographies might have said that he actually recorded the event he didn't he went back and he took these long audio notes right of like shadow and light and the whore that he saw that's what I'm saying yeah he took the audio notes the recording he made the record yes yes and then grab those two Tom Wolfe and Tamil exactly yeah but some people have said that he put the tape recorder in them no no that's not that's not what I meant I mean he gave him the recordings and I was like they're terrifying but it's about like violence and shadow and light and horror you know it's a horrific it's a horrific scene that says Thompson's brilliance at that age he could in an audio note get the fucking images and details that he needs to express the the nature of that instant and so Tom Wolfe used those to create it himself but then Thompson recreated it to wrote about it in house angels yeah but in a more distant way than Wolfe did which is crazy because he was actually there it's fucking crazy dude now is the first time Thompson ever took acid because he was so upset he went to Kesey he's like fuck it I'm not a journalist anymore that's so horrific what I saw fuck it I he had friends that had told him that he's a personality where if he did acid to go to the bottom of the well for him you know this would be a really horrific thing and so he's like I don't care anymore and instead he just walked around and like was that peace like that's always funny when someone tells you how you're gonna recycle a drug relax right yeah you're gonna react to it how you're gonna react to it what was it like for you when you finally finished this when you when you put the last page down and you knew you were done I know that you like me share we have an adoration for this guy that's uh you mean he's one of my for sure personal heroes I mean it the last image I wrote was uh one of the most people think Thompson Thompson writes is something he didn't actually see was wit Nixon's helicopter he saw it on on TV left the White House lawn what happens is that you know giant helicopter with the white top and the blue its wheels lose their pressure so the wheels are you know flattened at the bottom but as the rotors begin to bring it up they become elongated wheels that still touch the ground Thompson wrote that image and I've always loved that image mmm so I was writing that in a sense when I was at CPAC in 2018 last year and I was walking out just after I wrote that and hence this helicopter was on the lawn right there and it was lifting off and I saw the wheels elongate just like that and I just had so much respect for Thompson's ability as a we talk about fiction as a narrative writer to detail that instant you know and to detail the way that that long gated and went you know to have that be the emotion of Nixon finally departing and so I felt you know I felt I gave it you know I throw as hard as I could throw as many pitches as I could I threw for as long as I can you know and I hope that everybody knows it's my version of Thompson and then it's a version of Thompson and written through the lens of Donald Trump but hopefully that it's through the effort and through the detail a version that might bring more people to Thompson while also at the same time for Thompson fans you know being something that they can respect and engage beautiful well thank you for writing it thank you for just highlighting who this guy was and thanks for all your work man I appreciate it thanks
