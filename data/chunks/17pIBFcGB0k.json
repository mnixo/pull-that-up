and we're live Hey look at you small a blunt I know I have this is your celebratory blunt holy shit dude I'm still a little bit that's felt like getting an AIDS test I know it's real but you knew you were healthy you feel good yeah I haven't felt like I had something so you were worried you one of them asymptomatic people yeah they said as many as 60 to 70 percent could be asymptomatic right so I was like I don't want to I don't have a because I gotta drive all the way that's why it's such a creepy disease like there was a Anderson Cooper thing I was we were talking about earlier where the mayor of Las Vegas was on with Anderson Cooper oh yeah and he was describing to her how one asymptomatic people person can go to a restaurant and it showed this chart of all the people that infected got infected by this one so he tried to get infected just the air just the air yeah so he's trying to tell this is completely theoretical first of all I don't know the people that are saying this from chiming I mean maybe they touch the same things maybe there's a bunch of different factors I don't know I'm guessing it was just because of the air but I don't trust a goddamn thing they're saying that's coming from China yeah anything they say if they're saying something it's been approved by the government right you know I mean it's not like what's that paper uh The Epoch Times there's like a paper that I think yeah epoch times is that it's like they'll be critical of China but I think the guy that owns it is a Fallon gong guy so I've seen criticism ensue well Fallon Gong's that persecuted Tai Chi religion in in China oh really China is fucking crazy damn mark x is a multi-language news was founded in 2000 by john tang and a group of Chinese Americans associated with the following gang spiritual movement so who is he again I don't know who John Tango following gang fallow and goings on it's like Tai Chi but I guess china considers it a cult what so they crack down on them like they're we Gers and oh no yeah and it's uh yes just like meditation check lines men shit and ki gong exercises where the moral philosophy centered on tenants RunAs compassion forbearance holy fuck I might have to join looking for a good call The Epoch Times guys get I've been saying this for years I want a good call to come up with a good one yeah that doesn't try to fuck me doesn't take all my money you're all needs to bang everybody's wife okay stop buying your wife I'm gonna bang your wife they always play out like that that stays do that gorilla that fucking classic chimpanzee right dominance thing where you lose face and poles and then yeah well I would have said you always witnesses was a good call if I stack because I'm not really better at you overs witness well let's tell everybody doesn't know cuz people might not be aware of your background you you grew up as a Jehovah's Witness you're one of my friends that has like the most rock-solid rules on not tolerating horseshit and because when people start bullshitting ya saying knots you you are you're always the guy that's like I know where this goes yeah well it's for something like that I I'm hyper I am very like hypersensitive to colty yeah I just don't want to go along with the thing because you have to go along with it and like come on we're doing this is important well I just that's the reason I left Jove what is it of course was I didn't want to have that then when I got out in the world that you can't escape it like the people all these people that claim to be secular that that jump down your throat like online or something I say it's all the same shit but they just let got rid of the Jesus Christ they just got rid of that and kept the bullshit it's a pattern yeah like I guess a set of habits yes comforting a comforting routine I guess but it's I mean the thing when when people do it to people like it's it's almost like whether they're doing it because you're not a believer in Jesus or are you doing it right you're not a vegan are you doing it because you don't support gender pronoun freedom right whatever it is like that hardcore well you can be able to fit that mind into a bunch of different slot yes there's the this is what I do believe from religious people there is a human need for what religion fills and it's like you know hey great you got rid of Saddam but now who's taking over I'm not so gung-ho on the like we all we need to get rid of like the Bill Maher level of atheism where he's a grad well per die that like I think he's not understanding you know people some people need that and and it it's not how to do is smart or stupid it's a just a very deep feeling of belonging and if you don't get it from God there's gonna be you know there's worse shit to get it from yes yes there's some moral tenants if you really adopt Christianity some of my favorite people are Christians and pretty hardcore Christians people that are really like well like here's 100 Chris listen if you ever met a Christian they're delightful just they're like unicorns there's probably like three of them the rest of the people are on a football team you know who's a real Christian like in like a admirable sense the word is Chris Pratt guardians of the galaxy yeah I've heard that I've never met one of the nicest guys I've ever met he's so nice and genuine and right there with everyone right he's very religious but I'll tell you what man if that's what it is it's like if following those tenants the way that guy does it turns you near that kind of a person he's an admiral that's how you're supposed to it's not supposed to be you know you're preaching at people your behavior is supposed to be the witness right and so people have come into it a lot of times that's why they do they got I saw this guy I'm like if that's what that is I want to be that you know it's like it's like they got it abandoned the goofy stories if they just came out and said listen it's our belief that living in this way with this belief in a higher power and that holds you to a higher standard of behavior if all that along with these tenants you know loving thy neighbor and treating each other as brothers and sisters as if we were all one if you just saw that you just got to stop saying someone came back from the dead you got to stop saying even those stories even those goofy stories which I always would say that was saying that but you know when I left but a lot of them work is still work as metaphors you know yeah the ones that there's people at all levels of smarts and they all need a thing to get on board so some people need a goofy story to get on board like I said I don't think that's the lynchpin that's harming it I think it's just I I don't believe that it transforms people's hearts like there's people that I saw when I was in my job's witnesses that they had a fucked up life that they turned around okay but I don't think that that it fundamentally changed anything but their behavior they were just who they were and this gave them a window to be you know purchase scaffolding he doesn't need something to sort of build on the structure gone to people right so so you know but if you're a psychopath it's not gonna change you into a not a psychopath right it's gonna make it's gonna be horrible because you can apply your psychopathic tendencies to the religion well and you see that right the worst of the evangelists that's what you're seeing right you're seeing a con man who's found a tool that's beyond reproach well some are just like you know they're like almost like met same as Marilyn Manson when he you know he had his thing that he did Marilyn Manson but he was ultimately like a guy that's gonna play golf like Alice Cooper like he's a man I'm doing a show here that's what those guys you know Steve Martin made that movie uh what is it called where he's leap of faith he plays like a TV preacher and and he cuz he saw this documentary about a real guy named or Joe who copied Mick Jagger so he would go to these churches and to like moves like Jagger for these old ladies and they and he would talk about it and he was just openly saying how it was a scam anything you're making money off of like that it doesn't go together for you know that's how you know automatically the guy's full of shit cuz he's making a ton of money off it if their preacher yeah you're not supposed to get rid of Jesus didn't get rich right and especially when you get like arena rich like you're buying a Olsteen yeah see you guys come out of nowhere he's trying to do the least harm singers they like pops all right I don't know about him until they get so huge that they break through the public macular like it's like pops like I just learned who Billy Eilish wish I didn't know this whole time yeah she doesn't know who they my sister had informed me about Adele she goes you know that song hello I go no I don't know that song you never had heard it just like now no I've been fortunate what is so hurt not in a bad way against which I think she's got an amazing voice you just haven't seen a lot of horseshit I stood I'm very down it's all Dwight guy who likes rap music and classic rock hey I just know why I like my classic rock I like Led Zeppelin and like oh yeah so you know it's not like Billy Eilish yeah dude Van Halen but it's just like at a certain point times like I'm taking in too much music I don't have time for all this new stuff yeah well I was like what we just talking about it different yeah something I didn't care about like well you know what's interesting about music is like our lifetimes and our parents lifetimes they like the first times in human history where people had music collected where they could listen to it over and over and over again right around their grandparents or was like probably the first like my grandparents came over from Italy and from Ireland in the early 1900s so when they were coming over here I guess they had record players but how prevalent were they and what kind of music did they have and like you know I thought they had like stand around the window over rich person's house like a slave Krantz to handle but like where was the recordings you know I'm saying like they weren't that prevalent if there was there certainly were some you know they had recorded music before then but it's not like it's on your phone didn't we send you know that that gold record we sent into space that has like a picture of like man a transphobic picture of a man and a woman doesn't have a dress as a woman of a dress looking has a dress and there's just those two doesn't she just have breasts but she's like hilarious you know the ones ik Oh like yeah blues guy like old old catfish Willy or you know like some some kinda yeah yeah just got some cool shit to make us look interesting it's a very odd wrong yeah [Laughter] they sent it on a gold plate you know was like a gold plate and then uh but the drawings made me laugh because they are like stick figures like I watched that movie contact the other night with Joey Falls yeah it's amazing holy shit that a good my love it's good but you weren't in a way that the aliens are like we're gonna look like your dead father because you couldn't handle no I can handle ceilings is it is that but there's images yeah you gotta flip it over to the B side yeah yeah where's the man and woman hmm wasn't the last video there's two tits on the bar where where is it yeah I thought there was hmm maybe it's something else would thinking of I don't know it's like why is different discs have different images there's not more than one disc is there are we sending mixed messages to them coming up but it's not a picture on the gold thing are there titties on this record what do they look like is it recognizable it's it's like a someone just drew it though on piece of paper and like I said this is on their the pioneer plaque okay these well whatever it is in the movie contact they got that recording and they sent it back to earth yeah and that movie like it had a cool like how it might go down then about it so much about it was cool it's just the end and it was like come on man and the guy who blew himself up like the religious to to brew himself up like that was a little cartoon this way so you're just gonna say the guy who blew himself and like that was an interesting point I didn't I think it's Gary Busey son I think JJ's right yeah he's great in it I met that guy recently and also the idea that uh you know he's greatness movie this was like a piece of paper called oh that's it that's it right there this was not the same as that golden thing oh this was 72 the gold thing was 73 okay well this was the first thing and then the record was a different thing oh okay we conflated it too so go to the image again let me see the image let me see the guys the guys dong they go to the one on the left that one right there yeah make that one big is that what they're gonna think dongs are just like here's my dick now most human dicks don't come pass the and I like how they had the woman built like a real woman she's not like a porn star woman well where's her gave her a little bit of an ass her penis yeah he's like hi where's donut on here I mean it's a show up and think we're down to party and everybody's all bundled up well that that image is showing us how ridiculous we like assume the aliens would think our clothes are what yeah what if the aliens send theirs back and they're fully clothed and like why did you guys make the space this is an intergalactic dick pic and it's a unnecessary dick pic to like no one looks like that and when they're waving to you right that's very like that's sending a bad message hey man where the fuck did you come from I can't just look at my dick and balls this is weird I like that they didn't really put a vagina they just put a like here's the important price well you see the penis clearly in the vagina see Barbie doll hey Barbie doll the woman is a little Barbie doll where's her pubes where's everybody's pubes are this weirdo set this is a porno set how come they got hair in their head they don't have hair in their box well when was this sent out they probably did a misleading this isn't so they were very futuristic they were really into porn they were way ahead of their time and why is the guy has such Caucasian hair that's my other question right right what percentage of the population has hair that looks like that it looks like a young Noam Chomsky's hair it's just a weird image it's it's very weird hi aliens yeah he's my dick but it's also it's like it's weird and just that but we're kind of acknowledging that superior intellects would think clothes are weird is that what that is yeah we're letting him know like underneath or adidas and our fucking jeans they must have argued about that too they must have had like a long conversation these fucking the people that are funding this are like really we drawn a dick and send it out to the aliens Wow who is funding I don't know I know who's making the call sounds like the cowboy guy from The Simpsons was probably announcing oh yeah that honestly that's right think we could all like Wernher von Braun oh dude Wernher von Braun was a legit Nazi these to hang the slowest Jews in front of his rocket Factory in Berlin yeah oh dude this Simon Wiesenthal Center said that he was alive they'd prosecute him for crimes against humanity the slowest do they have a racist had something where they would make everybody work faster and harder by killing all slowed you that's what put the slowest guys the slowest girls whoever they you know she's a Jewish prisoners and they would hang them yeah dude there's I remember him from like a Disney thing about rocket science he was a part of Operation Paperclip right there he is right there an Operation Paperclip imported all these Nazi scientists to run NASA I knew that but I didn't so part of that I thought he was always like no I wasn't with those guys just look at him chilling go to that picture again just stop and think about that this dude was a Nazi in Germany during World War two comes back and he's running our space program with his feet up why go to space so you want to get hung up on people's Nazi past you want to get a dick pic to space or not they got this genius bilingual motherfucker to come over here and show us how Rockets are done they were ahead they were hit with rockets they were head with engineering I tell goes they're all head of science because they plug an extension cord into a Jew to try to invent a computer guy that like I don't want him to not be doing stand-up I like this downtime you know he's I don't know anybody does as many sets as Dave like I did I like all cuz I just met with Tim Cole cuz he's got there's no you know he says no number it's like a really ungodly hour like he was telling me to like he wanted to make a prank show called practice to him I was just middle easterners doing pranks up the most inappropriate breaks yeah he shouldn't be taking time off when do you think anything would be able to stand up again if I was gonna ask you oh shit that's the problem right when everyone can get a test for kovat 19 no the problem is when do you think that'll be it I don't know I didn't I didn't realize that the tests were so just there around I thought is it just in some states they don't have the tests out some places don't have them and there's there's that there's also that there's some tests that are FDA approved in some aren't and why that that is the case I'm not gonna speculate cuz I really wouldn't know what I'm talking about probably whoever fucking could be I know I would be pretending if I know whoever flew on the epstein plane with the FDA guy but the company I use is they're very confident that their tests work and they say even though they're not FDA approved if there's all your well being for your own knowledge is it that they're incorrect mostly with false positives or they won't tell you and you did have it I don't know it's a good question because if it's false if they tell you that you had it and you didn't that's not quite as bad yeah it's a little more safe than sorry they know the doctor said they've had many positives they've had plenty of positives and a lot of people that just had like a little bit of a call for a few days and it went away and turned out to be positive really and some people with no symptoms at all okay so if you just had a coffin one way in a few days does that mean you don't get that's a good question right does that mean is that precisely yeah no one knows they don't know they really don't know it's a it's a new disease whenever something's new it's like there's guesswork going on it's like who knows they don't really exactly know they know a few things about it they're learning what they're getting lots of help from China is uh the lady the Las Vegas mayor those was him before yeah Anderson Cooper Anderson's explain this to her and he's like in a restaurant trash like China this is Las Vegas Nevada this isn't China he actually said here wow that's very ignorant like it was that's an incredible it was a ridiculous it was indicative of how those are first of all is indicative how those are not real conversations yeah right you're gonna talk about something that complicated it shouldn't be you're over there I'm over here there's like a fucking thing in your ear you don't even see that right and you're just talking into a camera that's just what a lot of those are actually loves it to Anderson Cooper's more than ones that loves loves like pretend performative oh I can't believe this and he's like keep it keep it coming baby what's it Dom member him loose Donald sterling with Donald stars like when magic had those aids I used to pray for him middle nation and uh a watch angel Cooper's video warning it might be kind of shocking like is it like it looked like he was holding in choosing his pants every time the guy would say another word well he's very good at his job he must enjoy some of that must enjoy really catching people saying stupid people from vague first of all people from Vegas are from the whole world that's what's ridiculous put there's a ton of Chinese people gambling in Vegas before anywhere well they build casinos to the standards of Chinese people like if there's things that are not a Feng Shui like in here's an example the MGM he had a walk in through the mouth of a black people in check please we're not walking through a lion's mouth change yes it's bad luck you can't walk into a fucking lion's mouth it does make sense by the way it totally makes sense what what are you stupid you know I have not superstition now that you mention if you're gambling yeah come on take these motherfuckers down are you walking through a lion's head god damn it's a trap I'm so stupid I walked into life and they fix can they make it like a dragon's head or like a better luck animal I don't think you're allowed to walk through an animal's head that means that animals eating you they're more sensible about it than we are what if it's a very lucky dragon and its yeah it's like you gotta be in the belly of the beast in order to get the magic no they're not dumb they're not gonna go through that fucking lion's mouth and on their way to a den of gambling trying to win money who knows maybe five billion dollar maybe if you didn't slaughter every rare animal to get a fucking 6-inch boner you could you wouldn't have these bad luck problems dude key Mangin that whole rhino horn thing like you're over some dudes house is like would you like some Rhino team it right the principal is literally just cuz it has a fucking horn that looks like kind of like a dick yeah don't have anything dick like on your person as an animal in China because you will they somebody will be like that somebody's got a snort powder of that well I talked to a friend of mine about this who he knows a lot about Chinese culture and what he said was that it's not really that they think it's gonna give him a boner cuz they know about viagra but it's that it shows that you have this yeah that's very difficult to go there I've never been in China I've been to Taiwan Oh Taiwan is very different I think I've never been it I want I went to the you know mainland the Big Island of China yeah and it's that was the most materialistic like you know having big labels on your coat there's all these fake ed hardy jackets that I guess are very expensive and it would have like a like remember Minnie Pearl that had that big price tag on it it's like that big and I'd be hanging off a very obviously not ed hardy there's a sneaker where it's in style to wear the label we had a shit fit about it on this podcast what's it called again Jamie off white shoes yes thank you it's a giant plastic tag I hope it's a GPS tracker it just tracks dummies it might be I dump these with these tags on their feet look what they do the people that keep that shit on their feet let's see what they hear that's the biggest insult you could say someone's like you I heard you're poor like that's like terrible terrible insult there why was it say I heard you're poor it's just a way that people insult each other like oh you're poor like oh that's the meanest thing you can say I mean it's probably not the meanest like go walk in a tiger mouth is the meanest but - so if someone said you're talking about in China yeah so if someone says I heard you're poor that's like the worst insult they could say to you calling you poor not the guy heard part is just that's just how about just calling you pours are you ultimate insult yes so everything it's like an 80s movie bully ya know what's important about that whether it's North Korea or China it's important for us to realize that their styles of living that work and one of the big one that works is freedom yeah right and this is the best place for that freedom style of living is right here and then you realize that in this same day and age not a small country but a country with three times as many people as us can be controlled by a military dictatorship well oh dude I was shocked it's got sounds like a weird thing to say but I was shocked by how much more freedoms they had and I mean you're not free to like hey fuck you the government you're not at all don't ya can't if you said anything like that they would come after you know that when I did comedy like you'd say when any political Ju womp there's nothing about China and now at the time I was like oh I don't know anything about China so fine so but you could just smoke with it wherever like the hospital you could like my friend we went to go eat at some hotpot place I was like do you like Chinese food I had was hotpot it's golf and we couldn't find parking and he fucking parked on some stairs like the front stairs to a bit he just parked like that and I was like are you allowed to park here and it's fine that it's late the cops weren't home the cuff just go Jesus Christ yes so that's why they had to have that so you know it is like 1984 ish but that Social Credit System were they yeah they can't possibly police that many people the cities I went to were like 3 New York New York City cities all next to each other in a rut like it's enormous it's like fucking a Judge Dredd it looked like only the future is what it looked like everybody had a mask on I got a theory man and my theory is if you look at all the old old cultures like so many the old except for parts of Europe but a lot of the old Asian cultures they still like they've been around lot like what country's been around longer than yeah that's a massive point of pride it's like you get a inverse kind of like in America it's like new money compared to old money like the what my point was I wonder if like after a certain amount of years even like a real valid democracy eventually gives in to the weight of people's instincts to control each other I wonder if like that's what China's what is the longest surviving country right somebody told me that one of their if they've had the same government this entire time you know instead of a dynasty it's just like the generals kids and shit exactly and so this guy's like their amp it's just been the same way forever and you just change the names of stuff so it's really what communism is mmm-hmm the part of communism they're taking is like the state control yeah but they have like a very like no welfare system kind of if it feels like an 80s movie like greed is good if it has that feeling of about you know I mean and uh also I was shocked how good the comics were really like front yeah well all the streaming stuff is there so you know whatever who they've seen all your comedy and so they have like I was just surprised like oh this is like they like they get how to do stand-up so where they were they expats where the people that live there shows I did where there were expats and also people from there Wow and that's cool but gotta be a tricky tightrope to walk doing stand-up in China do not well I had nothing to say about China I didn't know any of the priests off at the time yeah but I mean for someone someone who does stand-up there in China like locals you have two more what I I think we have to worry about is another business because popular people like it but let's see some guy down the block runs a bar mm-hmm and he's jealous that you're getting business he can go to the interior ministry people and go they're putting in communist propaganda and then something with but in mine and he you know he knew people at the ministry and they go listen we know you weren't doing that but you just can't do shows for six months because merely cuz someone reported it we have to do that so that's the that's the Sharia this is one of the that instinct that people have to do things like that it's one of the reasons why I got so upset when LA started offering rewards on social social distancing violator yeah so if someone is like high five and his neighbor or you go over the next-door neighbor's house you have dinner or something like that like people are stitching people out for money I was already reporting people for high fives before this virus they're getting very into well don't you think they just figured out like the people like that cuz when this they first thing for his head people didn't it was funny watching especially like the social jihad he's trying to figure out what side of this they're on right they're like well I don't know so for a little bit they were like okay whatever Trump says I'm against that and then now it's more on the okay so you got a social distance and like enforcing it it seems like that that group went to that now yeah and also policing who gets test it yeah well it seems like this is the new thing now right it's like here's the new thing to be outraged about it's like who is going outside without a mask who is doing this without gloves you have to transfer your business like because that was a big business before this it's like how do I adjust my business which is because I don't think anyone is out racial yeah no one is out rate I mean I've do you think they aren't or do you think I need a false there they're foolishly focusing on things that are not as important well that's if you are serious about it well that's not the people that like you know make a living off doing it if I see in the media then it's not sincere well there's there's a lot of that for sure but there's a lot of things you can't rule out people actually being upset about something that's legitimately upsetting I unless your make it it's almost like the thing we're talking about the preacher thing if you're getting rich off it I don't believe it well the problem is it's like a cry wolf thing it's like there are some things that like did you see the the Elon Musk beef that he got in with someone who is a reporter for CNN yeah why okay why are they so anti him I don't know I don't know but it didn't make any sense because he said there was greater thing yeah and he said are you aware that there's a search function and then would played little semantic games to keep retweeting these different nurses that are showing these respirators and they're like thanking him smiling and and holding up the Tesla sign and he showed all the different places that he can use respirators and explained and they're still like they're not gonna go back on it cuz so so now they're now well they're not technically respirators they're a different kind of thing it was it was different ones for different places I believe it's ones hospitals asked him to get and they are respirators they're non-invasive as per machine yes but it's pumping oxygen into your into your lungs right it's a type of a respirator is I don't know I was knocked over 19 I got tested well congratulations I don't talking out of my ass but I do know that oxygen goes into those things I mean that's that's the whole reason why are technically bad people wear them yeah no they are event they're a kind of ventilator and the hospital said could you get these for us and all the shit to give someone a hard time about it's like he's they're out to getting these things he trashed the media he hit me on twitter be like and what if it doesn't the press suck so it's like if you it's like hero cop killer or something like this if you go on YouTube this guy Alex or Alec Bostwick he's a reporter and he's into I caught a video has raised explain it it's like cops like the media's like cops and a PR person is your lawyer so you don't ever talk to the cops without a lawyer you know that you don't and they have and we need journalists we need cops but the people that abuse it or they're corrupt which is like a lot of them there's so many people doing it right and there's different styles of doing it well there's a certain amount of like serving collects where so now these people they were tormak over 19 like they didn't know how to handle this for their business of like we got to condemn people it sounds like a fossil fuel they're almost a hundred frie of digging these tweets they're like well how far back do your tweets go fossil view like and it's like there's ones they're saving like okay we have these old black face picks of like Tom Hanks or yeah like what about these Indian baseball teams yeah right or the Braves the Indians didn't somebody get mad at Adam driver because of this one I was crazy it was because he I don't know he even though he's in the military but he went and served in Iraq he because after 9/11 he wanted to go fight against you know he said you had a vague because nothing against Muslims I have feeling of I want to go fight whoever attack it so he's Islamophobic there's a whole Twitter Islamophobia thing which is Wilder that's how far disconnected Twitter is that section of Twitter that doesn't yeah that's how absolutely fucking break from reality well it's it's a new form of communication and through this new form of communication people have strengthened ideologies right for good or for bad and I think that's just part of what that is that's part of what that is with the outrage Twitter but it's also part of what that is with other good stuff like the giant scientific debate Twitter and people talking about different issues in the calm collective way let's can't throw out the baby with the bathwater there's something there's a lot of good to what's going on with like weird online social discourse but you're definitely seeing people get enraged and you're flamed more often well by the way when you brought up the cult thing in the beginning that's what it is it's like yeah that's a certain kind of cult and you can't talk anybody out of being in a cult like especially when I was like a deep believer no one would have you wouldn't have shown me any evidence or anything that would have made me turn from my call when people leave it's because it didn't when you need it need it to do what it's supposed to do it didn't do that for you when you needed it so that that's how people leave they don't leave because you yell I might tell them they're stupid or any of that so all these sock just types the same way they're as it fails for them you could see people now like I'm not doing it Jamie kills teens one first right he's the he's the best example in my opinion because he's been like really honest no right how gross he felt when he was like attacked and he was like a cold guy it was crazy yeah and then they went after him and he was like oh shit like you no one's safe well so that's that's the it's the running out of fuel for these fucking things so so that's why yeah I mean they're just gonna dig through all of it it's like polluting and it's that's why they're going like 83 1983 you touched someone's vagina who was 1983 1983 though the 1980s one was actually we the guy from start row got in trouble who Picard no no the guy who is on Howard Stern Show Sulu you know yes yeah yeah George I know you said he grabbed someone's penis or something oh okay in 1983 or something like that like legitimately like talking about in the 80s I mean it sounds about right you know it never happened but it's like when when they're if they run out of outrage if people like really run out of outrage and they go searching for it and all that those are very like there's a lot of movies that if you went and went searching for them like outraged you get really mad if you were looking at you watch yeah right well people look at me Ace Ventura pet detective oh yeah Oh port to you which is the one know where he goes Africa I just watch that recently it was an Ace Ventura what was the one where Shawn yeah was it named that it was that was right where it turns out he was a guy sign or nine or things oh no that's right that is part one all right yeah there's so many old movies man I watched Tommy Boy the other day there's so many movies that have scenes you couldn't do now the fucking 30 rock is all things you couldn't do shit we do it happen you can't do them on like the network this is the thing it was part of the reason for the the mad grab for like outrage things it's like stuff like this or anything YouTube or all that shit is eating up their lunch and so they'll they went all in solemn to the fucking whatever that I whatever the idea of a millennial on Twitter was yeah that's what people were pandering to in it they called it on South Park dude you remember the episode of uh what's his ain't PC principal where they introduced PC principal so there's a scene when there's two forms like well PC is back how long you think it's gonna be this time and go six years and I'll be goddamned it was back in 2015 and now these shits Peter now it's about six years yeah people get mad and it's like it's like a jackrabbit thing like there's like populations Jackrabbits they go up and down like every seven years it's very long that's right what I think ideas can very well be like diseases and then you know they come and go and like big ones stick you know big I love whether it's a religion the ones that have like this is what I think is going to be an Ebola ultimately the the social justice thing is just it's too burnt itself out too much well too many people inside of it got attacked and felt what it was like to be misrepresented yeah and there's no there's no fallback or also not nice looked here you're supposed to be the good person right if you're if you really like if someone social justice warrior one of the first thing they think is that they're doing a good thing and that they are they have an intelligent philosophy right it's an it's not an idiots way of looking at the world it's an intelligent way of looking at the world right and they feel wise in their eyes right because they get ideologically drew but I don't think they realize that a big part if you if you act that way and you're attacking people I think you realize a big part of being a person is learning how to be nice to each other and if you just go out of your way to attack people you don't ever get those people to change their mind what you what you do is you get those people mad at you you get those people sad they feel upset that sounds like humans and these are internet people you can't you can't like get them to listen to your opinion and take it seriously very disrespectful that's just a tenant of human beings right and it's there oh yeah they're socially fucked up people that are engaging and these online wars right and they're doing it for these little adrenalin bursts and these little dopamine hits and there's something that is why I do anything yeah no it's oh it's a weak-ass but that's how you get like that is not having a look at and say that yeah I think you know so so it's just gonna burn out because there's no you know like Christianity Zakaria very that's a corona that's gonna be around a long time yeah like that game locked up yeah ain't got their own country well coronavirus you can get it get like there's a forget if I want to become a job as witness again and I was like you know what I repent for every or whatever I did that took me out of this and I want to be then you can go in so so there's a you I could become that again do I mean like Jamie kills team can never be a social justice warrior didn't let him back yeah yeah well I saw people attacking him and misrepresenting him when he left I was like people told me he raced somewhere that's the shit that I had that no one whenever no one ever accused him of that and then even when he when he did leave it's like he attacked them what he was accused of is so crazy it's just that Jamie went all in bashing other people my feeling is if he's accused of flirting with girls or something like that it's so much worse I mean it's such a long story but I it's so crazy that what the actual story is is just that he went after people and so when you do have people turn on you like well fuck you it yeah but you can't be like that if somebody comes out of a thing you've got to be cool yeah well that's how you would like people to be in real life right if in real life I would like everybody to be real reasonable when they talk to each other and hang out with each other but on Twitter for some reason like people that think they're reasonable people will say some shit that you would never say to someone in real life because if you did you'd be such a fucking asshole if you're just looking face to face and you said some of the things that some people were just right to random people on Twitter you would be a fucking asshole but for some reason well that's a shot escape clause like you would think the cruelty would create a callousness to it you know what I mean but music it's like people say they crazy a shit but and then be hypersensitive to anything said right there direction right right it's not it's not that's a good point like really both punch each other and that's what we do it's not like that they get deep but they get more raw it's it's really like an unsatisfying call to be it's it's missing a thing and the big thing if you want to be right is you got to be nice it's not a nice one it's not a reasonable one it's an attacking one in in attacking at a lot of things that are very debatable and they just want you I think that's it there's no debate on this yeah there's a lot of things that are very debatable well like when it comes to any controversial issue there's their controversial for a reason they're like a lot of them you know there's there's debate there's debate - could be had now if you can shut it right down yeah that's that's what uh that's the Mojo's witness as the uh you know you basically let's say you were like hey so i'm about this seems off and i have an issue with it i didn't raise your hand and say that in the because there's a Bible you don't want to stumble your brother right like what if your doubt or whatever you had like keep it to yourself you know there's a time to discuss I don't know when but the worst thing can happen is you hurt someone else's faith by you saying the thing that's obvious that's in front of your face so that that lets in all kinds of horrible what if you hear about like mala stations or you know jobs what is actually the largest settlement in history really for that yeah and it's not because someone in a position of authority did it it's because they did but all these places do and then go to the cops they're like we're gonna handle it and that's why we all bunch of church tanks like if this kind of the kid diddling happens and when it happens it's really a morality issue of probably the kid like like we have to see if they need to be married now that's the kind of God well it's just old ass all Bronze Age you know how crazy is the Catholic Church is there another country that is like the Vatican the Vatican's like a country that's inside Italy right you know isn't it essentially like no sovereign nation and is the idea that so that no one can get kicked out like they can't get a you know extradited to the rest of the free world no I don't know I think it's like like that I think it goes back a long time but how weird is that I mean how weird is that like if you've got a kid fucking priest and they're holed up in a church over there he is probably the best place for him right it's not a heavy kid population it's just a bunch other all religions by the way have roughly as much as the Catholic Church pedophiles yes all healing all of them some more so it's just you know they actually kind of handled it more and they didn't do a great job now but they did it their reckoning came that it hasn't really come for a bunch of others on such a large she don't hear about that with like Baptists or all of course you do really I should talk to you uh my friend Brooke was in quiver full what's crimpable the nineteen it member the show 19 and counting no I don't with the Duggar family that's right yeah and uh and it's like your quiver is supposed to be full so oh yeah you're supposed to always be having kids I know there's a good analogy there because if you're one of those assholes there's a 20 arrow quiver that's a lot of weight I can fit 20 arrows in my wife's pussy now well it's like there's a there's a quiver analogy believe it or not for archery and particularly for bow hunting yeah that's probably good too many arrows like one of the best bow hunters I know my friend John Dudley he only takes four arrows that's it the only it's four because it weighs your bow down he doesn't want a bunch of weight over here on the side of his bow so the analogy is to not have too many kids yeah if you have very bears is like have nineteen I don't know but that's a bad analogy like but but the idea like oh I'm gonna have a hundred arrows okay well you got to carry those around Stu to know who founded it the idea and by the way it's not it's own religion it's a thing that they're if you're just like you could be a Methodist and you're in that movement do you know what I mean I think the founders are some dude who's still there and this chick who former feminist mood who changed to this like she went the other oh wow extreme that happens to sometimes yeah that where do you see the other way if you thought you didn't like like the hyper left like kids waiting till they become Republicans how much you're not gonna like them Oh their kids are gonna become Republicans for sure there's a lot of them are gonna flip a lot of them are gonna get older thinking that we're talking yesterday on the podcast I did with Owen Smith we were talking about farmers how some most farmers like the lot of them are Christian and a lot of them are right was a lot of them right-wing oh yeah I was saying because they're no-nonsense people because they get up at six o'clock in the fucking morning every day and they feed the chickens and milk house and they have to do it every goddamn day they wanna hear your bullshit they do it on they have no time for lazy people that they think everybody's trying to make a fast buck and they're out there every day so if you've never been around it people have never been around that have the most TV like deep shit Hollywood idea of a white farmer yeah it's crazy hard work really fucking hard yeah real strong member um those are different kind of people yo Harris Stanton did you know him yeah look using the accident with Tracy and uh but in that way I have number that when Tracy's uh two of us got hit he was one of them yeah he's a lot i mean he's not that I don't watch but uh yeah Harris he's that he's from South Carolina used to be a who's gonna play baseball or something then hurt his fucking leg and became a comic but he fucking uh one of the strongest fucking people I used to do tobacco bales oh jeez likes others and tobacco farming so it's like what did Country Strong it's crazy how strongly you know how crazy that is that's actually a workout for CrossFit yeah that kettlebell workout it's called the farmers walk farmers carry did you see take a heavy kettlebell in each hand you walk with it so you just why don't just get a job that is really at that point motions farmer strength is a real strength like yeah like wrestlers always talk about farmer strength that's like a like a expression I mean it sounds so close to retard strength but the idea is you're picking up bales of hay all day like they're doing things all day and instead of working out which is like you burn yourself out that was the most tremendous working just go my friend's dad drove a truck you know a tractor-trailer cross and his fucking hair like Popeye forms yeah cuz the shifter is there I'm sure he was fearsome least it was like it was upsetting how strong his doubts and and I just remember like everybody's dad had a job like that well think about was some jobs like lumberjack like a lumberjack you immediately think of a giant man I think my paper towel giant yes yeah that did that for the job he was a lumberjack right the paper towel guy was a brawny guys not a giant he didn't is not the brawny guy I looked the brawny guy rip off for the Paul Bunyan carolinians like that but what is are we imagining the brawny guy incorrectly I have a feeling he's just a regular-sized guy this is a handsome the kind of guy men and women want to fuck that's right it's like a Marlboro Man type character starts the orgy in the LSD camp yeah it's clean it's just a perspective thing that's what I'm saying there we go guy with the moustache the guy with the moustache then on the left hand side yeah he's just a regular-sized guy with some trees behind him the guy no the on the guy in the top - is that the same guy or is that different mustache guys the new guy is that guy's he died of HIV sadly that's why we had this new like I don't understand why they got rid of the old brawny guy it made a totally different guy a brawny guy because this is this is clean looks like he lives in Long Island and yeah he really looks like Adam Carolla he owns a travel company he's got like one of them second wait market ticket sales companies yeah they had the strength has no gender what is that it's a brawny commercial please yeah don't say that's real good strength there's no gender that's true I guess why do you think in the the well it looks really like a lesbian book club with some kindly look at the there are definitely women that are stronger than some men yeah well I had it but I don't know why I don't first of all it only what why a paper towel would tell me anything well not only that why is it assuming that I don't think that women are strong it's assuming it that's what it's not that it's not a strength has no gender okay let's it's our women it's a way but listen if it was us what it was a bunch of meathead looking men standing there as head strength has no gender fuck you we know you're strong right stop women are strong too like okay I didn't say you were I just said strength has no gender and here's keeping me and my somebody in marketing that's like the the whoever does the marketing they're like women who've the Don Draper's that go what do women want this is like they're white they are angry they don't think they're strong like that's the that's the purely the it's like the dumb dad on the sitcom thing that's just like a thing that's been going on for I don't know forever that image that insulting fucking yeah they're teaching you about life because because every woman is an engineer I would feel so sold out if I was a guy and I was really into brawny cuz you I kind of look like the brawny guy and I got and there's three chicks if you were positioned if you felt like the brawny guy but literally it's like pregnant men ok the brawny guys at goddamned lumberjack I would assume most Lumberjacks are probably big strong men you don't think he became a gay kind of icon Ally I mean I understand they they have three female Lumberjacks three well you do the job of one man Jack the lumber of one full man this is gonna take three yeah it's just what are the percentages of women that are Lumberjacks and what's the likelihood of three of them being on a team it looks in that picture he looks like a guy who's about to take a shuttle by the way this is an ignorant question I I'm aware if you're a female lumberjack and you're mad at me right now I'm sorry I don't know anybody that's a female lumberjack I'm just act just asking questions they're mean they're wearing lumberjack clothes that's what a lumberjack wear you should sue me are you posing what if you don't Valor is it still about are you preparing trees you wearing a lumberjack shirt is stolen it is these are models these are hot chicks with nice nails they're not out there carrying trees and shit you know they could by the way you know I'll tell you what the women that do do their job I promise they're not gonna put on the paper there's just fucking put a wig on the guy look at that one lady with her sleeves rolled up are you about to go to work look at her good that picture click on that she's got this really thin body there's really thin arms and she's got her sleeves rolled up with a flannel shirt flannel shirt on in front of a bunch of trees are you about to chop trees down ma'am because you weigh 90 pounds the idea is to make you think that you feel like a lumberjack while you're wiping your counter down is the is what they're trying I think we need to be more respectful about what the fuck it means to be a lumberjack I would think you you would think that that would be romantic until you did that job eight hours a day five days a week and your fucking body's broken down because you're carrying logs in your shoulder and shit you're chopping it trees oh my god was your father a lumberjack because it's very I feel you can't pretend you're a goddamn lumberjack you can't take a hot model and cover a face with a little bit of coal powder and pretend she's a coal miner in West Virginia getting black lung you can't because she's not sounds like a great point I believe you you're not a lumberjack lady and that guy okay brawny wood what if that was for Similac and he was breastfeeding that would be fucking hilarious just as likely is that lady being a lumberjack just as likely that the brawny guy is breastfeeding yep I think yes just as likely lumberjack is a brutal physical it's if a woman's doing it that woman's gonna be jacked she's gonna be strong as fuck what's the one that uh jeans shirt I just left it with that what's the one that kicked off the whole like oh the Gillette one like the one that kicked off the whole like fuck men advertising that one you know the fucking Gillette I don't know here's a while ago it's that I miss it it was like some outrage you must have talked about it which one wasn't it was holy it was about is this is this the best a man can get and then they wish and it was like the me to movement times up fucking the guys looking in the mirror himself and then it cuts to you now I remember yeah it was preposterous really high so no no I remember it now I blocked it out like a childhood molestation well then there was like a fake debate I always be like I'm never buying Gillette you know people are tweeting they're throwing out their fucking Gillette razors and I'm somebody totally goes great it's brilliant because it's to the women who were buying the razors but here's the thing the women are by rate they're not into that either so a woman that's buying razors for a man is also not into the fucking Gillette so whoever is in charge of the marketing it's their entire like what do you think that is do you think that's like someone who decides they're gonna cash in yeah well it's that man and they just say maybe there's an opportunity here to make some money dude wait okay I totally forgot what do you remember look at this the guy men with their fucking sick hunt now did you see what they just showed it's like his hand on her shoulder no it was a fucking sitcom where a white guy grabs his black maids ass and it's all men in the hahaha what fucking show was that this is a god I've just fucking grabbed his maids ass everyone's like yeah is there a show like that made with children no even then that's so fake that's such a bizarre but it's right you're dead right because it's a recreation of something that didn't really happen what is to be an example of that's not even like a mash-up of anything I've ever seen but it's like they made a fake TV show yeah it's like here's an example of the type of shows you like no one was watching that but that's not even a show right that's why so we are even it yeah so it's like a straw man show the whole thing is a fucking strong right but I mean that if there that's a weird way of doing it is that what they were depicting with a depicting a fake sitcom yeah face it you like it right which mean it seemed like it was friendly well that weird is that they don't have a real example how weird is that this is our gonna fix that right there yeah how weird is that like not even a puppet did shit like that on one of the puppet sitcoms from the 90s and that's weird to know his hand on that girl's shoulder and she had this weird look in her face like oh my god I know that's the craziest like if a woman I thought it was a Joe Biden campaign if you were working with the woman and she put her hand on your shoulder like that will you be it would be nothing um right yeah well it's not well it's not a good example to put in your ad I look in a real situation like hey I've felt this weird thing I'm sure there could be a situation that someone puts their hand on your shoulder and it's weird right oh yeah not automatically or or that you're they insulted you yeah when you put their hand on your shoulder why are you putting this the whole point that I can't get past is why the fuck is JIT what are you talking about boy arm where you tell me how great your razors are you fucks you should be begging me to buy your fucking man you fucking more they think it causes a scene people know cuz then you talk about it like on a podcast right and then they're like so you've got engagement that doesn't mean people are gonna buy this shit I'm not gonna not buy it I just think some marketing person fucked up I don't think it's representative of the whole company um some marketing person they just they decided they were gonna like yeah right hatch hitch a ride onto the back of this movement a bunch of things did yeah first ton of things isn't that weird when they do that it's like it's you think I'm so stupid I'm not gonna know what you're doing that you're because statistically you are that's they have some kind of research where they're like yes you are statistically it's like the letter from Nigeria tube wow it's like they're trying to be creative right so they like creative people that are making up these scenarios like there's a commercials like a little scenario here's we're gonna have a guy his Bush is too hairy he's posing for the picture with Roya they're gonna send into space but they want him to shave his sack of balls that's the show could you slow our show I want to show the guy going well we we want to use you but and the guy fuck and then you see him in the bathroom hold this but did you see Joey Diaz his balls we're on Twitch know they get Tommy Store got in trouble and there's like a real violation we what is it an FTC or FD where is the FDA but violated him they do in a commie store alive fucking balls cuz he pulls him out he's bored so Joey Diaz just pulls his balls out and he's holding on to them like he's got two kitten heads and an old lady's pantyhose fuck the biggest balls you've ever seen in your life isn't that a violation of twitch to fully have you yes they got kicked off at which it wasn't good but you got to see the video on my phone I saved it here's how good it was it was so good I screamed because I'm like this is gonna go away they're gonna pull this down because people are communists and they know they don't want to see something amazing so watch this so look that's a screenshot of someone filming it that looks like from dude I thought he had fake balls as a joke those are alive seen them for years I've said the first time I saw him was in 96 he's got a lot of ball skin dude his balls are soft balls they're soft balls stuffed in a flash cover oh my god Danny Burke's got his shirt off I just I'll donate money ya goddamn yeah because I'm just thinking of the amount of distance of scrotum you need to flop him out that amassed balls are preposterous he's obligated to take them out - you understand about do you get what he's saying he's not playing any games screengrab that's probably he'd go to jail for that or something everybody got assaulted I well until I saw the size of birds in a trap Burt's trapped never play - oh yeah he's trapped in and I always have to take my shirt off thing same thing happen to TIG Notaro how many ladies oh that's even darker I forgot about Tigs anyway terrible person I know I got so I imagine why can't women do that is there a topless female comic cuz you don't it's not when birds taking shirt off it's not like sexual except to like you know if you're Linda Bears right it's a woman that could do that same kind of thing she has to be not attractive hmm but that's the whole Bert thing listen be a guy you don't want to be that hot yeah well Bert's because his body's large I feel like it was his shirt off can anyone ever taking the shirt off no because it's part of the fun it's more than a pump like is it brave because you don't have to applaud him for that I just want to accentuate the comedy whereas the girls big tits don't really accentuate the comedy like Bert's big belly accentuates the comedy I mean it's like you're hanging out at a pool with Bert laughing that's what it the effect is it creates a girl just pulls her tits I was just weird if you're that kind of a fat guy that yeah I mean yeah I guess you better be like a baby on the end of it I guess well women could do it we would just have to be accustomed to it the problem is like if a woman just pulls her tits off tits out and starts telling Josh we don't usually if it was always like that it would be just like you see on those old documentaries of like you know yeah somewhere in Africa they all have bras and it's not a thing it just like exactly which is how human beings all of us used to be the whole planet before anybody figured out how to look if we Joey Diaz it balls were out all the time we all could well it sort of like it goes back to what we're saying about the the couple that they drew on that little plaque that they shot off into space boy when the aliens find out about Joey Diaz his boys they're gonna fucking check the space that that really should be sent to space to represent us who else loser earlier in the stream yeah what happened wait there was a different guys ball that Bobby Lee yeah he show his ass mmm these shows like a context for it he showed his whole asshole you know Bobby leaves another naked guy oh yeah yeah yeah he'll get naked I've seen Ari Shaffir his balls and dick multiple times as well he'll pull everything out no ya didn't already do something for skank fest aged naked you know R he's trying to become a shirt off guy he could he's always oh well he'll do it if he wants to whether he can or not he does shirt off walks takes pictures all the time sun's out guns out New York City yeah walks around quickly never seen a guy take to New York better than Ari Shaffir like a duck to water just might alright just right in his little pond ya know a spot as many trips across Asia probably helped him prepare he loves New York yeah I'm sick of it I mean I like I I liked it for a long time but I've got ferry it's a different way of living man I can't just have I don't want another winner like that goes to April that I have to I can't do it mmm I wonder how much of that has an impact who gets the most colds and flues is it people that live in the cold and the East Coast or are they more custom to it so they get less of them or is it people in the West it's it's how tightly packed you all packed in you are to other people that are gonna have it you know right that's probably why New York probably helps your immune system at some point when in New York because you just bombarded with fucking that makes sense that it would help your immune system except for something you don't have an immunity to like this corona virus which is why I was so bad in New York right because your immune system you know I just have no it's when you take your balls out I don't fucking I want to know at the end of the day what what happened it's just gonna everybody wants to draw a conclusion long before it would be awesome that they tested Joey Diaz his balls for Corona when I was testing he's patient zero you got to squeeze him out like that so there's a drop of blood what so how long from Bobby taking his ass out that's a good question which is more offensive Bobby's asshole or Joey Diaz's balls it's hard tough calls equally are well ones way more impressive Bobby these assholes are regular size as well be the same nature Wow you know it's like when you see a bird like a toucan has a crazy because it's fucking big holy shit is exactly like that yeah like an exotic bird yeah you see other birds they have normal beaks like even an eagle it's a normal beat right but then you see like a fucking like I said talked it would be like oh he's one of those set of balls at dogs yeah like a shoe bill big shoe bills from Africa that is a you seen one of those motherfuckers they call me the shoe bill cuz I got huge bald my favorite ridiculous birds to cans got a crazy one he's got a super bright one tell me that doesn't get him some pussy I don't know I don't know look at that picture that's you know I knew hot damn that's pretty I mean come on how psychedelic should I want to fuck that bird that bird is beautiful it really does look fruit-flavored I thought the cereal was making that up okay if that wasn't real that wasn't a real thing and someone drew that we go what is this the new fucking avatar monster what is that it does look like an Avatara on state it looks freakier than an avatar monster look how long that fucking beak is do you think dinosaurs are like that's probably all the dinosaurs were that kind of crazy planet percent I'm by the way 100% not Kate I don't know what I'm talking about but i think that's the it's been confirmed that birds are like leftover dinosaurs right what are those thing you know like big - can't nut there were big Dodos but they're all dead now terror birds oh yeah yeah we've talked about them a ton of times too much almost hey we kill humans we can kill by something that's stupid looking like you're like Nizoral dude the shoe bills the one who was talking about earlier look at that motherfucker that's a lot it's a kind of duck it's huge five feet tall and they they're so evil I'd I felt like Joey's dolls look friendlier than that bird look at that imagine that thing standing up like looking at you in the eye moving towards you thinking about eating you and I yeah I don't like the around the eyes as he looks like Ray Liotta too I don't like it like the Ray Liotta that was here in the helicopters overhead yeah Karen I needed that Karen why look at the fucking eyeball look look at the eyeball in that thing that thing doesn't or the fuck of you guys I like the sequel poster face Jesus Christ now imagine that but imagine it nine feet tall and that was those terror birds get a picture that's a bird that's aliveness a bird it's alive right now oh I thought it was like a CG oh dude I thought that was for one of those were they on discovery where they make the fake oh right right right like they reenact if you did it with murder you know this is a real bird it's a real bird that lives oh my god that's real yeah it lives in the Congo it lives in Africa his face with those fucking big man and really does look like a Reebok his fucking head some monster there's a crazy video of one of them eating a snakehead fish it's not really super new heads are the ones are like who will take all these snake heads off our hands because there's so many fucking snake heads well they're an invasive species so now we got to bring in these shoe belts look good thing that's this that's the fish yeah and this thing snatches it up and and and gobbles it oh and that thing breathes air and this motherfucker comes dude that's a grazie dinosaur looking face on that shoe head what's a call to shoe a shoe bill look at hitting that that's great I mean that is a fucking dinosaur I would think that was like a dog yeah you would think that's a fake thing it's a 5 foot tall bird where do they live those are in Africa but where oh well the documentary that I saw was there talking about the Congo look at his fucking shoulders and shit but I don't know what part of Africa they live oh and the goddamn it's crazy yeah crazy now imagine those fucking terrors the eyes it looks like a puppet they make a realistic puppet for one of those Discovery Dinitz Walking with Dinosaurs look at that looks like a goddamn animatronic so fake-looking they should never do CG because like puppets look more real I know well they have a real hard time with feathers and they have real hard time with fur it's hard to get fur to look completely realistically like I saw that new movie with Harrison Ford and the dog dogs fake dog yeah it's so weird it's weird it's weird cuz it doesn't get past the uncanny valley I would never get pet it's him looking and you're like I know you're not looking at a dog dude I call it the wild right isn't that what it is yeah it's all fake dogs fake wolves there's a lot of fake you know really dog in real life that you could kind of fake it with no man you gotta get these dogs do very specific shit it's weird it's real close real close that's not that was trying to put a little flourish in there too it's you love this dog though man okay members awful awful it's like yeah serious so it's always a little off who's the person there they got like a dwarf to be the I mean they didn't do shit man this is all I mean he's based on staring at the ground why would you an him it like like a dogs a Bigfoot or something that we we have to submit you gotta get the dog to do very specific things like some Ford did look a little bit CG he probably was this is like a low-key flex the dogs gonna say everybody should have made it all animated if they were going to do that yeah right right the people - right it would be kind of cool you're right yeah Express or something yes which is so creepy yeah like in the future like that that is gonna be a horror movie this is almost like Roger Rabbit if it wasn't funny though the the man acting with the animated yeah animal the call of the wild this is called the call anyway I've never read the book the call to when I was a kid but this is very different than the book they took a lot of liberties and there's a lot of things they changed well you know and also this into a movie I don't know if I could made if it was really good so yes it was actually really good it was a good movie it's like it's a good movie yeah but in terms of like a family movie oh right yeah watch movies with my kids right so there's a lot of movies that I watched that I know I'll never see that because I don't have kids so I'm taking some chances on some movies that were what's turned out to be a mistake well not that it was bad but that watched it with a nine-year-old Jojo rabbit oh yeah it's more serious it was about kids getting killed by nazis like hey maybe not right now yeah switch to Adam Sandler also we tried to watch the first season of Lost but we put on the first episode of the first season and when the guy gets sucked into the the airplane engine they show yeah I'm not watching people get sucked into engines after a plane crash the fuck is wrong with you I'm nine she's right feel like she's right the kids right yeah I haven't had to consider kids so I you know if I see my nieces that is Adam Sandler movies but which some of them are great there's some really inappropriate see which are though like the newer ones are which are the ones that are like the best is Owen Zohan is one of the funniest movies in ever I like the zone it is a fucking funny movie it is you know funny yeah I like that movie it's like the end I was it was like ridiculous yeah the same thing you know sort of kind of preposterous but it was you got me I'm going with you the whole ride yeah you know what else is a funny movie man like an unapologetically ridiculously funny movie oh his fucking have a network do you see his Netflix no really good Deena white loved it he's awesome man he's a great guy I've met him a few times he's very very very nice guy but his movies are so unapologetically funny like just goes for all the ridiculous jokes yeah well there's like you get a Zohan azov it's like dick jokes and sex Joe it was like although he got that blowback because of on a talk show he said like I was just going on vacation with the last couple something right that that's remember there was like I was attention he got blowback yeah cuz he said like the ones that aren't that good like the ones they're good I remember they're like you know like I remember Simpsons lines or what you know like fucking Billy Madison right that shit usually got a bunch of people amber and then no more there's Lady Gilmore's our classic that's a happy gilmore though but the ones that I don't know if they didn't do well that like there with what's-her-name from et Jubei more yeah I think that it's like those ones he said something like the last few movies are just going on vacation I think it probably he probably didn't mean it like I don't think he was like phoning in Adam Sandler confirms that his movies well see them all so he could just be being he could be just being funny and they you know you know because I have done that I've done that since 50 first dates Sandler explained it was written in another place I said imagine if we did it in Hawaii how great would that be and they said yeah that's a very artistic idea I've been doing that ever since he's just saying he does movies and vacations at the same time that's pretty wise yeah well that it's a it sounds like it got made into a thing by it article you know what they are dude they're like they're just funny alright he just tries to do the funniest thing and for whatever reason some people have decided that that's dumb because there's some movies that don't do that there's like Coen Brothers movies we're more sophisticated humor that still are they like you just as hard I like all those Cobra the movies but I never thought of them as like like the who's that something like that what's the bowling one holds a pretty fucking good pretty fucking good that's a brilliant movie that's a brilliant did you you know what I saw it fairly recently a friend of mine showed me with nail and I you hear that now what is it it's from like the 80s and it's fucking George Harrison from the Beatles like produced it's a comedy fucking hilarious dude really I never I heard of the title by never seen it and I don't remember in Wayne's World there that guy was like a roadie who would tell crazy stories yeah that character they took from this movie and that's what he's doing it's the same actor whoa it's that guy's in it and this guy does that help dude I I had never seen it it was fucking hysterical Wow they're like out-of-work actors and they live in this fucking rat infested like in part you know cuz they're alcoholics and they go to the country to get away from their stress I don't really spoil it it's really goddamn funny there's some great fucking old movies that slip through the cracks or this one I like like I like Blazing Saddles really yeah like of like you could make that now I like it like that it really is fucking classy I like I never I heard of it never watch it was fuckin funny mmm I'll check it out I'll check it out yeah it's you know who still makes movies the same way is Tarantino he still makes hyper I like that new one I enjoyed it I enjoyed it a lot once upon a time in Hollywood but I just have a foot fetish so that's why I'm in time yeah yeah did you see that Bruce Lee do you believe the Bruce Lee what do you think that whole Bruce Lee thing is about well I've talked about it almost too much but in the interest of keeping up this conversation I don't think he's right he tried he depicted Bruce Lee in a way that made him look like an asshole right and I think Bruce Lee was very confident but I don't think it's really any evidence that he was a dipshit and then that way they make him out to be kind of a dipshit and there was a real instance and this is what I've talked about before like Bruce Lee had relationships with people that were stuntmen in a positive way and one of them was gene LeBell gene LeBell a famous guy was a judo champion who taught Bruce Lee a lot of Juno moves and they worked together in several movies and but gene LeBell if he had an actual fight with Bruce Lee the way Brad Pitt did gene LeBell woulda killed him I mean gene LeBell was a real gigantic man a gorilla of a man right it was a really strong guy who was also a judo champion I mean his grappling so it seems like had a like a gripe it or he just wanted to make bruce lee it build yeah that's the problem it's like this there's this so there's bruce lee getting his ass kicked by this guy who's just a random tough guy and they get in this I mean that's what they don't tell you that he was so doctor killed his strong wife on this book what's that he was here remember he may be killed his wife who may be killed their wife the Brad Pitt guy that beats up Bruce Lee did he really in the movie they suggested he killed it what was it from what I'm not trying to remember that now it's that's why they didn't like him on the set remember like the the australian lady damn and i forgot that he was on the belt and his wife's like bitching him out and he just hold her spear gun and then it never resolves oh honey that's always rumored that he killed his wife but nobody ever knew for sure that was like the so when he fought bruce lee yeah he was a kid yeah he was a carol baskin a but with sharks this is from your mom's house but um don't blame me i don't know i mean she seemed like she did it but I don't I wouldn't want it way into that yeah I don't always steer clear of tiger people and all good man don't buy a Porsche get it taut if you want to get laid get a fucking tiger yeah Jesus Christ they all start like a little sex cult around themselves yeah like why is that do you think you think is they're dealing with those Tigers they're feeling I mean I like shooting guns that's like a feel it's fun like walking a tiger must feel like whatever that is like times a million yeah be like if you just hung out with what a fucking shoe bill that followed your commands if you were dealing with giant cats all day how freaked out you'd be well that they getting off on that this cats not killing them when it easily could they're all getting off on that it's like exciting to pee and plus what people just love animals so you get to mix like we really primal feelings together like yeah and then the holes beat that's why a lady got her own bit off but she's like don't blame the tires make she shouldn't it's her goddamn fault to work there yeah for what they have a taste you know it's he now that was a big part of the movie that was a profit of the accident no she's transgender she's a he no oh really yeah that was a big part of the controversy that they had misgendered her they missed out here in the television oh my god I thought I had done it I don't know she you but you did because you said she we can blame the doc I'm as mad about this documentary as everyone else that was the information I had to work with brother that's a dark moment when a tiger takes your fucking hand you see it but okay you know when they talk about like if a bear gets a taste for human it's bad like if a tiger got taste for specifically my arm like I don't want to work with that tiger oh my god you know there's some moments in that that show one of them were the Tigers dragging him away by his foot remember that oh yeah and he shoots the gun it's like son fucking bitch fucking bitch remember like it's the tiger let's go but he's like literally holding a it's holding on to his foot and dragging him away Wow yeah I didn't see that point I'm thinking about in Tiger King I missed that one I haven't seen all of them I've seen most of it the thing grabbed his feet and was pulling but why and he don't know because it's being a tiger no I'm sorry what was the situation he was inside the cage of the Tigers and everything was cool but then one of them grabs him by the foot it's checking out his feet won't leave him alone and then grabs him by the foot and drags him away do you mean the way he was kind of try Wow so he's hitting at it with a stick and then he pulls pulls out a gun and when he pulls out his gun he shoots near it and it lets go oh it's a loud noise yeah it's a loud noise so he it lets go but he starts screaming I mean fucking bitch so he thinks it in the in the show he said he thinks that someone put something on his shoes Oh sardine oil yeah well that was what the lady had said like to get a cat to eat Carol Baskin by the way I don't know if she did this is just your mom's house they told me to wear it they do they have a little our opinion cannot put that on there I know right but they anyway he almost had to shoot the cat was pulling him away by his feet for some reason maybe has some nice Jordans or something you know I think it probably feels like if it smell like I would just imagine leather to a cat unless it's like really smells like delicious beef joy seems like some kind of a meat product yeah wouldn't it I mean it's probably fun to bite I mean dogs bite shoes but they're they just bite it cuz it's soft and it feels good or do they know it's leather they know it's leather that'd be crazy if they knew I know but I mean they know it's not some sort of an animal product maybe I don't know I don't know a lot of stuff like further for a dog like if you just had raw leather laying around a dog would be like why can't I just eat this I think this is food they did walk up to like I to dogs I remember them being a particular way at leather no but like shoes are things you wear so your smells on them you just I think the sheen arrived that like it somewhere you sent out yeah but don't people give their dogs leather to toys right I never did so I don't know no never no I think rawhide is leather rawhide is toys yeah rawhide sure I thought they were edible yeah they are edible it's edible leather yeah the leather is edible leather leather is edible was yeah yeah it's just really really tough like I'd like a jacket if you were starving you could eat your chair people in the depression actually boiled their shoes and ate their shoes that was a shoe city people they choose that's how much people were starving to death that was a real thing Jesus Christ yeah now eating shoe leather was like would people would talk about like the lowest point of people being decimal had to eat food Jesus Christ right oh my god that's that's real depression we would have been thankful for bats I can answer you know what Swardson said to me well I did awesome in a text group group text with him he said a friend of his is a sheriff and they said they used to deal with maybe one suicide a week you're not a dealing with as many as five a day where I probably shouldn't say in the Hollywood no you probably shouldn't yeah well I mean this is a very it's crazy but that never like a podcast or something people that are used to doing it like doc didn't stand up feels very very weird I get I'm disoriented like what day it is and like because I didn't realize how much I was like timing my life out for him like when I had spots right and depended upon it artistically to write yeah absolutely people have they've hit this weird breaking point it's we're like six weeks in right and people are really antsy for things to open back up again so who's like and additional tension that seems to be in the air well maybe it's time for celebrities to sing us to sleep with us don't stand so close to me yeah that's a creepy song uh right it's not a song about uh I guess priek Ovid nineteen it's creepy but don't stand so close to me isn't it about like a teacher and a young girl is that what it's about this subject of school well if he was saying come closer schoolgirl I was hitting on him he's the teacher and she's hitting on him here we go young teacher the subject of schoolgirl fantasy she wants him so badly knows what she wants to be inside her there's no room hmm this girl's an open page book markings so she's so close now this girl's half his age don't stand so close to me because they're fucking yeah well her friends are so jealous you know how bad girls get sometimes it's not so easy to be the teacher's pet temptation frustration so bad it makes him cry wet bus stop she's waiting his car is warm and dry don't stand so close to me loose talk in the classroom fucking voice holy fuck he starts to shake he starts to cough kovat 19 to hurt they try and try strong words in the staff room the accusations fly it's no use he Cesar he starts to shake he starts to cough just like the old man in that famous book by now bação leal doesn't stand so this is that's the whole song okay that song is a paedophile song that's not about a guy getting tricky well don't do you say a guy getting tricked into fucking for tonight it's a song about a guy who's getting lured in by a young Lolita I mean that's what it's you sing so badly you know and then then it's not so easy to be the teacher's pet all right they're out together they're in the car together it's raining out it's cars warm and dry as another no dude it until you told me that I've never in I don't know how long I've heard that song like thirty years however long it was around thought that was what I've listened to it so many times like not that I even sought it out but just over and over again and never that's what it was that's why it doesn't matter about lyrics like because no it's dude that she used to move on when I was in high school Spanish teacher in my school I knew someone that happened to the song was penned by Sting who just happened to have a former career as a teacher before the rock stardom came calling do I told a story about it it used to fuck their students back then I was 17 and the guy was a Jamestown man he's a handsome young man he's one of my favorite teachers anyway they fucked sure I was in high school everybody was like a bunch of girls I knew were dating some guy that was like could probably have gone to jail yeah but a few people I told the story on re-show I knew somebody who like it was a he was in high school and hooked up with his geometry teacher and they end up being married when I was in high school I dated a girl she was a very nice girl but she was also naughty and this naughty girl fucked in older man who had a boat and sounds like such a good like song her friend fuck the guy anyway she was a naughty girl older man very nice she's adventurous and one I think she said it was like like he gave her a hard time about it she's like motherfucker I'll turn you in to the police oh so much yeah we're doing a problem show years ago you know like I don't think do that here but in New York the club's I promised even a bunch of like Long Island High School's go to comedy shows after their prom yes I I did that at Dangerfield's yeah right I'm wearing field sales so one of the limo drivers I don't know who asked him like do you ever look like cuz the probably the girls look like kids like a like it was crazy how much they look like kids to me but high school kids right there would be a couple year like oh that looks like an older kid but they are like kids but somebody asked the driver one time a driver a girl I remember she was 16 he said but she did came on to him and they fought and she goes how much she makes and I I think I was like I don't know like 500 bucks I'm shows I think you made 200 and took $300 off this thing oh my god yeah like that's a really advanced fucking thing to do stole 300 bucks and fucked him it's an interesting call because she like turned herself into a prostitute I just like don't know why you would make that although I remember uh remember to catch a predator when they it would cut like half those people seemed like they would go to anybody who had written back again I got a theory about that - about why guys are into like high school kids well I think there's some guys out there that hit a point in their life like maybe like right after they graduate where their life got really fucked up and it didn't so I've heard the sting song it got really fucked up and it didn't go anywhere and they wanted to like relive their childhood Yeah right went back to high school like maybe they have a lot of regrets they got they got clown but it is that kind of thing where it's like you wanted a thing that you you're you stuck in a certain yeah yeah well there's the thing with women - that's why a lot of women wind up fucking high school boys right women there's teachers how many times you heard that story how many growing up it's constant the funny thing is they barely get arrested like most the time they don't do any time I saw one recently there's a lot of places she was fucking a 16 year old boy and they just said don't do it anymore and they gave her like one year probation where was this I forget they gave her cool orders knock it off stop it just people what you call form stronger but if it was a guy that was fucking up 50 or 60 we're just happy it's not a cousin go home just happy it's not a guy the guys doing it they would do it want that guy locked up in a cage for sure but it's interesting well I agree with it it makes sense but it's still it's right kind of crazy yeah I don't mean I guess to so many features blow their students I mean it's just it's just the only ones you hear about are the ones where these pussies can't keep their mouths shut well I know some have to go to their mom and go to the teachers and go to the cops you know what it depends if you're a fucking kid or not like I'll tell you find out what it is if if I was like 16 when I was in high school like 16 I was as kid of a 16 year old you can because we were religious so oh okay I had no really what I mean so do you think that those the guys that they try to fuck or do you think they go after like the young football player guys I think it's all kinds of different like if you're a crazy girl who wants to relive childhood relive high school so you go I think someone strikes your fancy and they probably never thought it would be like that I think it's like maybe they think I'm pure you know maybe they think like when I was in high school that boy wouldn't give me the time of day if I was in high school with him but now I can fuck them because I'm 32 and I'm the teacher do you think is that thought through 100% it's all planned out there's journals with Maddox and German oh is their journey they had a map of how they wanted to go down and all the friends are connected and one of those little circles with all the lines that come out with different names who was the one that they made that movie about with nicole kidman what she gets I mean there's a real story of someone which something you know the teacher got the kid to kill her husband oh right that was and that uh that was uh was that in New Hampshire where was that yeah then there's a documentary about her where it like me it's so fucking crazy story was that was that Pam smart yes Pamela smart yeah I remember that man because everybody had jokes about that when I was in 88 when I was just starting to do stand-up it was right around then that had happened when I was in open my curse everybody had like Pam smart jokes to die for yeah they what did the real Pam smart look like not that good well keep in mind that's imprisoned well it's just not fair that's their yeah she's pretty cute with some fucked up Revere hair look at her hair go back to that picture again what year is that what year of hair was that because I remember that when like something the 80s for sure goes under like that big money here yep in the 80s yeah to die for was 95 yeah you're not it's hard to fuck with a 1995 Nicole Kidman right that's what year it was I'm not as good yeah yeah it's fine it's more accurate but I think like well the Kidman was supposed to be just a character based on her but it's fine right because if you're doing an actual real life story you would really if you had a teacher that looked like Nicole Kidman it would change the narrative like there's a weird there's no 100% oh this is a weirdness if it's a big fat lady right it's a big fat the god that I knew the guy that I knew the teacher was hot and everybody was like well yeah exactly what we saying tonight for is like loosely based on that movie loosely based fired yeah yeah so here's the problem with that if like Salma Hayek like hot Salma Hayek from dust to darkness right that one in her prime remember when there was another foot thing with Tarantino oh yeah where it's a shot off her feet four feet know when you hear it and then you look back you're like wait a minute there was a 20-minute flick seen and every fucking Kill Bill she's like now wiggle your toes it's like camera hangs on toes for a while until they until I come what what kind of a chance does he have a saying no he's got zero chance buddy mythological creatures based on their what hot she was Yeah right fuck out of here man she was so smoking and still is she's still hot as fuck yeah Ludi without a foot fetish that foot thing is like I would do that yes exactly exactly she's beautiful now imagine if she is the teacher and some 15 year old 16 year old boy if she the teacher let's not say it's hurt let's say it looks like we could be like your cousin or something like that but really hot just as hot as our son say it sir let's not be disrespectful someone equal scale of hotness to Salma Hayek fucks your 16 year old boy like what chance does he have a saying no to that how about zero but some like consider zero zero you know beyond beyond consent you know that's I think that's the entire idea of a cat being a kid the thing about it yeah but the thing about it is if he was 18 he'd be psyched for him just two more years if he just lived 24 months look better that's that's who somebody said it to me maybe Annie cites me she's like if it is just like a year like why can't you wait a year some I think it's uh I think it's like arbitrary they say look grown women they want to fuck 17-year olds don't have a year to wait those bitches are all crazy you know they don't that's right that's right no time to wait fucking try and chase him down because I will a high school student help your credit card you know some of those women are married some of those were in a marriage think how are the people married and they wind up fucking their students I was never around that I never experienced that as a kid where a teacher female hot teacher fucked any of my friends yeah no I never had that do it it's if it's a gym teacher on somebody in my school I remember a female gym teacher does male gender and somebody else but that makes sense then he just got fired but wait just listen you know I could be wrong I think the guy that need the weight room at the school had a weight room you know he'd go to after school and the guy I remember hearing some shit like that about the guy that was like ran the weight room that he's one of the gym teachers I remember he was very always very grabby and like oh I didn't think it was just it was very Joe Biden II like shoulder rubs and you know like I got hairy legs he just wanted to press your leg head and then you press is like a downhill big deal just presses like hair down everybody likes kids playing with their leg hair it's fun yeah just don't totally normal to talk about two of you running for president dude that fucking is that from the corn pop thing let the corn pop speech yeah the thing about I got hairy legs yeah yeah yeah yeah something about going by the pool yes he was a lifeguard and yeah fucking stared down the local gang leader corn pop is that what the story is yeah and he had a chain and then they were gay instead of fighting they became friends huh and he was like I'm sorry I called you yesterday from with razor wielding gangster name yeah they used to rust their razors in a raised barrel that's a real story whole story the same with the pool it's just I only heard the the legs in the pool part I think I didn't know about this other guy cuz now I might need to hear that these are we allowed to play this is this news how's this work yeah okay let's hear the audio see what it says there's a three meter board did you fell off sideways you landed on the damps the darn cement over there in corn pop was there a laugh track on this one the corn pop is he prohibited well I did and back in those days and shot things have changed one of the things had to use if you use pomade in your hair you had to wear a baby cap and so he's up on the board would enlist him I said hey Esther you off the board or I'll come up and drag you off well he came off and he said I'll meet you out side my car this was mostly these were all public housing behind it my car there was a gate on here I parked my car outside the gate and I said I'll be waiting for you a bird three guys and straight razors not a joke there's a guy named Bill right-mouse the only white guy and he did all the pools he was mechanic and I said what am I going to do he said come down here in the basement where mechanics were all the pool builder is you know the chain that used to be a chain that went across the deep end and he cut off a 6-foot length of chain you fold up he said you walk out with that chain and you walked in a car and say you may cut me man but I'm gonna wrap this chain around your head I said you kidding me he said no if you don't don't come back and he was right so I walked out with the chain and I walked up to my car and they had stepped those days used to remember the street raised you and bang him on the curb get him rusty put him in a rain barrel get him rusty and I looked at him but I was smart then I said first of all I said well I tell you get off the board you get off the board I'll kick you out again but I shouldn't have called you after what is I apologize we're almost done we're almost done keep it going for a second it's only a few more seconds to go he said you apologize to me I said I apologize but I'm not for throwing you out but I apologize to what I said he said okay close the straight razor my heart began to beat again dad a polite were those children being by the way during that fucking um that was one of the things I was gonna say when I pause it like no one's paying attention to him all those kids are talking they all went through a happy place they're all just talking yeah this guy's running for president and they're behind him and he's on stage was this a president a president stump think so knows I don't know what it is but he's running for president while this is going on for sure he's gonna be was look there's that thing the city of where is it because it says it on that little city symbol that's on the front of the podium Dell so who set this up where you have a bunch of kids onstage behind him not paying attention why he gives us long-winded story about razor blades and chains and basically they apologize to each other and then it's crazy in flight that he's a presumptive it's crazy to run him it's absolutely fucking crazy it's weird man it's weird you know you know what's interesting some I it was interesting talking to Owen Smith yesterday because I love Owen these are really brilliant brilliant comedian like one of the best guys I know you know and we were talking about and he said I like the Biden makes me think it like makes me feel like things would be normal again like I think I saying the people that go like don't provide and that's not a small amount of people yeah there's like so Obama rubbed off on it but yeah Biden was never a guy who's gonna get elected before that he's certainly not now it it's just trying to get that that feeling back and it's not coming back they got a fuckin but you've never seen a greater example of team loyalty that yeah and this this one right here that's what this is 100% because no one on the left wants to talk about these crazy long-winded speeches and things that don't make no sense the lefties I learned about it watching why think jimmy dore the people on the left this is why they lost i mean i say that they lost when fucking and that came out but they're like the people who people on the left didn't want him and no and they weren't on board Bernie like Bernie say and I go along with Biden people were following Bernie cuz that what they thought his policies would be not necessarily like a cult of personality so they don't give a shit if Bernie says vote for button they're like they were voting for way more lefty shit yeah and not the normal feeling in fact they they hate those the real lefties can't stand like a Owen Smith Democrat right above all else they wanted it changed they wanted the real lefties want everything yeah the Republicans had to have their thing where Trump just trash he trounced them when he came in right and they had they're like wow they they're like his bitch now and so they had that fight there's no one Joba uh Bernie was never gonna make do that with the Democrats isn't crazy it's all about likability and electability like that's really what it's all about when people lie simple clear message dude a simple clear message and see the barn thing you're right that people just want to feel normal again like yeah I don't know how that was Owens take those how he felt him personally yeah that if they could make that into a slogan I just want to feel normal again that would be like a Magga for them but somebody's got to come up with that well dude you got to look back in time and you look at history all the mistakes that were made throughout history you know that's what you're reading about when you're reading about lost wars and invasions that went terrible you're hearing about trials and errors and mistakes well as we see people's fucking principles hell yeah because I mean wasn't it the specially Biden the thing of all the people that were crowing about believe her and all that shit right that are like well you can't believe sometimes people are lying oh why they know when he came after him yeah that's really despicable yeah well there's only a few people out there that don't do that that are in like the media that are in this that sort of the media loves this shit more than I mean how they hate Trump when it's like 90% their fucking fault part it's there's a lot of different things going on did you see like sports it's like you want your team to win it's a lot that's a huge amount of that place you know that movie annihilation with Natalie Portman yeah that was the one where they there was a by the same guy who made ex machina right yes said it yeah that was really good remember the end and Natalie Portman and there's like don't spoiler alert it for everybody this is quarantine people could see that movie now all right well when you see this like they've had enough time to watch it I'm just kidding when she's there's a thing of her that's rainbow-colored that's like a duplicate of her that she's trying to run it's pressing her against the door she's fighting it and then she stops for a minute and then she gives it a grenade and pulls it and Walt and gets away by being call the more she would fight it would give equal reaction back at her that's what these people it's like Trump's your fucking reflection and you hate it and the more they fight it the more it presses them back up against the door and and that's that's what there's no never gonna figure out how to just like give him the grenade and pull the pin and walk away because they can't like a he definitely makes mistakes but they are also so wrapped up in everything that he does in a way that they distort even things that probably turned out to be a good idea plans for that he does that every the people that it just could get ruined by one minor thing you're like I'll do a thing every fucking day and what are you gonna do and people like these go like a bunch of you just don't follow him or they like it's genius do I you hate his guts you can't say it wasn't very smart so wound up but this is look anytime you get too emotional about things your your view of things get distorted it's one things that happens in fights all the time you see fighters talk shit to each other right and one of the reasons why they talk shit to each other because they're trying to get the other person emotionally invested in the fight right they're trying to get them angry and pissed off where they gonna do something irrational they're not gonna be logical right but that's what you're seeing that with him you know instead of them analyzing it it's like everything is a personal affront and he because I've done it must be selected people that vote for a field like that Obama feeling that's why it's such an offense it's about anything Obama did or didn't do its the feeling that I got it's it's been offended right well that's what I want that back always said about him like forget about his policies like he was a great statesman the way he would talk yes that's the thing yes he was reserved and he was articulate and smooth and when you would hear I'm talking like that's an excellent representation of the United States yeah right that's our that's our one of our top dudes makes sense yeah right yeah and and like even-keeled didn't get exact certain bourgeois norms Yeah right where's like the thing with Trump is that he's you know like he said he's not really a politician so he's just being guy who's always been and everybody's like I thought you were gonna be a president though I thought you're gonna act like we need cuz you want to be called poet I thought people got him for specifically the opposite of that it's like and that shit's done now so people still want that the west wing or whatever the fuck like that's what it is it's like you're west wing kind of people because you want your form real reform you should be kind of happy that he exposed it what I think it exposes is how not rigged it is because if someone controlled it no fucking way you really might roll some of it you can yeah yes done yeah the fucking of Bernie who's gonna win the fuckin of Bernie though it's crazy it's like you're watching Bernie's not to be prised listen if you get bulldoze like that you're not right I think he's a really good man I think is why he's unfit to be the president you can't this is not a job for that well this is one of the reasons why they're so scared at Tulsi Gabbard because she doesn't lay down like that you see yeah once she had that moment with Camille Harris in the debates oh yeah it was great by the way it's fucking amazing instead of saying wow this lady's dynamic they're like oh shit we can't really control her she's gonna attack our lady yeah that's after people she's saying things that you know you really if you you want your team to win you're not gonna give up those cards so early um but well they haven't there's an internal thing you got to settle with all the people that are let the actual left that are like mad and they want their Trump yeah right so they're not gonna go along with the same cuz cuz I think a lot of like just liberals don't get that the lefties hate you more than they hate uh not seen they hate you more than any right winger just a regular liberal that's who they want to get them that's why they turn on Ellen or whoever the fuck yeah cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you right there's no one's gonna pass the purity test no one they're just looking for something and I think that again it goes back to the thing like that's not nice like if all your your constant now is not the time to be nice Joe now is the time for Rage yeah there was someone that someone wrote something about oh that guy from CNN what's his name brian Stelter Stelter that looks like divine out of drag that's that guy he wrote something about about the the like angry journalism right yet what do you bro but it was like widely criticized why well because it was like basically he's admitting that this is not you're not doing journalism this is like editorial it's an actual direct very yeah yeah it's like you're that guy Joey for activism more than you're calling for marketing the news it's just and just believe that you're correct so you're gonna like push your idea I mean this is what we would go to the news what I really want is someone who's gonna tell us exactly what happened without any political bend to it that's what the way I still even saying that I still expect I'm probably gonna see a little bit of it people figure II and there's probably gonna be that and when I was a kid it was like that but not near to now where it's become like a Miss a caddy gossip mixed with news yeah now it's fucked because it's all - it's all because women shared more online that's why they're targeting the emotions of women that that's specifically this is a design this is what the same thing we're talking about with the Elan Mustang like how could you say that he didn't do that when he can he can show you all these tweets like how can you how can you accuse someone just out to get him dude I mean right like how was that where are we in the news it's like if you some rapper talking about how the cops won't leave him alone like he's like a guy like the cops are always gonna bother him on you know like that he just got on the bad side of it's an institution and all these institutions if you talk about they hate you like though they have it in for you it's great think it like a cop it's corrupt going but well the thin blue line and block might but you're a fucking dirty like yeah but we're that's how they are with Elon Musk so they were with a bunch of people that's so crazy it's not like so much about justice let's say as it is about processing in the system and shit that's what their that's their job okay and that's what they that's what they fucking did you find his quote a bunch of people had made a meme out of it and we were passing it around him I forget the expression that he used but I've read real really wish I could remember because I looked at someone's uh tweet about it or Instagram about it and they were saying finally you know you're admitting what what you really do finally you're admitting that your rage journalistic instincts are show oh yeah rights rage journalism you know it's been open for it they've been opening like that for a while I feel like we need somewhere that's gonna give us the information just clear one hundred percent dedicated to factual information without any political Bend at all no one's well the people somebody would be like it's not possible so it might not be my politic it's got to be possible used to be possible yeah it's got to be possible to just just read the news because if you if you look at it like there's got to be some other does that will start getting views and you know what I mean if somebody who fills that niche right it will be successful because there's gonna be people who should be able to report on maybe dumb shit that Trump tweets and also report at report on the the really important things that are happening that are good for they should just stop reporting on Trump's tweets just try it just fucking try it for a minute you're playing right into his hand first it's like anihilation look what each side like he do and then while while they do that he gets like a judge in or something he does that all the time yeah it's very savvy dude you're always very savvy in a lot of ways it's like the the fake not sophisticated language that he uses it's almost like he uses that to kind of throw you off the trail I'm like Don King with the crazy hair he's got his own crazy hair it's almost like in some ways it throws something about crazy hair that really uh it throws you off the trail but it's you know there's no there's no newspaper or no no thing that I subscribe to or I don't get at least some political bias one way or the other you know what just clearly mark the stuff that's editorial or like you know this is not news just market is that if the house I'm have news and then out the news you save one for the part that it goes yeah just do their job you don't have to fucking uh to the Daily Show I blame a lot of this on The Daily Show not because it was bad a whole bunch of people that became news for them right and so then all like all the other ones like why don't we have it like Daily Show but more news than comedy so true people it's terrible it's terrible it's such a good point that I never even saw yeah I'm sure someone said it but it's a it's a great point it's right that's news for a lot of kids like college kids they're barely paying attention that flipping through Comedy Central and Jon Stewart's in there telling them what's going on in their hilarious way in a hilarious Trevor Noah want like that's a different generation cuz I would just be like why is it highway like I know it I met him before like I like him but I'm just a fan like why you have some guy that shows not American white like what is with a guy with a foreign accent here it's beautiful all these all these shows that I like the admit it's always some enough from here that's interesting like John Oliver same things I know I even like him he's they seem to have a fucking what do you call it like a I don't have that kind of feeling of like I like I always have a level of that like a good fuck you right like I can't imagine going England's doing a political show about their politics this is kind of funny so it's just like a thing that uh you could probably do it like if you went to Ireland do some time but Holland yeah he had a show in Holland that wasn't even the Tom Rhodes show here to play a character the character not show host yeah well he couldn't just be a talk shows no no so instead of Tom Rhodes he'd be like um Pete McGillicuddy like you had it but then it's a talk show it was like the people Gila Cudi show starring Tom Rhodes or something like that not Pete McGillicuddy was the name of it that's right you know starring it wasn't like a sitcom though right no but it was like a talk show host where a talk show rather where he would play a guy that was demeaning Kevin masters I mean did that what they did or they just all at the Kevin Masters show and he would say I'm Tom Rhodes I don't know is it like a joke of late hell no get the joke he could only pull off in Hall [Laughter] Kevin masters was a generic American and the producers used to fill in until they find an actual host Holland's a fascinating place man it's a fascinating place because it was like when the first place where people go to get high I haven't either but it's also the place that produced some of the best kick boxers ever why did I kind of need a shitload of them came out of Holland Van Hollen is like the motherland for badass kick boxers like when you hear about a kickboxer you hear about from Holland it's like hearing about a jiu-jitsu blackbelt is from Brazil you like whoa like Holland yeah why is it do their animals in Belgium have a lot of like Van Damme II kind of people too I'm sure they do I don't know anything about Belgium but I know corazon with stripes Roland right with black and white checkered vans on Holland has also really large people like I think the average height for a man is six feet tall is that right yeah women are really big there too they have a bunch of great heavyweight kick boxing champions like Peter Aerts he came out of Holland as a show man even esto host Ernesto Hoost is like one of the most brilliant beautiful technicians of all time he came out of Holland is a kickboxing that of like that in jiu-jitsu at the - in MMA is that like the things like you everybody basically you just have to know yeah you have to know wrestling - yeah yeah but wrestlers have to know submissions as well and everybody has to know stand up because you're standing up yeah you got but it's there's a few guys stand up when you say stand up you mean striking I got my G box I got a spot distort all areas so I didn't even think about it that way I have in my mind I have two different types of stand-up that I don't even I just say it I got to work on your standup like people do say that like you got to work on your stand-up and that funny holy shit striking that's right that's what it means but it basically means stuff that you do on your feet it's been working a lot on stand up do you remember you ever seen like I remember seeing it on like a Star Trek episode or anything any kind of sci-fi where they tried at the martial arts of the future like this martial artist Paul the culmination of all and they did it on a Star Trek like this is their future martial arts it's nothing like MMA I don't remember it's like ridiculous it was like a ridiculous high kicking like well that's where Bruce Lee was brilliant we kind of figured it out Bruce Lee in a lot of his movies sort of depicted mixed martial arts fights do you think in your life that Bruce Lee could beat Brad Pitt in real life though he would have fought anybody man not like that that's that was if you get back to that story about Quentin Tarantino's depiction of him I don't think he would have done that I think he would have behaved like that he wasn't a buffoon you know he was a he was a tough guy I'm sure he was very confident but when you read the things that he wrote and when you see the interviews that he gave where he talks about things he was a very deep thinker he wasn't he wasn't a buffoon he would talk about things in a very profound way so just the way I didn't like how they portrayed Charles Manson either in that movie it's Tom O'Neill's chaos Charles Manson the CIA in the secret history of the 60s if you just listen to the audio version of anything gave me this but the fucking podcast I did with him Ballu my mind oh yeah things are crazy but this one this one's even more crazy because it's all about the psychiatrists that were experimenting on hippies with acid isn't that why the Unabomber fucking yes because they did a hippie experiment on him when he was like a teenager it was part of the Harvard LSD raise yeah yeah that's fucking crazy dude they did it to a lot of people that's what this this book ultimately turned out to be about Tom O'Neill wrote this over 20 years took 20 years for him to put all this together he started as a small story like I think was like a 5,000 word story for vana fair or no premier premier magazine that magazine eventually went under and then he got a book deal and he missed a deadline because he kept diving deeper and deeper into MKULTRA and CIA yeah dude it oh it's crazy did uh this book is a mind-blower cuz it's all factual he's got sixty pages of references and citations at the back of it I will totally listen to this book since I can't get it yeah did um they sold out I didn't prepare you have you ever read is the manifesto of the Unabomber man no I didn't I didn't it's crazy how how almost reasonable assess like technology is going to be a problem it's very weird just like I don't see the connection of we blew these people up for the Hewlett point you all agree with it but it almost there so rational it sounds like he came from the future and he had to make those bombs I bet that's what he thought I mean it that it it reads like that it's wild dude there's a guy named jolly West that's a part of these MKULTRA experiments and he's connected to the Manson Family and all these other different people but that was a lie the Manson Family because Charles Manson was a guy that for sure they gave me acid they gave massive in prison at least the way they're describing the possibility he was even talking about certain doctors and he has the the last name the doctors the last name of the doctors a part of this program and doctors had treated him I was in prison and he comes out of prison and there's evidence that he gets released over and over and over again every time he violates parole someone on high wants him out on the street and he's got a large supply of acid and he's got very sophisticated techniques that he's utilizing that he learned in jail sophisticated like nique somehow to brainwash hippies on acid get him to fuck each other by the way get Hughes orgies purchased up a very manipulative criminal yeah it's not you can figure out how to manipulate him you certainly don't need Rainey for that but we're talking about within two years he's got a murdering people I think the pimp lessons he learned help them do that you know it's that their disassociation with reality through LSD through through constant trips daily trips I think you almost had to I think like for brainwashing I'm just saying I don't I'm sure you did that yeah I don't know that he did it for the CIA like I could easily see him for his own reasons brainwashing people that let me clarify when I say he was a part of a CIA experiment I don't mean he did what he did for the CIA what I meant they let him do what he was doing and they that's very belief gave him drugs that's like this story yes that's very believed if if you're letting this guy keep getting released every time he Rob's a car or someone's house or when you know you you think he's gonna somehow or another be locked up and you want him out on the street doing this thing and they were trying to discredit the hippie movement and the anti-war movement back right and that's part of the way they did it they infiltrated these groups in one way or another and one of them would be to take a guy like no yeah I like them it's like oh the old Mariel boatlift when they dropped a cuba MP their prisons into America yeah thank you yeah that's a guts uh yeah well that that's a pretty well-known thing to think about the drugs like well it's just you know yeah it's a pretty well no doubt the weak elements of society and we'll get a lot of information well it's also they didn't exactly know what would happen when you dose people up with acid back then there was a sign of experiments got a lot of great info from that Nazi guy and it's not so easy to get those I'm sure this part of those programs too right I mean when they shot doin that that Japanese guy who's like worse than fucking Mengele came and what it's called though it's so crazy the shit this guy did to people and uh he got a they wanted to know what he learned from his human medical experiments oh so he they let him off Jesus cry wish I remember the name of it the Japanese uh it's but it's so cos mostly done to Chinese you know prisoners but like you know cold and pressure and all like it's fucking grisly dude yeah and it's just he did so many aim were like experiment he there's knowledge that helps you make anything they got same reason we go put that great gold in the record in space okay the people had useful knowledge yes that crazy so educate yourself if that's that like look it's more important that you tell us how many pounds of pressure it takes to crush a little kid's head yeah we did not know that official officially tell us what you got is Christ it just let him go imagine being that guy who killed like hundreds of people and they just let you go most imagine you like eating ice cream at a diner just fucking sitting by yourself I doubt you have the union of offie nice cream nobody even knows your ex ank you I'd like one more please didn't they have that of Harry Shearer easy that's the Gustav guy Jesus Christ he led in development and application of biological weapons at you didn't 731 and how do you say that word meant you go Manchu qo Manchu qo I say that Manchu Co but in Chico do you and the Oh together how do you say that probably basic - cool man Chico um anyway how are we saying during the second sino-japanese war from 1937 to 1945 including the bubonic plague attacks Oh in a tiny cities oh my god and the planned attack against the United States you know blossoms holy fuck man oh isn't that the one where they would send the balloons across the country yeah it didn't yeah it didn't work these bats are something to do with though the operation cherry blossoms at night imagine this is my plan operation cherry blossoms at night biowarfare they're gonna drop the flying plague cholera smallpox Oh oh my god so they were gonna do that to America in balloons is that what they're gonna do date I think the thing I just come at us and the through our most vulnerable way our love of balloons 99 red balloons go by that was about in a Shiro Ishii nighty-night loose balloons [Music] that was a big song when I was in high school yeah the girl was cute yeah okay the these killed six American civilians near Bly Oregon I thought they dashed into a farm in Medford Oregon and caused a short circuit on the power supply power lines supplying electricity for the nuclear reactor cooling pumps in the Manhattan projects production facility holy shit dude did you know that what were they dropping on him I had balloons with bombs attached to him but was it supposed to be with plague or something well I don't know Jamie said that was part of it but what I did here on there was an episode they did about this on one of my favorite podcast which is radio lab radio lab did a whole series or a whole episode rather about these balloons that people would find these non detonated balloons and I think people accidentally blew themselves up a couple of times Wow yeah I think people found them and then they've they've found out after the war about the project but I think a bunch of them made it here and some of them went off and some of them didn't go off it's contaminated fleas fleas oh my god that's so dark Jesus Christ I'm so glad we're friends with Japan now in China all the all the bad guys in like y'all watch like the local TV so everything is about a mean Japanese general and like a brave Chinese somebody is really yeah that's like how like Nazis and Gloria's bad like yeah Nazis are a pop culture you go to likely you're always used as a villain like that Japan is that to China well you and I had this conversation about you don't have to say a person's name but someone's saying why isn't it okay to punch Nazis like oh yeah right right had that same conversation with people it's totally you and I both like yeah by all means punch a Nazi but I want to just see your Nazi detector you're using when your Nazi dowsing to find these Nazis I'd like I can't just go off your word like no I'll handle it I've read someone calling ben shapiro a nazi i know there's a guy i think maybe you were gonna have mom but i like him he's a guy that reviews comic books that he fucking got it's crazy what they did to him oh I've ever heard the story a great story what is it called something comics what is it it's called it's called um I don't know his name is your boy Zach I forget what is Comics matters where your boy zach is another chance and so what happened with him what was the story they made him into like some kind of dudes crazy man it was some kind of Nazi I mean he's the most reasonable the reviews are so utterly reasonable okay where and by the way guy gives credit to people when they're things they're good like there's nothing if you actually looked away so there's nothing there at all but because he mocks like the dumb shit they deal in comics now they made him they're like he's a white nationalist well they're doing he has a lawsuit because they did that them injecting social justice warrior credos in the comic books now right well there's a little power if there's a little fiefdom of like Portland weirdos that I guess run comics now I didn't know this fiefdom of Portland weirdos is the bestest I blame The Daily Show I blame Portlandia for the other half of faggots just so you know before you guys fucking unleash Cthulhu out of me oh we're gonna have some laughs and fuckin do that so true they are the that is the liberal epicenter that's Mecca like The Comedy stores Mecca for comics that's Mecca for social justice war it's like in a really annoying look I didn't know I did a show commies show it's Stonewall one time you know you know it's don't want like the historic like with the gays for the cops and where's that where's that in New York okay and I thought it'd be a good show cuz you you know this back in the days of you know where Joan Rivers was like a gay like you know like right so I assumed it'd be a great crowd it was awful really oh yeah and the guy who was coming my hair he's like no dude that you don't go you know that's not were like cool gays are fuckin Stonewall that's like a some dipshit living out their worst fantasy of being gate like so I didn't realize it was like it's like going to Haight Street in San Francisco today yeah you're like circle it's not 67 fuckface yes so I think there's a lot of that set right they try to bring it back yeah oh yeah anytime there's a place where hippies it's like that's a fire I'm missing out hippies hippies we're a lot more fun right but they they burn out it burns it's like there's no fuel there it eventually it goes way they design a newish thing to me of that is the the Twitter like certain groups just got marketed to based on lazy uh right following like Oh what is Twitter say like that should never be an article anymore like Twitter is saying that should never be a thing I need to know about ever well that's what we're yeah so so back I cater to so much it created these bubble around people that's fucking crazy and they and they're getting fed it still just to sell them products and you know this this vibes are gonna fuckin pop that bubble that's it's like bad real estate right now being a fucking being woke there's a real estate market that has is gonna being upset about stupid shit when real shits going down values way down yeah it's out of fashion well that's where it came from in the first place came from not enough for real problems yeah yeah that's right people I get we know same thing like I never could get emotional about who's president doesn't a doomsday called dude like where I thought like I took I was gonna kill all of you by now was how was what how I absolutely thought yeah any minute now this is gonna so that you know so people think that's the end of the world like they say that but have you ever seen unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt yeah that's a funny show do you really oh oh yeah the first episode of that I mean I didn't live underground with Jon Hamm get crank but but certainly that mindset yeah it's a funny fucking show it's just communal reinforcement keeps you and thing and also the people around me were nice like I I'm not bitter about it it's just like I can't ever be oh don't stumble your brother like I'm not sorry I kind of courage or anything like I'm compulsive well for a guy like you it's always important for a guy like you to talk about it especially a guy like you who's all the way out and is now comic because people need to understand that it's a trap that you can get sucked into it's like a pattern of behavior and thinking and you get like this confirmation from all the people that you're around the same thing we all could get sucked in I think I'm only less susceptible to that now just because of growing up in that mm-hmm so so because it's such an obsessive thing to me I'll see it I'm more likely to see it where it's not then not see it but some people are not they're not gonna understand that they do if you don't open religion you if you didn't grow up in a religion where you had to do it right you have no idea you don't understand religious people and a shock Smith the level that people don't understand it's almost like we need another word because you know what you're saying that like social justice warrior behavior in a lot of ways it gets very religious yeah it is like and it gets religious also for Republican conservative type of behavior that gets very religious - like I can tell you a religion when it becomes called woke anything that you voted - right where that you said it that team thing like well we gotta stay on the team have you ever had a conversation like here's an example with right-wing person who doesn't believe in climate change oh yeah you still always argue with Nick Nick DiPaolo yeah when we're doing a know know about that but Apollo is always like we'd be on that lucky Inara was the Hulu thing that Louie had Jesus I'm so fuckin on Louie the Horsham Pete oh so Nick like he's the he's awesome to hang out with waiting to shoot something it was like it was he was awesome but arguing about political shit he gets like he gets heated he's like what do you love Obama like a really goes to that but uh yeah but you know I like him I like I think I wouldn't want him not to say what he thinks what'd he say I don't know something about Obama I don't know some stupid Guinea sure you should be able to say whatever you want to say and I have no issues engaging people like that I'm used to knocking on stranger's door so nobody wanted to talk about their thing threatens me and anyway like proselytizing does not bother me you know uh it will bother me like you're if you're not I'm not allowed to hear it because I don't need someone to tell me what I can do you think there's less examples of that on the right than there are on the left of people like within sort of in compulsive speech like this compulsive I think that I think that the people that are on there the people that whoever needs to worry about or all the people that are too far to one of the other right I agree and and you know there's every degree every goddamn thing it it's now there can't just be two parties which is the good one and then the immoral evil ones yeah that's crazy that there's by the way 68 fuckin genders and only two sides of politics that's fuckin incredible it's so true it's so true yeah so that's what happened that guy's uh your boy Zach he got fuckin you're with us or you're not yeah that's the problem they want compliance it's a game it's not just people that have an ideology and some people agree with it and some people don't it's a game of compliance did you see the new mute what did you see the New Mutants thing mutants the new mutants the comma Marvel know what Marvel's reboot of the New Mutants okay right but what is the New Mutants it's not it's it's what is it called a TV show not the new I'm sorry not the New Mutants the New Warriors have you seen the most the most woke no what is it it's gonna look like you're nothing it's a joke really yeah so this is a kind of thing he would be laughing at okay and people cuz I haven't read comics for like so I was a kid yeah movies but they should it should be easier than ever to give kids the comics okay what is this okay we have talked about this snowflake can save space yeah so this is really some kind of trolling but basically they've been doing this in comics for the last you know it's like a nerdy he's happy comics in like star wars and all that shit was like nerdy guys that don't get laid stuff at one point and then it became kind of cool to be a nerd and then it became a hot property and soon ain't got claimed by like the Toyland the Cthulhu Portland thing that's what the what comes of it this on ironically look how an ironically they swapped the gender colors what people are mad and pink yeah people that are fucking I don't even know whose jurisdiction this is but people were mad at this the people that are trying to pander to were like I don't dress like this you better not it's ridiculous if you dress like that even people that don't want to make fun of you will start making fun of you well it just looks like I would give up I'm like I can't mock you better than you're doing yourself like what okay I mean if I was gonna if I was like hey why don't you make fun of the create the stupidest will comic you could think of that would be my characters throw her balls is bigger than his balls too if you noticed that well how do you know that's the woman well I'm assuming the blue with the hips like a woman is the woman and the one that's built like a man I'm assuming that's a man it's a trick question piece of shit you fucking pig you cisgendered ass fuck yeah well oh wait then here's well be negative isn't as funniest oh wait where's the girl at the back back that's the other one oh holy Shane time because he was exposed to his grandfather's Internet gasps his grandfather's experimental it's over it was the she's fucking hot that's the old that's the old the good days shit where's the girl with the backpack what do you think her power is her powers eating cake no what it's a magical backpack that has unlimited snacks no I'm making that up she just has a magic backpack oh my god a pocket dimension with seemingly infinite space which she could pull out useful or random objects okay so look at the joy so it's not always under her control though she claims to get her power from God but not the God you're thinking of Jesus Christ I can't do this but look at the joints let me see the dry look her in the eyes while she looks strong like she carry a lot of stuff on her back what magical too much you can't be a superhero ye too much it's like you know how do I like how Wendy from Wendy's got real big when they showed her again this is like what happened to Dora the Explorer she oh she got a whole turn I gave one up they want something that's a true that's that's that like that that's a luxury that's like when you have the luxury of being like like Gillette like are you good enough to get Gillette as opposed to being like please buy our thing we're we're a fucking razor company that's what this is fuck you to the people that are into that shit which you can only do in a good economy like now people better love you shit you don't get to just troll them right good porno right it's gonna be harder to sell things well show me and make me laugh alike I will give it to that guy who made that up right well that that's where the benefit of bad things actually comes in sometimes like some of the best things are bad things that are good by accident right like the rule movie movie yeah we I used to introduce that movie in New York for uh I did it for a promo thing for Comedy Central first but then I had never seen the movie so I kept going back and like hosting it and then we made a fake sequel to it this guy George glass and he he knew Tommy so Tommy would leave these long messages it's fuckin yesterday that's how long ago this was and uh the guy who played uh oh hi mark Greg his name is he wrote that book that they made the movie that guy's cool shit oh the guy who plays mark yeah and uh but the other guy the one who got a blowjob and he had like who's shiver me timbers or something mm-hmm cuz he left his under I left me underwears in your remember that guy and gets a blowjob and on what's-his-name squeeze o's couch god I don't remember that yeah I remember every character I saw a bunch of times I don't think I've ever seen it all the way through dude and then Christine seen I've never gone now I never went to uh it has like it well at the time I don't know if it does now but a head like that Rocky Horror Picture Show yeah thing which I never did that so at movie theaters people go and this movie group watching it you it feels like right to yell at it I swear to God like I mean I thought it was like a I'm like I'm not gonna get immediately I was like oh this I really understand this and people yell sometimes of a band playing and like yeah it was great this was the Rocky Horror Picture Show they do that because they actually like it yeah this is a different vibe yeah it's very hard I mean he's genuinely a fucking maniac and hard to deal with I had to have stood I know my girlfriend and another friend dressed kind of like slutty and distract him so he wouldn't see the parity thing we made before we showed it I mean the move look at the reviews yeah but that did nobody listen to make a thing that's watch ibly bad is like that's a beautiful thing that can only it is rarely happen yeah it's it's interesting like the room is so unfeasibly bad it has become a cult hit trust me this is the worst movie you will ever see ever in your internal life ever but it's it's like but it's amazing because when they say worst they have to be I mean we watchable where it's not boring that's the thing right it's just not more amazing so I think that's like a real lightning in a bottle it's the worst movie because they're trying to make a good movie it's not the worst movie to watch I think it's the best to go to a thing on theater of people it's like the best people shouting at the screen because you have cancer cancer it's it's such a crazy movie when did you see it did you only see I've only seen it on like I guess it was DVD at the time mmm or what and I only watch like part of it and then I had shut it off my I can't do this did you ever see the member that I remember those billboards Jamie when I when I lived here early in the Hollywood days when right after they made this movie I would drive around see that billboard it was up there forever forever he had the room the movie like ah the room movie calm he drive by it like what year was that I'm friend remember I I might have made it up because I'm like I've seen this like I've seen it in person I don't know what he might have had up he might have had it up still he was he had a billboard up forever you know here was the movie made that doesn't three it said what yeah how's that possible well I missed it I I would have thought it was way earlier than that video most multiple billboards just one what was coming soon how old is he nobody knows you know I never saw the top one coming soon like how old is he I don't know he's looks like an older fella but there's a couple movies like that like showgirls is a movie like that or so I don't remember it I just saved me remember that's a it's a good one at the end of elizabeth berkley after that it's hard to bounce back from but because the movie is so bad or because it was uh you know who knows man she went from Saved by the Bell to being a dirty girl so did screech they brought back Saved by the Bell yeah it's later okay yes Wow looking good freak I just made it Mario Lopez looking good everybody's looking good so what are they coming back as the other parents yeah there's a bunch of jokes referring to it and there's much new jokes about like iPads and screech was out there doing the book behind the Bell or something that Mike that screech was doing stand-up there was Skippy from Family Ties remember when he was doing stand-up yes lived with him Judah Friedlander was his roommate oh that's right yeah he said we're just like be in his room he's like he would smoke pot all day and then he would come out and be like did you eat my it was like a just I'm gonna have a sandwich and I'm not gonna touch it for a while but I want that see so and he would always got freaked out about missing a call to something what happened to him does he still do stand-up now or no I don't know no I'm CeCe I used to I was this thing is that what it said Hugo yeah like he's dirty now let's give you with notes get it I don't know he would always be there like I never met him I don't think maybe I made him one time but he would always be on the wall I coming next week escape you from family times remember that was the first guy that I worked in a club where he worked and I was like oh yeah that guy from TV it's coming next week yeah the oh I met a TV you're the first guy I remember I saw from TV and comedy where I like some of the club was a legendary wid remember that guy yeah we saw him walking down the street there's me and uh big J we do in the lab what was his schtick uh he's prop guy that's from eighties that used to be on making me laugh all the time people don't know that before Carrot Top prop guy was a genre yeah prop guy Nick I don't like when they get political problem remember that Bob Dylan scene one of the old bottle one guys the lady placards Bob Dylan have the placards he had it it's like a couple different Pete yeah they done that more than once right the people hold up signs in chocen yeah it's a it was real whatever I didn't find it to be shit but I know it's a legendary thing of throwing your placards yeah Jesus Christ yeah Bob Dylan oh yeah oh I'm thinking of you too didn't bono do this after he might die too maybe in tribute I'm thinking of the you two things I'm pretty sure INXS did it I've never seen Bob I had no idea Bob Dylan yes he was the first I only saw the remake he would do it to his the lyrics to his song what it was cue cards everywhere subterranean homesick blues and so he would that's actually him singing the words so he's doing a music video but refusing the saying they just holding up these pieces of paper that have all the different lyrics on them yeah I never saw this version yeah it's the music who did the thing that I'm thinking of the reader we may access did it was it yeah I think it was in excess in excess who's the what the lead singers one of those dudes that choked to death jerking off yeah wasn't a lot no no I'm asking is it but who knows what's your dad can't ask you why should somebody told me like a lot cuz live musicians are her ex heroin addict so the only thing that's close to the endorphins of that is a good choke choke slash jerking off yeah joke jerk so they do that with some verses that's up Jamie that wasn't it ten different videos here that did it oh these are all different people that did it in different different songs okay go up to the NSX one well I've never seen you thinking of the top one yes this was pretty famous Mediate yeah it's right I'm thinking it wow I had did I shed no idea Bob first only no the existing oh yeah bob Delmas original do you think that this guy was he a heroin guy is that why he was uh I beg you it's like you've burned out your pleasure centers of your brain so you need some incense like an explosion of sensation from a choke jerk I never thought of it until you brought it up but it totally makes sense right if you plug in big J nobody shoot up anymore and you wanted to get that rush he wanted to make this as an invention like a shark tag invention which he means dead series of invention it makes me laugh so it's a belt with like us it lets go like it's got a sensor for G in case you got a jerk off do you dad it has like a sensor to just release you when you but if he lets you go in your unconscious you might bang your head off the floor and died anyway okay it almost makes you want to try it that's such an embarrassing way to die though I know it's - there's a preacher that died he had a wet suit on he died doing that oh yeah get a giant dildo it's the wet sense for the wet suit the Builder is like no I'm just jerk I'm just guessing it was like a compression hold on that but to plug the dildo so here this dildo up his ass and then wheezes sucks it all in place so it can't go anywhere so it's a sketch I mean is it that hard to lose a dildo in your ass you know wetsuit your ass would want to shit it out immediately and I think he's probably and then the tension formed by that probably been to other rodeos and so he's realized what gets him through I didn't think you just started at wetsuit level first time in the wetsuit and then noose Wow and he's a preacher like that's a lot no it's a lot happening you know what I believe it more than ever yeah God took called to him said listen I'm gonna bring you to me but you got to do it in a humiliating way imagine of God look I didn't God try to get people to kill their sons oh you're talking about him was the story I hear him and Isaac yeah it's to see if you would if you do it your son it's not yeah it's a creepy game God was playing didn't actually go through with it as a creepy game it yeah well you know you're not up fucking right they've got a broad like a cave Jew from the phages imagine that same God today but he's only around occasionally and it comes down the fucked up thing is the view of your son as property see this is the old world it's like like God will give you ten more sons that's in like job that's back when you owned your right your family and by the way if you didn't know if somebody would kill them or do so much us how what yeah I don't judge none of their shit but here's the here's the reverse of that I'm not taking any judgment like what if Moses saw you're doing that like I know it's all right he's on his fucking business but imagine if God was real but God only came down occasionally and tried to get people to do fucked up things like killed her son imagine if one time he was like a steve-o and his early thanks tur he's like he was like an impractical joker well he's like Banksy nobody knows what he looks like but everybody sure he exists so he comes down occasionally he's not into giving a large scale advice but occasionally he goes down talks his preacher and says I want you to I want to thank you for believing in me I know you're a true believer and I'm gonna bring you to heaven but you know you sounds like you have too much ego you hold on to too much ego and I want to humiliate you and death this sounds like the original script of Prometheus but this is what he was originally telling prometheus is a weird one right I gotta like it it's like very stupid but I like it I really like it as much as I like the next one the next alien movie was really good covenant I like that one too I love that one I know people didn't like it that was a good one it's also features justice Millette before the allegations it does yes he's in it he is witness he's one of the dudes in the ship is he a guy who fucking he's one did he go to the coffin say a white alien popped out his back it popped out of my back and it said this is our Nagashima system yeah he was one of the dudes piloting the ship with uh what the fuck's his name Kenny oh right yeah the comic the hilarious yeah yeah from from the foot fist way yeah he's on it too he's hilarious in it yeah I like yes there's Jesse Smollett I know Wow it's a fun fucking movie Hey look he got jacked BAM what is that cinema org is that in the movie is that the scene in the movie where no my god how did the audition for that part that go right through is the back of his head yes now I want you to imagine a cock coming out the other end of your box like I don't have to my favorite part in that movie is when the one lady locks the lady and the infected guy inside that room after the thing burrows yeah oh yeah that was cool dude that was a heavy fucking scene man that was a heavy YUM that was a really good scary horror movie scene yeah that was genuinely a fucking good uh in that alien that they made at the end that one that you're shown a picture of Jamie that thing that was more in the beginning that guy no no he was uh towards the end I think he was the nation alien well ok see the dark one I thought that oh oh that's the one that came out like later that stowed away yeah that bit the girl's shoulder off remember oh yeah remember that I thought this one was like it can't like it would eat I wanted to like eat them yeah it was trying to eat them yeah that's what it looked like look at that's what it looks like when it came to I'm sorry I know I'm talking about covenant the remember when they were downstairs in the other David's those black alien was it I thought it was white no that's that's what comes out of your back but I thought there was a white one in that movie that it might have been one coming in at the end it's kind of it looked like that it's lighter skinned yeah remember I'm not making anything up there was a scene towards the end where they realized that this artificial intelligence guy had started breeding these aliens together and combining their DNA with people with other things and it came it came in and Jeff put his all it put its arms up the alien like he did like a hand wave and it went like that came in the Joey has hand witness speaks waving it was uh it came running out and a bitter on the shoulder looking that this alien looks like Joey Diaz his balls I don't think it's some it's when here's downstairs in that well it sounds like a pink one it was a weird colors like a whitish color and it was down when he was in the the dwelling where that guy would draw and do all scientific oh no no a face hugger got him but there was another one there was a full-grown alien down there kind of anybody who's like a real alien fans probably so mad at us right now yeah this is it can feel this is it oh oh we get someone shot it's kind of a white things called neo more if I guess it yeah so killed it he's all mad hey what is this music that goes with it okay yeah that's it so this is a scene but he's to see where it gets a girl I think I'm pretty sure I think it was yeah see so it's kind of a pale looking thing is that you lack of entertainment in the last 15 minutes late I forgot what it was I know it's romantic with this song well that was cool part of the movie that he had been there for so long he'd been experimenting with these aliens and making different kite yeah and it was also interesting to like the the difference between the the new version where they'd cut out creativity in the old version or he was wait they cut out creativity in the artificial intelligence guys you know there's always yeah right right right those I got yeah there's always a robot trying to kiss himself or something I love you that's what it looked like Jamie that's that's exactly what it looked like that right there you just had it bang so that's what it looked like and then it came out its whole mouth opens up and a bitter shoulder is like took out giant chunk out of her if I remember correctly I mean I was very scared what is all that different lighting over it do you thought I don't know it's good question those are my some of my favorite movies because I like it I just wished they he showed the fucking engineer I don't like they space it out another you know extra movie and he is really something about somebody with like a a space judy so I like that haircut they fucking fights aliens it's up to this last space judy to fucking is that what it was and that music are we fucked now do we play in the sound oh good it's uh I mean those the series of movies there's some of the best horror and science fiction movies of all time you got to go back to the original one that original alien holds up yes great holds up that's a 1979 movie about aliens and space and it fucking holds up your own I mean it's still the the the technology looks goofy it's going off and all their computers and a fucking older nothing looks worse than like a 90s tech movie like hackers or something oh is this a pentium is the future yeah but what were they right about Back to the Future there right about a lot of shit right wasn't Trump president and impact the future tizzy am I wrong imagine I think he's present on The Simpsons The Simpsons predicted it yes there's a great video about how accurate the Simpsons were about so many different things yeah and that Matt Groening must be some sort of a time traveler I don't I think he just like through said whatever the most hilarious thing he could think of was 13 Simpsons predictions that could not come true but still could all right oh that have not come true it's still good you're fond of 2028 in vodka 2028 there's probably a hundred percent gonna happen they would if it was said Melania that I would go oh you think people step up Melania and Michelle Obama hang out here the hottest for his lady we've ever heard she's for sure the hottest any argument will start a fight right there's no it who's a close second to Melania Trump I mean it's not even fair it's not fair ya know it's not fair but Melania and Michelle Obama together Michele probably was the most the unite the parties wait oh yeah Laura Bush was it was a series not bad was that bad pretty lady Hillary Clinton when she was younger fucking Barbara Bush was like it was like a legendary joke how unfuckable the first was the entire 90s there was like some work I would punch Barbara Bush in the face Oh naked gun yeah there were so many Joe's you'd be falling down the stairs people loved it too so many jokes about Barbara Bush dude she was lit like she was legendarily ugly I understood she was the first lady and also she was one of the ugliest face it just came through over and over again on the media so this all the first lady's all when it's just a picture of do they mocked her on every format of whatever they did she was declared ugly they did it was like Oh Jackie O though is one of the first ones we could see abortion a thing oh really yeah member there was pictures and Jackie and a bunch of money off that's a very flame got rich yeah like he came out like fucking really why do I forget that I spent a bunch of money on that house that he was gonna make to get kicked out of in Ohio really yeah they just gonna try to make they thought it was in be like a playboy hustler mansion play with me oh my god well he did open up some casinos did um Nancy Reagan used to get Ronald Reagan listen to astrology yeah right she like had like a White House astrologer they would run all the decisions by these would believe in astrology mmm do you do astrology every day oh I don't fact I'm doing it right now I'm a Gemini were skeptics Oh first lady's never married two presidents never met other women oh the side pieces wait am i but they were still considered the first lady no no no the ones who were this is just a trick yeah it's a true national first lady's library turn that over you son of a bitch what we are the society that's beside peace Society it's like the sons and daughters of the round the daughters of the revolution I can't wait for a woman to become president just so we could see what we call the guy is that not settled unless she's a lesbian which would be even better I hope that we finally don't have to address the prophecy to run the country whether you love pussy and you have one or you love that's how I would run if I was lesbian like hey we all know it's important you'll have to be willing to eat pussy we all love pussy oh wait is this what am I looking for well weed the weed I thought I thought he was blessing it on the screen the elation for your coronavirus test and then the weed together just tell you something hunch an AIDS test was not as stressful really yeah I didn't feel as it's um it it's probably it's just because there's a long car ride so I'm just like oh shit what's probably the most stress inducing thing any of us have had to go through except for the people that have been to war or first responders or people that have exploded strangely call me because it so beyond my control of a so beyond yeah I got a you had Barry Crimmins on here what time didn't shower yeah so we were on tour together we almost died in this car accident really yeah the call we're in it was black ice and who was driving dude I won't say name but anyway fucking so he's driving I'm in the passenger seat Barry's behind the driver and we were going about 65 on the highway which wouldn't be too bad except it's black ice because it's winter he's trying to pass this tractor-trailer so as we're going the College starts wobbling and uh oh my god so I remember I said what the fuck three times is how much time there was I didn't like dock or anything cuz I saw the trailer we we just started myself start going in under the fucking oh my god so he's right I just went going well I guess I'm dead like and then at the very last second it's spun like because it was wobbling and then the back were no sitting that got grabbed and the HMDA blew in and then we spun into the middle of the highway it was crazy too but afterwards I I'm on that me and bury me I felt like hi I remember you telling me a story the driver was weeping I felt hi any reason was it was it was so out of my control I mean it was so like cuz I was definitely sure my I was gonna come off guys like that and it felt so out of my hands I was like oh like it it felt like I was gonna die all kinds of times but it usually it was like you know I mixed some kind of drugs or I did something where you know it made sense so some I think I was trained of formal you know into the world kind of feelings since birth for being that boy and I think I just have them where it relaxes me more than what would they tell you the end of the world you know whatever the everybody says like what do you mean like like when you say it was a end of the world cult like what it would what did they do they call it yeah that God's revelations gonna happen and Armageddon God's gonna destroy the wicked system of things it doesn't appeal to it for sure are then set up a we'll survive of course well job is witnesses people that some people live on earth in a Garden of Eden restorative paradise have you ever seen the literature they show that I believe it's paintings of Hawaii no you ever got Hawaii it's beautiful looks like gorgeous that's where their heaven is maybe that's them that's what the guy painting it in the things I saw when I find went to Hawaii I was like oh this is the parents what I thought of paradise my entire life of you know the Garden of Eden and who does Hawaii looks like that imagine if Hawaii was all that was left there's a massive volcano there's enough people but imagine if that's it well there'd be a lot of myth I'll tell you that how many people like what ye is supposedly I think the fought in the world that's the furthest away from other spots like it is completely isolated in the middle it's a Hawaii it's like the Earth's vagina I think lush it's gorgeous right it's amazing but I think it's also five hours by plane to anywhere I think the closest you can get is like Guam or places like that but it's really I said shock to me I got there at night when I went to Kauai I didn't I I heard is like the good one to go to was awesome so never been but it was pitch gorgeous when I got there at night and then I woke up and it looked like fucking Jurassic Park Maryland it was crazy that's where they filmed Jurassic it sound like a cliff and there there's like it was like every kind of biome in one spot it's magic at least from the photos well five days five days perfect yeah I could like go crazy after that dude it would become a beautiful hell that that you your only joy in life besides methamphetamine would be showing new people that come the island the movie weren't they on Hawaii and the show lost they're desperately trying to get out on an island like Hawaii but they film that I thought in Hawaii oh yeah for sure they did right yeah and you're ready to go after unless like you it was like a place you go after you die it felt like well some people go to like Maui and they they live there I've seen Dog the Bounty Hunter I know oh I know Steven Tyler lives there a bunch of who appears browsing lived up the block from where I stayed did he really yeah I think it's the climate kind of destroys property so it's ffensive upkeep of like owning a home there dude I was just reading about Malibu how much Beach Malibu's losing when they're trying to do all these different things to try to save the beach like a comb-over from another be like as they don't acknowledge there's a problem they're really gonna say I do with my hair from it they were literally calling it a beach Botox really yes why does it last because a little quick fix so they pour all this sand into this area and then the ocean swats it away I thought they have a way to make artificial sand dunes that work they have a way to do some walls but the thing about it is it affects other beaches so like if you put up a beach wall over here it's gonna affect the beach of the people down there and so they're like hey fuck you you're gonna ruin our Beach because you want more Beach right because there's only a certain amount of water the the problem is though the water is rising the water starting to take over then everybody should have extra water good everywhere well they're saying by 2100 it's gonna move all the way through there's gonna be there's gonna be none of those houses this is what the story was saying mmm that by 2020 100 there'll be no more beach there'll be no those houses will exist the beach will be in a totally different spot the water will get so high it just starts taking over everything no shit yeah man sounds like I'm telling you China felt like going to the movie Blade Runner I bet it did I was know now it seems the oceans are high now yeah well I was there before the 2016 election just before it and they were into Trump oh really yeah cuz he's like a business that whole thing of your name on everything like mm-hmm Chinese people love that like they they get him dude I mean like I don't know now how it is but um they were all about him because he's business he's a businessman he was successfully a businessman that's how they fucking well he definitely it's not call me so I'm saying he definitely rubbed them the wrong way with this right with no they don't even ever dude if the country of China goes hey that's racist they're purely playing on American like dippy kind of shit like they don't have any feelings like do you see what they're doing black people there they're kicking them out now they they put it on them you know yeah instead of the bat super what everybody said they're like oh it's because it spreads because of black people that's what they trying to say that it's because of black people because they also said those because of Americans they're like fucking Romulans do whatever whatever it takes to make a narrative the government controls like here it's a bunch of corporations pushing what they want they're the fucking guy the head guy the papers pushes winnie-the-pooh agenda I think they just passed a law saying that the Chinese guys can't go online and play video games with people in other countries yeah well Russia has some walls like that too you couldn't get certain American foods because of the fucking you know after they went to Crimea there was like oh it's our American sentiment but the government was like yeah Marika's are they really still I watch that interview deal with what's-his-name Nodin yeah it was interesting but I thought I thought it really stuck out about it how it blows up because Putin could be like failing if not for same way Trump wins right it's not for the constant like this guy's the devil and the boogeyman and it gives them status yes you know how smoking commercials where they go quit smoking and and that they say they don't work because it all it does is put the word smoking in your head right that's what they've been doing for fucking fine don't mean old Trump but all you hear is Trump well that was what Trump's play when running up to the election just say more outrageous shit they would that's crazy the system oh yeah but they used that to show how they're doing that on purpose I think that's something he's done yeah for many years but I think with them like they didn't even know what was going on until they were checkmated like because you're fucking greedy they were making money off of it yeah yeah for sure yeah it's a great thing people want to see the dumb shit that he says they want to get outraged they tune in also I

dick but I mean obviously it works I don't even know why I was criticizing but you could keep the tiger alive and get the same pussy that's what I'm sorry yeah I don't do do they have Tiger bones or something like that is that one of their ailment you've heard well you heard that the Chairman now has like old sayings of like his physician wrote a book after he died no what'd he say he's like filthy like you yep like syphilis he wouldn't brush his teeth and the doctor like listen you gotta brush your teeth and here we go I swear you go does the tiger brought you ste what do you even have to say that's like saying this is New Orleans this is Las Vegas traditional Chinese medicine Tiger bones are believed to help cure conditions like rheumatism and arthritis along with erectile dysfunction rhino ho my god you put a rhino homeowner on your fucking ready to go baby yeah back when they all had syphilis and they just died of it and it rotted their skin out their teeth it's fucking what you see the Johnny Depp movie where he gets the nose fall off syphilis Oh what was that movie The Libertines no I don't really kind of remember it but I know at the end he's all fucking syphilitic and it looks like he looks like a dead men tell no tales over to the Caribbean coast Oh God but that was a common thing because he would just get syphilis look at his eyeball - it's got a dead eye he's got makeup on the wig that's how people lived imagine what they stunk like back then I know that's a thing I have rotting syphilitic with a wig on sweating under the wig you'd make up Kings skin and imagine no soap a pair of boots from and you got open sores probably all over the place because of the syphilis if you lost your nose it's not all your and you got holes all over your fucking body is that right you get like new nose holes besides just nose holes dude go to syphilis wounds like syphilis autopsy that your fuckin head falls hey more holes - fuckers that syphilis talk no no not like full hole no I know the holes in your skin like we could see your skull I know is making me a feel gross Wanda yes is it really like that yeah the whole powdered wig thing came from know yeah it came from people that have had syphilis particularly - I believe there was French gentlemen who were royalty that were young and they contracted syphilis and their hair fell out and I started wearing wigs look at that guy's face holy shit whose pussy - he looks like a little kid - what is his lips are gone as nose how would that be it just it just rots your skin out leaves holes in your oh my god - yeah horrendous a powdered wigs not gonna fix that no so what happened look you get holes in your skin and shit look at that guy's no put away that shit his fucking head into his brain oh so anyway a nice comfortable wig on top of that that must feel a fucking amazing these wealthy guys were like the shit what does it say syphilis what is it what is it I believe syphilis - by the way syphilis or gonorrhea that came from the New World did it you know like the flu that killed all the fucking well they brought back yeah either gonorrhea or syphilis so came from Native American Montezuma's Revenge oh wow it's not true yeah it's the war I mean I assume that's what killed Al Capone - right didn't it they say that but there's a new movie coming out with Bane in it what's his name and he plays this awful party Tom Hardy have you seen the ed hardy ed hardy love Tom Hardy how dare you yeah Tom Hardy's gonna play a syphilitic and yeah this movie seems to be about that he was faking it oh I don't know who fucking knows Dean when someone's dead for 50 years you can make up shit about him yes guys start making up what happened sounded like yeah it's I mean I could believe he probably had several of course he had syphilis probably at everything and I don't think he's getting enough meth like at least like the JFK and Hitler were getting their meth to come yeah cocaine injections and testosterone shots yeah what is this the trailer based on true events but you could just say that based on true events you could kind of fucking do whatever you want oh yeah I just mean events that's what events are things that happened there was a guy lived in the house and everything else were made oh yeah Al Capone was a guy so the bigwig thing came from these guys who were rich guys who wore these powdered wigs that's what a big wig is yeah other people wanted to copy them and so it became fashion a lot of them had syphilis and the more expensive your wig would be the bigger would be so that's why you know because the a really a lot of hair in it you got a really distract from the rest of the part and then they were still fucking hoping the dick wouldn't rot off it still I think a lot of times the dick would rot off wouldn't it people just turned any cheese gradually back then yeah had holes in their face that guy has a hole in his face oh dude look he's trying the painter made him flattering right the god the worst fucking part yeah look at that hole in his head that he's under selling pick the hole idealize the hole in my face right that's not a mole right no huge pull it up pull it make it larger so this guy is a syphilitic hole is that a word no it's a flooded hole in his face and other than that looks great with his rosy lips Lucy's got some lipstick on myself it that's how Foundation and and if you were a royalty back then you probably fucked all the peasants right tomorrow you would fuck that cousin and then whoever attends to your cousin in the castle when you breed with a cousin but you probably fuck a bunch of people on the sneak tip too right yeah probably yeah you're a royal and you got a hole in your face and you know how much time right how much time do you think you got left when you could see your teeth on the side well that's what Chairman Mao did he fucking stepped up his stepped up his walk I told him he was sterile and Chairman Mao took it to mean erectile dysfunction but he just no I meant you can of kzo I'm a sterile mi I'll shut and he just spread a whole bunch of and the girls were proud of it they would say I caught the fucking cause he's syphilis from chairman man yeah because that's a fucking cult and a half yeah I think now that to your mom's house shirt I got syphilis from Chairman Mao have a whole would like half her face hanging out yeah I do nod and you wouldn't it's crazy the details do you imagine that they were proud that is that's real listen what didn't the chick from Smallville get a brand of some guy from like us right multi level not even a cult like a multi-level marketing seminar right right it was like that vitamin company that did that without any Tigers he did that completely Tiger free how did I do that he got women to be his Tigers they would go out and get other women I make them feel comfortable what do you think but what was their acid involved was there any country no just group manipulation that's it yeah acid that's why it's so stupid those experiments cause like I feel like I'd like somebody could I told you that like nothing that's just like a seasoning on top of something that's already there right that's not there's not a drug that puts a thing there that that wasn't there it's it lets something out that was in there you know so the right don't you write about about acid religion gets to who you are like if you have something you devote it's something that it gets to who you are I'm sure people can't leave because they're like that would be like I wouldn't exist anymore because this is what I am I'm sure that's true without any acid and now drugs but I do think that they showed that you can do things to people if you get them daily acid and manipulate them I think it was a pretty good disorder yeah I'm sure you can disorient people and fucking well they even thought there's they're pretty sure I don't think they plan for people to do things I get people to commit murder get people to to do things that would never do those things I mean I well I'm sure that it doesn't help I just don't like Ted Kaczynski like I can see that looks like something getting out of hand like right or ass experiment created a thing we didn't anticipate not that that was the end goal right right right I agree with you yeah I think with Kaczynski what happened was he just made sense but he made sense in a way that people are like yeah but you don't blow up the guy I don't get it's just like you know hey I don't get why okay great the trains run on time but why would you have to kill 60 like how how does one correlate to the next right you know like like that's why I said seems we came from the future because so yurina like that's exactly what's going on right now and he knew ahead of time was like what you got a brilliant guy and then I dose him up with acid at Harvard yeah right so he probably thinks hey I made it to Harvard he's all screaming I still yeah I'm still smart but it's all like faulty what was a brilliant mind yeah right yeah Russell Crowe remember was it that brilliant for him to figure out to go hit on the ugly chick so the hot chick fila he wanted a fuckin Nobel Prize for that that was a hit on the 7 over the 10 was his big everybody went crazy in the movie yet yeah well I think that if you just gave him acid he probably gone crazy too I think there's a lot I say that acid does that if you have mental it can definitely get to us yeah you shake that shit loose yeah so can pot from the Beach Boys said happen he because he smokes so much upon which one they want one that hung out with the Manson's because one of the one of the boys Brian Wilson he hung out with the man says he's in the book a lot he's a lot in that book he had like a guru who was like his own personal like nexium guy for a while and he said he smoked pot and when come out house I'm not surprised yeah he blamed marijuana but yeah it marijuana is not like a panacea of medicine for all your problems well not only that marijuana kidney fuck you up if you're not ready for it it can especially now I don't know I like to find good mids again yeah mids you don't want to get too deep sometimes like I think in this podcast there's many times where I don't know what we were talking about you know cuz I smoked a fucking blunt by the way it was to get it that tobacco in the leaf of course you want it yes looks like one at this money of that delicious tobacco a sweet sweet nicotine soothing me and celebrating no co vid 19 yeah how worried about you are you I'm worried about all this are you is it something you get anxiety over you really just I mean I need those road dates to pay my rent so that's worrying yeah but I'm not worried like the end of the world I mean I just don't even have that I wonder what's going to happen in terms of with the restructuring of society when things bounce back it's gonna be like China do just be just like China a bunch of people it look like Naruto everybody's got a mask on like everybody's a ninja that's why I saw a bunch of people in masks look like Blade Runner kinda like it's just complete out that that's not gonna be good for us well I mean hopefully it helps with this whole Co vid virus I hope it does help I hope there's something better even I hope there's some some sort of medication comes out of this well we well at a certain point it'll be like a Tamiflu if it doesn't deliver on the amount of deaths that it's promised and people that's what people be like alright come on ya know I think you're right um yeah I just wonder I wonder how long that's gonna take like what seeing how Vegas wants to reopen like and then Anderson come see their ads where they're like hey listen Vegas don't even worry about Vegas right now you just quarantine just Vegas is still here yeah they're still advertising like don't forget about Vegas I saw an ad like that for a car there just showed an empty road don't even worry about chiming stay home dodj yeah I was I despise that people like whoever the Don Draper's or that same guy that made the actual that app knows it check it was an Australian like oh really there's a whole new like crop of like young ish you know kind of like feminist drivel but it's like in ads it's like you know what cants yeah but it it's a that's not you know woke was going because once it's commodified like hey kids you woke right we're a corporation like a snedecker dreams had it's been dead for a fucking right it's corporate created punk rocker yes horrid its realist that makes it quote like when it was some granola kids fountain not it was more hilarious yeah like everything here about colleges like those kids but they all a lot of them came out in the real world in what's entry what's interesting to me about the thing almost as much as the kids himself is the intelligent adults who should know better yeah well to push the radical ideas because they thought of those kids is almost like the soldiers in the forest far left yeah throw them onto the beaches and they don't understand that they're the first ones to go they think that the people that think like that they have no idea they're more despised than anybody on the right they hate a fucking John Stuart era liberal more than any does it I mean they're calling boomers those are all Gen Xers they're not boomers but that's how did disdain yeah and the ones that are really enforcing compliance they want to reshape the world didn't want to reshape the way people behave I know people personally that I like good friends what that are like their feeling is like I just want it to be like Biden mmm-hmm like how Oh like because it'll just then they're gonna call him down like no they're not gonna calm down because they got a little taste of power yeah they're gonna full socialism people are gonna it's not it's like people it's kind of funny because a lot of them don't allow them are just like fucking silly upper upper middle class kind of twits that are pretending that they're fucking soaked but they don't the first thing about it who's that guy that got the ad pocalypse on fucking YouTube from Vox remember that yes yeah like that guy he's a rich kid it comes out he's a rich kid yeah so that's who does they're not really socialists they like the feeling they like this very kind of t-shirt feeling they get and then they also like the good life yes that's why it's all silly kind of people in what the people I know that spout that shit most of them have money I've never I can't think of anybody not do their have real problem so that yeah everyone's a bigot imagine I mean imagine caring about fucking you see fucking Phoenix talking about dairy like she just imagine bringing up milk or like charging on the stairs what I really knew Bernie was unfit to be President when they took his mic Twite to elections on the
