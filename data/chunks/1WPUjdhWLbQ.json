hello freak bitches keep in mind that these narratives afford by public opinion all right this isn't the studio's trying to make the public force feed the public like gender roles and you know whatever this is the public saying I like that I don't like that so the studios are responding to the questionnaires that these researchers give out so one of the really interesting things and this is totally inflammatory but the the role of the person defending like physically physically defending the community when they try to put a woman in that role people have a problem with it and and and frankly often women have a problem with it like it's really it's really really interesting and women are just as important as men in a crisis or in anything right but with the what the public seems to want is the guy with the sword and the woman with the bandage you know with that sort of reassuring you know like it gets divided like that and it's not again it's not the studio's forcing something on people it's the people watching these films saying just voting on what the narrative that they like best but the the other character that I thought was really hilarious there's often that there is a an estranged husband who's betrayed his wife and family in some way he's on the outs right with his family and his with his wife and then the crisis happens the Martians invade the floodwaters rise whatever it is and he comes to the rescue and does the right thing and saves his wife and family and maybe even the wife's new boyfriend I mean he even could have gotten to that stage right and because he does the right thing she takes him back funny it's really just playing out these ancient archetypes it's exactly what it's doing I mean they rise I mean those storylines resonate because they're ancient and because those those roles in society helped us survive and then I dawned on me wait a second Stamets you're in the tallest tree on the tallest hill from miles in the middle of a lightning storm this is not the best place to be and so I realized I could be killed up here suddenly I had a reality rush like you know you're you could turn into a god imagine when he grams of mushrooms hug at a tree the Lightning comes it hits you maybe you were the Savior maybe need to get back to that tree maybe you're the chosen one so I thought I was you know I it was an incredibly spiritual and wonderful experience but I also had the fear and this comes comes with the the hero's journey you know you always have the the dark side you always have not just the light side but as counterbalance to the dark side and I realized oh my gosh I'm gonna I could die up here and I said well I don't die stemis what's what are your issues this this get something out of this experience and I said this stuttering habits ridiculous and I'm not stupid and I saw I said to myself stop stuttering now stop stuttering now I said that dozens hundreds of times over and over and over and fortunately the storms went past and held onto the tree and soaking wet I came out of the tree and walked back into where I was living and then the next day I got up I didn't see anybody and I was walking on on this path and a sidewalk and there's a lady that I really liked a lot and but she was always attracted the super self-assured jocks and things like that she was actually very kind and sweet but I didn't want to stare at her in their eyes because I would stutter and it's humiliating for us so the more humiliating us stutterers feel the more we stutter and so it's a really slippery slope and so I would avoid eye contact and so for the first time she walked towards me she's a good morning Paul how are you she was always so nice to me and I was terrified because I would embarrass myself and I looked at her straight in the eyes and I said I'm doing fine how are you and I stopped stuttering and one day and this speaks to now what was been medically proven is that we can reset the neurology of the human brain through neurogenesis what do you think is a real no-bullshit achievable time for you at full marathon full marathon Jim you gotta help me you run for forty five to a little over two would be a pretty good no no no it's a little mera five-five says it got five has to be a good mark because after that three hour marker even doing the half you're gonna hit a real tough wall but you also will be running with a pace group the whole time which helps yeah it's like you're like I have to go with them no matter what I have to go with them five hours five hours that's hilarious I don't even know what I'm saying I'm thinking about draining my bank account to bet you hold on Joe five hours what are we doing here I like this do you think yeah wait hold on this I'm thinking Ari and I could make some serious money on let's get let's get it let's get a course that we're talking cuz we're not gonna can't do one in Colorado I said I wanted I want to Boston it will keep you alone I'd say like five hours you would have to really prepare know anything he's willing I want to see what is that net worth shape right now so wait he had a really prepare to do five hours I think you could do it I'm not saying you couldn't do it I'm giving you a year idiot fuck you know do you know the story of viagra and how that was developed it was some sort of a blood pressure medication correct right and hey jackpot yeah so they found like okay this isn't working very well for what we designed it for but what but it's got some pretty interesting effects and so but they knew wasn't enough to just then go out there and start selling it for to God to say hey here's a drug that will help you know make you perform better in the bedroom that wasn't enough what they had to do was create a disease yeah that it could be prescribed for because that's and then and and you know how they did that they heard an advertising agency and the ad agency came up with the term erectile dysfunction no way and created this no way absolutely it's publicly available information agency named Dizzy's this is not the only case where this has happened so they create this disease category and then they get it out into the world and they advertise it to people and doctors and so all of a sudden people are going in with the magazine or like this is me I have erectile dysfunction and I know now there's a drug called viagra that I need because I have erectile dysfunction and the doctor has seen them they have their own brochure they pull out their brochure and it says erectile dysfunction here are the signs of symptoms okay check check check check yes this patients got erectile ID so here's a drunk okay how is it legal for an advertising agency to name a disorder well I'll tell you that it's illegal in every single country in the world except for New Zealand in the United States to advertise drugs to to consumers please New Zealand be the first to change first because this is the result this is the result of allowing drugs to be advertised is that you get advertising agencies creating conditions that then require drugs to be treated and this you know this is like the era I'm hanging out with Dennis I mean look at Dennis's size compared to Shaq if you didn't know it was Dennis Rodman it was just some you know NBA scrub right you would think there's no way that guy's gonna guard him one-on-one especially Shaq in his prime there there's no way yeah it's rotten is a crazy guy speaking crazy funny story please got a good story yeah so used to hang out a lot with Dennis and you know hadn't seen him for years was at a restaurant Chicago not too long ago and and somebody said oh you guys are friends with Dennis right yeah yeah oh he's upstairs oh really we
