you guys never fucked around together nothing before that one moment no I mean we play a show the first time we met was like over 10 years ago and we were just babies you know that show was so dope show that you guys did that Jameson thing was so dope well you remember that well you were there and then Jameson was like why is this video like going like viral cuz you tweet it or you like you know they're all asking us about PR and stuff midnight riders one of my all-time favorite songs so when you guys went into that like randomly Mike oh my god when I used to get up in the morning whenever I just have to do morning radio morning radios like you got to be funny at like 6:30 a.m. you know and you shake shake the cobwebs off mic just went to bed like four hours ago so I would hit hit a joint and listen to Midnight Rider you would always that tells my new morning song Midnight Rider was my cuz when you're high first thing in the morning on your way to the radio there's a feeling you get when you listen to that song like these guys were just out there yeah it's a cruiser oh my god they were free yeah no yeah the music then was so free yeah there was something something special about like that era music in that song and then to see you guys doing it together and to give it that Gary Clark jr. sound yeah yeah you have got a sound you got a sound man it's amazing all the fucking people playing guitar I hear your sound like you have a sound that's special it's very great 100% the fuck you're doing magazine oh shit I keep trainees Steelers tricks I don't know that did you guys together with bent there was it was Ben oh yeah and there was someone else right a drummer Connor that's right yes that's right and you guys together god damn that was fun fun Thanks yeah we did you know I don't know when honey honey's gonna play again but we we did have we had a lot of fun you know guys made some awesome songs thank you [Laughter] so that's crazy that you guys had never done that before that one night well you brought us on you you bestowed a great gift on honey honey by because you played at the ACE that day yeah and or that night and then there we were you know brought in by Gary to do this after party sponsored by Jameson hence all the like Jameson barrels and all the stuff it was so much fun I mean and it was in downtown LA which like adds to it cuz downtown LA is straight-up Blade Runner these days homeless people by the thousands and gangs and weird graffiti and dudes are lifting and closing garage doors in the middle of the night to fill with people inside yeah I went down there the other day man and took my wife for some nice restaurant drive was like bro don't go anywhere else around oh my god we filmed fear factor that we watch people smoke crack yeah or meth whatever they were smokin they were smoking something and they were just doing it openly in the street like we were elevated and when them little oh my god yeah little those little vials broken vials would be everywhere it's crazy yeah it's like Mad Max but it is and it's also beautiful buildings they've also built these insane apartment buildings there's gorgeous office buildings it's very strange it's like there's a concerted effort to try to turn it into some like to gentrify downtown but I mean it's happening but when you're in California do you really want to live in downtown LA Eddie Bravo loves you there but you don't there oh yeah it's a fun hang but you know I want to I don't know I want to be in the the canyons the rolling hills of Los Angeles course you did perhaps a beachfront property a little bit of uni and Brad Pitt I had a dream that I was wait for the Joe Rogan podcast and I also had a dream that Brad Pitt and I were dating and I was in fact late as we've talked about so I can't nice ladies and good music I got one for you I did it was incredible how how weird was the violence oh god it was tough I watched it with my parents and what's what was ironic is they knew who all the characters were like my dad said oh I bet that's text I'll bet because those were real people still are some of them and you know that was kind of chilling to me to think about the fact that they knew by name who these Charlie Manson heads were by watching this movie cuz you know way before my time so what's super super popular story and the other part about it is like those people that killed those folks you know how the story turned down right so you're expecting yeah I loved a happier ending is way back it's like inglourious basterds - they're just other Brad Pitt movie and like just plugging this one or what he knows he's a wizard he's he's the last guy allowed to make a movie like that yeah when I said that the violence is shocking I don't mean necessarily that it's bad I'm not saying that I'm saying shocking that in a movie in 2020 you could have a dude smash some girls yeah exactly I mean this is wild that's pretty grand fathered in I think Tarantino's grandfathered in right because everybody has always known him for having the wildest craziest fucking see from pulp fiction yeah straight on his whole career like I need to be expected yeah the fucking uma Thurman with the the injection and the nobody goes deeper than Tarantino but the thing is that he can still do a super ultra violent movie and people consider it great art mm-hmm and I think that's getting harder and harder to do right I think I think he's sort of like everybody knows that's a Tarantino movie you're gonna need to see some madness right but I think of a new person tried to do it they would hit more woke reaction more people like are we really celebrating a scene where a guy smashes a woman's a head into pulp he does a good job of like like getting up the good guy to win oh yeah so and we all want that badly so you know if anything like he's got a formula that continues to work yeah I want to see the bad guys get the shit kicked out of them that's it's there's justice yeah it's fucking great it's fun entertainment you know but there's a sort of resistance to certain narratives and and certain kind of scenes certain kinds of depictions of violence no you shouldn't even have it for entertainment sake mm-hmm you know but god damn it's so nice having someone like him around yeah I would love to I met him at the Comedy Store he's super nice cool but he makes madness you know you leave a Tarantino movie like what the fuck pretty soon Joe you're gonna be in the next Tarantino movie no I'm not in talking like this I'm just appreciative yeah that's great yeah no I'm with you that's why I'm appreciative of music - I have no idea what's going on neither do we I don't care how many instruments do you play just a guitar or do you play others I just play this well enough to keep the lights on she's humble folks master of none though master of none I it's been fun though I I really I started practicing every day and I really like love it you know I used to practice because I was afraid of sucking and now I practice because I just I really just want to play yeah and I think there is a threshold that I that I crossed like a little while back and but I just I I need I want to get so much better you know I'm sure you could relate to that like it's just it's hard to be satisfied do you do you find a struggle between being a person who concentrates on one aspect of music or one concentrates on a bunch of different arguments yeah yeah it's like I haven't picked up my banjo in a year and then but also I think when your muscles are strong and you play one of them all the string instruments are kind of like cousins you know but the violin is the hardest one when I step away from it went and then I come back there you know that makes sense yeah that's a crazy motion yeah it's an emotional instrument too like yeah you totally got you could you're crushing it you're so good at the violin [Laughter] it's true it's such a weepy instrument it's a Beautif the ones ever like it's just so nice that those Wizards of the past figured all these fucking things out yeah you know man could you imagine being there when the first person sat down at the piano and was like oh my god yeah imagine the life where people only could make noises but they were crazy people like Mozart and you know Beethoven they went nuts wouldn't you make go nuts if you were smart and you lived back then [Laughter] [Laughter] concerto everybody was thought to be crazy that had any any idea outside the system you know they put Galileo under house arrest because he was figuring shit out about the really like he ended his life on house arrest he couldn't go anywhere just because it was heresy you piece of shit he was challenging the orthodoxy it's funny all that stuff manifests today you know the same sort of same thing it's a part of people we'd like to control how people think and behaves and if we could do it under the guise of religion or under the guise of the correct politics or under the guise of anything anything we can do it's just a pattern of human behavior you see it with you know right-wing people who want to get people fired you see with social justice warriors who want to get people fired it's a pattern of human behavior there's people that are the most aggressive soldiers for a cause right and they're at the front line of anything good or bad and sometimes you know people get fired some people get in trouble chaos why I just feel like these days I really struggle with like you never really know the truth it's hard and it's so frustrating because I want to be on the frontlines of information and know what's going on in my country in the world but I get so fucking frustrated and I'm really struggling with it to be honest you should it makes me insane you know and it's it's hard to put things into perspective - yeah I coronavirus thing is a good example of that it's got everybody on edge and we all should be on edge for diseases don't get me wrong why are we not on edge that 500,000 people die every year from cigarettes yeah they die prematurely from cigarette really that is an insane pile of bodies right that happens every year we're barely worried about that okay you should probably quit smoking but what I would live your life sister in whatever brandy oh there's a solid point there it's a good point yeah man they're good for your brain I've had a couple of cigarettes I've had them with my friend Tony inch cliff right before I went on stage I was like whoa and then I had when I went to work with Chappelle I smoked a cigarette with him before every show yeah I was like I get it I see what's going on it's not like I just thought it was stupid they say it's a nootropic that it actually nicotine actually enhances brain function really yeah yeah it has a similar effect to other nootropics like you know yeah yeah like alpha brain or and any of those like one cigarette yeah kind of like an occasional cigarette is that we're talking make a teen in and of itself is a stimulant that I'm sure I'm saying cigarettes what I really mean is nicotine but that nicotine in any form whatever you can get it if you chew if you smoke a cigar if you get totally chew it does something to your brain it actually enhances the way your brain functions okay maybe a little bit of your memory maybe a little bit of your verbal your dictionary you know pull words quicker well here's a crazy story I don't think so doesn't work for me well maybe well my grandmother in a fit out of it my grandmother had a brain aneurysm when she was like in her 40s whoa and she-she my family's in the restaurant business in Cleveland and they just opened a new store and the story goes like this she was they they weren't up to code or something and they needed to like clean the shit out of this place so they could get their you know license or whatever so she was really stressed out and she she felt a pop and heard she said it sounded like running water in her ears and she called my uncle George and she smoked a cigarette outside and waited for him and he went to the hospital sure as shit she had a brain aneurysm and the doctor said that the cigarette was probably it probably saved her life because your blood vessels they constrict right is that is that who's the doctor here I'm a doctor but anyway she survived the brain aneurism it was like you know but the the story is that the cigarette had a lot to do with her making it to the hospital alive you sure that she didn't make that up she also did a couple rails of cocaine and sorry dad which limits the amount of blood Wow folks if you have an aneurysm start smoking do to it smoke those filterless cigarettes with the most savage humans yeah I knew a guy would break the filters off he didn't give a fuck he was a gamble how were his teeth they weren't that good I would imagine some weren't that good yeah well that was it was a guy that I met when I was in a pool hall in White Plains New York it's one of the first times I really understood what gambling addiction is I used to pass it off as being no big deal but being around like real gambling addicts oh yeah and the really ones that I liked like they're nice guys this White Plains Charlie was a nice guy stop gambling he couldn't stop gambling because and he was a pretty decent pool player like and he would win occasionally so a buddy would always want to play people for money always want other people to back him like come on get behind me I can be fucking beat this guy and he no matter what it was he had to be in action all day long and in New York you can bet on horse races oh yeah you know they won't let you have casinos in New York City but you could go to these off-track betting places yeah this fucking guy couldn't stop gambling all day long and then I started to study him like as his friend he was quite a bit older than I was when I was in my 20s he's probably already 60 did you file that under the what not to do category of your studies filed and all I didn't know that was a thing yeah I didn't grow up around gamblers so watching this guy was like whoa this is crazy yeah like these guys are all addicts yeah well like the old folks that like the slot machine addiction they also have screen addictions but this guy would snap the filters off cigarettes fuck feel like I'm not surprised it's I enjoy this company for the brief amount of time they just hang out with him and he's a kind of a legendary character around White Plains New York walls yeah he was a great guy that's where when I first moved from Boston to New Jersey I was around a lot of these weird characters if this one is from like comedy stuff or just from well one part of it was from comedy stuff because my friend John Tobin who was also stand-up comedian I was friends with him first and he started working at this pool hall okay and then I'm like wow well let's go fucking play some pool so you've been like pool sharking for a long time yeah but it was just being around weirdos yeah the this is the point I'm not in that good a pool player the first time I played pool with Joe he put a glove on and I'm like what's going on here what is this it was very intimidating I'm not trying to show you its the balls like I have to play the balls correctly yeah they demand respect don't I know it that was the first time I was ever terrible people want you to take it easy on them that was the first time I was around like around like legitimate I realized I definitely had a point somewhere know how you were meeting all these characters in New Jersey and like pool halls and comedy and people understanding addiction gambling addictions I don't know how it was oh the addiction thought they were just being weak and being around people that were like really addicted to gambling I'm like this is just like a drug this is a drug they're giving themselves it is that but it's also they don't go to the drug store they go to the oh my god what the fuck of I done store yes gets them all day like fuck yeah and then occasionally in low lows you know it's it's a thing I am a gambler you know that big time damn how much have you lost I'm not a lot I play poker regularly what's the big hit what's the number-one hit I mean I want like the most I want in one sitting was like literally 500 bucks just like I was at a three card poker table but I like home games I like playing poker with my friends you like taking your friends money yeah that's a sure that's a hard yes you find out a lot about someone when you beat them in a game no I like you know you don't want to play cards with someone who's gonna be a dick it has to be fun but it's interesting it is it's interesting they get angry after the game's over yeah right no oh yeah yeah sure some toads could lose 20 bucks yeah and be pissed at you for a year yeah that's fun but it's weird that we get so personally invested in the way cards lay out yeah to the point where like fuck you you're always giving these fucking aces it's half that and it's also your you know this the this game and you have to read people and like you can see how people hold their hand I can usually tell if someone's got cards you know you just pay attention do you think that's what poker is it's like part like amateur psychic part a game of craft and skill yeah I also just like the hang when my landlord has a card game downstairs and I just walked downstairs with a bottle of tequila and have so much fun and don't need to leave the house and make a couple go back upstairs in my apartment those dudes that were sunglasses at the table right the the threat of nothing to them comparison the threat of someone looking into their eyes they would rather have that extra shield that's it seems to me a wise move I respect it I respect that so you're saying I should wear sunglasses oh okay fine thank you guys I saw jay-z in the crowd the UFC once nighttime sunglasses yeah that's how I feel about wearing hats on stage I feel like I couldn't have liked he could wear better sunglasses no no those are perfect for his look are they yeah look at the beads that's a fatso he's got money look at all them chips there's something pretty spectacular about one of those guys that can win those fucking World Series of bullshit you know who does that hey brother boost buffer from the UFC really yeah giant poker player loves that shit he's always in like poker or pool he said poker Thursday pool you did I'm looking at that guy's Bruce buff is a killer poster poker player like a legit one yeah he gets an old world series up I feel like you'd be really good at poker I can't no chance really zero desire to be sitting nothing's happening yeah but you but you can okay that's fair that's fair but I feel like as a you know martial artist who your mind game is such a big element I feel like you would crush it at a poker table probably not because this is tag powerful it's not fun to watch for me if I watch and I go I get it again I get sucked into that trap look I won't push it on you but I might call you the next time we have an a home game would be really fun to have you there I'm terrible I just touch it I just go there and talk shit it's it's just because look certain I just seen with golf like I've been told to try golf and I'm like I can't see I can't I don't want to get into it I don't want to get stuck yeah you guys are stuck my comedian friends would get in the golf they'd go on the road together with fucking giant golf bags and travel across the country and the day jokes at night they're always exhausted you walking around all day with shit is there a workout element to it like do you feel working if you're poor did you gotta carry your clubs but it's also like just the whole thing you're walking around this course right for hours and hours and you know like lining up shots and then move into the next shot you're concentrating all day yeah but shit takes forever it's guys they love it especially rich dudes like rich dudes who do business love to play golf they get together and they fucking SWAT that ball around chase it in the gear yeah you mean like Golden Tee it's I get it it's a super skillful game but it's like to me it's interesting as an outsider who's never been bit by the bug I know that if I tried it I'd probably get bit by that golf bug it seems like everybody does using game an extracurricular sport that you're into like tennis no never done that seems to me a recipe for meniscus damage that I need for other stuff I need a sheet I need to keep my meniscus healthy for other students elf I love Tennessee I would get so mad if I couldn't like do jiu-jitsu yeah because I played tennis yeah yeah you know that's a solid reason not to play tennis for real imagine what it must have been like the first time a human being invented a musical instrument for real imagine having been the drum maybe probably yeah probably an Olympian maybe some sort of a reed that someone blew yeah went through yeah made sound mimicking what the wind was doing or bird calls right trying to lure that turkey in I don't know what that sound like oh my god some guys can do that insane yeah there's no hunting buddies and stuff they have legit turkey calling contests and elk calling contest or men that oh my god it is no sportsman's channel might have some footage on it but mostly but you can find it on the internet because these dudes okay yeah these dudes they of course they have these turkey calling contest oh my god and they're like try to sound the most like a turkey they can do I can't do with my voice clear and the elk one they put like a little a little thing in their mouth like it's almost like a it's like a read it's like a flat read and it sits on the top of your mouth yeah and they blow into a tube to make these sounds like a really horny male elk yeah and they have contests crazy how do you know how do you know if it's a good concert good question it's a good question Wow it's a really good question yeah Wow but it's an art for sure it is when you hear this dude do it and make it sound exactly like an elk like wow and they can talk they've been around elk for decades they can kind of talk elk shit and they're also attracted to them a little bit okay what sounds like that's probably one of the first sounds right mimicking animals yeah but then someone figured out how to make a fucking guitar and no one's topped that shit since stop and think about that for a while whoever the fuck made the guitar that well there was made like cat gut or like animal intestines for the strings in the beginning I know that imagine how bored you have to be before you start doing that that I hollowed out for a year yeah when when did like the scales like when did tone become a thing this is fascinating it's what's a weird thought feel like I should know this homework to do should we write it on the staples note Packers learning about where in the sounds King was what is it was it like the Egyptians like who was the first musical instrument creator was it the Egyptians that we know of like where there's a depiction and an image of a musical instrument was it like a harp or something like that when do you think that would have been well I would think yeah I mean what what your what your time frame are we talking here for Jim I don't either Egyptians it was a long long Empire but they were alive this is how crazy it is Cleopatra was closer her life existed closer to the birth of the iPhone than it did to the construction of the pyramids what yes what yes Egypt has been around for a long fucking time yeah yeah 2500 BC is the estimated year that they built the Great Pyramid of Giza and Cleopatra was like I think she died she died in AD and she died closer again closer to the iPhone she died like the first couple centuries or something ad that's so the Egyptian Empire had been around for fucking do you do you ever think about like in the in the alien sense you know all the conspiracy surrounding the pyramids and things like do you ever wonder about like more of the extraterrestrial affiliations with the Egyptians not just the Egyptians but with human beings and this is why because it sounds ridiculous because ridiculous mean talking about people don't like to talk about it right so don't it doesn't get considered as being a potential reality but we're so different than every other thing on this rock there's nothing even close to us we're so weird we make music we can talk we can send video through the sky yeah we understand Schumer we understand nuance we understand chaos and you nice and love and we're constantly making newer and better shit and there's nothing like us everything else is just trying to mate even mate that's it even dolphins dolphins are as smart as ice apparently or maybe even smarter live a giant head they have huge brains they vikins their their sonar capade they have all this all shit that we don't we can't even comprehend their language is complex we don't even know what it is we know they have a language but we don't even know what they're saying they also like to like play they have games seems a lot of birds crows like to play but we're so different yeah we made crazy shit we can nuke us yeah yeah we can nuke each other we can fucking power our phones with the sky I mean we're weird we make we did we like this fucking wind I want to turn that shit into a electricity we figure out how to make windmills and planes that soar through the atmosphere everything else is just fucking and eating well sometimes I well like back to where did music come from you know sometimes I wonder if like the people that came up with these things I mean obviously you can go to school and learn a trade or you know become a master of your craft or engineering but like sometimes I wonder if it's just like some weird other dimensional source that come out of nowhere that's what I think ideas are ya that's I'm saying idea I think motion I've been saying this for a long time I think we should think of ideas as a life form that's trying to propagate it hmm because everything that you see came from an idea everything yeah every invention every everything every song that you've ever written and sang every book that's ever been that stuff every book ever written came from an idea and then boom it's a real thing like imagine if ideas because we don't know where they're coming from I feel like that when I write sometimes I'm like what do you ever feel like that was like almost like a gift like something's giving you a gift yes like a chant like it was a channel of sorts look yes whatever yes it's weirdest I don't want this to be misinterpreted like 100% give you credit for creating it weird about this but don't get where I'm coming from what I'm when I'm coming from is everybody that I know that creates things has a very similar narrative they're like it's coming out of nowhere like I just have to be there to get it mm-hmm you know it's a thing where you in the group and it particularly if you spend a lot of time on it and you're working at it and you're passionate about yeah and you're focused on it it's it's almost like a muse even if it's not real it's still real because it's it's there's an accuracy to like if you pretended that there was some god that was bestowing upon you these amazing ideas if you focused on it and if you you led the correct life and lived the right path then it would give you these gifts if you focused on your art form and that that would be like if someone told you that that was a God doing that you like God it's so ridiculous what do you give a shit who's doing it it's the same thing it's like a God's doing it for you it really does work like if you focus on what you're trying to do hmm these weird moments do come out where creativity like pops up and you don't know where it came from an idea will come to you I think it's equal not equal parts but it's you know when you put in the effort to like keep the muscle flex like the creative one where you're writing regularly or you're practicing regularly and then you also kind of let it you know sort of come in yeah it's you know I saw Dan Harmon speak once at one at Duncan Trussell 's live podcasts and he had this he said he he called it the ginger bread man theory and he said it was almost like he was a giant I don't know why this was what he said but he was a gingerbread man and there was a big hole in the top of his head and there was all this shit falling into this hole from somewhere and every once in a while about 10% of it would lightly dust the rim inside of the gingerbread jar and that was him and the rest was other stuff Jesus Christ I love Rick and Morty you know think about that and then watch Rick and Morty yeah yeah but you also have to like put in an effort to inspire yourself inform yourself read and learn grow live and then you put all that together and you know have you have we ever talked about the war of art Steve field book yeah for anybody that's into it's not just like writing but it's kind of about writing but it's also about like I think everything there's a weird thing that we call that you know we call procrastination and and he calls it resistance in the book it's really interesting because you realize like what is there's this weird thing that tries to keep people from being their best at stuff mm-hmm trucky there's like a weird confusion and stress about it that keeps you from focusing on what you really need to do to be a true professional and he sort of lays it out in the book in a way that makes you go oh yeah I never thought because he figured it out like when he was like 40 years old yeah figured out what he had been doing wrong changed his direction and then became like super successful as a writer yeah and is like really respected as a writer and this book is one of the most interesting things because you know like his history that he kind of figured out how to get out of his own way yep and puts in the work mm-hmm well cuz I think a lot of its subconscious too it's like you want to succeed and you want to you know grow and evolve but then there's these obstacles of like yeah but you know what today I'm gonna do this I'm gonna you know you know what I got I got a call you know you just kind of procrastinate in this it's it's a powerful force you know and and that can grow into so many things you know your self-doubt then oh I'm not ready I can't do that I'm not ready I can't play that show or whatever you know I'm not that's not a good example but it seems like there's a wrestling match in creative people's heads particularly performance artists like you guys are the comedian's or singers anybody where there's a wrestling match between like creating stuff and and and being disciplined putting in a lot a lot of work or slacking off and feeling like oh my god I got to get back to work again and then being really excited to work hard and get going again and some people fall too far into one way or the other and there's like a weird balance in there like you almost like have to be scared yeah fuck yeah you know I'm saying yeah I think that because that's that's your vulnerability is a big part of its you know giving an honest thing to a crowd when you're playing music or comedy you know I think that sorry I feel like I'm talking too much Gary I i've played music with folks and and i don't want to like say say this in a knock against conservatory students and things like that but i found that people that are really really smart in the musical education element and and you know again i got a lot of friends and i hope I'm not stepping on any toes but it's almost like harder for them to vibe out because they're so smart and they're they're almost mathematical with their playing whereas like Gary like let's just fucking rock like let's hang out and like find the thing where I think sometimes I felt like when I played with people that I know I'm gonna get so much shit for this I'm so I'm like kind of I'm trying to I'm trying to find the middle ground that's like you know I'm not gonna piss off too many people it's not always the case right there are some brilliant but like the vibe is where it's at so what I'm trying to say is yes you can go to school and be the smartest and know the map frontwards and backwards but if you can't feel it when you're playing live and playing with other people then there's a huge missing element that's what I want to say I I'm not I don't want us but I think that you almost have more of an obstacle when you are you have that kind of intelligence with music because it's upstairs Barry do you agree with that or like this I think of it like a radio like like you know back in the day when you would to a radio you try and dial in whatever station and you get that Clear Channel sometimes you'd have to move yourself sometimes you don't you know that place and I think that as a musician for me what I'm trying to do is gather information around me got the little things and not consume myself with this so when I'm in that place to receive that inspiration that that thought or that melody whatever that is I'm not clouding myself with doubt or this isn't what this person is doing or whatever I'm just I'm here in this with everybody but I'm like alright I'm gonna dial this and so the noise goes away a little bit less you're a good listener like how can i as an artist how can i dial into that channel that how can i be the receiver and get that clearest thing and and whatever you were talking about with the ginger you know that little pieces yeah of you at the top is like you're holding on to to that thing yeah and you know putting that all out there as a as a force it makes sense to me but that sounds stupid no it doesn't sounds like some people are so consumed with giving what I know right and pushing everything out there that they're not taking the time to sit back and listen yeah like just shut the fuck up for a minute yeah listen to this beautiful inspiration that comes out of nowhere just listen to yourself you know Lassa being you know so when you show up to a place and you know you're jamming of course you're gonna it's gonna be somebody who just comes in and go it just gives you everything that they know right I just crushed this thing without without accepting the fact that like there's a weird a collective you yeah there's other we're trying to all tune into the same station and that's when that magic happens that's writing jamming or playing whatever recording can I ask you this approach something that you've evolved or something you knew intuitively from the jump that this is how you need to like to now and like look at things from don't get to like the way you're describing your ability to shut the fuck up and look at the world and draw inspiration from the world is that something that came to you in time or is it something that you always kind of intuitively knew I just I think it goes back to like sitting around smoking weed with my friends and just like so much pressure on myself to be yeah what it is that you know what's happening yeah do you be this type of an artist to be this it's like just who listen to myself who am i and listen to myself I feel like he's listening to the you know this is gonna sound and tuning in that channel just gonna sound goofy but that's what comes out and your music when you did that Midnight Rider comfortable Jamie find that shit oh no I'm such a wonderful moment because I hate using the word wonderful but I really mean it's the only word for that spot no it's just gonna be a big resurgence of the whole cellphone thing again if they don't understand you never know rehearsal you guys never sang together you didn't do shit together you guys bust out Midnight Rider I couldn't I love that song I couldn't tell you the fucking words if I had to sing it right now be like oh I might fuck it up I don't I I say you know like I said that was my early morning smoke weed and go to the radios song that's a fucking amazing song oh my god this is one of my happiest moments as an audience that's Gary Clark jr. sound right there Texas baby what are you playing at 3:35 that's yours that's ours [Laughter] yeah I know Oh God that was fun that's what I was talking about you have a sound man if somebody played me that riff and I'd be like that's Gary Clark jr. a hundred percent boy someone pretending to be him well that's cool I'd like to piggyback that because when when you came in and played on my tune in July you were just straight into the amp and you were doing things with the guitar that I was like doing and like I don't it's it's you it's this guitar but you didn't have any pedals you're just straight in yeah just out there you know I have video of you playing and I loved it because you're just so sweaty it's a good story because that and I'm just like so grateful it worked out but we my my dear friend John Spiker who produced the record he he's a hell of a guy and it was like the whole day we had texted about you coming in and you were flying in from Austin with your family and you said I think I'm gonna make it and you and then you said you couldn't make it and John Spiker was he also plays bass in tenacious d and tenacious d was having this like secret show happening for Kyle gases birthday in in Burbank and John was kind of like M deaiing the whole the whole night and all this stuff and so I was like Gary can't make it and then like a little while later you're like I can make it I'm getting in an uber I'm headed to the studio and then I was like shit John we gotta go we gotta go to studio and I couldn't get ahold of him cuz he's in soundcheck so I'm like calling all his friends and I'm like we gotta go and then finally he's like I'll be there in 20 minutes I was like me too and we get to the studio and the the air conditioning wasn't quite on so and it was in July so it like a hundred degrees outside and it was very hot in there like like kind of kind of insane and we had a half an hour for Gary to play you did like seven passes and it was so amazing I have video of this and I can't if I haven't sent it to you I have to because it's so great and you're just fucking shredding and sweating and then when you left you're like I feel like I just played a show cause it was so hot and it was great it was one of my favorite days and then I got to go watch nation's TV playing the shitty bar and it was honestly I was just like this was a great day yeah I'm I'm so stoked me as long as Fire appreciate you thank you likewise but yeah great guitar is something that's been a part of this you know the music history of great guitar is it's a crazy history you know it's it's one of those absolute most powerful inventions that human beings ever created was the guitar and then the electric guitar because some of the fucking inspiration has come from some songs yeah that just just make you just jump and scream and dance around your house you'd stop and think about I mean there's the vocals for sure there's there's the singing there's the bass there's the drums but goddamn a fucking electric card the guitar needs to be one variable you can't remove guitarists change lives they do yeah agreed they make you fucking pumped you can be on the elliptical machine ready to quit [Music] you'll find that extra juice right that's hilarious that's so funny that you say that is what motivates you because when I'm like on tour and I don't want to work out I think about you saying conquer your inner bitch and I'll be like fucking gotta get to that gym downstairs we all know that inner bitch oh sure you all have that inner bitch is like some of us have an outer bitch too we just need you [Music] yep let's have a coffee let's eat something in the lid digest and work out later right we all play a little weird - your inner pitch I you know in all transparency though to the per the workout you know portion of this conversation I definitely at this point in my life work out harder than I ever did in my 20s Wow I love it it's awesome it makes me feel so good would you start doing well you know I last year when I played with hozier the Irish dude you know we had a lot we had a big tour and one of the girls in the band Rachel Beauregard this amazing woman she's a yoga instructor and just like kind of an like natural athlete and she would just work us out almost every day Wow and so every day we would do like just about everyday you know yoga or like circuit training or she'd like have a group text in the gym and it's just like my mental game alone was just it just to have that release almost every day was it was great and I used to be pretty lazy with it was working out and so now I I do I work out almost every day if not every other day I like take a day off every other day that's fucking awesome it's yeah thanks trying to make you proud so much better yeah across the board just but like you know I love my body but I also love like the the just the effort you know yeah I feel good and then I can you know go drink as much as I want and I don't feel bad no I'm gonna get like a Buffalo Trace endorsement really come on now that's hilarious it's fun but it's I mean so many people that are suffering from depression that don't work out might please people please please it's a world changer it's better than a drug that meditation yeah but just you don't even have to fucking go somewhere man there's so many videos online if you if you're depressed is please please just try something physical try there's a drug that comes out when you do something physical and you can do like simple burpees in your apartment you could you could do something but there's something that happens when you work out it's not just like you know like a vanity project there's actual like benefits to the your outlook mmm-hmm you know and that's what people there's people that make rationalizations they besos rationalizations off the worst negative stereotypes of someone who works out all the time CrossFit Bros or bodybuilder dude people are like pretty happy you know there's so many you know I think we have requirements I think our body has requirements in terms of like energy expenditure and also threat there's worry and like about nature itself and when that doesn't exist anymore I think the best thing that you could do is challenge yourself all the time with stuff and like one of the best way to challenge yourself is like do something that's difficult and do something physical because physical things are always difficult so if you do something difficult meaning something that you have to concentrate on getting better at and think about and then also do something physically difficult so that your body gets its demands and you can see things more clearly right because there's the people that don't ever get a hold of their body also don't get a hold their emotions right they spaz out well you know per the the CrossFit thing too it's like there's a sense of community there too like these folks are they have each other's backs they're motivating each other and you know a lot of times when you kind of are like I'm gonna hit the gym and you kind of go solo there's a different trajectory I think you know I mean some some people can do a really good job at that I personally can't I will crap out pretty early and just really that's pretty good you know but if someone's pushing me and then I'll stick with it I couldn't agree more yeah I couldn't agree more it's the best ways for a class it's fun jujitsu class for MMA class or CrossFit I know there's f45 and or into that yeah a lot of people are into that bunch of people working out together it's motivation I don't I don't do well when someone like um kind of like makes fun of me for not keeping up like I was in a spin class once and this this a night I've never really spun before and I was it was hurting my back for some reason like I don't think I had my bike at the right height or whatever not to make an excuse for myself but I wasn't keeping up and the instructor kept calling me out in the class ambiently I know you hate me there in the back in the red pants I was like yes I do bitch fucking hate you I'm never coming back here again there's something about people making fun of people they think is effective positive that's usually doing good let's keep going see that would have been a hell of a fucking class you're vulnerable you're so vulnerable you know but that's that's a physical and it's also like a social experience like when you do a class with a bunch of folks because you kind of feed off each others energy whether you like to admit it or not you know you kind of like it's fun you see everybody's pushing yoga class I could do yoga by myself but I like it a lot better roomful of people we're all in this fucking struggle together yeah 90 minutes of bullshit yeah no I'm speaking of yoga I took the yoga class yesterday walk out of my class in Silver Lake Duncan Trussell stand in there and he I think he was there for the afternoon mindful meditation what sounds like Duncan yeah probably anyway and looked away and I took my sunglasses off and I was like hey I don't think he actually you're CIA plant rustles one of the great influencers I did his podcast a couple months ago it was really might have the best Twitter page in the known universe because he's the only one that's never succumb to taking anything seriously yeah like he has the most preposterous like suggestions for the future in the world and yeah his fucking Twitter page is amazing yeah it's so fun he's a funny dude he's so smart is that on his page that's a bloody dick what is that it looks like Oh what is that I fake salami challenge I don't know what that is I don't know what it is either but I'm disturbed I don't know what's happening Duncan and I became friends when he worked at The Comedy Store he was one of the people he was a comic there but he was also the dude who you would call in like if you're in town he'd say hey man I'm in town Monday and Wednesday and they put you on the line up so I'd called Duncan so and we I would give him my days and then we wound up talking on the phone for like fucking hours like dude do you know about hours to Crowley yeah fucking psychic yeah UFOs and the reptilians oh my god oh my god and then we just became tight just from talking on the phone when I would call in for my reservations yeah you know my days that I was in town and then we started doing gigs together yeah you know he's one of the most interesting people I've ever met my life I don't know anyone like it he's he's incredible yeah I I don't know if it's okay to say this on air don't say it okay no but like he continues to like and like he's like yeah there's no one like him no yes he's a truly unique gem yep and I'll tell you that story later this is a televised platform and and we have to do you know this company was sound commercial because I do commercials for them but it's real they were founded in the 1700s the same company they did they even operated through prohibition by they had medical weed licenses right for four people in California yeah yeah you know they had medical weed licenses for people in California thank you though I know you what you doing you try to get my for people in California before it was legal right but before alcohol was legal you could get a medical medicinal alcohol use license right during Prohibition like the man gets shakes the only thing that can hand it to you what a racket but this fucking company did that alton prohibition so they've been making whiskey three hundred fucking years I love that bonk it's a good story well done near the same time period I read that there was like a religious exemption also for wine for Judaism if you were around you could just I don't know the way you could disperse alcohol but there were also no limitations into what it took to become a rabbi there were hundreds of rabbis oh man everywhere but that's a lot of work like I don't think they were working I think they're just okay honorary doctor because like to be a rabbi and to go through all of the the literature would you the question well whether you would or not if you wanted to do it it's no moral judgment or ethical judgment it's a it's a fucking immense amount of work like if you if to go from learning Judaism to yeah fuckin rabbi yeah you know that's not an easy path that's kind of that's kind of like in the Terence Mckenna book true hallucinations where he is studying he goes to Tibet and he's trying I'm gonna totally butcher this because I literally read it this morning he's he's trying to go to this like God I'm gonna this is so bad okay help me out if you remember what I'm talking about where he's I haven't read it since 2002 okay so are somewhere in that range when I first started really getting into McKenna I don't necessarily okay help me out here so if he's studying Buddhism and he's but he's really trying to get to this like top level was eating when he was interested in the chain know he's trying to get to it's almost like a heretic like cultish area of shamanism that also involves psychedelics and he had all these preconceived ideas about like what they were doing but it was sorely frowned upon for him to go study with these people but he needed to learn the language first does that make sense and I'm just butchering this we should delete this he was he was posing as a student studying one thing but he really wanted to get to this other thing that had primarily to do with psychedelics and was frowned upon in the that religious community I it's bad are usually was into that with almost every religious community and he had a pretty firm belief that all religious experiences initially with a result of psychedelics right and he was he was big on this theory that he had that his brother actually does almost a better job of explaining called the stoned ape theory okay his theory was that humans became human because of psychedelic mushrooms interesting and that the psychedelic mushrooms are the aliens and that psychedelic mushrooms exist in other planets and they came over here on asteroids and slammed into the earth because this spores can survive in a vacuum and so this weird life form that actually breathes air like us ya know he exists almost it's II absolutely yeah they're weird like to deny that that mushrooms are weird like you definitely haven't done them then because if you don't think that might be alien life but you haven't done them if you haven't done enough I'm not mad at you and just like it's not scary that might be worth it so the story about people being like created people by aliens we're talking about earlier maybe the aliens of the mushrooms and that's what McKenna believed yeah I had this theory that and got a bunch of like fucking science behind it weird and the way I say fucking science should show you I have no idea what I'm really talking about it's a great theory about the reason why humans went from lower hominids to human beings right was because we ate mushrooms Enlightenment's the reason why the human brain doubled over a period of two million years was the regular consumption of psilocybin mushrooms yeah because it existed all around us and then we ate them all the time and then eating them all the time literally cause some sort of fucking neural enhancement of the animal it's a super controversial theory but when you listen to his brother Dennis talk about it Dennis is you know he's alive and well and a super brilliant guy and he explained it to me and semi scientific terms I say semi because I don't know what the fuck you really meant but the way he explained the development of language that the reasons where psilocybin could actually have enhanced the development of language yeah they didn't make sense I mean the the core of their mission when they went into the Amazon in the 70s with no cell phones no sat phones with I mean they could like there could have been two dozen things that could have killed them on their way to this this village he's like profound in and of itself yeah and the dedication to their study it like is blowing my mind and it makes me feel like I haven't lived at all did you ever hear the lottery hare a story where Dennis McKenna talks about eating so many mushrooms that it literally like lost all knowledge of who he was and what life was amazing week's breakthrough slash breakdown slash expansion contraction yeah supernova inside of his brain that left like fucking reeling for a long period of time I don't wanna say how long it was but Terrence described it and he described it like you just went bonkers yeah he ate so many mushrooms like he crossed over to the other side and then he came back I've never done like heroes DOS you know like I well that's not true but I think that like there's this part of me that's like you know that are gods DOS I think or the Thor shits on it that's yeah because if he was by himself would even remember to eat would he remember to go to the bathroom what do you remember to take people with him who knows I'd have to review the story but he's so fucking smart it's confusing he's one of those dudes you talked to him you're like how do you remember all this stuff like what do you you talked to me about the actual origins for speech and like why could have been connected to psilocybin and the impact that psilocybin has on the brain and it's this weird thing it's it's like that's a comforting thought though the man has done so many drugs that like on top of his intellect that's really cool he's a super super super nice guy too but it's almost like there's a key slot in our brain for mushrooms oh hey Klunk yeah it just fits right in mm-hmm it just locks right in place and it might be the reason why we are who we are and somewhere along the line we forgot you know I've definitely okay if this isn't okay to say on the air we can take it as totally but I've microdose you know after tours but like when I was sad after tours like I don't know Gary if you if you get like this but I'd have this like comedown of like depression for a couple weeks after the road and like there's that initial excitement to be home but then your body isn't used to the non momentum you're you're like you know like the train stopped but you kind of keep going another you know 100 yards or 500 yards or whatever and I I would get really sad and I come home and sort of feel like I didn't know how to come back to my reality it's lonely it's kind of you know whatever but I would microdose a little bit and it would just kind of get me out of my depression the tiniest bit I wouldn't even trip I would just take a look a bit of you know and I think there's obviously like this is nothing new dozens of people are doing that now but it's something that I like I'm I think is it's really profound and helpful has been in my life yeah a lot of people will agree with you it's so funny that I thought after all we've been talking about this is the moment where I'm gonna get a phone call from the feds I'm happy with it you know that's on the ballot to make the decriminalize mushroom right I know you I don't know much about it but trying to push it through and thanks to people like maps you know who this that organization run by Rick Doblin is doing all this crazy work to try to show the benefits of psychedelics particularly with MDMA and soldiers PTSD you know the MDMA in soldiers yes MDMA and people a victim of violence victims of auto accidents a really common one for PTSD a lot of people getting auto accidents and have that yeah and they're doing this work with PTSD and MDMA and they're trying to show like this is a legitimate therapy that's really like highly effective when they look at it like that instead of looking at like some it's some illegal drug that's great only terrible right and so you got pharmaceutical companies that are gonna want their you know take on it which that's the problems that have influence yeah the problem is not that they exist because they make them a bunch of amazing shit pharmaceutical drug companies make amazing shit and she keeps a lot of people alive it keeps a lot of people healthy but they also are invested in making tremendous amounts of money and yeah they're like cellphones if they find a threat to that money and they move in politically and they stop that threat and they'll hold back certain drugs from being turned legal but a really beneficial that might cut into their profit margin well I like briefly told you about Sarah set the the sleep therapy I did yeah tell me more oh my god so I have had insomnia for over a decade like most months I could look back and tell you what days on I could count on one hand that I slept like eight hours so I would fall asleep and then wake up three hours later and just kind of deal with the night and in and out and it was a it is and was a really tough way to live you know you kind of just it sort of rules your world a really good friend of mine my friend Jake I met with him in December and he said I really think you should try this this program it's called Sara set and and what it is is he he helped me obtain a like a mobile device for my house but you can they have facilities all over the country and what it is is these sensors are you wear this headband and it has sensors on your frontal and temporal lobes and it comes with a tablet that is basically bouncing soundwaves off of your skull so you listen to these series of tones that are like ding ding there's no order to it and it is it is sort of measuring the the brainwave activity inside your skull and then evening it out right or left brain it sounds so crazy it sounds so crazy all I can tell you is that I dedicated myself to it for five weeks you don't have any alcohol you don't have any marijuana not even CBD yeah you feel me naughty yeah can you do it I know you can you do your silver October yes so I can do it I I was the first two weeks were horrible the first two weeks were like it got worse before it got better but I I can tell you right now for the first time in over a decade I'm sleeping through the night Wow like like I never was I mean obviously if I'm like partying with my friends I'm not gonna sleep through the night but I have I did it it's so different my life is like and I I have a different I'm like my anxiety is kind of chilled out cuz I'll sleep that makes sense yeah but also recovering better so something I I learned through Sara set was that like I talked to this woman in Indianapolis that was helping me like with the program and she had a you know she was like have you had any significant head injuries which I have like a jet ski accident I was 22 I got fucked up I got concussed and I had like two points of impact it was really bad and she said you would be surprised at how that can have an effect on your like flight mode like I've been like run from a tiger mode kind of thing and you know basically the the program is tailored to people with PTSD head injuries or just high stress levels and yeah man it's been great that's amazing I'm so and I'm really grateful that I had a friend who was looking out for me to help me with it because I mean I was just kind of getting used to not sleeping you know regularly a woman who used to fight for the UFC her name is cat Zingano badass chick from San Diego and she had a fight with Amanda Nunez there's the UFC current bantamweight champion okay and this is before she was a champion and Kat actually wound up winning the fight but she got badder in the first round like really bad and her brain was fucked up for a long time after that like she had like significant imbalances in her hormone levels and it was like legitimate brain damage like she had issues - the way her brain got rocked so hard in the first round and she actually came back and stopped man Nunez which is crazy considering how much damage he had taken in that first round but she went to this place in San Diego that treats soldiers I can't remember the name of the place do you remember the name of that place Jamie and they used some something similar where there was magnets like very very powerful magnets and through some way it stimulates the areas of the brain that's been damaged and it regenerates the tissue yeah or regenerates the you know the the use of that part of the brain I don't understand it either but like you know sound is vibration so it's it's doing something I mean all I can say is that like I feel a dramatic difference that's amazing that's so that's crazy yeah and this is not an ad you could just probably Google Sara said it's cer ESET and they have facilities that are kind of popping up all over the place there's that there's another company I'm not sure what there's no place you went to no this is this is a really good friend of mine who was just looking out for me and knew how bad my insomnia was and he had a similar version of insomnia and everybody's different you know everybody's got their different like some people can stay awake all night you don't know how long before our robot overlords take control of our brains I don't relieve us from all the pain and suffering that it is to be human turn into a cyborg now I am Bionic the more I think about aliens the more I think they're us in the future that's one of the theories that he's always been bounced around because if you look at what a human looks like versus what a gorilla looks like if you keep going with that it's as a big giant head the control space and time around it that that's probably what we're turned into and we're gonna do it through electronics we're gonna introduce something into our brain whether it's that Elon Musk thing they're trying to do with it drilling holes and putting wires in your brain neural link it's gonna be gonna have like super fucking accelerated ability to access information it'll be always at the tip your fingers I'm guessing you know eventually I mean how long before were robots we already are we are it's already like I don't know this is gonna give you love 24/7 through an IV drip I mean you don't think this is a simulation right now it might be it might be or am I not being and that's the problem the problem is it's so weird it might as well be a simulation mm-hmm it's so bonkers it might as well be a simulation it is it's weird we watched some political game of Thrones type shit television that's a scary way to put us at ease it's fascinating yeah how do we do what do we do now it's so weird it's so weird I yeah every once in a while I wake up and I'm like I think I just woke up in a different dimension like I know that sounds crazy crazy though it some of this stuff is so overwhelming the way we're changing so quickly yeah the information that's coming at us that I don't know if I'm shutting down or if I'm just like going to another place we are currently alive and conscious on a raft headed to a waterfall cool that's what's going on we're waking up what the fuck yeah we're what's changing so yeah yeah we're going 25 miles an hour straight to our towards a goddamn waterfall it's definitely gonna kill us I you know what though I don't Gary how are you doing Gary's empty we need to get Gary sorry Phil I could probably choose to to pee yeah see God thank you and I will see nice things about this conversation we're gonna try to figure out some sort of a like a national mantra we're good we should keep it positive people mess cows dangerous do you want to open up this stuff this is the stuff that Susanne brought for Rosa's small batch please hand me your glass kind sir we need to get some sort of glasses made out of animal horns this bitch makes it not a glass like Jamie's all fuckin bullshit you gotta cool if I doodle a little bit [Music] I owe you that guitar I told you but they only made them in yellow dude I don't care what color and the guitar you want to bring here is it could be bright pink I'll put that motherfucker on the wall right next to Richard Pryor oh yeah nice let's make it happen didn't ever tell you the story about my friend Phil Hartman when he was a kid he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix for one night he was like what I would whatever you would call it a grip someone who's a stagehand and he was a he was a teenager and Hendrix is at the whiskey and he's there putting his hands on the speaker's making sure they don't fall over because they were kind of perilously close to the edge and fucking going off he was just going off right in front of a bow right in front of them right in front of him and he said dude he goes he was feet away from me I could have touched him he was Hendrix Phil Hartman told me with great me and Phil Hartman got high a couple times during that era it wasn't much he got high he got high a lot in fact I might not have even gotten high definitely got drunk anyway he was telling me about when he was a teenager that he worked with Jimi Hendrix he was a stage tech at the whisky wait so how old was Phil them he must when I met him I want to say he was 46 when I met him coming off a Saturday I'm so like 90s 94 is when I met him okay I don't want to say he was like late so when he was a teenager Jimmy died in late 70s right he died in 1970 I think right okay so how old the fill out so when I met Phil it was 94 that was 24 years later does that make sense if he was like 19 at the time or something like that Wow so anyway he's a kid and Hendrix is right in front of him and his job is to make sure that the speaker doesn't fall into the crowd standing there and he's looking up at the stage standing from the stage and fucking Jimi Hendrix's right in front of him in this prime you know when when everything is going down you couldn't believe he was real you couldn't believe he's standing right in front of you like Hendrix didn't exist before there was no there's no pre Hendrix there's just Hendrix and everything else is like like you read about Eric Clapton like Eric Clapton's quotes about seeing Hendrix play for the very first time it's fascinating yeah because you realize like with these top of the food chain guitarists go to see Hendrix they go what the fuck are we doing what are we fill said it was happening right in front and Phil you know would dabble in music for fun you really enjoyed like playing guitar and fucking around so for him to be a kid and to be standing right in front of Hendrix performing was like wow did he know at the time was like well he was a fan at the time you know but I mean this is like I guess it has to be like 69 or 70 whenever that that day was Jimmy's like rain you know we need before he was like playing clubs and then playing you know to the magnitude question that's a good question mmm I'm not sure before like really getting out there and playing live playing live and stuff it was like he's doing like two chillen so I kept on Isley Brothers right people like Little Richard right on okay they didn't like him doing all that fancy attention to yourself that's amazing don't be great on my stage yeah there's some sounds you know like one of my one of my favorite influences of Jimi Hendrix's Stevie Ray Vaughn well my absolute favorites cuz he managed to mimic Jimi Hendrix in a tribute way but also make it kind of his own like he did some shit that was clearly he had a sound she's grave on her sound yeah yeah but he was a clear Jimi Hendrix fan yeah like a superfan like that was a giant influence of him you could tell yeah but yet he was different like it wasn't offensive it's like when he did voodoo child Stevie Ray Vaughan's voodoo child is fuckin slammin have you ever heard a child's make it's not better but it's fucking amazing that's right it's a it's a it's a Stevie Ray Vaughan almost like the Hat that's a tribute in a way cool it's got a but it's got fuckin force behind it it's good it's another great workout song yeah man Oh someone mix it together there's a video on YouTube with both of them back to back well that's another guy that like there wasn't a Stevie Ray Vaughan before Stevie Ray Vaughan he's a unique human yeah like he had a very very unique sound yeah and cactus shirt let's be honest multiple times for over 20 years I never noticed that Gary come on you're a very fashionable man is he from Austin where's he from Oak Cliff Dallas Texas down goddamn well good shit comes out of Texas sure does exhibit no chaos great spots are there well they took a good chunk of the fucking country and claims it is Texas I don't want to say hey I'm not gonna get political I'm not gonna I'm just like as a as a texture fuck sake I mean you can't even go outside it's why it's so good it's perfect if you could take that sauna heat yeah just just condition yourself sure get a song yes okay now it's romantic like main main spot that you mean hub Texas yes Austin Texas is one of the best places on the planet Earth yeah and everybody knows it now unfortunately yeah the traffic's no no no John there yeah it's pretty some people say like Houston fucked Austin Houston fuck Dallas well a few Houston fuck Dallas and made awesome I should say that's what they say yeah I've heard that before hmm Austin is a weird spot right it's like Austin is sick somehow or another it's not it's not watered down in Austin is particularly artistic some weird way not entirely but there's a giant chunk of artists out of Austin it's a fierce artist yeah weird like yeah there's a lot of in Austin there's a lot of focus on Independence and a lot of like rewarding independent artists and independent musicians and appreciating like real shit right Boston that's one of the things about Austin it's like if a hundred percent more than I think any other city in the country favors real shit mm-hmm if favors authentic food authentic music it's okay it's a it's a different kind of town oh yeah yeah it's a different kind of town they not mind the normal bullshit they're in bulk it's a different spot you know and I hate to say it because they'll get swarmed yeah how do you feel about like well what's happened to it since it's like people like found out about it yeah I live a few miles away yeah that's good so you're not you're not in the belly of the beast you know but I I love I grew up there and I was a teenager there but on those streets and you know into the same faces every day for 15 years I seen somebody else yeah I mean for those young musicians out there were you don't have to deal with the bucket and playing out there for tips and have these people from all over the place coming in right they can you know it almost feels good did you do that you play with a bucket in front of you yeah you did you were a busker is that what it's called that's the official track in clubs like you know like hang out and you play for four hours watch this how do you play that's so cool and then you'd make six dollars yeah four people damn what are we talking when this was happening 90 98 through 2010 when did things I look for you when did things like legitimately happen when eat in 2010 yeah I got a call up from Eric Clapton's that can play my festival kind of changed my holy shit so yeah man burning candles you know but so I don't mind the the folks coming through you know I mean yeah if you intimidated somebody's gonna come take your spot and fucking game yeah it's it's happening everywhere you know people coming in and like how much you share you're really good at you're like I don't know you're generous man what do you mean like I feel like you have this ability to like when you were talking about you know tuning into the radio like you're a good listener that's that's what that means you know as a musician well I was a middle child so it's never been about me [Laughter] yeah that's perfect that's so good middle childs have a chip no but I mean like that that's a really positive way to look at rapid change like a city like Austin that you know you could say it's being inundated with just like this huge volume of people coming in and it makes your life whatever but instead you're like nah come on it like that's that's a good attitude I salute that but it's different yeah that's a great attitude for all aspects of life yeah the idea that someone's gonna take your spot like they're not gonna take your spot it's not it's not what's happening your spot and that's a that's a fucked up way to live yeah you're being scared I think for a long time people you know really dealt with scarcity yeah you look back at people that lived in like the 1920s and 30s did we like 110 pounds like all the men little tiny men everybody didn't work out they worked you know people were like hoping you didn't starve to death right you know through the 20s like the roaring 20s and then the depression that I mean what you know people starve to death it was like a regular occurrence mm-hmm and this parts of the world that that's happening right now yeah we are we're a weird animal yeah we really are yeah and what we are today is so much different than what we used to be like at lightning speed mm-hmm isn't it funny to think about like the gym and all the intricacies you heard my call to butBut no no like to like our physicality and how we tailor our bodies and workouts and then just what you said like 1910 and people are weighing 110 pounds and like you know they're just eating trying to get enough money to eat and then like we have these lifestyles of like to a science or exercise and our diets and it's fuckin fascinating yeah we're just trying but also people around the world are still living like that we're trying to night no matter much yeah that's we're trying to do they're trying to stay alive we're trying to not eat oh my god it's so hard no I mean it's like let's take a minute would you know how hard it's hard to do things yeah it might be hard to mentally do not do a thing yeah that mental struggle is real as fuck though right yeah I think there's like a weird line of being like conscious of that and then feeling worthy of your own lifestyle and your own life that's where your reer weird robot overlords helmet comes in place yeah become one with the vibration Suzanne there's no there's no reason to be a rebel stay tuned I'm ready to change some shit the narrative I don't know I don't like it what narrative do you not like you know music industry stuff I think I've been working really hard to go against the grain of like right now I'm self-released like I don't have a record company and I'm self-funded and it's really hard but it's also really gratifying at the same time because you know right now I since I left honey honey you know like honey honey's kind of ah nice for you know sort of yeah you didn't knew the territory no yeah well we we're figuring it out you know well well said but you know the the battle is getting ahead you know and and being a woman and being in my 30s and and not like you know no one wants to hop on board until they know it's working even though I made this incredible record and it's so well received and then folks are like yeah well you know call us when it's when it's working rather than like get in now right and you know I feel I don't feel discouraged by that I feel informed but that that's a also a business move you know because it is we're taking art and turning it into Commerce and no one wants to bet on a horse that's not winning yet you know and you know I'm pretty I feel pretty good about what I'm doing I don't think I should be doing something else but it still struggle you know so when I said I want to change the narrative it's it's sort of like I want to kind of prove to myself and others that like you can do it like you find a way you know and it's it's really hard but you can do it you know and you get help from your friends like this is so cool to be here with you guys like I don't know if I could really convey that enough that this is a huge help to what I'm trying to do right now but yeah also this is the thing that like keeps me up at night of being like oh my god but at the same time you know the the music industry I'll just speak to that right now it's tough well it seems to me if I as an outsider has no business in the music business when I look at it like it's a big ship that had to like cut parts of itself off and now it's a smaller ship yeah and now it's like whoa it's still a pretty big ship but it's not what it used to be the money doesn't come in anymore in the form of record sales so it's it's entrenched its tentacles deeper into the industry and other things like merchandise and mate live shows and all these different things to stay alive and maybe it helps yeah maybe it doesn't it depends entirely upon the artist but I what you're doing at your point in your life were you like look this isn't fucking working like what what do I need to do like being attached to this group's not doing it being attached that groups not doing it what the fuck's doing it let me just try to not be attached to someone yeah and through the internet you have the option to put your stuff out there yeah and it gets a reaction from people what stuff like this yeah and then they go oh shit this bitch is talented well you know and thanks first of all that's sweet you know I love you I love you too I it's not like I want to like take over the world I just want to like make a good living love that's all I want you know and it's it's fucking hard but it's also yeah like it in a you know I want to capture that thing I want to get into the right tune into the right radio station and also not have to worry so much about like not having enough to get by you know that kind of thing and it's it sounds silly but it's not like that that is my reality but what is the major function of a record label not hating just wondering what's the major function of a record label when you're not really necessarily selling records so they try to blow up anybody's business well you you can't you want to weigh in on this I can give a little bit yeah therefore marketing promotion marketing they're the folks who helped you with budgets for tour mm-hmm they're a bank so when it's it's like yeah just for tour is it because you have to lay out money in advance to set up a set and to make sure that everybody gets to the place they have the money to get to the event and set everything up and then then they would reap some of the rewards so it's almost like an initial investment and then based on return from ticket sales right so yeah so like you know it's it's expensive to be out on tour right yeah it's it's a lot to be anything and everything basically and so what they do is they come in and they'll help you with with things like that and and but sometimes it doesn't work for people you know and that's that's the thing is like people coming to this thing going oh I made it I've got this deal but if your record doesn't they've invested all this money so it's kind of it puts this extra pressure on you to figure out what you need to do to make it and I think some people go down a different route and would change up switch up their thing and and but they can be very helpful yeah it depends on your attitude to a lot of it is your attitude and what you think of like you know are you being taken advantage of or a system just gonna pay off because there's so it goes so up and down you know depending on I would imagine would be hard to be free and creative and having a good time with it if you feel like you're being taken advantage of it would put a dark cloud over it there's that and I think there's also the misconception that once you get a big record deal and I've had a few where you think all of a sudden like you have to stop doing something and they're gonna do it for you that is like the biggest mistake you could ever make in and if anything you have to work harder and prove to them that like you're kind of worthy of their time and money you know sometimes it depends it depends on the company but you know essentially like when you sign a deal with these with these folks like they have a lot of your creative integrity in some ways depending on the deal on how it's shaped and you know they own your copyright if they want to own your record depending on your deal sometimes you have more leverage than others and you know if that's the case like fuck yeah good for you well I thought I saw you sell it for the exorbitant amount of money the idea that you would own the whole song like they would own the writing the music are different okay so you could still have someone else so that song so okay so I self released my last record ruby red and I learned a lot because I hired my own PR and distribution companies and I really got into the nuts and bolts on how all this shit works and I'm not sure if this has changed because sometimes this is you know going back and forth but when you own your copyright the digital return on things like Spotify and iTunes are ten to one so when the record companies own your copyright and all of your streaming is is like kicking like just fucking taking off they're making tons of money on your even ten times more than you are yes yes to Labor's now earning over 1 million per hour from streaming that's fucking insane shit so they figured it out they figured out how to get deeper into the arteries like real close to the heart but the hustle is like trying to get but they also they also have the keys to a lot of doors you know think it's like a weird trade-off to but I have a feeling if you just look at the landscape that that is less and less of an issue almost every year there's you don't create feuds I don't think they necessarily have the keys to arenas I think if you go through major agencies that's that's solved and I think distribution over the internet just through people finding out about it and sharing it tossing it around it's probably as useful if not better than anything because I'll find out about it podcast find out about it people on Twitter find out about it they retweet shit people Instagram repo stuff and then it hits millions and millions and millions and millions of people 100% organic and it happens all the time which it is good I mean it's almost like you're you're bankrolling on it not being a good idea if you do it with somebody else it's like what you're doing is like bankrolling yourself yeah I believe in myself let's just put this out whereas if you do with a label you have to so many people have to be and there's nothing wrong with it and yeah I'm sure it's worked out great for both you and on numerous occasions but some of this has to believe in you used to have to work with someone there's a lot and I'm sure like well first of all there are some great companies I don't know what like you know what come what label you work with but you're fucking amazing and you're crushing it and you know like some companies that's not the case and you know people's jobs depend on your success and if they're scared and they go in in this in this way that it's not like it doesn't hit yes or something like they drop you fast yeah yeah and you know I'll speak well you remember when Prince had to change his name to a fucking symbol yeah exactly that is the perfect perfect yes imagine you are trying to keep your prince that's just business gyeo a tease of all time come I mean of all time goats he was androgynous before anybody knew what the fuck it was he was dancing around with high heels no one could say shit cuz it was so good think about all the homophobia we're talking about transphobia homophobia think about all the shit must have endured in like 1988 or whatever the fuck it is when he put out that first album and it didn't matter and he everybody it was so good everybody just had to step the fuck back when Purple Rain it was the way he was ridiculous Ryan Reynolds was in a movie about a singer who he was another planet let come on oh that guy was on he was on another plant really rarely people like this exist you ever get to meet him Gary no I fucked up one time no I came back from tour wanted me to come out the next day and I was jet-lagged and dealing with family stuff and I was like I can't make it tomorrow but my bad but such a big fan I think yeah I think I mean I funded that once I had a chance to see him at the Hard Rock in Vegas yeah like when he was just starting to do music again a tour again yeah and it was real late so yeah after midnight I was tired I'd do some shit in the morning work out I think we should all work out tomorrow actually let's work out tonight Jamie you and fucking bench press competition drop this fuck after a podcast hop a muscle my leg or something your meniscus no I was like my hammy somewhere my lower it's that's the bane of all existence but it's the source of so much pleasure how dare you it is I'm having a great time it's a rocky seas that's what whiskey and boot all booze and generals the rocky seas it's like you have great moments but you also have times are you gonna puke off the side oh yeah okay when was the last time you guys went to pukey town from drinking too much from jane it's been a long time but I'm cute from stomach virus just four days ago what oh my god in between shows of The Improv cheesiness my whole family had it my wife had at first and one of my daughters had it and then I'm like I don't get that shit bitch and you sure do in the bathroom at The Improv like that I do not feel good I'm like I think I might puke I had to go up in 15 minutes why don't I just make myself puke and I'm like all right let's make myself eat so I shoved three fingers down my throat and I didn't puke oh my god damn it my body was like oh you want a party I mean fucking cartoonish like down to the core of my lower lower spinal column I was gonna pull muscles a little bit I picked and I stepped up and I washed my hands and I went right back in I puked again so I got two off I did a show like that once and then I'll do the show and then I drove home and on the way home I was like keep it together bitch what car were you driving the Tesla Tesla nice is a comfortable ride so yeah very advanced ride so to keep you away from those horrible bumps it might disturb you I barely got inside my house and just I mean violent fight like the most violent throw up I think I've ever had in my life it was spectacular have you like that have you ever like that yeah I did the second show that night that way too but I made it to the second show with no problem the worst my friend we were in Austin playing it yeah and we just got back from the tour I was like a holiday show and everyone's there and we went got some pizza from this so me and my tour manager at the time really sit on the bus and we look at each other like five minutes hey guys you guys ready to go did you tell him no but it was pretty obvious yeah it was why my dad sweaty and never hidden oh yeah oh my god but we also had a thing over in Europe a couple of friends of mine these guys in my band had some oysters and oh no so we had to fly the next you know like in Europe when you're traveling this is occasionally with food poisoning is rough because did you know that when you get food poisoning on a boat they try to quarantine you know I didn't know that either yeah food poisoning apparently can spread from person to person never knew that until this weird night I didn't know anything someone someone got food poisoning on a boat and they couldn't leave the book find out if that's true [Laughter] [Music] because we were trying to figure out oh the oyster things Tom how it spreads but then my wife was like I think that shit is actually contagious like if you are the bacteria essentially right exactly [Music] you touch those things right yeah yes terrifying they want to make people dirty bitches they don't want people coughing in their hands and touching things then everybody gets food poisoning like you kids literally can't happen that way my last honey-honey show that was the I was it was puke City I don't know what it was I it started in the middle of the night before the show and you know it was it was playing gig that for us that we couldn't turn down and they had a bucket for me backstage in case I needed a like ditch does it affect your vocals yeah it affected everything it was well first of all the noises I'll be honest you know what happened been graciously let the crowd know hey Susie's not feeling so well everybody like just won't you know we're gonna give you the best show we can but like give her some love and I could feel it I could feel their support and I got whether it was adrenaline or what and I basically played in my pajamas like I didn't do anything to my face I didn't wear and I was wearing like I just went out there I was like like I was dead I was lying on the couch and they're like we gotta go and I'm like okay and it was a really intense show and but also in like a kind of beautiful like it was our last like scheduled show together and you know Ben and I were like crying and stuff and like we had this whole thing but the crowd really held me up they really did I didn't puke during the show ironically but I was sick for like days after that and and then I I flew to Dublin the next day to join the hozier band so it was like a weird mind fuck I don't I don't know a part of me wonders if it was something like weird like mental thing cuz no one else got sick but I mean I was really sick my dad was a mental thing but I doubt that I bet it was a mental thing though that that crowd raised you yeah you know they talked about like one of the worst things that happens to people in terms of like illness and disease is loneliness one of the worst things like there's something there's something about people that are lonely and sad it's it's one of the worst things in terms of like indicators of overall health like you just you just don't have a reason to go you feel bad people get real sick it's real it's real bad for your immune system yeah but on the other hand when people love you and you go out there and they know you're sick and they love you and they send you there's a it sounds hippy and woowoo but there's a feeling I believe in that it's it's a similar feeling that feeling you get when kickstart my heart comes on [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] honestly it's a hundred percent concur with you huh nice Thompson had a great quote about music being fuel yeah he looked at it like fuel save my life like like my sadness my joy all of it my inspiration it changes how you feel ya hear a great song it changes it's a fuckin drug it's just like a drug it changes how you feel music has always been a matter of energy to me a question of fuel sent to mental people call it inspiration but what they really mean is fuel I have always needed fuel I am a serious consumer on some nights I still believe that a car with gas needle on empty can run about 50 more miles if you have the right music very loud that's cool but you know music as a writer and as a listener has saved my life people do more work you like music changes like the way first of all how many people at their job they have some bullshit ass fucking job but music gets them through like warehouse workers sure people that are doing shit but they can hear music in the background music gets them through there oh shit not this one and they yell it out to their friends and everybody's having a good time while they're working I mean that's just a fact right it's every bullshit job if you can listen to music at a bullshit just empowering it makes that job way better yeah construction gig they suck when the fucking foreman comes over it says no music guys yeah like what gnome you what is what is television or movies without music oh we know there's a whole bunch of dead space but you also have that sort of like you know music score to your life yes you know you have those moments in your life where you're going through a breakup or you're going through whatever or you're empowered and you you know four on some run the jewels [Music] get out here yeah he's the crazy fucking speech at the Bernie Sanders rally get out of here like one of them goose-bumpy speeches whoo-hee to run the jewels I I get goose bumps I get like a physical reaction to their music it's so powerful and and killer Mike for president killer Mike ever runs for president everybody better be real he's a powerful orator like a fucking New Age preacher when he was doing at that birdie Sexton I'm like dude that's some serious shit you know like he was he was spitting flames brilliant man there's something about people that could do that right they can have those fucking giant speeches and that's one of the reasons why Trump is successful is his ability to stand in front of large groups of people and get big reactions but he says dumb shit he does but but it's all in who's your audience you know it's all in like who's there and what else have they heard that night right that might be the most fun shit they've heard that night if she it's like if you're a bad comic you know a lot of bad comics do they have terrible comedians open for them so you have like just like the audience is just in a coma by the time they get up in a sense that's what Trump is Trump's a comic who said nothing but shitty comics on before him so all the politicians before me even the most interesting ones are really boring to listen to talk to for long periods of time but Trump goes up there and it makes fun of Mike Bloomberg's height by ducking under the fucking table and any hillarie crazy hillier lion hillary and sleepy joe biden he makes jokes about them I'm not saying I'm not justifying what he does but the reason why he could even do what he does because everybody besides him when it comes to communicating is so goddamn boring yeah the way they get their message is so fucking boring yeah Jesus you're fucking killing me you're so annoying with the fuck are you man who are you why are you lying about your past why are you pretending about this it's a weird sleight of hand you know something they're wearing a mask killer Mike there's no mask now he's guns blazing oh yeah that kind of person is the future taco man that's what's gonna happen back to the truck it's like a it's like a magic trick but so is everyone else that's the problem the problem with saying that is so is Ted Cruz everyone saw the videos with Ted Cruz with his family like you know pretending to have like a real moment was family weird weird like sculpted fake scripted reality Trump is the antidote to that that's the problem they're all crazy - that might be a worse kind of crazy I think it's time to trickin it's like someone someone made a good description of it I think it was Kyle kolinsky that's exactly what was he was saying it's exactly like there was a bunch of crappy comedians that were imitating the cadence of Dave Attell he always had these brilliant punchlines and he he inspired a whole gigantic slew of people that have imitated this Dave Attell cadence most of it is hard and they're just fans and they wanted to be like him they might not even realize they're doing it and they eventually would find their own voice and that happens I'm sure with musicians it happens probably with everybody and are in everything right but the problem is it's like just just doing something like that is I can't listen you can't run the world if you're doing a character if you're doing this because you're trying to make it as a comic and you pretending you're Dave Attell fine but if you want to run the fucking free world and you do in the Obama thing and you're talking like this and you're talking the exact cadence exactly the way Obama used to talk like fuck you man that's not you who are you bitch who are you at least we know who Trump is he might be crazy it might be madness it might be you're right guess what they all want the whole thing's crazy yeah everybody wants to be President almost everyone yeah except a couple of them you know what I like well the fuck wants to run this thing crazy people I think it'd be cool if no honestly though if the Democrats like teamed up with who each other aliens oh I think they're doing that right now Anders you're you know a head of national security you're president you're vice president you know like it in this way that I think they all have strengths it's tough to feel like one of them has it all and and essentially that's the case with most people but if they I don't know I know the Democrats I hate talking about politics because people give me so much shit about it and it will fuck them I don't care I I think that like it's a really scary time and Trump is terrifying everybody's terrifying yeah but his his blatant I'm gonna pee I have to I'm holding it together that's why I'm so anxious right now wins this one we don't have to play any more songs yeah but let me come back you guys talk amongst each oh I'm good I'm quick to be to know Wow I feel like I have to pee again and I've already on that man come on now have I told you how much my mom talks about how good-looking you are oh really yeah she said it literally today I love her and I said mom Gary's married to a beautiful supermodel and he's about they won't now you've had your third baby yes well your mom she is she's great I wish more people thought like get out of here Gary think yeah it's a good life hey Cheers that's very sweet thanks for being here Wow how about it we're running the Joe Rogan podcast without Joe Rogan I don't a mean how many people have got to do this oh my god okay what should we talk about Joe what a legend with his space suit and his you know his antlers and as their taxidermy in this room I mean yeah yeah copy that no it's a special place I feel like we're in a bomb shelter of party town you know like we're safe here and we're gonna have a good time and we could stay here for a while yeah I wouldn't be me - yeah so how can we model our lives like it's like wd1 sauna sensory deprivation thing - what really yeah no but you know Joe ironically sent Ben Jaffe and I from honey-honey to a sensory deprivation tank in Venice Beach it was going well until I got to that point where I like panicked a little bit Oh Joe we're doing so good without you I really literally wrote down sauna I was just telling the story of when you sent Ben and I to the sensory deprivation tank the flow tank in Venice and with crash crash my man yeah and I kind of went in and crash was basically like look I'm gonna lock the doors and you guys are like in here you know do your thing and so I was in the tank and I got to this point where I like started to panic and I thought I was just trying to sort of go somewhere and then I was like what if what if crash didn't we've opened the air vent and I'm gonna suffocate go for the door and that I got it in my eye maybe I'm not sure and I ended up like going I had to like jump out and go to the shower and I was like my eyes all rinsed out and I kind of sat there in a towel like it's so ridiculous I failed my first float thing you never get this vents there's this air but I will say I went to a cryotherapy in Austin one of the last times I was there and I loved it it's great right you feel awesome I got I didn't last the three minutes I did like 2:30 before I started to panic I think they're supposed to make you do - the first time I did - 30 that's your rebel who's the first woman to say suck my dick was it was Fonda oh I was gonna say I hope I would hope it's like Sherman anymore anymore gij right remember she was a Navy SEAL she's like suck my dick that was the best a woman who's ever said suck my dick now you're the queen wow that is a great honor sir I believe I believe in me honey days and I you know I did have a nickname and it was suck my dick Seuss say a little too often it's like a reflex but it's a cool thing that a girl could save though she's never dick and everybody thinks it's hilarious like no one gets offended ranges like you're off the team yeah woman like you think so one day we would and this is where I get the me too from you guys that would be like a good indicator of like like douchebag ashiness she was upset of you saying suck my dick who are you yeah well that's the climate we're in which is kind of scary I don't think that way though it's not that way because that would require men to be upset at a woman for saying something like suck my dick that hasn't gotten that crazy yet I hope the only way could ever is immortality I don't think so either there's a lot of bitches amongst us there's a lot of bitches amongst us it could go bad we could hit the rocks and then bounce back you know what we need but we need to conquer those inner bitches that are just not capable getting up they can't yeah there's gonna be no movement agreed boom they're gonna hit that wall there's something some guys look there's a for sure a lot of men who would try to claim that way in that direction well let's hope that's not the case with this podcast [Laughter] cooperating a penis fucking horrendous injustice the appropriative pretty sure I said that at one of my I'm pretty sure I said that at one of the last poker games I played and nobody laughed so I was like oh fucking playing poker with a bunch of serious normies buncha normies they can't handle it how much money did you take from oh it wasn't you know she's trying to have to fuck up her game right now I've always wanted to be good at chess that would be a thing that would be like cool to tell people like I'm really good at chess really yeah yeah I guess so a thing like you're really good at a lot of other things so this is one of them once it's like universally respected right me to do to the place of chess like oh okay Gary how's your chess game now checkers on the other hand flip it up on his side eat you all day of four squares oh my god there's only so many games and there's only so many I love game shows in a day that's the problem I recently this is so silly my dear landlord slash friend invited me downstairs to play this game that was created by the Rich Dad Poor Dad author and yeah and it's I can't I don't know what it's called but it it's it's about it's a financial game it's like a adult Monopoly okay you get out of the rat race I'm always scared when I play Monopoly you get out of the rat race and then you go to the like big dogs and it's very enlightening because you're kind of like buying property and then you're like making deals and there's something about it that well I did you read Rich Dad Poor Dad no it's interesting it's it's an interesting way to approach your relationship with money if you've ever struggled with it or weren't sort of given a crash course on how to handle it or not handle it what did you get out of it um I got that like the the power that money can have over you is something to reconcile with you know in a way that you can live a healthier life and you know not obviously in a consumerist society like you kind of have this constant like I need I need I need all that stuff but Rich Dad Poor Dad I first of all I read half the book I didn't read the whole book so I can't really like speak on the entirety of it but it gave me a different level of confidence that money was taking from me you know like the war as an artist like I chose the life to be a musician I could have lived in Cleveland and sold spaghetti and had a comfortable life but family is great they have a great restaurant if that ship has sailed because it's like out of my immediate families hands but at the time I've had many many moments in my life where I was like should I move home and just like ditch this music thing because that would be so much easier and money's been like this you know you kind of have I've I've had a rollercoaster and it can like rule my sleep and rule my happiness and my anxiety but when I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and then in conjunction with this board game I played with Russell it really it's so funny it seems you know what it seems like part of the whole illusion of reality and obviously you need money to survive but this the stock that we put into it is pretty incredible mmm you know and and and like the things that we think that we need in order to to like satisfy us yes yes and and I feel like there's this weird mind game I'm always playing with it yeah like in in terms of like getting to the next level in my music career like it's gonna take this much how you're gonna get it you know all that stuff but at the end of the day I think when you sort of really like release your white knuckles on on the thing it all works itself out I know that sounds pretty you know broad but I think uh money is something that's entangled into life yeah there's there's great aspects to what you can do with your money but it's entangled into your life in a weird way there's like there's what you currently can do right based on your circumstances based on your life your health your responsibilities there's what you can do and there's what what's like what's humanly possible for you to do hmm and when you see people that are making a lot of money and you see that money that money starts you to get you think you know that's what you should do yeah you should do that money thing whatever that money is no no I used to make less money now I make more money and that makes more money then even I make I got to do what that is to get more money but then you do that you realize oh but this isn't fun you know most of my day is spent doing something that's not enjoyable that's not what I want to do so then it's what you want to do what you can do what's possible and what you want to do mm-hmm and they don't always go together sometimes what you can do is like you have too much responsibilities and you're you're always going to feel short-sighted by life because it's random and it's crazy and it's chaos but the money thing can trick you like if you have well you have a certain amount of money in the bank like Bryan Callen said it best to me he's like once you go to restaurant and you don't worry about what food costs he goes everything else is bullshit yeah I was like do you're right yeah cuz that's that's when you're free right when you know your rent is paid you know your your gas is paid your your car payments paid you're not worried about it at all you can just go eat let's go eat you don't care you leave a nice fat tip thank you good bye that's when that's when you're rich everything other than that is like what are you doing like you just trying to score points because that's what we're doing we try to get the high score let's get the high score I like that a high score like you're in there fucking playing centipede all day [Music] just passed pong super old-school dork shit but that's what it's like yeah it's like you know yeah the minute you stop obsessing about it it stops becoming a problem yeah in some ways I mean it depends on your situation but yeah for me it feels like this weird like spiritual grapple where I'm just like like one side chill out though all the things start yes always because you're more relaxed if you're more relaxed you're better if you're better you attract people that want to do stuff with you yeah desperate people yeah anxious people are the worst is angry people people that are angry that they've been fucked over by the system somehow and I'm not angry I will say that and I feel really grateful for that like with how hard I work in like trying to get the things that I really want I don't feel jaded or or you know cynical about it I feel really excited it's me and Brad Pitt yeah there's something about these days though like yeah I also have to appreciate them because when they're gone they are gone forever yeah they're gone they're gone forever I yeah I I think about that sometimes yeah cuz I do believe like I I know that I won't feel like I do now with like the struggle you know whatever but I also think like you know maybe this is I did not read the secret or watch the secret however I've had two guys I broke up with give me the secret as a book dues an arborist please limit trees but like you have to be funny and kind of my favorite poker tables is in bozo oh my god she is a hustler Gary stay the fuck away do not have a water pocket money this lady there's this bar there that has like a six seat table and I probably go in once a year and I love it and I don't know if the same deal of the dealer's name is Spencer and I'll walk in at the last few years I love it makes me feel so cool he goes honey honey and you can play off of 40 bucks for six hours and have a blast it's fun you know it's just fun it's a hustler I like to play cards I like that fun fun games are fun for people they are fun you know have you ever done those VR quest things when you put on a VR helmet go to a fucking warehouse and once yeah fight gargoyles and shit no I was dancing I was in a VR dance like with this robot with John Spiker Michonne Spiker had a VR helmet and I was with him and his wife in Lake Arrowhead and we were drunk and having fun and then I was dancing with a robot and then I got dizzy it's weird well it the thought of it is disconcerting because you're like it's so let's sound the visual the actual like depth of space you know you're like in a real setting and then you come out and you're like this isn't as fun as that and that's fucking weird like that's scary that's where we're at oh yeah that's where the future is because right now it's still pretty crude you can still definitely tell it's not real life but how long is that gonna last they're they're they're so Duncan speaking of Duncan had the very first htz HTC vive which is one of the very first consumer virtual reality headsets you could buy and he was like an early adopter so when Duncan when they were first going through it you'd put his helmet on it was attached to a PC via all these cables and you couldn't move very far you had a very small area can move in but and everything was really really really pixelated like in no way did it look real they looked more like like some sort of an old-school video game right okay but then I came back and I just podcast again two years later and I tried the new one and the new one was way better I was like whoa and the new one I was at the bottom of the ocean a whale swam by and I look right in the whale's eyeballs I was like holy fuck dude and he's like bro you should see the poor no they don't yes they do and and there was a few quite a few things you can do this one archery game it was amazing it was like almost like South Park style characters okay towards kill you and then you would shoot out I'm like Roman times like barbarians were attacking your castle and you'd be on this castle with a bow and arrow and you'd be shooting at these like South Park looking shapes but it was fucking crazy did you kill Kenny I killed all the Kenny's but the problem is you you're so tired cuz your arms are just doing this for minutes and minutes you're assaulting my shoulders retired yeah everything was tired yeah it's don't be a VR workouts like you do yeah for sure so you're like you know training with Olympia great boxing games that I'm super nervous you feel like you're boxing someone you got headgear on and there's a big Russian dude the fucking cross on his chest is coming towards you in time it's not their cartoon looking do they look like like Mike Tyson punch-out characters they're cartoon looking can you feel no no but you see white when they hit you oh that's weird that's disorienting yeah that's what it's like it would feel like if you you know feel more that is now as I say I was reading about one just yesterday that's opened up I think it's called dreamscape and have like yeah animal thing yeah like you have sensors on your hand and like the kids I did that dreamscape they have it in Century City but that's but the difference between that is it's not like a fight with a thing like the boxing one it's see it's a real workout yeah the dreamscape one's just fun like they have one that's alien zoo and there's like a thing there this this this alien comes towards you and you put your hand on its head to have like a little you know that we got working there and he's got a little foam rubber thing and he puts right where the should be and you touch it but you really feel like it might be touching this aliens fuck I mean I will say I feel like like there was like a little piece of my humanity that was lost when I was in a VR situation where I came back and I'm like I got lost time or something yeah well you said it's best that it's more fun sometimes than regular life and it's crude yeah when it's complicated yeah this is the argument for simulation theory the argument for simulation theory is we know it's coming one day if things keep if you go back to like the mom you don't think it's already here it might be I don't know I don't know if you go back to Model T and then look at like a modern brand-new BMW at the amount of technology of this shift is so radical and so so crazy and not that long 100 years or so imagine what it's going to be like a hundred years from now because things are just speeding we're still gonna be alive apparently probably so the stuff that we're seeing now in terms of virtual reality this is just a tip of the iceberg yeah yeah that's weird it's some freaky shit you're gonna be able to stay home and do concerts so that's the goal fully immersive like someone's on stage with you live show I don't know if you're right I do I do know if you're right I think you're right I think you're right but I don't know if you're right and I don't think I think we're limited to what we're we're we understand people are capable of right now I don't I think until our actual like resources collapse and you can't go outside and you have to live in a bubble nothing can replace a live music show or a live comedy show like when you're right there I think you're right for now until the VR gives you the like breath the wind on your face and the fucking heat from the pyrotechnics or whatever by the way I was at the Grammys when you played and the pyrotechnics were I was like there was fire I don't think they're very far away from being able to transmit a more immersive experience call me a purist fuckin sucks sucks you're gonna get a bunch of people that are just no you first the question is don't forget your thought that's not the question that was that was a request the question is I can't is I can't believe that you could replace check me out here yeah thanks friend the energy that you get from a live performance with virtual reality I can't believe or subscribe to that thought that it is gonna be manufactured digitally like you can get 3d effects of the sensory stuff with the sound and the visual and maybe even have machinery that gives you physical like air or heat or cold or whatever it would you know simulate that thing but I can't at the core of my being thinks think that you could you could substitute the energy that you feel when you connect with a group roomful of people cheers love you guys this is so much fun salute do you know I'm saying I do I completely agree with you but I don't okay I saw Tupac live at Coachella right Tupac go super jacked but was that the same thing no no it's not the same thing but I'm kind of in the middle like yeah this is what I think I really think this like right now you're right right now you can't be at a show where you're on stage live and get that same exact experience if you were at home on a computer or with a VR goggle I feel like right now yes but in the future oh they might be able to get to the point where it's better to do it through VR cuz I'm standing right next to you while you're singing on stage last not the intimacy of the crowd experience where look can look to your neighbors and be like fuck yes oh right simulate that one way you can you like that in cells that finally find an online community and when they've got reality they meet virtual reality not only is it more satisfying than real life has ever been for them it's the only one things better than real and you don't have that it's not happening this might be the only way where they can recreate some sense of community through digital entanglement like to do these together in a room real sexual entanglement you're so right but thank you unless you feel like fucking Gary angry some people are not gonna get they're not gonna catch the right break they don't have a good hand of card this is our this is the worst thing that could ever happen to us I think this is just a problem and a puzzle I think the way we handle these problems and puzzles is what's going to define our future that's what I think and then I think there's a lot of old-school people with old-school ideas I'm gonna try to keep things running the same way they were when there's no internet and no accountability I think there's a healthy level of evolving and integrating and also not going full-throttle robot there's all these things you know there's so many things happening at the same time that can affect your life forever you can't pay attention to all of them and that includes industrial waste yeah chemicals fucking life and sucking all the tuna out of the ocean and so where's the bunker where's the party bunker there's a lot of questions right the cosplay out do we fucking figure this thing out before the canoe gets to the waterfall well in all transparency though like when it comes down to it like the end I'm not afraid to die wow this bitch is crazy I mean I don't want to suffer and like burn and like nuclear like you know waste and and be like in that aftermath I really don't want that but you know when it's like if it's lights out i I'm pretty spiritual so I'm sort of curious of like what's next yeah and then if there's nothing then like what the fuck do I care yeah it is really right like this is what I've always said everyone wants to go to sleep but everyone's scared to die mm-hmm right everyone's looking forward to sleep I can't wait to shut off and I hope I come back good god first of all as someone who's been deprived of sleep I love it shut the pod bay door whatever the fuck is the future it's a matter of time we're hanging out we're heirloom people we're like the last group of people I mean I'm the oldest of all of us I'm 52 which means when I was a kid don't even bad shape of all of us though I'm going the same time what is that was that quote there's a quote inspiration is like bathing it's effective but it must be done daily said it that's the quote there's quote like that forget who's had that inspiration it's like bathing yeah yeah it's like it's effective but it must be done daily I can brutally and really unpoetical II paraphrase that do you know how I like back to like having the Blues having like depression and stuff that Bertrand Russell the first thing that popped up a zig Zigler said I was also changed a little bit I've seen 10 variations of inspirations like a shower you need it daily and be an amazing team ease so on it is the best he's the best he's a goat I know I love that guy yeah but but back to like you know / inspiring yourself man whenever I've been like really in it in my like head and and down I just read a book just something that takes your brain away from what you're concentrating we're just like you develop a new story or inspiration or like even just like jargon you're getting new words there's something about it that's really empowering you know I watched a movie again real recently that I haven't seen in quite a long time it's called Jurassic Park it's called happy people like a tiger it's a warrant werner herzog don't mentoring it's a great documentary about these really really really fucking happy people and they live in siberia and there's 300 of them in this town and some of them are trappers and some of them are hunters some of them go out and pick pine nuts and they grind them in this old-fashioned wood machine they have dogs everywhere they live on the base of this river and they scratch and claw and get by every year they know what to do they work every fucking day they get up they run nets through the ice in order to catch pike I think where the kids have like Hawks on their hands and like Eagle no no okay sorry the Mongols these are these people living this really really really hospitable cold as fuck area the river is only thought for like 2 or 3 months out of the whole year the river the fucking River it's a great documentary but I want to watch in okay and the thing about it is the city Werner Herzog he's one of my favorite documentarians cuz he's like he's so passionate about fascinating things whether it's this or grizzly man or the one about the the cave paintings and in France there's amazing documentary about these 40,000 it's 40,000 year old cave paintings they found in this cave in France or like what in the fuck aggghhhhh imagine what these people's lives were like these creative people that were like becoming what we are today but only 40,000 years ago so they're probably really fucking similar to what we are and these people just barely clawed by living in fucking caves in France and there's cats and lions and oxen and all these crazy animals they're depicting on the walls these caves where they raised their families and hope they didn't get eaten I think that's what no I think that its simplicity it's like it is simply love like sustenance yeah and intimacy you know like community and community yeah everything like bonds like the worst thing you could do like I always said that's about prison what's the worst thing they can do they put you in solitary yeah isolate they take you away from rapists murderers and thieves yeah they put you by yourself you know like no general population I'll take my chances you'd rather take your chances you know what I loved about your Bernie sander sanders episode was he said that there's a epidemic in this country and it's a lack of community yes and i thought that was really profound he's right he is right it you know you don't really like half of us don't know our neighbors and so since I've been home for a while since my last tour which has been like crazy I've really enjoyed immersing myself in in my community and like getting to know where I like people where I get my coffee and it feels so good to walk in and have them be like hey Suze you watching you want your oatmeal oat milk want a latte and I'm like yes thank you it's a little thing but it's not you know you have recognition and people see each other and that that goes a long way it does man it really does it does like knowing your neighbors is a good feeling having a community is a good feeling that's one of the things that like we're talking about that it's an indication of health sure and or an indicator poor health too is when you don't have those connections they feel real lost yeah they don't have a sense of community and this that's one of the things that any sort of thing can provide them and that's why it's dangerous to get lumped up in groups because some groups are toxic can you just you you really want camaraderie that's like that's what gangs are all about right like people grow up and look real bad circumstances and together through a group they find loyalty and unity and they get compelled to act in the interests of that group even if it's like really dangerous illegal shit right and so they do it out of love they do it they do a negative thing out of a positive for a positive reason because they want love I think we all do that we all do that with our ideologies we do it with our religions we do with so many different things we do we do it because we want love and we're we're not we're failing to understand the mechanisms that are at work that are causing us to be a fundamentalist or a reactionary or a really a radical person on one side or the other that's like we really just want to be loved and but it's so simple yeah there's so many things coming to admit yeah I mean well I was telling you guys earlier about the LA AFC the the Los Angeles football club yeah I went to my second game yesterday it was their season opener and you know I'm a die-hard Cleveland sports fan I love where I'm from I love to try but love the Cavs I love the Browns but I kind of have a beef with NFL it's not gonna do it so high and mighty on Cleveland oh shit who's the UFC heavyweight champion of the world Stevie Miocic we're too steep a live motherfucking Cleveland but you said UFC what's that he's the greatest heavyweight of all time do you know that the UFC greatest most accomplished heavyweight of all time is lives and from Cleveland shut your mouth he claims Cleveland okay he's a great guy I am NOT as educated on the UFC and I will and I and I also you know in all transparency I know this is boxing but I did watch the wilder fight did not like it at all it made me very sad but yeah sure did between a poker game have you've seen a boxing match live or not no oh no I watched it on the television oh that's not live where are you from I want to get into the UFC a little bit more but I I get a little tripped up by it but what I wanted to say about you know I first of all I love you and I want to go to a match I just I just really yes no time cool okay next weekend I'm gonna be on tour okay but yeah Gary Gary Gary watch people fuck each other up god damn it yeah getting some FOMO hey in my face I just comes back full circle [Laughter] what I wanted to say was I know it's taking 10 minutes the LA FC team is has been constructed by some pretty great folks in LA like like Will Ferrell's a big impetus behind the team and Mia Hamm and and all these great folks that kind of tailored it to Los Angeles and my first game was you could I've never felt that kind of pride in Los Angeles like I've always sort of felt like a transplant here and I've been here for almost 20 years and it was incredible whoa the game itself is is mind-blowing like it's nonstop and that like the physical feat of and I grew up playing soccer so I love to watch it I love to play like it's great but the sense of community here and the enthusiasm and just the the way that they have built the stadium in downtown Los Angeles it was it was heavy did you you want a hand of heart I did I felt it I felt it so deeply you can make fun of me all you want look at that gorgeous Stadium were you a soccer fan excuse me football fan can we just come up with one fucking name we can't call it football okay why because we have American football we are listen this we're all in this together I'm just talking about names I look I don't even like football I think of they're real and they take those fucking helmets off I'm joking these are just jokes fucking music I think you should play football from fucking hamster wheels just giant hamster wheels slamming each other if you and we're gonna have shoulder passes pat up the fucking entire area around you while we playing games hundreds of yards you're in the center power in it they slam in each other what's eliminate CTE we just need bigger we need golf court size areas to play on we get some that's actually not even men that was the guys in the transitionary period they were transitioning that was right when in yeah see the original men were leather helmets yeah well here's the thing here's a little shout-out to our Native American friends one of the problems wasn't when they first started inventing football is the Native American teams would fuck the white teams sure we had these dudes were like you know college educated you know trying to learn how to play this new game and these Native American dudes would put the smash down on the fucking old school angry that the grandpa got scalped bison for a thousand generation put that real smart it wasn't like they were making millions of dollars which player you know they was this is a new thing though they had real jobs and then football yeah so this is the story it's like if you google how I'm sorry how American Indians saved the sport of football it's an amazing story and it's the really the origins of the beginning of football they barely had pads dead like these little shoulder fucking things that like dudes have now in sport coats to make themselves look like they you know they're more boxy crazy like that's the male equivalent of a push-up bra there's a dude with like padded shoulders and sport coat yeah whenever I buy like a vintage jacket I take the shoulder pads out because I feel like a douche bag [Music] I think there was an NPR like a radio lab podcast on people died playing football people playing wait was that in a year yeah 19 people died playing it timeline one year oh my god those people are different get it I have to pee too but we should probably play a song when Gary comes back and you know exhaust your fan base here's the thing they don't have to listen this whole reason this podcast became successful like Ari Shaffir who I love know and love he's great at once I love Ari to death I love him he's amazing but our gave me the worst advice ever and I talk about it often he's like you can't have your podcast four hours long why not I'm pretty sure the last honey-honey podcasts were about three and he fully admits it by the way but it's not knock on Ari no one knew what was going on back then I was just stubborn yeah yeah I was I think you've done a great job doing it your way I really and I salute that and I also like you know Joe you've had a big hand in my career and in what's gone on with honey honey and how you've supported us and like there's something very special about not just just doing your way not tailoring it to anyone else's agenda it's like it's pretty fucking cool what you're doing my friend but the crazy thing is that it happened a hundred percent organically you know there was no preconception there was no idea this was gonna happen just keep doing it and do what you like and then eventually it happens but like when you and I went to see Sturgill how fun was that so good how fun was that oh good but I enjoyed that so much eating because like we went to see what another one of our friends and there's like real cool intimate setting I don't know Sturgill you worked with him never met him I love it there was some communication we so we both worked with Dave Cobb on honey honey's last record was produced by Dave Cobb and he does all of sergel's records for the most things crazy I would have swore that you guys had met no I've never met him a huge fan loved him but I told you I got mad at him at that one point where he did like an 11-minute guitar so I was fucking sick and then he said hmm all right it's a little too much testosterone let's tone it down for the ladies and he played like a like a love song and I was like he was just looking for a good segue man first of all I fucking love him and I but I like rock and roll you know else I love that dude who's on the road with him right now Tyler yeah he's cool he's a both of his albums that I've listened to I don't know if there's more than two does he have more than two he's really good he's really authentic yeah yeah they're doing like stadiums aren't they they're like dude I'll see myself out Ben turn guys Sturgill told me he quit sugar he lost 20 pounds you sent me a taxes like motherfucker I lost 20 pounds I'm ready to do some fucking arenas whoa can I pee no I'm gonna pee now who has three and then we should probably take it we're going on a three-hour pod one well no it's fine there's no one we have no boss you're right you're right Suzanne good luck return we don't say nice things about you I love that dude to death one of my favorite people new introduction dude I love him yeah he's he's amazing I've had a bunch fun experiences with him but one of them was like I have a couple of buddies mind that at the time they were living in Idaho they came down to visit me and I said hey I go come on down these are just like they live in bumfuck Idaho right at the time shout-out to my friend Kenton Ken crew 'the first light as a hunting apparel company and my friend Ryan Callahan and they came with me to the Laugh Factory we just hanging out and I said hey my friend Sturgill Simpson's going to come by and they were like what and they're like and then we're all smoking weed and they're like holy shit we just smoked weed with Sturgill Simpson yeah sorry buddy gets in trouble surgeon but and then you know he goes he goes what the fuck just happened we just smoke we was dirt reserves not his last album but the one before I didn't know I was supposed to not tweet it but I was the one who broke his album I broke the cover I put I put it on my Instagram I said this out was the shit what he sent it to you a song everybody knew how far before they released it was pretty close it's pretty close he's he's a unique dude you know cuz like it's hard to define him like he's all over the place that's kind of what time it is thought I feel like I with you you know I agree with you people are complex yes and they should be we should be complex you know and then sometimes not like I love ac/dc yeah that's okay though it's like I don't I don't think there's a right way or wrong way I think it's great to have all sorts of different things you know a whole lot of rosie's that's a fucking song for for the ages and it's a real simple song about a giant lady well-put you know it's a real simple song about a real large lady and it's amazing a whole lot of Rosie's amazing whole lotta Rosie ac/dc man come on oh yeah come on sister and we need a an an equal word - come on son ooh - two girls you know I mean sister works we need I'm a big fan of the friendly-like come on oh you know just in the friendly way I like all girls hook when girls yell shit out I settled down hooker yeah but it's all it's not like in my day I feel like you're the only person the only person I mean that and I don't say that lately that I'm like I can laugh when you're like yeah bitch 2011 right we did that and the world show 2012 that was fun we did a did a show at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on December 21st 2012 that was the Terence Mckenna thing the end of the Mayan calendar he had a compute this how deep that motherfucker ran he got so high he came up with an algorithm based on the each hing that was mapping out time it wasn't the Mayan calendar it was it was both okay it was the Mayan cattle T was based on novelty it would coincided with this is what happened he came up with a thing called novelty theory and novelty Theory he based off - II Ching the II Ching which is it's a divination system a Chinese divination system and they would throw these hexagrams I believe it's hex crams and they would indicate a certain pattern and they would try to recognize this Pat was it hexagrams change anyway they would throw these they would throw these stones thank you so it's a Chinese method of divination that's more than a thousand years old and they were trying to conduct what McKenna believed this is what he believed in each Inge really was he believed it was a map of time and that they had through some way figured out through hexagrams to recognize a time was it was mimicked about you could capture it in in hexagrams in in in mathematics and geometry it's like a string theory kind of thing almost all right and that you could come up with some sort of a system to this thing and he called that system time wave zero and what he thought that system was he thought that was a system of recognizing novelty like new ideas creative things whether it's the internet or internal combustion engine or the Tesla electric car anything where it was where you could map that out and you could say okay if you looked at this as a mathematical algorithm and you saw how this was gonna play out you could almost predict patterns in this wave and where do you where do you predict this happening and that happening and where does it end where does it get to a point with so crazy no one knows what the fuck to do and in Terence his life he believed that time was December 21st 2012 and he as a matter of fact my barracuda out of 1970 barracuda my my license plate was December 2012 did you think it was twenty first I was like if I'm gonna die my favorite people on the planet legitimately through the countdown that's what I love there was no like ten nine you're like Happy New Year motherfuckers they just kept it was great yeah it was fun it was fun it was like my favorite people are my family and my friends there's been yeah and to be

you for bringing us on it was fun just me and Stanhope look I love Stanhope as much I'll cut my fucking pinky off first and home but I don't see him enough you know so whenever we gonna make an excuse to do this we're gonna do another I should tell this right now we're gonna do another end of the world podcast at the new presidential elections so when was it November 21st mm what is it like the

at being like oh I made a mistake I'm so sorry cuz you're a human and that's what we do and that's where I think there's this like real disconnect with the people that are quote unquote running this country you know there's there's no room for error it shouldn't be running it that's and they know it that's why they're holding onto that spot no one should be I think they would do a better job running it if they could exhibit human qualities and also be leaders at the same time I agree you know but I think they're scared I think everybody's scared and I think when you're in a position where here's rule and killer mind control over giant groups of people you you barely can keep your shit together like who are you are you an alien you have another fucking planet you know [Music] take me to your leader dude member close encounters oh they talked to be bull they're good we should play a song or not I don't know Suzanne we hit the perfect podcast right we're at critical mass we do whatever

no line why and I'm like how are you he's like I'm fine twelve fifty excuse me pardon me I haven't so far yeah 1250 I'm impressed I'm very impressed he's an alien and also inspired well you know like sheep can't eat like certain grass and will die to eat phalaris grab the fucking DMT killer I did not know that yeah you think you can take it it's a part of your brain but if a sheep gets all like they just died legs sticking up here twitching it turns out they a day DMT rich concentrated patch of grass kills of dead in their tracks like farmers in certain areas would find these sheep like legs no way yeah the last time I smoked DMT I was in the bathtub and I was you know prepared to have a moment and I got myself all situated and I like lit up and then I hear like and I'm like I get up and I put a robe on and I go to the front door and my old landlord Carlos was like me Suze Suze the ceiling is leaking and my bathtub was leaking oh and I was you didn't know no and I was very high it was a terrifying expected oh my god your DMT high so you pixelated and shit and PS though it was kind of old so I didn't get as like you didn't get a solid no but I got enough of a head to be fucked up with my landlord knocking on my door when I was a little high on DMT so anyway I haven't smoked it since I'd like to at some point but Duncan Trussell [Music] wouldn't I call Joe Rogan - I'm with you guys they should be they should be they're missing the point well this like the drug users versus fucking law enforcement you guys should be on drugs you want to do good law enforcement she all be on mushrooms that's we should have every cop on mushrooms like like you know that guys in prison right now that guys dad's a bank robber or that guy I think all cops see Andrew yang had a great idea is all cops should be purple belts in jiu-jitsu which I agree with I think it's a great idea so you should have some understanding of how to defend yourself if someone tries to grab you and get your gun I 100% agree with that but also why not be on mushrooms to their life and death in the streets teach people the right way we work together agree I'll be a part of love oh yeah it's I think it's possible yeah I think we just need to adjust the chemicals that we have just like you've done with exercise and some people done with medication or meditation and medication some people do with music it adjusts the chemicals and I think that's I think every way that we know of that's beneficial to adjust the chemicals whether it's through yoga or meditation or love or music or comedy or anything you can find that puts you in a better place we should embrace that and agree mushrooms are one of those things I agree it's not it's you shouldn't listen to a CD highway to hell all day long ac/dc highway to hell 24/7 is gonna be a bummer man I mean you might you might like the first two or three plays you know it's like Billy Squier lonely is the night you don't want to hear it every day mmm but every now and then when you're in a car you know how you have that bluetooth thing that happens when your car synced up to bluetooth yeah does your car do that bluetooth we're like randomly to play a song yeah it's always all no not alt-j we goes through the a and yeah a lot of Titans I told Tommy Segura that what there was one of his bits would come up like one of the first things they say well it's any but sometimes it's a random thing to it sometimes it doesn't do it alphabetically it just doesn't randomly and like you'll get like a cool song out of nowhere just plays when you start your car like oh that's a trunk it's a little weird truck yeah yeah what you guys do is a little weird drug likewise so are we drug dealers is that what you're saying good way we're like the proverbial do whenever you could use we should be wearing robes Willy be from the ghetto boys had a Willie D from the ghetto boys had this you leavin no you gotta do what you gotta do Willie D from the ghetto boys had this video that he put up of James Brown like right after James Brown had gotten arrested for some some craziness but he was like on the air apparently high as a kite [Laughter] that's freedom he's got these crazy glasses well we play yeah it's a famous clip James Brown strangest interview ever that's a real can I speak to the manager haircut it's amazing his glasses he's like yep got it perfect that's what I'm trying to say bitch I'm not even in your dimension you know that my favorite James Brown video of all time is live in Zaire live in Zaire before Muhammad Ali and George Foreman fought yes yes and James Brown comes out and performs live right before Muhammad Ali fuck's up George Foreman BB King's on that and you got a real what is this 74 or something is that what it said 74 you got a this is the world's a different place James Brown live in Zaire just crushing it just crushing it and again what the fuck was out there like James Brown before James Brown answered nothing no not a fucking thing not a thing a human original just superb us mean JB James Brown thank you Jersey I'm sorry Christ you're white meanest thing you've ever said to me Joe I knew once I said oh my god a dude like him I mean he's so goddamn talented he could wear whatever he wanted yeah he could wear some bullfighting cape right James Brown oh my god far easier than a male a male pull in our office you know what though everything has already been done for the most part oh I I do I think like like sexuality and individuality in a lot of ways have been exacerbated and now the weird I sound cynical I think the thing now is being authentic that's what's a rarity I agree with you if that's what you are but if you're some hyper sexual James Brown motherfucker from another dimension this is for zero before grtt no no vitamins to speak of stem cells yes dude a lot of home cooking and a lot of love that is fueled by love I was like maybe four people on earth as famous as he was in 1974 there he is man that's a that's a weird moment in time you know it's special I was watching a video of Elvis Presley singing suspicious minds and I was like that poor bastard never had a chance never had a chance what do you mean this is what I mean there was no famous before Elvis it never happened it wasn't real and then all sudden this young guy out of nowhere and all the signs are there like his marriage his wife when she's 14 why is he doing that because he wants to reclaim his innocence like people call him a pedophile like maybe but there would be probably a bunch of instances of that I think it was more likely this is a guy swing key like sliding away from reality with pills and he and stardom that's a good question how old is he what about that in this it was funny about that was we would expect there would be a year where he should be able to keep it together cuz like I don't think he died that all pretty young there how old was Elvis when he died he's like 45 not that old how old was he young Jamie drum roll please yes sir four and 35 done in 77 642 yeah 42 that ain't shit shit no it's not and it was he was a new thing there was a new thing the new thing was this fucking insane supernatural sex appeal star with tassels on his pants doing fake karate crazies taking pills he was kind of a sacrificial lamb though in a lot of ways did you imagine like and then there was Michael Jackson Michael Jackson hold my beer you want to see crazy how about I do what you do when I'm six the weight of the world on your back of like icon that you are and the barriers that you've broken and then the you know the effect you've had on people and how much they rely upon you I can't fucking imagine I can't imagine either Jamie some of his karate was fake he was actually trained by Edie Parker who was a noted Kempo karate master and back in the day like in its pants rip when first of all how did what do you mean it's a great moment in history yeah but I know he was really kind of squatting there and some crazy farm in Brazil horses that's not lenny Kravitz's there's a whole video online when you see him and as a state in Brazil Jesus he's amazing he's so fucking talented well are you gonna go my way maybe - he's so talented he's so talented there's a film where he produces Mick Jagger's record Wow record from Mick Jagger wow it's incredible are you super you can tell just when Jamie because that's an amazing video because you can tell like what kind of a person he is by following him around this house where he talks about like what these things in his house mean to him like what like little pieces of art things that someone left him think people you know the things that have like real significant meaning to means talking about why and what they are Architectural Digest okay yeah people try to be weird I'm gonna get a fucking ranch in Arizona I see your ranch in Arizona I raised a ranch in Brazil what is this one when you talk about levels this how is this dude let's let's guess let's be conserving and say 73 yeah might be 76 right yeah here we go drumroll please come on Aubrey de Grey podcast I do have a like I feel like these people are joyful you know I think that that's the anti-aging contingency is as propagating joy I think you're right and I think with Mick Jagger one of the big things is that makjang is like really really into fitness oh yeah he works out twice a day he does varga he does yeah he's like oh I see what's like you got to keep this fucking boat on the river you got to keep this boat on the river and he gets after it he does it's legendary he does dancing dancing is everything is a lot his heart so if you want to see Mick Jagger that's some dancing in the streets right there he's gonna stand still no this guy's fuckin hustlin realizes what he's doing do you guys dance do you dance I do this is my my thing is what I'm in my studio I work all by myself and I just dance crazy fuck yeah Gary yeah absolutely I'm busted out someday Gary awesome yeah why not man you desert to your own sounds I love making my own I don't dance enough I dance at home alone often but I should get out and like exercise too sure it's not just a physical exercise it's like a spiritual exercise in that URI you're enjoying yourself though that word spiritual so poisoned by crystals and fucking freedom it's true it's true yeah why should why should joy have boundaries it shouldn't we're all scared no not this I had this conversation this friend of mine about Bernie Sanders we were talking about socialism and you know I'm like he's like don't never thought you'd be into socialism like I'm not a socialism but but what what about fixing the things that are broken doesn't seem appealing to you and we have socialism for a lot of different things like the fire department in the police department but I'm like but that's not what I'm into this is what I'm really into I'm really into like people having a big stake in community and I think when you look out for other people that's when you have the biggest stake in community and I think that's one of the things we're missing today we're missing we can we can do it in our neighborhoods like we were talking about like you know your neighbors it's really nice but I think we could do it in an expansive way as long as we didn't give in to the the temptation to be shitty to people that we don't know and treat everybody as if we're all a part of a community I think that can be done and I think the best way to sort of enhance that kind of thinking is to make decisions that are for the downtrodden make decisions that are for the working class and the people that are struggling and the people that are just trying to put food in the table and keep a home he did that's that's concentrate on that first before anything because those are the hardest hardships yeah and there's too many people that have this idea that everyone that's in that experience is there because they're lazy or because they don't work hard or because they don't really think that they just make excuses there's a lot of people to do things like that but it is because it is it is a thorough ignorant but it's it's also that they don't know they have an experience with those people who experience and if they this is the thing about every person alive you look at a person look at a person who's doing great look at a person who's falling apart you would be that person if you did what they did there's not much difference unless you're talking about physical things like the difference between Usain Bolt's running speed and the difference between mine physical things this is our unsurmountable I'm fucking positive there's certain things you can't get past but there's a lot of things you can yeah you know and and one of the problems that we all have is our perception believe look at things if we could look at things as more like we're all cool we're all together like nobody wants you to do bad like let's all do good we can all do good together we can we can all go forward or that mindset some people that want you to do bad and those people also deserve attention exactly which for they're just so scared to be treating in the wrong way yeah treating them like we need to kill them and it's like it's like the hurt people hurt people thing you know you just you got to see those people and say hey I see you and I'm gonna hug you and I'm like let's all fucking move together yes the problem is some of them are really legitimately broken yeah like some people have done a terrible job of raising their kids to the point where they've broken the kids and those kids need to find some way back to the garden it's hard and that's the reality of scale the the fact there's 350 million people just in America mean is that the real number is that North America because that's fucking crazy for us to try to put that into perspective is almost impossible I don't think we even understand what that number means and that we're all supposed to be a team but I think it's possible I think we just have to look at it the right way like you have to have no room for douchebaggery no room possible but it's not impossible I don't think it is I think people just need a higher level of gardens and of understanding of the consequences of not behaving that way and the benefits of behaving that way the promise we look at it like it's a negative like somehow it's a weakness if you're if you show if you show any sort of sympathy or compassion or or under stri to have some understanding for people who are downtrodden or poor people look at you like you're weak like no you're you're looking at the wrong way you're looking at you feel uncomfortable about it because it makes you feel weird because there's too many variables and it'd be better if you just nail it down to a 1 or 0 either lazy or they're good hard-working people if they're good hard-working people to figure it out if they're lazy they don't it's not yeah it's there's so much more just too many of us there's too many variables the idea that like no one should get help that's so crazy I was on welfare when I was a kid it's it's important it's important for people it keeps them fed it gives people a chance like that doesn't mean that people are gonna come steal your money that means we should all chip in a little bit but we have to figure out how to make sure the government has our confidence we feel like we can throw them our money and they're gonna do the right thing with it and we're gonna help communities we're gonna help people and that's what everybody's worried about for a good reason it's cuz who the fuck knows who's taking your money they don't give you an accountant cheat they don't show you what they're spending on you just give it up that's what I meant earlier when I was like I don't know what's true I don't know it's hard but at the same time I think what you're saying is so powerful because like you can have your sort of government affiliations and like oh these are the people that are quote unquote taking care of us and then you can also take care of yourself and each other and recognize your neighbors and recognize your community and and kind of build from the ground up know who your your local representatives are you know for fuck's sake like your kids in their schools and like all that stuff like that is a very powerful tool well in and even I mean those are official titles and official designations and all that stuff is awesome too but it's also just know who the fuck is around you right like in and be nice to each other and figure it out together well we're all acting like everybody is not help you and everybody's not gonna understand you and then when that gets fed to a scale of this impossible number of 350 billion people 350 million people doesn't even make sense to us it's so hard for us to ever understand what it's like to try to like do what's best for 350 million people it doesn't make sense so you just do what's best for yourself and you go it's gonna work itself out it's gonna sort itself out if there's ever conspicious action involved in that exactly and if there's ever a conspiracy to keep people still but that's the conspiracy yeah make that seem like it's normal make that you really can't affect things and you really should pay attention to this and we should all figure out a way to do it together where the the whole motivation is to make life better for everybody when you're really really really really rich let's say you're really really really really really rich what if you're just really really really really you are contributing in a dynamic way to a system that helped you get really really really really rich see the balancing act is not wanting to get to a place where you stifle people's need to do well because they they have they need to have some sort of motivation some people do you want them to have motivation but you want them to feel good about contributing to that's that's what's up it's not this idea that they're gonna come steal your money it's like no we're you're gonna help you're gonna help we're not stealing any money you're gonna help people that can't help themselves there's people you might have got lucky you might have got a good parents and a good situation good neighborhood good school he did well some people don't so you'll get fucked when they're really young they get robbed they get beaten up they get tortured they get scared that's normal in life too and you can help them and this is what I think when you get lost in words like socialism and libertarianism and all these different fucking labels that carry all this weight behind them if we just say like what's your intentions is your intentions to make the community a better place for everybody and make people happy and make people have food and make sure people are loved and make sure people are in a war that's what we should do as a community yeah that's what we should do all that of this stuff is bullshit because if you don't have that you don't have anything and you're gonna feel you're gonna feel really uncomfortable yeah that's the thing and these fucking labels whether it's liberal Republican you fucking cook you know you goddamn hippie all these different labels of people it's so easy to dismiss people with these labels and they have such an agenda right and it it plays on that part of the human psyche that wants to be a part of a team and attack opposing ideas it becomes a fucking tribal thing it's so hard to sort out what's right and what's wrong you know but I think we're in a weird space where there's no one at the wheel I think this is the first time there's no the government doesn't have a hold of wheels there's a mystery yeah but no one's at the helm no one's got a hold of that goddamn battleship you know the pirate ships they have those handles on the wheel and you know strap yourself in and shit no one's at that wheel you know where I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a limb here you said this earlier and we laughed about it but like the thing is you know you said the word love and like music and art and you know things that are cohesive in communal environments and helping people come together like in terms of like feeling like like what what can I contribute like fuck how can I help because this feels like an epidemic this this disbandment you know amongst us and all this fear everybody's so scared I'm scared you know I am scared I go in and out of it I don't know my fear is fleeting you know it's things that are that feel a little superficial at times but at the end of the day like this love thing that the energy that you know you you could make fun of me I don't give a fuck you know like the fact is like we all need it you know we all want it and we all deserve it so what what are you gonna do with that you know like we can sit here and dissect politics and agendas and this guy and this guy and socialism Allah stuff but we all need to feel that thing and it is love yeah and it's very very very powerful and it comes in many forms in and has you know different hats and I think that right now like like I'm sure that you feel it at a show right when you play music for people you know I'm sure you feel it all the time you know with your podcast and with your shows and with the outreach that you have and you know and forgive me I don't want to assume you know and I feel it in all the varying degrees of the shows that I play in things and like at the end of the day this stuff it like where we're at is a scary place but there's like this thing there's just like kind of one thing and it's it is the love thing and that has like a bunch of different adjectives around it and verbs that are like recognizing each other and seeing each other and saying hey we're different but we're the same and we're okay like let's keep moving you know the thing that saves me from all this like deep depths of fear is that like period there's really nothing else I have to say like because it's a weird world that we're living in but that's the thing that's it it is a weird world and people can tip left or right or that's bad and now people get tip good or bad one way or another depending upon how you approach them sure and this is the thing that a lot of us get wrong you run into someone they're a dick you're a dick back it turns into a fight you're like oh that guy was a fucking dick yes but sometimes when someone's a dick and you're not a dick they stop being a dick we literally talked about this at the beginning the podcast right that's right we're like will you do defuse a situation where energy gets heated and somebody's angry or you know I don't know if I should retell the story but like you know you it's accountability to like you know when you master presumptions right right conversations with presumptions of how this guy feels about you like could this fucking guy thinks I'm an idiot I know like a winner Society it's like you have to be right but you know what it's a it's fucking okay to be wrong I fucking made a mistake I'm so sorry it's not just okay to be wrong it's a gift when you're wrong to give because that humility that comes with being wrong is what really helps your education as a person yes agree as a fucking girlfriend a boyfriend a lover a father a son you learned when you fuck up you learn you learn like goddamn I was wrong yeah that's a valuable lesson because it's a humiliating lesson when you set yourself free to because there's a there's some when you're hanging on to righteousness like this like you know an ability to say that you were wrong yeah that is a fucking burden it's not just a burden it's it's a foolish pursuit like you should relish every opportunity to apologize and say you're wrong as a showing of strength yes if you think you're strong you you think you're strong and you know you're wrong and you don't tell the truth well then you're a fool you're you're missing out on an opportunity for you to be strong for you to show that you're strong this show that you made a mistake I've made a lot of mistakes I make them all the time I'm a fucking dummy all right I do my best but ultimately the other day there's a lot of dummy in me and I do my best but if I make a mistake I will fucking own the shit out of that mistake if you talk to me about it and you want to have a good discussion about it I'm not one of those people that I don't think there's any value in pretending you didn't make a mistake I think there's a real societal misconception it's they don't know the people that did it didn't understand the rules that were written were written by people who really hadn't had a good grasp of the territory yet they didn't really understand what they're saying they should have taught people that in school they should have taught people like that in junior high school high school for sure it's just said you're your failures those feelings that you feel like they teach you about history and math and those things are great there's nothing wrong with that but they should have taught us about how your failures are a very value bull fuel you have that feeling that you get when a girl dumps you with a feeling that when you crash your car or that feeling that you get when you fucking ruin something you say something wrong when something comes out of your mouth when you anything you do wrong you flunk out of a class whatever the fuck it is that negative feeling is a boost it's supposed to take you into the next orbit it's supposed to blast you into the next level of understanding what you were doing wrong and how to improve in your life and how to go forward with better habits and if you don't experience that pain that feeling that embarrassment then you don't really know how valuable it is to stay on your grind mmm and people say it all the time and it resonates are people gonna stay on your grind like yes yes but why do you think that it's not okay to be human like why do you think societally speaking we can't just be like accountable and strong at the same time we're just nervous it's not that we but like I mean like systemically like that is since the beginning is that like them like monkey brain in us that's like you have to be alpha all that shit like I thought about this forever fucking boggles my mind just because we're worried about people that are not pulling their weight when people are starving to death it's an ancient ancient instinct when they look if we barely had enough food to keep our babies alive and our friends alive and our parents alive barely had enough food and we saw someone slacking holy shit did you want to fucking kill them if you saw them someone that was sneaking food that was taking too much food or you saw someone that wasn't putting in their work and you were just slightly shy of being comfortable and you knew this fucking lazy motherfucker they just did their work we would all be fine but they don't do what we do they they claim their foot hurt or they claim their back hurts and they go back to their cave and everybody wants to kill him that's what the fuck that's for it's a resource balanced relationships like the sort of aggression against like welfare people that need it and people that don't know that exact you know exploit it I get it exactly exactly if they will what's called it's attaching ultimatums or Ultimates rather like this is the ultimate truth to any sort of circumstance and general sense to pretend that you have a million fucking yeah let's pretend you have a city of X amount of people you have a million people that are on some sort of assistance whether it's food stamps or welfare or whatever to pretend they're all one thing is crazy to pretend it's all one story is crazy one set of circumstances one says that's nuts that's nuts the the the question should be like look there's no billionaires or sign up for food stamps right there's no millionaires that are trying to get welfare money right so it's only when you're desperate so the question is like how do we engineer society so the even the most desperate people never hit that spot never hit a spot with a need assistance the most desperate people are always taken care of well they don't have to worry about it and then what motivation is is just following your dreams doing what you enjoy doing whether it's a thing like playing music or writing books or whatever it is whatever it is finding that thing but that that motivation for doing that thing should be above all above the idea that you have to survive by doing some shitty job to make a living to pay for your bills and just robbed you of your your your time and your resources it should be like hey fuckface recognize this you don't have a lot of resource okay alright let's just pretend you don't you don't need a job we're gonna give you the money you don't need a job but understand this motherfucker you give it a gift you give it a gift that Beethoven never had Hendrix never had nobody had it you got you got money enough to live now go but understand you got if you're lucky you live 80 years everything over there is like tomorrow well every time you sneeze you're wearing you gonna die yeah we just have to look at the way we distribute money as being like we think about it right now as being this is the way we've always done it this way we're gonna do it but money didn't even exist really recent it doesn't mean we're doing it right we shouldn't have tents filled with homeless people that's fucking gross we should have people shitting in the street in San Francisco that's fucking gross if you guys have to pay more money to make sure there's health care for a bunch of homeless people with mental illness that are shitting all over your street you should definitely spend that money because you're not gonna fix it but a bunch of dudes that squeegees and fucking power hoses out there where's that shit going you know what they do is they they give those people a little bit of money and I'm bus ticket to like Salt Lake City or something or Austin Texas or awesome they do that yeah and then they drop them off and they say you got a motel for 30 days and then get them the fuck out and then make them somebody else oh fuck yeah and they make it somebody else's problem we tried to trace that right it's gross there's been all over the country they ship them to different place yeah they had a huge thing in Orange County there was like like almost like a mile-long tent city and they got them out I don't know where they sent them you know what that's like it's like the human equivalent of throwing a cigarette out the window on the highway someone's gonna figure it out it's terrible it's Tara what are we gonna do guys what the fuck are we gonna do Suzanne I think you figured out a lot of things you selling yourself short yeah amazing revelations during this show and they've all been documented shit yeah um but I think the more I mean it's gonna sound ridiculous but I think the more conversations people have like this we try to figure out what's going on yeah try to concentrate on what what do we need to do like that 300 percent I think that's real wake up and walk out of the house yeah I'm understanding your what's your intention I think it goes back to yeah that but I think what you were talking about with you know coming up levels and and different upbringings and this and that it's it's a factor and so it's not that easy yeah well learn about people that are different from you you know I think that a lot of folks ignorant is something to recover from you know you if you don't know if you haven't if you're you know religious type and you have an opinion about gay people but you've never met a gay person in your life and what it's like to be gay and why you know it's like you think it's a choice or whatever you think you know until you have it you can't really have an opinion until you actually sit across somebody and look them in the eye and talk to them you know I think that's that's where a lot of this you know discord comes in in terms of we're all different and we are but we're not you know I don't know how we I don't want to go there but we're there we're different about is the things that are superficial yes thank you yeah well we're not different about is what we are we're human beings whether we have weird accents or styles or hobbies or musical colors all that step whatever we're interested in whatever the weather is the way we like to dress or the style that we'd like to eat or the places we like to live or all those things are interesting mm-hmm but what we really are that that core whatever the fuck you are at the center that's a human being yes that that's what's real that's what's real and when you love people and they love you and you love each other back you all recognize that that thing that human being thing is the same it's the same it's the same in your children it's a man your mother it's the same in your neighbor it's the same in everybody yeah it's the same it's it's love it's like us and we don't you know the only time that people lash out is when someone lashed out against them and it all gets terrible and cockeyed and twisted but well we we are is the same we're all the same going through this weird strange existence it's almost like some crazy game that's being played out simulation no one knows but what but even if it's not a simulation in this this one people need to understand even if it's not it still is even if it's not even if this is real it's still a simulation you you were fucking nothing 14 billion years ago you are a part of a head of a pin and you exploded and the only reason your fucking human body even exists
