here we go 5 4 3 2 1 first of all how many people get your name wrong when they try to pronounce it well so many people I don't even care anymore however it comes out because I live in it's a funny name where I come from right from England who grown up with a funny name but in Mexico is even stranger name so I just normally make it in and my second name gorilla which in Spanish is Glee yo right so everyone I messed that up too if they see it spelled yeah this microphone about a fist from your face right yeah there we go um Yohan I don't think I've ever heard that name before there's an actor called young Gruffudd was the end he's in Fantastic Four oh really he's the stretchy guy oh no sure in Fantastic Four so yeah he kind of he's made that name a little bit more a little bit more so how did you wind up live in Mexico City so I I came to Mexico or went to Mexico in the year 2000 and I kind of messed around for a few years in the UK wanted the game to journalism so I found one way to get into it was to start working in a foreign country rather than going to my local newspaper and work and go to a foreign country and start working and I had a romantic idea about Latin America thinking I'd be like I saw the movie Salvador ah you know all of us Stones movie for me yes I kind of had I had a romantic idea about running around with guerrillas fighting military dictatorships so I arrived in Mexico in 2000 and got a job at an english-language newspaper how old we 27 when I first left the UK yeah 28 when I messed around for a bit in Mexico as well I didn't got a job when I was 28 Mexico City's a wild place yeah yeah so packed it's it's hard to but I've only been there twice for UFC events yeah but every time I'm there I'm just shaking my head like I can't believe how this traffic works it's crazy yeah 18 years nothing a lot of time in that traffic nobody cares about red lights green lights they don't care it's stressful everyone cut wants to cut you up all the time yeah people shouting you a lot you have to get used to people calling you like been deckle Sarah go to I different tactics now just try and relax and not get angry did you know how to speak Spanish before you went there yeah yes I spent one year in Spain living in Spain before I went now it's been a year in the Middle East as well and but yeah I started off when I arrived I spoke more to Spanish Spanish which is like all yet deal gone your deal and then unchanged more to like the Mexican Spanish which is like or a way kept us away right yeah so when did you start getting into narco journalism so like I arrived to say with a romantic idea about what I might cover in in Mexico or Latin America and right away I realized all that idea of gorillas and military dictatorships that gone that was the last century mmm che Guevara all that stuff had gone but right away when I arrived my very first thought first like back in the UK I grew up around a lot of drugs in the UK so going back to the 80s I grabbed a lot of people taking drugs I had a few friends who died from heroin overdoses back then for people I knew died of herring overdoses I had a sister who went who became schizophrenic smoking a lot a lot of why not she which became schizophrenic and there'd be a lot of drugs being smoked around that time as well was it part yeah back then it was Moroccan hashish there's that there is a connection you know and we've been exploring that a lot lately yeah we went into this marijuana debate between Alex Berenstein and dr. Mike Hart from Canada and we talked about it and I know people that have had that happen to them where they've had schizophrenic or psychotic breaks because of just massive doses of marijuana and especially people that don't do it or people that do it too much for too long it does happen I heard that debate that's one of the reasons why it came to mind I mean I don't know a lot of people smoke weeds yeah well it's fine now when when my sister had a breakdown when she was 18 and I was 16 at the time and when that came out it turned out also my my grandmother had an issue with schizophrenia right and I think I don't it was a time bomb waiting to go on yeah or if it was how much the the the hash was involved in that there's other issues as well so I don't really know the science of it but anyway going back so so I've been around a lot of drugs before so when I arrived in Mexico actually one of the first first arriving in Mexico ended up hanging around with some some people and they were smoking a lot of crack in Mexico it's one of some of the first people I met Wow I was I went down to the beach like backpacking down to the beach and these people were smoking smoking crack and I was like it's kind of strange I didn't know these people smoking crack down here so when I got a job at the local newspaper in English and I just started looking at the crime thing one of the first doors I did was on the issue of crack being sold locally and how that linked to cartels and then very soon just fell in right away like I said all these things happened by accident I just fell into covering the crime beat misses going back to 2001 so 2001 that's the same year that chapo guzman escaped from prison then I was calling a lot then - a great journalist from Quanah head who's Glenn Cornelis you know a real legend from Tijuana who survived the shooting bye-bye cartels and you know phoning him up all the time just getting him give me information can be tips and that was however least I wonder our big story I did it back of those days was the court-martial of some generals for drug trafficking and that was really where it began back then generals for drug trafficking how much of an issue is that I mean corruption must be unbelievably rampant so I mean corruption even isn't a strong enough word for it sometimes I call it state capture I mean silly this is a real beginning and this has been a whole crazy 18 years of covering this stuff means this is a very beginning battery and I've seen a whole lot of for a crazy stuff in that time but like just to get a sense of how bad the corruption is or what it really means on the ground level there like there's policemen like you interview policemen you get to know the policemen in a certain town certain city and it's hard to know you know how all military guys or politicians and you want to believe these are good people you want to believe there's good policemen out there who really want to stop crime so there's one policeman his nickname was theis a Dyson like Mike Tyson his nickname was Tyson he was a well-built bloke well-built guy and he was friendly with the press forgot from michoac√°n friendly with the press and then it came out that he was actually a drug cartel member ranking member in a drug cartel and he actually confessed they they used to have a thing were the police the federal prison when they got him got him to confess on camera and he confessed not only was he turning a blind eye not only was he carrying out murders he was training the young kids how did the capitate people how to cut people up and he was explaining in graphic detail how he like you know how they managed to cut limbs off how he gets young people trained them to cut limbs off to get them to lose their fear so that's the level of corruption that could be a policeman you're dealing with and that's really who they are so that's one of the crazy things about a corruption down there did you have any hesitancy in getting involved in narco journalism knowing this I mean I would imagine that's one of the most dangerous avenues to pursue in journalism so this was little by little involved in covering this so like going back to 2000 this hadn't happened this war hadn't happened it was still like a crime issue at that moment so I began to cover these things and then around 2004 I got a job for the Houston Chronicle out of Houston Texas I was covering I was a string of covering Mexico for them and I flew up to a lot to Nuevo Laredo and there was a turf war beginning there which is really the beginning of the drug war which is torn Mexico apart began on the border with Texas in this city called neue red all over the bridge from Laredo Texas back in 2004 so there was a lot of interest from the Texas newspapers what was going on there's a whole bunch of bodies piling up there but again this go back these days and this is kind of innocent looking back innocent looking at myself then an innocent looking at what Mexico is like then they would simply say go to the place I'll draw up the Montero I rent a car and just drive the car - no Blair either with bus by myself and now he would just don't do that it's just too much crazy stuff come on but back then it was still like oh you can just do that so there was when you say crazy stuff like what kind of crazy stuff I mean now you can get stopped by an armed group driving on those roads he could you could just drive along and it could be a group of guys with guns could stop the car get someone out takes take you away I mean there's a whole people a lot more careful about you know way now now when I'm when you move around the roads you could be very careful how you move and how you plan this stuff you didn't wonder by yourself drive around these places so so back then when this was happening and there was a these bodies turning up and I'm trying to figure out why and I there was one guy interviewed who was a head of chamber of commerce and I talked to him you know very interesting guy about a couple of weeks later he became the Chief of Police for the city and they asked him I said are you scared you know you scared about being killed it's a normal scared it's only the corrupt people who get killed and he was shot dead six hours after he gave that statement they shot him dead and that was one of the real markers of something really strange is going on in Mexico something is like gonna erupt in Mexico and then from there it kind of just escalated and escalated and started work by the other media Time magazine New York Times different people in off the water said I can't do this I can't just write new stories about it's gotta write books about this okay this stuff is big and it's complicated it must be immensely complicated for the people that live there it seems like there's no escape I mean if you can't turn to the police the police are the cartel there's the cartel the police all the politicians most likely if they're alive have to be compromised yeah I mean there's been some very very desperate people and I mean there's been some very there's been some inspirational people as well fighting this there's been heroes there are heroes just to get more of a sense of what that means on the ground as well you know and some of the things you see you know some of the things that stay with me enough for a while it was quite romantic covering this it was like wow I'm covering I'm going to these places where chapo guzman is from no I got the villager me his mother me his family I'm wrong about these these crazy people but then you start seeing that the human pain in all of this one of many stories that the stick with me was a mother in Monterrey a schoolteacher you know when you have armed guys moving around they're also like really affecting the civil population attacking the civil population and one mother she was in our home with her two children in Monterrey and a it was like in the night just chilling in their house and then the door broke down and about 15 guys in bulletproof jackets all came in long arms just taking stuff from the house held the family we're not pinned him down and they said to the mother which of your children is the oldest and she was like didn't her reply I mean which of your children the oldest how do i how do I reply to that she just couldn't speak and the eldest side you had two sons 118 115 the 18 year old was a philosophy student and he said I am on the oldest said okay you're coming with us and took him away the next day she got a phone call saying I could we've got your son give us this amount of money we'll give him back so she went round to our relatives just got the money she wants give the money right away she turned up with the money gave some money and then they just cut off the causes she hadn't heard from him since and I have been seeing her face the devastation and the paints that I just couldn't can go on my life after that and just not knowing not having a closure and I met her when I went to report on one of the worst atrocities which was 49 bodies had all been decapitated all had their hands and feet cut off and all been dumped on a road and they were taken to the morgue in Monterrey and I arrived at the morgue us I was inside the morgue just smelling the smell of the dead bodies it's kind of weird snow you get from like decaying flesh kind of course smell you get from when you're around those places but you can smell that the bodies decay and I was inside the morgue and I came out he was outside the morgue and she was trying to see if if her son might be among those people among those bodies but you know it's it's so insane that this is right next door to America and there's so little effort put on doing something about it including doing something to mitigate the influence of illegal drugs by making drugs legal and that would be one gigantic step you you're not going to stop people from doing drugs I mean this is an illogical ridiculous approach I don't think people should do most of those drugs but when you make drugs illegal only criminals are gonna sell those drugs and this is exactly what you have right next door to America it's just unbelievably insane that there's this amount of crime a drive away from San Antonio yeah and talking about that issue of the money and the economics of this yes so I mean you look at cocaine so you could tell you what the there was four main drugs now it's you've got fentanyl coming in as well in the drug and the cartels and making fentanyl stir making making it yeah and made in the making of bringing in precursors making it there's a lab one lab I was in Nogales about a year and a half ago if they bust the lab in Nogales right on the border they'll make them have a lab they're making the Fenton even bringing up here but as well as that you've got other four main drugs historically marijuana heroin cocaine and crystal meth and this goes back 100 years like so Sinaloa which is the cradle of Mexican drug trafficking Sinaloa's be like Sicily is to the Mafia lifes in the lowest in the Mexican drug cartels where it began and he began right so you go back to 1914 you had in the US the Harrisons narcotics tax act when they made they restricted opium and cocaine in the United States and from 1915 they began a cross-border trade from Mexico to the United States so that's when it started all the way back then so every one hundred years ago some of the very people doing it we're actually Chinese Mexicans they were Chinese immigrants who arrived from Mexico they began doing this they bought opium from from China planted in in Mexico and some of the first people receiving it with Chinese Americans some of this very early cases a case from 1916 investigate their documents about this case where there was Chinese Mexicans trafficking two Chinese Americans here in California and at that time there was a governor of Baja California involved right back then what is the solution is there any solutions to this well I mean it I get you know I think a lot of people covering this you get very weary you want to see solutions yeah you want to find solutions and you want to come with that optimism of finding solutions and you want to justify why you're doing this what you're doing is for you to tell the stories but to look for solutions to this and it gets worried about that there's three areas I believe that are solutions first I do agree with you on the idea of drug policy reform again it is tough uphill battle I mean are going back to 2012 I wrote editorials about you know one of the reasons you should legalize marijuana is because of the marijuana come from Mexico which goes to cartels which pays for killers which pays for corruption but at the same time marijuana a lot of you know love is legalized in the United States and the violence that she just got worse in Mexico so you've also got the issue of heroin cocaine crystal meth fentanyl and you've got the cartels go into a bunch of other rackets now they still crude oil which is a big deal they still billions of dollars worth of crude oil criminals down there from pipelines he doesn't tap into a pipeline or something yeah you kind of pipeline yeah you know they put in two taps you drill two holes in the pipeline you drill a hole to put to take the oil out you drill a hole to put water in to try and keep it equal the pressure the same never you saw it's a crazy video recently in a small town in Mexico where a bunch of there was a tap open a really a really bad tap the oil just sprang out and a bunch of people were lining up just to pick up the oil from the pipeline and exploded and just it was just like crazy death toll you know I did see that from from from nada but a bad way that I do believe in in drug policy reform we have to talk about this has to be on a table I mean Americans you know no one knows really what Americans spend on drugs but as this survey we you can find online if you just you know tap and what do Americans spend on illegal drugs and it there's an estimate of a hundred billion dollars a year so you know that amount of money I mean that's an estimate I mean it could be right you know hard to know it's a very round number but like 100 billion dollars a year now if you think about that pumping into these cartels year after year I mean decades you know how much of that you know if it's thirty billion of that going down in Mexico and over ten years three hundred billion over 30 years close to a trillion dollars that really creates this dis monster burn our second area so I'm not believe in drug policy reform I mean I don't know how I mean rehab everyone who needs it because heroin addicts buy a lot of heroin so everyone you save from that you can you know you can stop a lot of heroin and a lot of that money which does money goes to these people who are doing this stuff but a second error I believe is is social work in the neighborhoods like I've talked a lot of interviews with particularly with the assassins with the killers in cartels in Mexico and also around Latin America I've been traveling around Jamaica Brazil Central America Colombia talking to a lot of the killer's especially and when I sit down with the my truncate their life story now how did they first get into this because you're not born doing this stuff and often I mean in some cases that is the different profiles some of them you know this one one guy this is dad in Honduras which is also crazy situation there's a guy there I actually met him before I'd met him when I was doing some reporting down there back in 2015 and he was driving for us and he was also carrying a gun to help protect us with the journalists who had a her dad who'd been hit before I've been actually shot before and then I met him again after his income to tell his story which is kind of typical of love these guys and he described how he been abandoned as a kid by his parents and had this real hate that he had with the world like and I just fucked the world and he described the first time that he carried out a murders and it this is just I mean he carried out they already talked he documented all these hits he'd done and decapitations he'd done and this kind of crazy stuff but the first time he had a murder was probably that the freakiest when he was then 14 and they got a family they went into a house couldn't work they got family and they butchered a family and he described when he described that and then described later on you know how he became a hired killer and the thing about him like some of these people we think they're Psychopaths they just they really don't care but some of them really do have these conflicts inside their heart I think he was someone or list about that interview and he had and it's hard to balance that someone who does evil but also has been a victim as well a victim and victimizer and he feel that pain since since then he's himself been being murdered but yeah he was you know one so how you get social work to reach people from a very young age because often they recruited into organized crime when at twelve thirteen years old so he butchered his family when his fourteen was he stealing money from them Rosie so the story would that was he said that he was hanging around with these basically street kids and one of the other kids said I know where there's some money in the house we can get some money in a house so they went in there and killed his family and it turned out there was no money there and the reason the other kid had said go there was because he'd actually been living with his family and he said they've been abusive to him so he wanted to like revert have revenge on his family well what was so really that is too when he was describing it was they had this family and they would to stop them defending themselves they would like take them one by one lap in demeanor in a room and take them one by one I take them out butchered them how the other ones didn't really know what was going on and think I mean the action itself but how like teenage kids can think about that stuff and then later on when he was talking about the decapitations he was talking about they get contracts with decapitation inside the court like they say look we want this killing we wanted to decapitate a guy we won this doctor want to see video of the guy being the Capitec we want that we want to go to suffer I'm when he hacks the heads off there sometimes still be a moment when when the life goes out of them and when the body is still like twitching like he says they can still see like was there's a bit like nerves I was like a chicken like a headless chicken there's a bit it's a part when they're still like twitching a bit even after they you know they've lost it kind of seven their connections there now when you're interviewing these people how nervous are you I mean this seems like if you're putting all this stuff down you could implicate them and some crimes and it seems like it would be very convenient for them to try to get rid of you so does there's a whole bunch of different situations around interview so sometimes I've interviewed people in prisons a lot of time in prisons um you know this took me years to get to a lot these people first of all you know no it wasn't like when I first started doing this I was like oh how do I get how do I reach them and start going out to drug rehab places and talking to people in drug rehab I'm going into prison since it out wireless I did a lot of interviews in one prison I got to know a lot of prisoners in the presidency Doris in a Christian evangelical wing there and they were going through his weird Christian you know like Cristiano a discovery of God there and then through this too on the street often like through contact I mean were all the time through contacts on the street in in Honduras a lot of great contact with a friend is a journalist who grew up in his neighborhood these guys it snows loads of these guys from growing up now there's different different things you know there have been bad situations I think anybody covered this has had some bad situations sometime people get angry people threaten them and so forth but a lot of the time when you talk to people and one things you have to be very a lot of time you have to be very stringent about protecting their identity and really serious about that because there's been cases where various cases what other people have interviewed killers and shown the identity either through the showing their face or through like some dumb thing being shown and they have been themselves murdered in a butchered after these they've given these interviews or like other things that happened they've been threatened or something their family or arrested or so forth so you've really got to protect people's identities in a way in terms of when they talk and stuff and I don't really feel nervous when I leave it all these people I probably feel more nervous hit that's just what it's like on a big show it's a different a different thing when you're like talking to first you know you start with easy questions like anything you start talking about how you know how you you know people human the human beings and people have got it people are complicated and I haven't just interviewed it I've also got drunk with some of these people and hung around with some of these people for time trying to get closer like you know I spent time to try and understand their world a bit more what's the most time we've ever spent with these people I mean several days several days yeah like you know I mean now see them see him again hang out with you know hang out with them in different places not all the time sometimes just you know sit down do interviews and just leave but it's it's complicated world for them is it's their normality knows if for them is normal it's what they've what they've lived what they've been through what's happening around them I mean this level of murder this happening a lot of parts of Latin America now it's crazy but in these areas is where he talked to other people who had just on the edge of this well her family members involved in this and it's just they're living this I mean these are levels of violence and it's interesting to compare historically these levels of violence because you look at some of the worst cities like San Pedro Sula Honduras Caracas I'm Sara Juarez and these are places which have levels of violence which are like way worse than medieval Europe a lot place in medieval Europe I mean look at the figures per hundred thousand because some of them have over a hundred four hundred thousand 150 behind a thousand and medieval Europe a lot these cities were like twenty four hundred thousand so they're way worse now way worse in the Wild West than like now there are some place in the United States the de la Owen idea I've done some research recently in Baltimore Maryland and I was kind of it's interesting to compare that to Latin America and that's high level as forty four hundred thousands that's that's not as the same level but it's significant still more than medieval Europe yeah Wow Baltimore's worse than medieval Europe yeah I mean I think it's you have to have to some professors there might in a like you get like you know there might be they might say well Jerusalem in this time or in a line I like you got triumph we nice hard to know it really dig down exactly that there was outbreaks of violence and killing in samples but the overall our yeah of all average yeah that's a significant leap 100 percent leap yeah absolutely Baltimore what about South Side Chicago it's not that I mean like the level I think in Chicago comes out around 20 or something so it's not now the American of the whole city now these again and one of things about the violence in the United States compared to Latin America when Baltimore is is significant but it's a fairly what the city of Baltimore is a fairly small place what they're talking about so in Mexico you have entire states that are like really violent or entire countries in Latin America whereas in the US it tends to be neighborhoods which are violent so if you really focus on the south side of Chicago it's probably similar levels to Baltimore I think you know it sir but if you look at the whole city got neighbors that are pretty safe in Chicago as well now through all of this time that you've spent down in Mexico have you seen it you've seen it escalate you've seen it get worse and worse yes so there was first this really big escalation happened in 2008 was the first big escalation what was the cause of that so you had there was a steady buildup that was happening and then in 2006 do you had the President Felipe Calderon declared a military crackdown on drug cartels and after that with there was this big response and things started really getting out of hand we had already seen violence escalating before I think you know my idea my kind of theory behind this is that you had in Mexico back in a 20th century more of a top-down centralized government controlling everything you had the PRI in power and they were basically they were hauling it through corruption so back then they'd have the drug cartels working for them an interesting story going back then to the 19 late 1970s story in a book called drug lord by Terrence popper who interviewed a a drug trafficker in the eighties when he got the his job as the jefe de plas which is the head of a certain territory when he got the job he went with the State Police at a time and said I want to become the head of the placer and they took him in and tortured him for two days and like and I beat the crap out of him put electric shocks on his nuts one of the big tortured in Mexico put water laced with chili in his nose smell one of his big say your whole face burns these are like torture techniques they have and after two days of torture who said yeah well done you know you survived well you've got the job so we know what it shows is that the police had the upper hand to please control this they were like okay we control this racket and you know we can fuck around and torture and kill drug traffickers when we like you know in all up the presidency I mean there was uh in that time Carlos Salinas became president 94 his brother Raul Salinas there's the Swiss investigate his bank accounts and said at 500 million dollars in bank accounts we say you know they they believed it was drug money so right up to the presidency this was being run when makes a code change democracy so when I arrived in Mexico was changing to democracy is like wow great democracy is gonna happen free markets gonna happen you know in the good days of the 21st century now but what happened was you look the political control shifted so you had a bunch of different political parties and they were fighting over the drug trade and you know I was one time in rebel arezzo when the federal police had a shootout with the municipal police they were fighting each other probably cuz they work for different drug cartels so that's what started but then you had the techniques like the technique of beheading wasn't really a big deal it was very very rarely used up until around 2006 and one of the first incidents was in Acapulco in 2006 in about June 2006 now it might have been after inspired by the al Qaeda sakal we in a video which was shown in full of Mexican TV remember when that came out and they decapitated the guy in Iraq and they decapitate first it was two policemen a decapitated later that year in September 2006 there was five heads they rolled onto a disco dance floor and then his thing just became just escalating just became this kind of like using his terror of public terror so 2006 2008 was a big escalation and then 2011-12 were like crazy and then it subsided a bit in a pub the violence got a bit less public and it was more like hidden like mass grave stuff and the worst mass grave that's been discovered so far was in Veracruz I've been to the side of it and it was 250 bodies were found in this mass grave in one place and it was right next to a housing estate and there's families he was so one of the saddest things was you cqc their kid his bicycles and basketball hoops and stuff right next to this and the field next to that they dug up 250 bodies and the smell was like emanating to this housing estate and it's a kind of middle club the dream of becoming middle-class that was the the kind of sums in this housing state and right next to it this violence but when I say a lot of these stories and I mean these are crazy stories but I love make the weird thing is a lot of Mexico lives a normality around this it's not what you say this is not what you say every day this is this happens but there's also just a normality that could just be like you're outside here in LA in normal people living normal lives around this as well what is the response in Mexico what it would mean after they wanted to have this military action against the cartels obviously that hasn't really put a dent in it would it would with the the current thought process behind dealing with this so there's been out there was a bunch of like citizen protest movements various times during these recent years and one of them was it was a very interesting guy called Javier Sicilia who's a poet and a writer whose son was murdered and he when it first happened his son was murdered and he just came out says the press where is likely not gone it's just like this is just Mexico's going I can't I can't deal with my son's being killed and then he began talking in very you know and he went to the streets and people coming out publicly crying and it was one of the first times there was a realization a lot of innocent people dying with this and people come out in you know I went to some of these things people come out crying family members and she I see a sense we're victims here because there's a for a long time a sense is simply bad guys killing bad guys and that wasn't the case now the current president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who just won the election last year and just took power on December 1st so he's got to mix things so one of them is this idea of the wars over I'm gonna create peace we can have forgiveness reconciliation you know piss hardly know what that really means and his second thing is we need to have more of a unified state police so like what I described before about you had local police fighting the Federal Police so we got to have so he's got this idea now the National Guard which is a kind of hybrid between military and police being around and that's basically his his these kind of two thrusts he's in now he's only been in power a couple of months January was still a bad month in terms of murders in terms of bodies last year was third more than 33,000 dead last year which is the size of Mexico's equivalent of the United States having close to a hundred thousand now matching what that would mean in the United States if you had that many people dying in a year a month the whole year in the year now when these people are when they're being recruited by the cartels when the police officers are being recruited the the big issue must be will there must be two issues right safety like if they don't join the cartel they probably get murdered and to the amount of money the cartel would give them would be far more than the government would give them to be a legitimate police officer yeah sure that's like known famously platinum blonde plateau plateau plumber like silver or let you want to have the silver of the bribe the LED of the bullet but but even beyond that for long time a lot of these people who joined the police I like from the beginning they're you know I've talked I've got I've got on video made a video back in 2010 in Sierra Harris of a bunch of rappers just hanging around in the middle of all this and one of their friends was saying and they were talking and these people saying you know some have been done for taking drugs over the border they've been in gangs and stuff how Morin was like I want to be a policeman and and he was like I want to be a policeman and make some money you know basically through corruption so it is like there's the mentality of some of these people joining the police from early on another guy guy opened open the first book with is a guy who became a policeman when he was 18 he was basically a hard tough guy paid American football from Durango became a policeman when he was 18 and in the police learned to torture and learn to murder he said that's what I learned in the police and I just started 20 after two years just left the place and went full-time into crime his life so you know you've got a situation where you know it's not you know it's worse even it's beyond bad that the bad I look up with my imagine of corruption so all of this essentially is escalated from the time you came to Mexico so when you came to Mexico it's something like you got in I mean if it was a story you got in almost the perfect time yeah yeah horrible way yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean it's I mean like you know you don't do these things on purpose you know you don't think if I look back 20 years ago I'm it's 18 years I've been in Mexico now I had Holden I've grown up in Mexico in that sense you know never look back and think that's and now in terms of myself seeing this I mean it's I mean nothing for anybody it's it's paced painful I mean how you process that level of death that level of murder level of suffering it's it's it's it's horrible stuff to see and it's you could still have a lot of people separated from that you know families people bring up children and you know you want to separate you know kids from that Soloff often like middle-class kids in Mexico quite sheltered because families want to shelter them as much they can from from from that violence and just you know not let them see that side of things how much of that do you have to deal with in Mexico City so Mexico City you know is about the same murder rate as Houston so Mexico City is not super violent now it's still not super safe but it's not super violent so Mexico City is kind of and there are parts of Mexico which are which are fairly safe now the state of Yucatan you know where murderous is the same murder level as Belgium so you've got aces within Mexico where you don't have this level of violence so Mexico City is it is a great city Mexico City is a great city to live in in many ways apart from the traffic and the pollution and various things I mean there's a bunch of things that are I know and I love all of Mex I love all of Latin America I love even even the bad places are still love I enjoy going to the place so I enjoy meeting people they're gonna hang out in these areas there's a lot of good things about him still but dealing with all the horrific tragedies that you report about and experience do you look for an escape route I mean oh you are you looking to get the fuck out of Dodge yeah I mean um there's been different times where I thought you know I want to stop this now and cover all of things yeah as a journalist and he see other journalists doing that as well as a journalist called her Zeus has given a great Mexican journalist who's just I just thought about the trial of El Chapo over in New York and who's been covering this for years one of the really great Mexican correspondences covered his drug stuff and he was like he just said to me oh butter I've got some stuff maybe I can give you this is the I'm gonna this is the last thing I'm gonna do conferring trucks not really no we'll see we'll see if that's true I think a lot of time you know you get caught still doing this stuff you know person when you when you've covered something people want more people are interested litter and there's relevant to this I think some of the other struggles beyond like the the danger and stuff is simply I mean with journalism's in a bad way I love the media in a bad way and you're simply getting no trying to be a freelance journalist I love being a freelancer and it's our lovely independence I love being a write books and travel and write magazine stories and make documentaries and do these things but like just have you know having the economic base for that you know it's to generate a lots in time now I've been doing it have you personally been targeted at all so there's a couple of situations that had you know I mean first I would I know I'm gonna have to give some come respect and condolences to so many colleagues Mexican colleagues who have been murdered have been being murdered threatened had to leave the country and various things and they've had it bad including a friend a good friend a great colleague called had about this who was shot dead in 2017 may 2017 in Kula can a guy I'd known since 2008 great guy got drunk with him in the canteen a very generous guy around eight books a charismatic I mean I really loved a guy who was shot dead and many other stories so so I kind of don't want to give my own compare my own work to lot of them in many ways but yeah sure there's been times is one time in it was in the state called Michoacan and this was 2014 and there was a thing that happened there when a lot of regular people rose up with guns against the cartels they were known as outer defenses or like self-defense courts and they rose up to fight the cartels and they they a bunch of guys with guns it was kind of crazy situation where there was this luck almost like a trench warfare happen between cartels and these self-defense groups and then what happened was a lot of regular gangsters started saying oh we're self-defense groups as well you know just coming up said all year were self-defense groups you know those guys were out on the street with guns you know it's gonna go out with our guns and so anyway I went down I drove down at the end of this I've been I've been covering this right through and it had been fairly okay to do the self-defense squads the other defenses were pretty easy going to work with but I drove down there to Michoacan and I wanted to do some stuff on it and Osman and me a friend journalist she just backed out at the last minute that's went down there anyway and arrived there and there was about 50 guys arrived in this place near the city called apatzing√°n and there was about 50 guys who supposedly a self-defense scored in a parking lot getting ready to go on a mission to try and take down this drug trafficker called la deuda and they were like they were sitting there was a guy would like signing them up for this kind of mission and there was a bunch of guys they were and they had very heavy weaponry they had ak-47s their fifties they had grenade launchers on there on there on the top of their guns and beneath their guns they had like grenades strapped to them lastly create some belts around them ammunition belts around him I'm not crazy like you know like you see that old revolutionary stuffing I mean like real crazy like this Baradei stuff and then I was talking and I realized quickly these were not self-defense classes would knock I these were gangsters them they'd you know they came how they're right over there like you know how long you been in the self-defense you know movement are couple of days no no like and then they had like guns with like diamonds and jefe what's-her-face then the boss and and I was getting okay I was kind of like you know joking with these guys and take some photographs at him so they were posing for photographs so they were sitting there with like posing with their guns and stuff in there and they said they say they ever the word we're always it's like it's not very white boy it's like blondie you know it could mean like you know you if you're you're white in Mexico you often get called away so like we're all how much the prostitutes cost in your country you have to go there to see in the light where do you like take do you like taking myth you don't you know you like taking myth you know like I'm okay and though they were still like nope I'm joking and this guy turn came up among them and he said yeah I'd say the other guys there first there's a big guy and he said he was carrying a big gun it's got the woody massive head and he said to me a bit aggressively just don't take my photo I'd like it no problem I won't take your photo and then a guy came up and said to the other guy say what are you doing it's a DEA guy here it's a DEA agent among you taking your photographs you know what are you doing and I was like I'm not even American I'm British and he said no no you know this is a DEA guy my my my brother was arrested in Texas and the DEA guy pretended to be a journalist that's some bullshit story and I said look I couldn't you know I could show you my website so they got the cell phone out and and looked through the cell phone and found my website and the guy calmed down a bit and he said you know if I see you I'm gonna put a bullet in your head I'm gonna throw a grenade at you he added so I left you know I kind of tried to talk about a left and yeah and then they went and then I didn't publish the photographs to God and I bought the photo ops and like one of the guys sent me an email saying what happened to photographs my emails and my website so I just ignored it and I think a lot of them got killed in a big fight with the federal police afterwards so that was one and this vignette has been a few more so it's a lot of touch and girl yeah in these situations yeah the the federal police do they have a plan to try to eradicate these mobs or is it a lot of lip service like is it really possible to eradicate these gangs or is it just one of those things where they say they're going to do something but they have to kind of protect themselves you know this there's there's been different different times I mean sometimes there's been the Federal Police have done well done after a particular guy or sometimes with the Americans you know there's been you know arrests of very many significant kingpins the problem is is well is that the deeper questions is that like when you take down some of these kingpins who's got other people who will fight over their same territory mmm so for example you know you take out chapo guzman and then you get a fight among his sons and some I had one of his lieutenants over it's over the Empire now what's happened and one of the reasons the violence is increased in Mexico is because they've had this onslaught attacking cartels over the years then you end up with like the lieutenants then taking over and then their lieutenants taking over and then their lieutenants taking over that's what happened in Chicago as well all right I spoke to a police officer in Chicago and he said the violence escalated afterwards some big gang arrests and once they had gotten some leaders of some gangs and other people tried to fill the void he exactly exactly so so so then you get some of the people who are in power now I like very young very violent people and people who are not as smart when I was not mature yeah so so you know so you end up these they fragmented territory so you have people controlling rather than having big cartel some leader who controls it and a half the country you're not with these cartel little are these gangs controlling a part of a state there's one state called Guerrero which you've seen this really like cartel fragmentation and you've got maybe 12 different groups in this one state and you get like a place where they you know one controls it along a road and then in our group controls it passing a certain point so there was some some friends went up there seven journeys went up there and got held up on this road up there 2017 as well and they got there in a car they're not there two vehicles and about 200 guys blocked the road and the leader of this group was a guy I believe called aware of pelea lie again his name blondie Pelayo and he's like maybe 23 years old like 200 guys there they said some of the kids I talked with one of the friends who was there and they said some of these or kids who was the youngest like 10 years old among this mob of people and they they they held him up they took away to one of the vehicles they took away all their laptops cameras all their equipment stuck them in a car did go do you have to be careful when you're traveling that you don't have like an obvious expensive laptop or camera something along those lines I think from the point of view of is you know they can they can take it away I mean it's happened a lot lot of cases recently colleagues just being robbed I mean you get like an armed group and they take away their basically their hold them down take all their stuff so you don't know so going on know various colleagues photographers if you're a freelance photographer all right and you lose a good camera then then you know like you know some of the TV people they have they have less expensive cameras and they used to I remember a few years ago a TV crew interviewed some gang members up in Honduras and they stole their camera it was at that time was like an 80,000 a camera and the TV network I say what the TV network about who was more pissed about losing the camera it was about these guys you know King that's how I know having guns pointed to them what is the attitude in Mexico special amongst people who are studying the narco wars with all this built that wall stuff all this what's going on in America there's this this is very strange right versus left polarization over here about whether or not there should be a wall between the United States and Mexico sure I mean well I mean the thing with Mexicans are obviously very anti Trump in Mexico is you know from Trump is very unpopular from the very beginning you know when he said I know they are rapists and murderers yeah someone's doing the raping yeah I mean he's kind of generally look at surveys the level is very low does anybody like my Trump in Mexico they're always contrarian yeah I mean I've seen numbers like you know people say like an 80 percent or something I think he's terrible so it means there must be a 20 percent somewhere don't I haven't met a Mexican who's been like pro-trump I mean I never have I met a Salvadoran who was pro-trump one time in in here he the guy had been deported and he was like I know you agree you know this guy Trump's gonna turn out to be a great president so so I say that but now Mexico is very very antitrump in terms of the wall I mean there's you know there in terms of what it said of the smugglers my was talking to a smuggler in Nogales about this and he was describing he he'd smart he was from Nogales from a neighborhood called Buenos Aires which is right on the border with the United States you knows Nogales Sonora Nogales Arizona so Nogales Sonora and there's Arizona and he was from the neighborhood right on the border there and he described that he first took people over the border of the United States back in the 1980s when he was at school he's a high school and the reason was that time was just an old fence and there was a hole in the fence these to go through into the United States and go back into Mexico it's an old wire fence and the first time he took people through people would arrive from southern Mexico so you know how do we get to the US and he'd say ah you know this way and they give him a tip he said the first time he got the equivalent of about 50 cents was what he made to take people to the United States 50 cents nowadays the cost of going to the US is five thousand dollars that's what you paid to go illegally into the United States five thousand bucks so you're saying wow look at that increase every time that the US puts more security it means it's more expensive when it's more expensive that means more money going to criminals which means there's no an industry doing it so now the cartels make a big percentage of that money of human smuggling into the US but luck in terms of the wall I mean the when Trump first came any at the line that Mexico's gonna pay for it yeah and and then it was this kind of line you know right the beginning he kinda he threatened Mexican president saying if you if you don't agree to the pay for the wall then why are you gonna come and meet me and then it was like wow he's really going to try and shake down Mexico for like billions of dollars he's really gonna try and do that and that was kind of scary moment then I think from the point of view of Mexico when he first got the powers like he's gonna do that and then he's gonna deport three million and he's gonna you know he's gonna kill NAFTA actually those things haven't really come to pass actually if you look over the last couple of years of Crump has some really hit Mexico very hard so the concern was that he was going to take money that should be allocated to other ways that's gonna help Mexico and he was gonna try to take that and use it to build the wall I mean no one really knew when he first came in he's like Mexico's gonna pay for this wall right the wall just got ten foot higher remembering that yeah it was like it was like you know how you gonna do that you can even start threatening Mexico militarily and say give us money I mean it was kind of like it was a shakedown could this shakedown is kind of it was kind of a crazy diplomatic thing when he first got it so that was kind of scary for a moment from the point of view of Mexico but I think after you look at the last couple of years he hasn't really hit Mexico with that now if he wants to build the now there's the big fasten in terms of the spending here but if he wants to build it or extend its there is warden sections in the board already if he wants to extend it you know it won't stop a lot of the hard drugs I mean if you look at heroin cocaine crystal meth high-value drugs they normally go through the ports of entry right so shipping yeah I mean the Gold's all through the ports of entry through like I mean you have through King cars right cars trucks I mean you go through if you look at the Laredo Loretto know though one of the reasons that was a big fight and war started there are mexico's because I was very valuable territory there's something like 8,000 trucks go over that border every day now if you have eight thousand trucks how many of those can you search in a day and also the way they can hide this stuff in trucks they can hide drugs in like a medal they can put them in Zinn in some kind of metal container seal it up solder it up put a bunch of stuff so it doesn't smell so somebody has to say I'm gonna open that with a blowtorch it was a searching I have to rip that vehicle apart right to find the drugs they were putting them inside wheels yeah yeah in the a that's like inside tires and stuff like that I saw one that like there's this song that's one of the older tricks from your like the seventies there's a song it is a one of the first narco corridos the drug ballots it was called contraband and true and treason from the 1970s and that was about hiring hiding marijuana packing you know in tires hmm back then but yeah I mean now the the trap cars now like super sophisticated they have some weird trap cars we have to do like a bunch of stuff like open the door move some stuff to actually to actually open find the drugs others like some trick sort of door has to be activated yeah I would imagine if there's a will there's a way and there's that much I mean I remember hearing that from it's not a reliable source but from The Sopranos they were talking about only 20% of all the shipping containers to get brought into America gets searched yeah well that's that's crazy yeah absolutely so so the hard drugs going a lot of time through on through the the ports of entry hmm and and they have there another classic trick they have is you get they allow some to get busted so you allow one guy to get busted hmm they set somebody up so they're taking some drugs through they get they get busted all the eff energies on them and then meanwhile more drugs are going through and is this the United States border that's test that's catching this guy yeah so they're not getting tests they're not getting tested in Mexico as they cross over right it's only the United States border yeah some sometimes they might catch him in Mexico mmm sometimes but the majorities can be the United States the United States Border Patrol guys are they ever caught being corrupt yeah absolutely yeah there's been cases of u.s. Border Patrol and customs entry people who have been yea caught taking a bunch of money taking bribes allowing allowing certain cars through the course sound vehicle through so yeah how does one fix this I mean if you had a magic wand you were gonna wave it over Mexico and fix this problem like if somebody said you on you're smart you've been in the business for a long we're gonna let you dictate how this takes place so I'd say yeah three things so like drug policy reform so we've got to talk about how we deal with this drug situation so I mean like America I mean I mean oh the some of that is is here isn't it and you probably got better idea than me about how to why America what Americans take so many drugs I mean I come from a drug taking community myself in the UK I guess so maybe not that different well I think there's a lot of answers to that the biggest one is in entirely that most people don't enjoy what they do and they want an escape I think that's probably the biggest one the there's some ridiculous number that was just were just who's discussing the number on the podcast of how many people actually was it it was a Johann Hari wasn't it yeah he was talking about the number of people that actually enjoy their job 67 percent people of in this country don't like what they do or you know or just just sleepwalking through their life there's another significant percent that hate what they do and then there's a few left over that love what they do I mean it's a very small number of people maybe like myself or maybe like yourself that actually enjoy what they do for a living and feel like they're following their passion most people are just working a job and they fucking hate it and then when they get off work they want to get fucked up and a lot of these people you know they're they have psychological issues they're suffering from abuse childhood abuse they're trying to I mean there's been some significant statistics about childhood abuse and how many people from childhood abuse wound up using and abusing drugs and becoming addicted and even overdosing on drugs and it's ridiculously high it's about pain pain and suffering and trying to remove that pain and suffering from your life and you know people that don't know how to make healthy choices and don't have friends that are making healthy choices and don't know what to do with their life that's a big big part of it there's another part of it that's it because it's illegal there's something about things that are illegal that are intoxicating and enticing you know when you look at the statistics in Holland in particular where marijuana has been you know you could buy it in coffee shops forever not that many people smoked marijuana in Holland it's a lot of marijuana tourism especially back in the day now that America has legal marijuana of almost everywhere and not a lot of people are going to Holland specifically to get fucked up but that was always the thing man when we were younger it was always like hey he's gonna go to Holland go get high like I was to go to another teenager I went over there for some of that you know on a boat and arrived in Amsterdam back in those days yeah the actually it made me made me swallow it smile what you saying just there about enjoying the job and it's true I mean when he said that I do love what I do and enjoy what I do so that's can tell you know one of the size of that thing but but yeah so so I mean in terms of you know the issue of drugs we have to talk about this how can we stop Americans stopped spending that money or allowed that money is gonna be spent not to be going to a black market and and destabilizing these countries but also a lot of issues in in Mexico as well like getting that social work how do you change the reality and again to you know people who are abused and suffer taking drugs but people who abuse and suffer in Latin America becoming assassins yes because one of the weird things are not on a moral level on a level of morality you know I knew a lot of kids growing up who sold drugs and it wasn't really an amazing immoral thing to think about in I sell drugs it was an easy step to take I'm gonna simmer sell some weed and then I'm gonna sell some speed and sell some ecstasy and then later on a heroin whatever but for somebody to commit a murder that seems like a bigger you know a lot bigger deal how do you get into how do you cross that line to becoming a murderer how do they cross that line so easily well I think it goes back to that young boy that you were talking about that butcher that family he was abandoned and angry and hurt and just so much pain that he's suffering that's often the case they want other people to suffer when when you see people that are doing terrible things to people they're almost always suffering they're almost almost always wanting other people to feel what they feel they're lashing out that's uh that that Social Work aspect that you're discussing so critical and something that we've discussed about this country that how few people are putting I mean the health end very few politicians very few people that are running this country are putting efforts and to try to heal these communities that have suffered from just years and years of systemic racism years in years of just embedded poverty that's almost impossible to escape years and years of crime and drugs and just growing up in this community of despair and this is what we were talking about with Baltimore this is what we're talking about with Southside Chicago and various cities all over this country it just they don't get better man they date stay fucked up you know I had Michael wood who is a police officer from Baltimore and he was discussing what it was like being in Baltimore as a police officer and then looking at some documents from the 1970s that detailed the crime in the very same areas that he was patrolling in and this the same crime in the same areas and this sense of just overwhelming futility like there was nothing that he was going to be able to do there's gonna put a dent in this because this was a lot of it was a product of in these areas in Baltimore where there was law that you were not allowed to sell homes to black people in these certain areas so they kept these people in these poor areas and even though they had this desire to escape into the the more affluent or safer communities they weren't allowed to for a long time I mean there's so much of that in this country that the you know the people that are in control but everybody just wants to get elected everybody just wants to you know and then once they get elected then they're looking to get reelected so they spend a gigantic percentage of their time campaigning no there's no universal effort on the part of all the citizens of the country to try to look at all these areas and say hey these are up this is us you know just because you don't live in the southside of Chicago that those are human beings those are just like you and I you could have been them they could have been you if they were you and you were them wouldn't you hope that you would help wouldn't you hope that someone would come in and try to fix this area someone would try to portman we pour so much money into foreign countries we pour so much money into subsidizing various industries that a lot of people disagree with you know when there's I mean I'm not an economist I don't know what economic sense that on any of that stuff makes but I do know that money is allocated in a lot of different ways and the idea is that it's going to be better for all of us well it's not better for all of us to keep these communities as fucked up as they are right now and there's no effort nothing very little done no movement no change no gigantic step no no ten year plan to eradicate gang violence no ten year plan to eradicate the illegal drug sales and murder so the this great social work there are some great social workers down there so there are some heroes in these places and there's somebody I talked to a lot by sincere awareness among cassandra who grew up in his neighborhood she's one of the first people introduced me to a young gang members in this in this area she used to work in a factory they're going to Social Work now she's a psychologist and she she's somebody who really will do the work and reach people and I'm more like save lives and you know some of these my basic stuff you really get in the community and trying to read you have to reach the kids when they're often 12 11 12 and you can often see in these areas who the kids are going to get into this who's gonna be recruited by the cartels right who are gonna get the gangs because there's certain profiles in these people they haven't got their families I was talking to some guys in innocency raha whiteis from the Barrio Azteca which is the one of the big gangs they started in the u.s. actually among prisoners and spread into Mexico and became almost like a paramilitary group in Mexico about how they recruit people and then this guy was saying like you know we will see no I can see from these young kids who's gonna be able to kill and you know who's gonna be a real fighter and who's not and if these people have gotten you know parents you love them and so forth these guys I'm gonna I'm gonna they're not gonna work for me I need I need someone who's like god I hate who's gonna hang their name and right I can do something with one of those who's kind of a perverse opposite of this stuff really but so if people don't have that families and this makes me I guess think a bit more sympathize I guess as well to you know the idea of how how important family is yeah how important loving parents is you know whether you're together or separately non loving parents you know having that and but if you don't have that you know you need social work and need people looking to offer something and try and now those are an interesting mayor of midian good and risk Waddell and he had these ideas of trying to change the reality of this city and he said I'm gonna build the most he was a mathematician so I'm gonna misuses a mathematical problem this issue and I'm gonna build the most beautiful building in the ugliest part of the city in the worst part of the city to make and force people who want to see we made a conservatory and put it in there in the poorest neighborhood so that people who want to be in this conservatory have to travel to the poorest neighborhood and go there and try and change the reality because if you see around you a horrible neighborhood Adder Street no light nothing working you know what do you turn into and if you see a nice environment around you can you change people that way well how did it work you know it worked for a while it's hard to know exactly because also there was a truce between some of the gangsters there as well for a while was it related to the construction of the servitor theme and the government was involved in the trees on truce or not but there was for a time the murder rate did drop quite dramatically in Marian and I don't have people have carried on you know but Marian has improvement Marian Marian Columbia was the worst the most violent city in the world back in the 1990s and it's it's not you know you know people do like their city now Midian Wow so it had some impact the absolutely yeah then the social workers I'm sure they have some impact on individual people but I would imagine that the overwhelming volume of children that are being recruited there's very hard to put a real dent in it well I think insid out why does it had an effect because when that was the most violent city in the world around 2010 2011 and now was this turf war there between the Sinaloa cartel which is chapo guzman against local Juarez cartel and there was you know there was 9,000 killed in that city over 4 years of that of that war it was crazy I was carving out it's covering it then just driving around from sing to sing to be like yeah massacre here massacre that is driving around bangbang these things happening and afterwards there was a lot of social work put into the city and Sandra described by Lynn she said there's a like a waterfall of aid money coming in there was like us you know USAID and stuff would start putting money into this and other different groups and the murder rate did really drop so and it hasn't gone back up to that level since so I think it does have a real effect when it spurs a policy you know it does have an effect on these things but also when you talked a little while ago about a magic wand on this I mean in making a police force that actually protects the community or making a police force that has some kind of effect I mean I grew up in England which is you know pretty safe place relatively and nice to not like police and no hate they know be a anti police would ever growing up and now I appreciate wow you know you have police who actually protect the community in some way and the same in the United States I mean the United States the police do protect people to a large extent compared to these countries and you know obviously this issues here is or issue will race and killing and violence and so forth but still I think a lot of the people who who believe that they know a lot of people believe they have guns for self-defense and I respect the right to have guns to self-defense but really in America you're generally safe because the police are pretty hard on clamping down but how do you create a police force which really has the will to protect people you know how do you have that you know with the with the word and the passion and the commitment to help people in Mexico that would be that'd be a dream the people that have dealt with police officers that are corrupt have a very difficult time here and what you're saying right those people would be angry what you're saying saying no no the police officers here are corrupt they are bad there is racism there are real problems yeah and there is but I think there's also a real problem being a police officer period I think police officers have an insanely difficult job and I think most of them are dealing with PTSD I think there's a giant percentage of them like all over the world and in America too that are constantly dealing with violence and the threat of violence and arresting criminals and being shot at and people lying to them I just don't think I think most people are very ill-equipped to handle something like that I mean I agree that there are definitely problems with the police and there are problems I mean the police shootings are very real problems please killing innocent people here is very real I need a little for improvement and you know there's people families against suffering from that from that violence I don't want to belittle this no no you're not I know you know I just have to sort of clarify because I know so many people be hearing this and yeah Mexico is terrible the United States there's I mean there's a ton of videos the real issue though is we're also dealing with the the sheer number yeah of interactions that police have with people you know the vast majority of them are fine yeah but others tell the other thing like saved the crime of kidnapping kidnappings a horrific antisocial crime and horrific crime destroys lives there's one video really of video which really made me sick which was given to a family of a kid a fourth your old kid who was taken and they send this video to his family in Mexico and they were beating this kid and saying to this kid you know this is you this you and the guy who sent the cameras is your fault you bitch to the mom this is your fault look how your kids get him being now you're gonna give me the money so asking for like was it $300,000 ographers huh and those kind of crimes now kidnapping doesn't happen in the United States on a very big level because you've got effective law enforcement so some I mean their house I was at one conference and those you know real nice real nice guy but those people calling for the abolition of the police and they shouldn't be a police force saying you really want to live like with no police you would only live with a dysfunctional police where they can just kidnap your kid and I send a video to like that and you've got no protection from that kind of thing right I mean there's definitely problems here but also you've got to see the other side of having a pretty dysfunctional police force and what that means it's just such a staggering difference between the United States and Mexico in that regard in regard to gang violence drug violence just overall murders and the stories that we hear from over it's so different the fact that you could just draw a little line in the dirt you cross that line you're in hell and then you cross this line you're in Houston I mean that's fucking crazy yeah yeah I mean again I mean I get criticized sometimes from I met you know sometimes mezack mitts can government sources or Mexican tourism sources you know like I'm covering this stuff so I'm showing the worst and it can give it a story at picture sometime because you know when I tell a story of 49 decapitated bodies with a handsome figure of people think wow you know as soon as you say this stuff and some guy describing to capitain people with this kind of does you know if not people outside you know don't say it as well as that it still is a great country yeah I still you know I love the United States but I probably love Mexico more and what do you love more about Mexico besides of food I mean I would say generally the atmosphere is good I just feel fill people in nice generally I think despite all of these horrific violence do you think it's because they don't have the same sort of ruthless ambition that people in the United States have I think there is a sense we're talking before about why people are into drugs and one thing that occurred to me is this kind of hyper competitiveness of society and people can feel like failures like if you feel like a fairly if you feel like I guess well maybe social medias affecting this as well because you see what people have and you expect you to have more right and you feel you haven't lived up to it I think in Mexico people you know if you're broke in the United States when you become often maybe feel like a personal failure how come you're living in America and you're broke right whereas in Mexico lots of people are broke so you like you know you don't feel that same kind of personal failure with that I when I'm there one thing that always strikes me is how happy people seem and that I think there's a certain stress level that a lot of Americans put themselves into where they're constantly pursuing material possessions material wealth and success and that oftentimes this leads to really exacerbated stress levels and it's not it doesn't make you happy like the whole idea of having things in our mind is someday if I buy this car I'll be happy if I live in this neighborhood I'll be happy and then so they work 12 hours a day to try to achieve that dream and they're never happy and they're always stressed out and even though the vast majority of the United States I mean there's some insane number like 34 if you make 135 thousand dollars a year you are in the top 1% of the world hmm so there's a giant percentage of this country that's in the top 1% of the world yet the overall happiness level is least from what I've read is quite a bit below the people in Mexico yeah yeah I mean yeah a lot of these things I mean how how do you see your own happiness or measure your own happiness or sense of success or failure so yeah so that's part of it I mean in the food is great the food is the food the food so my giant fan of Mexican food here I love it there's a place down here that I take the guys here that work here all the time it is as Mexican as you get no one speaks English there they have Mexican soap operas playing on the television and the food is just sensational it's so good yeah yeah so um so some of these things as well as that but but before you took my at this border between Mexico and the US yeah it's it's a huge is that vast difference between countries and coaches and and the interaction another issue I guess is the issue of guns going south and we talked about oh I didn't come up it was a lot of firearms a lot of firearms like that fast and furious deal yeah well the Eric Holder thing that went down years ago were they well sold it was some sort of a sting yeah they sold guns and those guns wound up being used to kill Americans and even American police officers yeah yeah so that was so the ATF gun off this and this I mean the number of guns not really sure how many guns are turned down but there was one study the they came to conclusion at about to over 200,000 guns every year go from the United States into Mexico so that's an insane number two hundred thousand guns I know I interviewed a guy in prison in Seattle Whitis for gun trafficking and he would drive every weekend from Mexico of the United States by like 10 to 15 mostly ar-fifteens some other guns as well and drive them down into into Mexico and it's pretty easy to get in New Mexico so you drive them in it's like it's a piece of piss very easy you basically most the time you've got no control no he would actually hide them in fridges and stoves and would pay an import tax for the fridges and stoves hmm but but he was buying them and he said shitless I said how did you buy the guns he said I wouldn't no idea - so what I did you showed it by your guns he said are nothing at all had no idea whatsoever I said no no nothing at all so do you buy him from gun shows see buy from gun shows but any what he would do was he would use the private sale loophole which they tryna close now yes so he would go in there and then I went to the dungeon to a gun show in in Mesquite in Greater Dallas area known as the gun show capital of America hmm and went to a gun show there and asked you know people can you sell me guns you know I'm done live here can you sell me guns and first I said I know you need to be texting something oh yes y'all can sell you these guns and who's the reason to get out as they say it's a private sale right however some of them I know some of the the the pro-gun people get angry talking about this but I saw him whoa nice they've got a whole bunch of boxed up ar-15 rifles and they're selling them as being private sellers so yeah private sell now so he was just simply buying his guns and taking him down I saw right in front of me as well somebody who who said to the person I can't I can't buy I was looking for a different gun and said no I can't buy it I don't have like a carnies ID to buy the gun I'm and the person will you know still happy like even the private sale loophole if you in theory if you suspect the person is a criminal mm-hmm or we're using for criminal purposes you shouldn't sell them the gun but they don't care and so one thing I mean you really want to people really want people who they could it could be ms-13 undocumented they can still walk in and buy guns on some of these places burr then yeah so that's that's that's a big issue as well yes those gun shows were pretty bizarre yeah you're walking around with a bunch of people just itching to shoot somebody they're just hoping somebody breaks in their house I know a guy who keeps a gun and his ankle at all times he keeps one in his back he's got a he's got a holster that he carries with him sometimes he carries a knife as well I mean he's literally begging for someone to fuck with him mmm I mean I've got my problem with the people who like you know I talked to a guy from the Alaska machine gun Association he has about 200 guns in his basement 200 guns and I have a problem with with with people with doing that but then there's still like how do you stop the guns go into criminals to say I'm the gun the criminals in in Baltimore right I was saying interviewed in Baltimore a gun trafficker who's taking guns into the city of Bodom the yeah the gun show loophole is very strange it's very strange that that's allowed and this is coming from someone me personally who owns guns and I believe in the Second Amendment and I just I don't think that the way to stop people from doing illegal activities is to make those activities illegal for people who don't do anything illegal you know I think they're the real issue is the psychology behind people that are willing to shoot people in the first place and the deal with the overall mentality of these human beings and try to figure out what's wrong with our society cure it at a base level at a human level that's what's really wrong it's not the inanimate object of a gun that's the problem it's the human beings that are willing to use these guns to commit horrific acts that's what I think but when you have something like drug cartels which exist or gangs which exists and then you have this thing called a gun show and then you have this gun show loophole well boy you got a fucking giant hole in your dam you know you got water pouring right through right there like how do you not fix that up if you are a person who believes in the Second Amendment you believe in legal and responsible gun use you should be angry at that because that is that represents a gigantic problem and that also represents a threat to legal gun ownership because if this keeps happening and people keep getting outraged and more mass shootings happen with illegally acquired guns after a while you know there's there's what's going to come to some sort of a real conflict with people yeah I'm actually doing a new book about gun trafficking hmm so I'm really interested to hear about his issues and what the actual room for compromise is or like we know or like what someone like yourself who believes in the Second Amendment how much room for compromise do you think there is in on these issues I mean like closing the gun show loophole the other thing like for example the issue of 50 cals yeah now 50 cals in Mexico the cartels the cartels use 50 cals they used them to set up ambushes they'll use them to hit military vehicles police vehicles so they're the set on the side of a mountain and now 50 cows and I bang bang and I go right through baseball sized bullets yeah crazy now imagine if you had quite that big yeah a big-ass bullet no I know I understand ups a lot these Mets can place a military occur up as well but you know if you are an honest one or whatever you're going in a car he's fucking hit by one of those going to your vehicle then they open up on you yeah see is there any room there do you think for like clamp down on 50 cows I've never heard that discussion that much I have a friend who has won an takuna he's got a 50 caliber it's ridiculous it's clean the idea that you're using that for self defense unless you're going to war with Russia or you know fighting against some gang cartel gang that's invading your city that seems that's a military weapon I mean it's the same argument I think for having a fighter jet with Hellfire missiles do I think you should be able to own a Cessna and fly a little print plane around sure okay do I think you should be able to own a jet well I mean there are a lot of rich folks at private jets okay do I think you should be able to own a fighter jet that goes the speed of sound look oh I mean it's just a faster jet right yeah okay okay do you think you should be able to own a fighter jet with 50 caliber guns strapped to it oh well what the fuck is that are you starting a war like what are you doing this is like these levels that things get too you know that's this is the argument against it automatic weapons you can't use automatic like certain states have regulations in terms of what you can't you know in California you can't even have a silencer I don't know why because it's very bad to have that loud bang of a gun it's terrible for your ears and if you're a hunter or someone who likes to shoot target practice or something that's a terrible thing for your ears and there's a suppressor they could put on the end of the barrel and will mitigate that but for whatever reason I think mostly because of films and public perception people think that those silencers are only used by assassins or something like that you're using to kill people so they they they convert the the semi-automatics from the states that it makes going to convert the fully automatic ass so they they they do that here too and then of course you know about bump stocks yeah yes which makes it much more free with the trigger much much easier to fire rapidly rather so how do you feel about the issue you know one of the issues is of having a database like the ATF or or they're not allowed to have a searchable database on on guns in the United States so they have like they have locked paper files and stuff they go through still they can't have like a digital database on guns that seems ridiculous doesn't it yeah um yeah you think they think I'm a because these are the gun lobby see the idea of a gun registry as being a step to taking away their guns because like once you start registering that you can go then afterwards and say well we know where the guns are yeah whatever but how do you feeling this flexibility on that issue of like the gun of like having searchable databases I mean like with a car like you have a license plate and if there's a hit-and-run yes type it in and you know whose car it is within seconds with gun tracing you can't you know you find a gun at a crime scene whatever you can't just trade in and put a button to go bang Matt's right is they have to go through paper I have to go through a whole formal trace mm-hmm and go through this kind of search see there's flexibility on that issue as well or how do you feel about that yourself wife myself feel there should be a traceable database I mean if there it's just like a car and I'm glad you brought up that analogy because when you when you get a car you have to know how to drive a car you have to in order to have a license to drive a car you have to take a test you have to take a written test and you take a physical driving test with an instructor they have to see and think about how many more people drive cars didn't own guns so it's possible to do this with guns yet it's not done when I bought my first gun like here you go I was like what like that's it like yeah you're not a criminal look we did a check on you you're not a criminal here's a gun I bought a pistol I buy a 38 revolver that was my first gun and I went to the the gun range and practiced with the gun and I read about how to do it and I talked to an instructor about safety and put goggles on and ear muffs and you know make sure you're protected and how to properly hold the gun while you shoot and all these different things but it's stunning to me that you don't have to do that I mean you can own a hundred and fifty guns and know how to operate zero of them and they're all yours you don't even have to prove you know what the fucking safety is you don't have to prove you know anything yes that's crazy but not me it's fun to shoot guns I'm not necess I've been doing research with new pickup and shooting if you guns in places oh I went over to Serbia and I arrived in Serbia on a hangover I'd seen my friends in the UK and got drunk with them and arrived in a hangover and I'd met him the contact down say I wanted to go to a gun club and he took me into a nuclear bunker I'm fine ak-47 just at a crazier this is whatever you want to fight that a crazy amount of guns there so I can see if it's fun to fire these things do you think they actually are good and self-defense I mean do you actually think I mean I don't it makes God I'd have guns I'd I wouldn't and when I travel in the field I won't go security and they generally secure is going to be more of a hindrance because they attract attention yet right attention yeah and they've got a go basically at my hands up and say this is this is me so I'm doing most of the situation's there you've got and have a lot of people with heavy guns you're not gonna out gun these guys yes in Central America is a bit different in Honduras there was with guys with guns they're not out of choice of choosing security because the the journalist himself was carrying a gun and had friends carrying guns and he was in he was carrying a mini Uzi was driving this journalist friend of mine Orlean Castro his name is great great journalist he was driving around and he had a mini Uzi on his lap as he was driving around to crime scenes and running around doing stuff hmm but do you do you think guns are actually effective for self-defense I mean do you have guns for self-defense and believe and that would simply just enjoy the sport of shooting guns well I hunt and one of the things I have used although I archery hunt now most of the most of the hunts I go on when I go to these places to to bow hunt specifically but I have rifles for hunting I have handguns for self-defense and it depends entirely on the situation that's like saying do you think cars are effective to get you where you want to go well they are effective if you drive carefully and you you know use the blinkers and look when you change lanes and you know make sure you observe the speed limit and all the different laws and are aware and don't crash into anybody but if you're an asshole no they're not effective you're gonna wind up dying in a car accident you're gonna flip your car over in the side of the road if you're in a terrible situation it is better to have a gun that did not have a gun if you know how to use it if someone's breaking into your house there has been there is countless stories of people protecting their families from from bad guys when they have guns they these are real stories they do exist there are people that I've talked to they mean you can find them there's countless stories there's also countless stories of people leaving their guns unlocked and a child gets a hold of it and kills himself accidentally there's there's stories of children actually only killing their mothers there's all those stories - so can a gun be effective in self-defense for sure that's why the military used them that's why police officers use them that's why people train and they go to the range and they take tactical courses to learn how to use a gun for self-defense absolutely a gun can be used for self-defense it's the best thing for the best tool for self-defense other than you know obviously living in a good neighborhood having a security alarm all these different steps a dog dogs are good especially a dog there's a trained dog but yeah guns absolutely can protect you if you're in a situation someone breaks in your house and you shoot that person dead that's you you're safer then that person killing you that has happened but it's a this is a that me this is a gross generalization that's an entirely dependent upon the situation that you find yourself in but if you're not if you're not protected by if you don't understand how to use it if you're not trained if you don't if you don't have training to keep your shit together when things go south because when you're in a situation and your life is in danger if you've never been in a high-pressure situation before how do you know you can keep it together and even hit something you're aiming at people have wild trigger panic and they have a really hard time dealing with life-or-death situations if they haven't served in the military or been in some very very high-stress situations we have to learn how to control yourself under extreme pressure conditions there's a lot there's a lot of factors there but I would say the same thing it's like you you would also say that with martial arts like can you defend yourself if you know martial arts well it depends on what you know I mean some martial arts are fucking horseshit you you just a lot of people out there practicing nonsense and if someone who actually knew how to fight just punched him in the face they would be doomed and then there's other people out there that are experts that would be very calm if someone tried to fight them and they would know what to do what not to do and if the person wasn't armed they would be able to easily dispatch them it really is dependent upon the situation how much effort you've put into it how much thought you put into it and but there's a lot of people out there but if you broke into their house you're making a huge mistake because they're trained and prepared and ready because they don't want to be a victim and it doesn't mean they're bad people and I think we we have a problem in this country where we look at things they're very binary they're 1 or 0 they're good or bad guns are bad guns are always bad I don't want a gun bad guys take your gun sometimes sure sometimes sometimes you kill the bad guy and you protect your family though - that's real - yeah no I've respect for people having having guns for self-defense we're talking about about shooting I've been around a few shootouts in Latin America and an over in Haiti and one thing about that from from a journalists point of view and being around and I've been seeing a lot of violence as well a lot people fighting even going back to England people having physical fights or with knives and that kind of thing so one of the differences I think with guns is in its fight you can't see bullets it's like a small thing but like you can't see the thing that's hurting when you see a guy with a knife right it's like the guy's scary you can see you can imagine that knife sticking into you but the gun is like you're seeing you know the object you can't see really they're the bullet going in so one of the times one of the times I shows in Haiti and I went in to cover the earthquake in 2010 which was you know real sad you know like crazy amount of dead there and we were covering the looting afterwards and the police came and started firing right into where people were looting nose with a cameraman and the police would find bang bang and then and it during the same situation not not right in that scene there but in another scene they shot and killed somebody the police just firing other looters and all the loot started running when the police were firing over fahren again with it how high were they farm they were firing you know bang find it put it down and the cameraman I was with was just sat down he was like filming this and I think this is one of the problems that while a lot of cameramen get shot in these places you start feeling like you're watching on TV oh wow because you feel like you know your signal is loud it's amazing look what look at what I'm watching yeah and you're seeing this and it's like not saying that one we got a go like the fire in who's like because I'm going to give the shot we could go there's another sad sad thing of a guy filming American journalist called Bradley Rowan will rest in peace who was killed in Mexico back in 2006 and he was filming a shooting in state of Oaxaca and he filmed these Glee's guys shooting and he fell and was hit and it carried on filming oh wow every filmed his own death I mean you can do it really literally see there yeah sad has worked for News Agency when that day when he was when he was killed in yeah there's a lot of courageous camera people and you know they get locked into that job and it becomes normalized almost like you were saying the people that live in these war-torn areas it becomes a normal way of life to them and although there are a lot of murders if you're there on a daily basis it seems like almost like a regular life a lot of these cameramen I mean they're courageous people you see these guys who go over to war zones and film what's going on in Afghanistan you know and I've met some of these guys that's just it's a crazy way of life to just accept the fact that you're an observer that might be a victim and you're capturing all this so people like me can get a some sin perception to what's going on in that part of the world or whatever to the Philippines southern Philippines and saw the fight against the Islamic state there in 2017 and it was interesting seeing that compared to violence our cover normal in in Mexico so that was Isis they took over the city called Marawi and it was an error they caught it was it was interesting was more self-contained they had a miracle the main battle area they mmbf it main battle area so in that area was Isis and the Philippine Army just gunned that all the time just like a constant bang bang bang bang bang and planes going over and bombing but actually even when you're outside that main area even if you're in a woods outside it and even if you're like 600 meters or 600 meters from it but it's you're not in the fighting the fighting is over there whereas in some like Mexico South America a lot of time this fighting is kind of happening everywhere there's no real control over when where the main battle area is but they didn't really let any journalists inside like deep into the main battle air and didn't really let any journalist in was sitting outside and hearing this constant ricochet of gunfire and but sometimes bullets will come out of the area so there was an Australian guy and I think he bent over to pick up some cookies and a bullet him in the neck oh I saw the x-ray actually the bullet embedded in the side of his neck Annetta he'd say it was taken out so it must have been at the end of its terminal velocity yeah yeah so it must've been a far far far shot yeah yeah it went through something else for it hit him yeah yeah yeah so so he say him everything going too fast there's a crazy though I didn't exactly say it was kind of a thing he's okay yeah I think he's okay he's okay with it well that guy's lucky yeah it's shot in the neck and you're okay yeah so but but yeah in terms of you know some of the people have really been in there was there with the head of one of the guys um one of the police special force guys had a camera on his helmet and he went he showed me that footage and he was right there right inside there going there like really really close building fighting with these Islamic Isis people and it was the same techniques I thought were generally he had a big chart showing how the techniques of guerrilla warfare had evolved from like Fallujah Aleppo Mosul and how this kind of weird new form of guerrilla warfare they have of like fighting house-to-house um so the business is suicidal kind of guerrilla war they rise up and they'll be like you know super close fighting really close I was and then when they're born they had hired in like you know basements and stuff and they drill holes in the wall so they could fire through and fire through and the footage he had he showed me the footage he had from being like right inside close-up like running victory in a room bang taking these people out and it was like wow this is just crazy I was trying to persuade the guy to let me put that footage out there you know the kind of crazy video game kind of cooler warfare okay called a wolf another cool cool call of Cornelia called a good of Judea I mean Mexico right now is almost like a war I mean you can call it a drug war but because there's no it's not like an army versus army war we don't think about it that way but from in terms of the amount of violence that goes on over there and the amount of casualties it rivals anything that's going on in the world right now yeah so I'll be talking a lot about this over the years and with some like experts is a good writer called Robert bunker who's an external researcher for the Pentagon and he investigates this stuff is a guy called John Sullivan from here in California as a police officer who also did a bunch of research and you know got a doctorate in in starting all this stuff as well talk to them about their ideas about what this means you know what is the how to define this in terms of warfare you know how's it fit in and they directed me to one book by an Israeli historian called the transformation of war and this was written back in the early 1990s and he basically predicted then you're going to see a transformation in war and armed conflict around the world and you know we have like nuclear weapon but they're useless in these situations in a nuclear weapons you can use a nuclear weapon to solve the problem in Mexico you can't use a nuclear weapon to deal with the Islamic state you know these are internal insurgencies in countries so if you look at Mexico so kind of weird hybrid hybrid so between crime and war so I use the working farm wars in some of these places so Mexico El Salvador Guatemala Honduras where you have na mele there are some situations in Mexico where you know the corner there was a group who called the Jalisco new generation cartel some of their guys shot down a military helicopter using an RPG seven Wow they killed eight soldiers in a federal policemen in the helicopter there was one shootout which involved 2,000 federal police and 500 sicarios like five hundred cartel hitmen had this crazy battle Mitchel tan so sometimes you actually get I see it starts to look more like kind of regular conflict but generates all you know what way more kind of hybrid there's kind of weird mix and such trying to get my head round this for a long time for some years I was fond of thinking is this a civil war room should we look at this and then it become like a this and then it was Robert bunker when he when I talk to him one time and he said you know like this doesn't fit into these theories you know it's not quite war it's more than crime it's a weird hybrid in between it's a kind of crime war and that's the way you got understand these these things but a lot of the the conflicts around the world today this is spreading I mean you look up Somalia you look at Libya you look a lot of these places it kind of weird mix instability yeah and then this is what a lot of refugees are fleeing from and I was down in Tijuana Christmas I followed the migrant caravan that came through Mexico Central Americans you know which caused a big big storm here here for the election what was that like was that overblown I think it was a big deal was it a publicity event like is that why they were doing it making it such a big deal in everybody walking towards the border look there is a bit more than that I think they were there was there this caravans had started a few years ago and they started off in Mexico for security they were an issue back a few years ago where the cartels would kidnap migrants on mass they would just get loads of migrants now you think these people are poor how can they make money from them but they'd get them put them in camps and they know they have family in the United States so they say oK we've got 50 people in the camp we want $5,000 off each one of you off your family now give us the number we're gonna call your family okay send us the money dad and then some of they did grilling okay mm you know it sounds like you know you're making money out of poor people right but you do it on mass you do it 10,000 people and you get a couple of thousand dollars each that's like you know twenty thousand dollars two hundred mil a two hundred million dollars so they started doing caravans for strength to avoid these mass kidnappings what was different about the latest Caravan the a she became became a caravan crossing borders they used to be going through parts of Mexico together then they started crossing borders now that Caravan began in October around October 12th and there was a call for them to meet and my friend Orlean again the journeys down in Honduras he was down there filming with his TV crew putting on TV are they down here they're going on this Caravan and Sonny went boom and like lows people saw it on TV and they're like I'm going I'm leaving I'm leaving now the desperation was so heavy and a Honduras isn't a real meltdown kind of staged Honduras is bad Venezuela's worse but Honduras might be like number two fire you know real meltdown cases in Latin America right now so people were like nice to talk to some these people they would say like I saw it on TV and I was that's it I'm going to decide it right away I'm gonna get my bad I'm gonna go so they arrived at the when they they went through a Guatemalan to Guatemala you know they became big like 7,000 people arrive at the the border with Mexico and you know first of all they try to know that they there was a push and shove on the border and tear gas was fired and they went down and crossed River and some of them walking across with a rope some of them going across on tires it was kind of crazy scene you know this scene down there was squatted half the bridge and then there came this it was kind of kind of a big deal I know the idea of calling him an invading army and so forth it was obviously ever blown but like I think it was significant scenes quite historic things that were happening down there and what was the overall goal to make it through to the United States yeah I mean you know different people had different ideas it was kind of on his weird things you know like it was go to the United States now some people had no idea where they would go and had no real plan some people some had very clear cases of being I'm a refugee you know understanding a bit about refugee legislation and I'm not fleeing very specific cases where they've been targeted by gangs working with corrupt police who want to kill them who have like hacked them and they've run and like I want to seek refuge in the United States or in Mexico someone was seeking refuge in Mexico was not the safest place to secret like there's been cases of people who have one camera man I know who fed Honduras and then was killed in Mexico has there ever been ever any discussion of the United States military intervening and trying to do something about the cartels so there's been like a us you know some US forces like u.s. marshals sometimes you the Mexico is very proud of its Constitution I'm very proud of its sovereignty and doesn't want us force acting in Mexico and I think the idea really of US military military is pretty out there how it's pretty you know like it wouldn't help if he's be bogged down into more problems and and they've been after in Mexico for that but there have been some cases of us doing some kind of activity in Mexico like for example when they went off the chapel's man when they got him and there's a big shootout no they've got in the first time I see without shots fired and and then he went to prison and escaped that one escaped from where he's escaped more than once really escaped twice yeah did he get helicoptered out once know the happy prison is happy and heading yeah which is crazy yeah he had the one tunnel escape with the electric bike yeah which is crazy yeah yeah the one he went to the John and went to the bathroom step behind the door and he's gone that was insane it was really weird when I went to New York right now seeing him in the court in New York like seeing him in the flesh after all these years covering this stuff and I saw him and it was like I've been to his village before I talked to his mother I stayed the night with his cousin in his village Wow up in the mountains you know seen what's it like up there it's you know quite rugged mountains Sierra Madre it's like you go in a car up and like we were in a 4x4 serious off-road up and down and there's people we're not wandering around they're fully armed left I saw guys like ski mask one guy like camouflage gear camera gear ski mask ak-47 just like or not quad bikes just driving around the area Wow and we went up there with a colleague and a photographer the story for Time magazine and we were up there and drove into the village and I bought a bottle of whiskey thinking to kind of offer to the sort of family remembered sailing his away his a bottle of whiskey - and when we arrived there and he said we could stay at his house and I bought our bottle of whisky so they know his and he said we don't drink in this house with Christians Wow if we drink and and this is nice guy name was like evangelical Christian Wow cousin and he would sit there talking and he'd be like quoting the Bible whoa and come and stuff and who knows like exuse and I'll understand and there's a church it's an evangelical church right there which is supposedly built by chapel but his mother goes to right in front of her house and we sat through a three-hour evangelical service sitting there with you know chapels mum there and all these family members were sitting there and McCartney was said and we've got some friends here because he won't he was basically what he said like you stay with me you know you're my responsibility if someone happens you know I don't have to pay for this right so we're like yeah we're gonna behave ourselves and you know in the village and and he said during the chairs I don't we want to also have up we have somebody from England here and somebody from the US and come out in this in this church ceremony so yeah a really really bizarre scenes up there and there was so bizarre did you talk to them about the contradiction of being an evangelical Christian being involved in essentially a mass murder and drug running operation so I said the cousin is supposedly and he was like a cattle rancher now then exactly you know obviously he's he calls you know he either know how much he might been involved in the past but his his he says he's he's he's a farmer there and the mother Chapo's mother who's 88 was 88 there now is like 89 90 now you know she talks about her son with kind of pride I didn't I didn't push too hard there's a man around and stuff in that pushed too hard in liner but but yeah I mean they this is this is their way of life I mean Aziza so seeing him in the Corps was kind of bizarre seeing in a seeing him right there and in New York who's ridin Brooklyn you know right Aaron Brooks yeah and they bought in all of these crazy characters as a cooperating witnesses they brought in 14 cooperating witnesses on a bunch of other gangs how does it protect those people yeah I mean heavily heavily protected I mean I think I think it was ethically very questionable why they bought a lot those people in and they were they bought in one guy whose nickname is Chiappetta who confessed himself to as many as 150 killings and maybe did a lot more and and he makes a deal likely makes a deal to cooperate against El Chapo so you get into a kind of weird intrigue there mmm about what the government was doing this whole case there's a history that in this country with prosecuting the mob John Gotti and Sammy the bull Gravano who was a admitted murderer and talked about the murder so that he committed and still they allowed him and get free hmm yeah one of his when I hit John got his lawyer with one of the lawyers for a chapel of course yeah and I think or somebody's lawyers there it was a crazy kind of show yeah it was weird it was like in a New York and the show they were putting on there yeah I felt kind of disconnect with the things I've been seeing over the last few years and they didn't really why was it in New York you know they they indict him in a bunch of places and I think they chose New York for the reason they wanted more of a show well I think I think they they bought in a more than 50 witnesses you know through another three months of trial what was his defense so they really try to be of a defense of they wanted to be a defense of how there's a kind of concealment conspiracy of like showing things like fast and furious you mentioned like saying oh how come the government's trafficking guns in cartels and one of the witnesses had before one of the witnesses against him before use this weird defense called public authority saying he had permission from the United States government to traffic drug so basically saying there's a kind of conspiracy involving the Mexican government's totally corrupt and working with cartels hmm the US government is corrupt and working cartels and having various agencies I know chapo is kind of a fool guy that they're putting this blame on hmm now that didn't really the gut the US prosecutors shut that down and the judge they just said you can't talk about this stuff you can't say that so when Fast and Furious came up they said no you can't talk about it you can't talk about we couldn't talk about it in a court well that's ethically ambiguous like that's a real thing that happened yeah so these he can't talk about it and then the defense tried a bit well they had a audios of the earth chat bonus he'll already know how you know it's him and is he really the main guy in Sinaloa cartel now there is was well very possibly he's not the top gardeners in our hotel there might well be another guy miles and bother who's rooted the number one and he might be more of an emblematic figure but for some reason El Chapo became the most famous in the world and so this other guys he's still free he's still free what is his name again my OHS and bother and where's he in somewhere in mind it's a Mexican throw is in the mountains often I mean what are these weird things you think like if you're drug lord and you've got all of the money you know you've got millions billions they say let's say hundreds of millions they only exaggerate how much money some of these guys have individually but then you could go anywhere in the world you think you could go somewhere out but these guys tend to be in places they're there they're there people like some of these people are people who are very educated I'm a little chapel who's was a kid he was carrying sacks full of oranges to sell almost no education and they start handling hundred the billions of dollars that dealing with a billion dollar international business and they've got the capacity to understand and deal with that but at the same time they're still really hyper local mmm in some ways they're still like people who they understand their world they understand it from their environment to control them become masters in their environment to become kind of powerful in in that place Nord in that place but you know they couldn't know the idea of them going to like sitting in Italy in a cafe and kind of run it from there they don't it's gonna be on there we'd have to be there near the business cuz otherwise someone will just take it over right yeah yeah yeah yeah how we have to run that thing with an iron fist yeah I mean you could think they'd or maybe like yeah I guess so you get your Christian cousin you want rip you off yeah so how much money do you need to make right all right hey can you get out maybe when it again with corruption I mean there's the issue of like a lot of police in Mexico poor so that's why they take deals but there's an ex-governor called Thomas Addington who I met a few years ago when he was governor of Tamaulipas state and again he was not only taking money from drug traffickers after he left being govern he going to drug trafficking himself and it's like you think well once you've made a couple of million right do you need to make an R ten million but then again the same with with I don't understand business will be dance which it was that incentive why do they think they always want to make more money I don't know I mean we were talking about that recently with Jeff Bezos when we found out even has a hundred and fifty billion dollars like when do you just say we're good we're good I mean I don't know I I think it becomes it's a game more than it is anything else like there might as well be playing Parcheesi or monopoly or what are they're trying to win you know they're trying to constantly win and also you have an obligation because you're a CEO of this company so you you're running this enormous business that's earning money for all these other people as well it's all very complicated though that it has to do with a lot of psychological factors where people can't put things into perspective and they get caught up in the race mmm yeah yeah drug traffickers are thinking that same thing yeah because when they're making I mean also they like like you know people have explained to me involved in this world they make a lot of money but they spend a lot of money oh yeah why these numbers of wrong with chapo they they said I'm he's worth 14 billion dollars that's what the US government said in that case he's worth 14 billion but then he's you know he was paid to me you know 14 billion is when you take the value of drugs you're saying he he trafficked and you're hiding the happiness 14 billion dollars worth but really all the time you're paying back suppliers you're paying people off your own money and you know and you know you're buying Hippos and yet gold-covered rolls-royce's yeah listen though some of that I think you know some of that was my been exaggerated with him he had a lot of kind of more like middle-class houses oh yeah I went to one of the last the last hideout he was courting it was more like a middle class it was a normal haha a house but you have a lot of those what the fuck happened with Sean Penn yeah why was Sean Penn up there talking to him that was so strange yeah the photograph of Sean Penn shaking hands and then Conor McGregor wore that same shirt and he was but he was gonna fight Eddie Alvarez I believe it was mmm yeah what was that about why was Sean Penn visiting him here bizarre moment I mean you have a a an actor who's played gangsters areas right there yeah an actor who's played gangsters with a gangster who they're having in a movies made about him and there was a woman that Sean Penn knew that hooked this all up reveal that she's a famous Mexican actress yeah yeah yeah so so the store whole story start there she is yeah look at them all piling around hey me with a murder so this nice to be married to Madonna the story spider Kate the Castillo you see there mmm she was an actress in a TV series about drug traffickers which have now become a huge deal in that America hmm they could like telenovelas means like soap operas kind of thing series TV series and the whole bites they made about drug traffickers which are really popular and Seussian one called Lorena del Sur the queen of the south and in that she played this drug trafficker and afterwards in some kind of weird moment afterwards I think she was like really into her role and stuff she came out with this message she wrote saying you know Mexico since such a tragic situation in Mexico you know why don't they come in a drug traffickers common like traffic with love I trust you more than I do the government which these are kind of sentiments that some people have but it now it was kind of a strange thing kind of be able to out there thing for a for a TV star to say mmm and then chapo el chapo apparently became kind of enamored with her seeing her on TV and they started kind of communication now Sean Penn then got involved in this and was like I'm gonna go there as well and we can talk about the idea you know the 10th of the meeting was as well talking about making of movie or TV series of his Gouri hmm Chapel giving the rights to Kate the Castillo and Sean Penn was kind of involved in this somehow now Sean Penn has a bit of discussion not now that Sean Penn and Kate the Castillo fell out over this they have different versions of what happened there but now Sean Penn decided to go and write this story for Rolling Stone about hard experience yeah so they went then and this meeting was arranged and they went up to the mountains and when that photo was taken and ie that point it he didn't actually give an interview to Sean Penn but they had a dinner and had a meeting up in the mountains and and then left and then they were meant to afterwards there was then a big attempt to hit Chapel but he escaped so that's when some people say that the Mexican government had followed them and you know used their their tres to try and get to a chapel hmm but he did escape he almost got caught close to there quite soon after us but escaped it makes sense I mean how else would Sean Penn be able to slide through he's a famous actor I bet he doesn't even speak Spanish yeah II think it does I mean I don't know if so if he was followed I'm not saying that he was um in any case in any way deliberately no I'm leading them there but it's something that I think about all the time I think about okay if I'm gonna meet criminals am I being followed well and am I gonna lead you know what's my connection with lauren force much conversing with criminals it's a very difficult thing that I've been balancing and thinking about for long years so anyway the chapo escapes and then said he couldn't meet up again for the interview because he was it was too hot for him so they made this video interview where he was sent some questions and he videoed himself answering the questions hmm which is kind of interesting was the first kind of statement he made and he said I know various things I've been doing it since I was 15 he didn't really give much away and then he was caught and when he was caught they were like we've got to move the stories and then the story came out like bang after he was caught in early 2016 so it had to have some sort of an impact and catching him must've I mean it's possible it makes sense yeah it's possible I mean chap I think was pretty you know he'd already been caught before he was caught in 2014 was imprison escaped in 2015 through that tunnel and then was caught again in 2016 so yeah I mean maybe it had an impact on you know I don't know but they were looking for him yeah they were looking for him and they simply seem to have lost a lot of its protection you know he before in I got Mike a few years I know he had enormous protection you know and there's mountains I mean in the village you see there's a house above like there's kind of main clearing where his mother's compound is I know it's a pretty basic still that village then our up from there you see a house on a hill and apparent a swell Chapel for a long time he's are going to stay in their house you know anyone is in the run in the past he had so much protection anytime the military will come close or the
