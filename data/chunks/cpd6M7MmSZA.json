hello freak bitches yeah I'm going to quote sindbad sindbad you got I loved I love this quote he goes Matt Lee is a very nice guy he was great he's in my pocket Tony Hinchcliffe says he's awesome talk about leaving your body astral projection Sinbad does it he actually projects the astral project how does he do that he stopped doing well there's all these techniques there's books and stuff about it the long and the short is you get into a trance and you imagine a rope above me they're kind of like pushing up now or what he did I actually remember he was like I put something just out of my reach and then you're trying as you're laying there with your eyes closed kind of meditating trying to reach the thing and then he said he felt his hand wrap around and that's how he knew he had left his body whoa and he did it for months and months and months and months and then one day he said he was like in was weird places in the cave some like shadow creature came up hit him in the chest I know this is Sinbad remember and he goes and it felt like someone had cracked me in the chest with a sledgehammer he's like I never did it again whoa and I was like really you gotta go back try and find like booby island or something maybe he's right so maybe he's ready to be snatched up by the demons and stranger things it was next to mentioned demon that was in the wall it is scary if you read journeys out of the body or far journeys Robert Monroe in the fifties it was like you read this book and he's still called black people Negroes nobody can tell it's an old old book but he's telling that's how old the stuff is it goes way back he would tell stories about like seeing something fly by and being very concerned that that thing was trying to get into his body but more needed so it's kind of a scary thing but it's one of those things so I was under the impression that people did die yeah when most people are under that impression I've had spoke you know given talks at medical schools and stuff and all these doctors think that everyone died at 35 a 35 year old was old and they're like and it works its way into medicine where they're like okay look the reason you have chronic back pain is that the human body was not evolved to live beyond 35 and so of course you have wear and tear and things like that's totally false the human bodies evolved to live into the 70s so it's a statistical thing it's like if Bill Gates moves into your neighborhood suddenly everyone's average annual salary is hundreds of millions revived so if you count all these infants who died in prehistory many of them by the way died from infanticide like twins normally are not allowed to survive but the weaker one is left in the woods to die what yeah any sort of deform and mal formality you leave in the woods by themselves yeah what cool way to handle it yeah whoo that dark man they would leave him to wolves that's fucked up man yeah leave your baby in a basket and run away yeah yeah there's a lot of a lot of fans aside but you know in our were a lot of it huh yeah well just because the times were harder than and it was more accepted that you were going to have to do some terrible things that you didn't want to do well it's just it you know if the kids born physically fucked up in some way you know you're not going to that you're not gonna have the resources and that kids not gonna the persons not going to grow up to contribute to the group and so generally and also there's a different sense of life and death right you know I think where death is much more a daily presence it's not that big a deal so we're all going to die there I was reading about a tribe in the Amazon I can't remember the name of the tribe but when someone gets too old to keep up with the group someone is chosen randomly like they have a lottery or pick the shortest straw or whatever it is and their job is to come up behind this old person and hit them in the back of the head with a hatchet oh boy right and no one wants to do it it really sucks but everyone agrees it has to be done and it's the least cruel option that they've come up you got to be real careful to do to keep signing up for that job exactly you got it me I got it with a hatchet my full-time photo op I Joe you've killed nine old ladies they this bitch is gone over okay we just let her stop moving yes weird man a weird gig Kenton's wife tends to look at me like that is the source of looseness right there that's single man with a bang -
