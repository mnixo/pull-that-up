the gyro gun experience yeah you know homelands a good show well actually know how but I gave up after lost you did until you just don't want element I don't watch anything the show and Daniel through your flat marina Elvis the TV I only watch watch mmm it's not a good thing it's not fatty virtue I'll watch Bigfoot hunter and watch fucking two episodes I had DVR there's I know cold foot hunter Finding Bigfoot or something and it's like a series where they have like more than one else the first episode that be like yeah we're not gonna find them no the best part about it is the beginning the guys I've been hunting sasquatches for 25 years Laurel quit now quit quit now you haven't even got a video of one and crazy ass though it's like you know it's like hey you know those ghost shows are really not realistic like they yeah I really find a ghost this was what's next like chupacabra sure if they can sell it they would they would have it it's it's a fun show to watch though because it's so stupid I mean first of all everyone has a video that they want you to analyze that may have been a sasquatch so they have to recreate the scene in the video it looks sweet it looks so silly because the people knew exactly where the car was and this is the tree and so they line it up on the camera and they have this big guy named Bobo who kind of looks like a Bigfoot and he goes out there and he does exactly what he's always way bigger than the Bigfoot in the video so it always proves that it wasn't really that's not as resolute right now oh I see here you were Bigfoot yep I was Bigfoot season 1 season 2 they replaced me there was like a contractor more apathetic and Harry and the Hendersons like a whole family lived with Bigfoot you know why not my kids I'm pretty sure I don't even trust dogs that I don't know this guy's got a fucking Bigfoot hanging out he probably told these stupid humans a thing or two about love oh yeah Harry and the Henderson there's never been a real good Bigfoot movie how about that nobody's ever stepped up and it's not like the bars been set back the bar is incredibly low the bar is all fraudulent videos yeah that's the closest thing to a Bigfoot movie and I would think after like season one there's a lot of people that watch the show like why not I think you should sameen it was like this is a really bad ones the 70s or some Swamp Thing monster guy yeah but there's never been a movie a good movie about a bunch of people that encounter Bigfoot how is it possible that you have such a folklore that is completely permeated Society he's never made a not sexy bit made a movie about Finding Bigfoot that's amazing that's true that's incredible really when you think about how popular it is is a you know V would be humor the movie ideas they're doing there yes okay it's like based on a matchbook yeah like so you'd think they'd have big photo magic comedies when you you know here's some romantic comedy premise you like what they finally meet again 60 you know I sometimes feel like I just established consciousness when I was like thirty because like romantic comedies like I you know I was so dumb I think at my 20s that like when you know it would be like you know meg Ryan and Billy Crystal you know like Harry Met Sally like to me that was just a movie I didn't consider that a romantic comedy which it was but now it's like this genre that is always existed but they just kind of like just churn out these just like those didn't exist before amantha you know it existed movies were when a woman got mouthy the man gave her the back of her hand yep back of his hand right yes that's what they used to do to the moon Alice yeah yeah all that stuff those were the good old days Billy Christian fucked us Billy Crystal fucked up fucked us and he tried to be he tried to be manly they tried to like be the best oh that sample of and then he caved never sleep doesn't see I see When Harry Met Sally Harry Met Sally is like it's like a sad ending to you you're like you know what it's weird you know you're the comedy policeman no I'm not you want you call me that before the improv when I told you that I'm very uncomfortable that makes you uncomfortable not really but I only I look I hate what I'm not enjoying step in for one piece of civil unrest that's something I've never done anything since well there's something about that whole situation with Leno and I don't know Jay at all and but it's you know if there was a Joe Rogan of that generation maybe to go and explain it that's why you that's our new show you look for Bigfoot and you know comedy kind of
