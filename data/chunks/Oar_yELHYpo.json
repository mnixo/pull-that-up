the girag an experience you know blizzard in world of warcraft i don't know the exact numbers but they had released a pet whereas it was like 25 actual dollars or something like that and their servers wound up getting crashed and people lining up to buy it just for like one little pet that's how that's what they figured out how to do is make it so that the more you play the game the better you get the better your life is the more successful you are the more powerful you are the better the experience is the more you have control over the people in the game and that's like the really trippy thing it's like it's a time thing they like locked you in like it's it's like it's a it's a show that you're totally hooked on and it never ends I mean it keeps getting crazier making new people and they add any any Blizzard mark my words has created this mold that's so many other people in the position gonna follow we got this uh this thing in the new gears and we have a calendar it's like you play Gears and it's like oh hey you know don't trade in your game cuz in two weeks there's like ticker tuesday or triple XP thursdays right and then your friends are playing on that same day and you want to keep going right and maybe there's like a psychology trick there we're like you know you don't sell the game because you're thinking there might be something coming up right we're Dungeon Master's and we're always like manipulating that experience online Avenue should happen yeah it's kind of crazy that just keeps going though but do this I mean how ever did all the average person have over their life right so a little world where you could start gaining that control yeah I say the biggest problem is like when you're young is figuring out what you want to do when you grow up right like that thankfully I was lucky and I saw game sounds like boom that right but so I've talked to kids are like I'm going to school and I don't know what I want to do it's like to pick something and be surgical about it and decide you're gonna be the best at that well yeah but the problem is finding something for a lot of kids the real issue is finding something then you got lucky I got lucky a lot of people did but it's like it's very difficult to find the thing that you're into you don't want to like say oh it's gonna be this and then you're doing it and then halfway know you like this fucking blog so it's difficult to do the other thing is it's like a screen asking it especially the young age when you don't know you hardly know a lot about what's going on in the world around you but at the same time that opportunity now with the Internet is greater than ever mm-hmm right like you could shoot a viral video you could start a podcast you could do anything and if you start looking better and better out he could build community right if that's what you want to do but what if you want to be a carpenter or what if you want to be a painter you know there's so many for kids the hardest thing is finding the thing finding whatever the fuck it is like you know most kids don't get enough exposure to interesting ideas between the schoolwork when you when you go to school when you think about we got to do you got to get up at fucking 7 o'clock in the morning you got to leave catch the bus with a bunch of other douchebags do a bunch of shit that sucks all day listen to a bunch of people tell you're never gonna make anything out of your life unless you pay attention to them you know like listen bitch you're teaching school I know you don't make any money shut the fuck but don't you love it well life is so great when you're a kid like oh you know yeah it's bullets but it sucked so to find something that you truly love in the midst of all this like programming is what school is no more than programming it is education there is information that you're gonna download you're gonna remember it but the reality of what it is is getting you programmed to get used to doing things you don't want to do listening to people that you don't want to hear you're a people you don't know there's a buzzer but being wise there have to be a buzzer stupid was it so important that we fucking leave at a certain time get there at a certain time you're turning me into a robot you know you're turning me into some worker asshole that just goes and does the same goddamn thing every day providing order for a certain mind that might otherwise use of a default again there's ways to educators like my favorite hobby is if I'm out with friends and I was out in San Francisco with a buddy and he had a date who is this a public school teacher at any time I find one of my Poehler so I'm like c'mere c'mere lemme buy you a drink and we'll just sit there and pick their brain for like an hour about my uncles in public school teachers II have horror stories oh of course right teaches in New Jersey yeah like so you know the like classes that are huge like kids who are young like super young hooking up bathrooms have to call child services it's a horror story oh yeah well you know they're all doing crazy shit now too because the internet you know you hear like 13-year olds they're talking about you know making out with other girls there's no girls making out with girls when I was 13 that shit never took place now they're all doing it you know that was I was 13 I knew a lot of 13 year-olds dude and none of them were making out with each other everybody would say they were gonna do something and you never knew were quite what it was right and there is this kind of like adult conspiracy to keep like pornography away from me or things like that you had to go in the woods and find porn we've talked about this a hundred times in the park finding finding poorly fluids yeah it's so funny everyone's got the gun every same story everybody it was incredible day before so you already stuff we didn't bring this up to you and everyone has the same goddamn story and the wood we shine a magazine you shouldn't make an adult bookstore in the woods it probably the most successful is just don't even tell have any signs when I found it woods there's like a Johnny porno see it looks like ron jeremy know gone going through the giant sack of porn and it's like so here's yeah cherry yeah yes okay it's not playboy it's the dirtiest shit you could find was the bad stuff weaker up with though your dogs there we go it was always penthouse with a lot of water damage it's always the girls like that the Sarlacc pit down there it was horrible right your young impressionable mine is like oh my god I'm supposed to think this is hot what is going on here it's terrifying yeah but I think of a button you can see two girls one cup yeah yeah we've talked about this before about how crazy it is how how close all this stuff is yeah like someone continued a Twitter link and you click on it and just get to be the most horrible thing in mark my words if I ever have children and it like they were not gonna get a cell phone until they're maybe 13 yeah but you know what the worst thing you want to have is an uninformed kid true when all the other kids talk to them and and just let them be you know in the same flow as everybody else just let them know what the fuck is going on well yeah but there's line set basis there right yeah yeah it's look you know there's an old expression the kids are gonna be alright you know and there they are they're gonna be alright they're gonna be fine just like we're fine we're worried about them you know and I have little daughters and logically you know I can say this and of course you know paternally I just want to protect them and nerf the fucking world and all that but I understand where that's coming from these kids are gonna be fine they're growing up with other human beings some extent you want them to to make their own mistakes right I've known parents yes Pat the house up too much and it's like let him fall over once in a while let him learn how balance rightly well yeah but you know you gotta be careful you don't want to mean kids died you know their fault yeah don't have a coal stove in the middle of the living room yeah but I mean if you have hard floors you know like I have marble floors it's kind of tricky you know you're gonna you gotta watch them but but that's not the point the point is you know but these they're growing up with other people and I think P things always get better and even though it seems like shits worse you know it seems like shits worse as far as like the economy and all this craziness as far as invasion of privacy and you know and the the you know the access to information that we have and there inundated with images and videos and all the shit that we didn't see until we were well mature they're gonna be fine they're just this is how they grow up now this is just how it is and we're just the old people that are just like our parents like you know kids these days look at them game video games the same thing it's just we're like we're like kids these days with their fuckin ass to mouth porn you know they get ass to mouth porn on their fucking iPhone well that's just what it is it's just yeah this is the new world and the world constantly keeps getting more and more complex world of a stomates it's the world is always getting more and more fucked up it's always getting more complicated more straight as long as our where is it going to the zombie apocalypse well I think it's always look I think as long as there's freedom of information the way we're expressing each other right now and communicating with each other people gonna be able to figure out things quicker you know and I think kids are gonna be able to figure out this multifaceted fucked up chaotic world far quicker than some fucking doofus from 1963 yeah they take some kid from 1963 you could talk him in anything they didn't know shit ya know today kids are gonna be more savvy more aware more nobody to ask anybody anything anymore Yeah right I find it right no Wozniak was complaining about this actually he was there was Steve Wozniak when the creators of Apple was doing an interview where he site saying back in my day you know you had a if you had a question you had to find a smart person and ask him well that's dumb why wouldn't why are you complaining about that there's not that many fucking smart people yeah but I got a seek out one dude that's retarded I have to go and talk to the professor that's why they're so goddamn arrogant bout their estimation think about the Mayans right they used to control them by the you know the all the cool priests you know figured out science and figured out you know how the you know the lunar cycles and how everything would turn out and nothing ever was like wow how do they know this it must be magic or like huh we're controlling this through knowledge right yeah well there's yeah now every two before the Library of Alexandria burned down they had I mean that was the idea as well they kept all the knowledge they and all this information about all sorts of different things that though the lay person was unaware of so everybody can get it Google bitch damn you wheeze to have to seek out a Tim Sweeney or John Carmack Yeah right and hang on to the dried up up to the jaw that's true now there's just fucking a computer connection to the Internet and all your questions answered it's not always true dude not oh that's the thing is I but it's getting there it really is closer and closer it's getting to the point there's a lot of disinformation but there's also a lot of information there's a lot of good information and I think that's good because I think it developed it just like we need to be able to discern between bullshit and reality in the real world you need to be able to discern between bullshit and reality online yeah and people will sort it all out and figure it out you know if you know there's a lot of people that have there's a lot of urban myths about all sorts of different things you know if you drink a coke and take you know you know fucking this with it you'll die you know I mean how many different stories have we ever heard yeah well then just go climb pop rocks going up yes that's right that's what it was it was Mikey from the life cereal commercial died his stomach explodes right yeah where was the urban legend about the girl stuck a hot dog in her pussy and then they had to go to the hospital you never heard that I didn't hear that one that was the other one there and maggots were starting coming out of her ass know that then there's the one about the lobster the right year that one right what was that one the girl apparently to exhaustion one this Lobster put it in her and then like lit a match to make its tail flip around turns out the lobster had like like planted a bunch of eggs in her and then three weeks later she died I was like yeah yeah I can slowly see that some disgusting girl with shit breath telling me that story it really seems like life is going towards like the having a matrix bubble where you live in a bubble and your whole life is like you're such a whore she took this lobster she's talking in a pussy right Oh fire yeah it was a little fire and a fucking lobster just dropped all his eggs in a snatch it was a lobster fest into fucking lobsters Acron of a pussy what a whore
