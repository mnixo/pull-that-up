ha here we are my my you a shooter well dude my ears are covered for the second time today I'm just gonna say that and I'm a I'm a ask me like they and asked me if would you go you a shooter that's funny I'm Italian hopper I'm a tactical shooter bro I'm a tactically so he ever done we did we went to Terran tactical today and yeah Bryan Callen learned the ins and outs learn how to lean forward had some Navy SEAL instruction as well no hold the post Whaler yeah how'd you feel I love it fun right I've been doing it in my head forever in your head doesn't really work first I've rehearsed killing a gang many times people surround and Shore lean and geeky wait I go like this why don't you shoot him in the knee and rehabilitate him that's a good idea because they don't have knee targets if they had just a bunch of tiny targets on the ground well I hit I don't like cuz I'm like what am i shooting B I was gonna say they're the size of a toddler yeah that's weird I'm like alright so I gotta kill the toddler with one shot kid with a missile yeah I was pretty accurate with that that's kind of sick but um yeah that's a good idea I could either waste them or wing them i wing them and then take them in and it's teach them the error of their ways yeah at the end they'll be loyal to you I tossed them an herbal an herbal remedy an herbal wrap like Steven Seagal had and that one movie was in a coma oh yes he was kicking his ass a couple days later I don't care everybody says that shit was factual would you remember that movie very well no no you're way out of line well above laws the first movie yeah this was deep he's in his comic what killing the property got a nurse yeah he already on fat by this time he had yeah yeah that's where he ran terribly he always runs terrible yeah but in the early movies he was skinny and above the law he was skinny yeah but then by the time he got to this other movie where he's in a coma forever like okay his fingers moving he's waking up okay look Oh sexy or wasn't too fat now wasn't too fat he looks great there but he'd already you know started to filling his hair and so then he was in a coma forever and then gets out of the coma remember starts doing all sorts of Chinese herbs and shit become about how see he was pretty skiing yeah he was so this early in the career yeah he heals himself I would that I would do I would throw them an herbal wrap and tell them how to wrap it and then say training begins tomorrow at dawn and then you wake them up yeah hey man fuck you fuck you man fuck you and I'd be on horseback for no reason really Jose why do you because there's something very masculine you have where you're on a horse it's my entire act it's my eye I just had this there are couple things I want to do before I die one is to toss somebody an herbal wrap and say training begins tomorrow or be there tomorrow and I want to rehabilitate at-risk youth but they're like 20 and then I want to rear up on a horse mmm we're up on a horse but I want to appear out of nowhere rear up on a horse and rescue a group of women in the wilderness a group of women in the Wilden was a in the wilderness for they got lost with the hikers they were there plane went down nobody got hurt but it skidded along the collision like they said we can't find them it's impenetrable it's impenetrable then I go fetch fetch me fetch the man Panther the man yeah you should have do you know about this guy his name is dick Pro Nicky and he was a guy who lived in Alaska by himself in a cabin that he built for decades yeah and he moved out there when he's 50 years old he got tired of life and just the way everything was the fast pace of modern life so this guy decided this guy amazing videos on YouTube this guy built his own house out there in Alaska fashioned it out of logs there's like a video of him doing the whole thing filmed everything filmed all of his interactions with animals mmm birds would come and land on his hand and he would really him oh yeah yeah he was you he literally is you splittin stoic yeah by himself and wrote you know me stoic and real solitary and you know real measured with his words of course and everything you wanna be and he would sit and every night he would write and he would write about his experiences and the the deep satisfaction that he got off of living that kind of a life right does it amaze some amazing videos pop one of the videos he could watch how this guy's living his life out there but you know he would only see people like once or twice a year or when they would drop off goods and things that he needed hmm but this guy was you know he wasn't a spring chicken he moved out there when he was in his 50s Wow yeah when was this I want to say he had some ways back cuz back with his brother I want to say in the early 2000s somewhere around that that looks like 16 millimeter film that yes yeah oh dude he lived out there for decades like I said yeah by himself got I know your shit to be out there by yourself uh-huh well I think most of it he learned once he got there and he talked about it he talked about what the experience was like about just you know learning how fatiguing is to hike oh yeah learning how fatiguing it is to gather up your own firewood and he made most of his own tools are right there he's making a mallet himself a drill drills a hole in it with a hand auger and then he makes his own peg and he only brought in tools to make tools and the big tools like that he made all of himself that's amazing and what did he live on just deer meat I mean yeah elk meat deer meat berries he got some oatmeal and stuff you know some dry goods that would he would get in large he's coming in touch-based periodical they would come to him people would fly out to him with goods but I mean he built all this shit by himself he built his whole cabin by himself and he documented every step of the way amazing his name is printed p ro e n n e ke dick prenta key alone in the wilderness is the whole series on YouTube and he's on the side of a lake with this this cabin that he built living off of animals that he hunted in firewood and you know whatever food that he gathered I'm obsessed with this now I got this Corona thing caught me with my pants down yeah I want here's what I want I want a I want a substantial cabin made of thick logs or stone and then I want it near a lake or a water source maybe preferably a well yeah then I can irrigate my own crops you can have crops how much chicken I need chickens really only need a garden you don't need cries I asked you I need a garden was it just you yes well it might be me and my several several of lady friends my lady friends because I'm going to start my own colony so I have to breed mmm you understand okay I need I need a lot of hair and beard dye because I want to stay looking young what if they go up with something that reverses you an age now you're talking my language how old David Sinclair will actually have a cabin on the side he'd be right next to you do an experiment I'm gonna have his fucking lab and I'm gonna be a skinny pig yeah you'd be the guy yeah David come out come on out and I'm just gonna Tyson Tyson with all the girls he'd come Wow he's not into that he's a married man leave him alone all right but he'd like to come out to staying out and pal round for a few days he's a fun guy he seems like a good guy he's a great guy yeah and he's brilliant and he's brilliant in the field that's very important he's what do you mean you're getting old that's right yeah that's right you want to be dick brenneke we had to escape your your wilderness again again I there are couple things one more thing I want to do is I want to split with my shirt off while I have women watch me through the window of my log cabin as they're baking me a pie and I know this is a chauvinistic fantasy it sounds like it don't worry you sound like a real piece of shit and the other thing I want to do before I die is I want to have a horse I'm so attached to that I can go and and then it just shows up Oh so sort of like Brad Pitt's pit bull and once upon a time in Hollywood correct I'd kill for one of those that pit bull was bad was fucking great that thing just fucking got me they knew what to do when to do it yeah yeah they don't use the cops I heard don't use Mastiffs even while I was gonna do - no let go yeah they don't like to let go yeah then you got a major lawsuit on hand you can't bite your fucking hand well I was watching a fucking video of a guy in San Diego who got arrested by these cops and cops couldn't get the German Shepherd off his arm did German Shepherds clamp down this guy's forum this guy screaming and they're pulling on the dog and the dogs pulling on them he took the dog you don't pull him bro they were a ninja shit and choking the dog apparently they thought this guy was a bad person and they were letting this dog chew this guy's arm up and you get permanent nerve damage devastating to the tissue in your for I've seen video of it where I saw I said the cops showed it to me I said why didn't that guy was this giant a wall him on a wall just giant he used to be a special forces guy and he just went crazy and they let that dog loose on they had two cops and he was fighting off they let this dis wolf this fuckin wolf loose and grab the dude on the top of his army of huge arms like Brendan Schaub like big arms grab grabbed the guy and the guy just I in the middle of his craze he looked at the dog and then just went dead he froze and went down and I said why isn't he punching he goes because you shut down because when he bit that arm that arm went numb you can't use that arm well double hane oh the excruciating pain a German Shepherd biting in your arm yeah oh not good or real wolf well that's now you can train them now you get yourself a problem of course they're not interested in listening they're not as serious I'm getting a wolf to attack I'll tell you who's not hearing a fucking peep out of a wolf and I'm talking about a timber wolf not a peep who is mr. mountain lion okay mister that works mountain lions versus a wall I'll tell you how exactly how ready yeah the wolf dies really that's right has you ever seen it that there's a video of it first of all really yep hmm now that is back by the way wolf cries get over at mountain lion gets under that under the old jaw line Oh get the net yeah and by the way God is and holds on with those claws that's right they have claws yeah and it's more athletic it's 150 pound hundred and forty pound hundred thirty pound pound line good luck with that and there's they fight so low they don't need a bunch of pussies and they come yellow they go fucking low like a lion there's no and there's no sound there's a great video of water buffalo charging a lion a male lion and the male line literally waits until the water buffalos closing the distance and then ducks under and grabs ahold of it by the neck and just hangs on yeah Wow actually it might not have been a water buffalo it might have been something else like oh he's a cow some some other rugged animal he's a rugged animal yeah I forget what animal was but the animal makes a rush at the lion like hey fuck you and the Lions like no fuck you thunder and one of the problems when you have a game reserve is that if you have a pride of lions you are gonna pay so much money keeping that that reserve stocked because a pride of lions goes through you know crazy amounts of meat every single day every other day so they will decimate they'll go through a whole heart of buffalo well that was an issue after the dentist the dentist shot that lion with a name yeah remember that last season it's he so and then do you know that they were worried that Cecil's brother Jericho was killed but no worries it was a line that didn't have a name so we're being serious about that living serious there was a real concern that Cecil's brother Jericho had also been killed it turned out not to be true like it's the real Lion King anyway when when they killed that lion when that dentist killed that lyin well they then after that had this this thing this international outcry nobody wanted to go there and hunt lions cuz they didn't want to be the next guy that gets targeted but like that dentist so because of that they had a slaughter a large number of lions I'm sure finally all the do people who don't have any idea what it is to sustain it's just the number was crazy was something like I remember was 50 or 500 yeah but it's like they had to kill them and instead of getting $50,000 per lion like they're accustomed to getting when people because they have all these lines the lions are decimated the undulate population of course is no one was killing the Lions anymore it's like elephants so now with elephants you can't move a one like a member of the herd or two members who elephants have to be moved as a herd otherwise they go nuts right so there they're the females rule the roost but you can't just take like three elephants from that herd and then move them over to the game you gotta take them all otherwise they really get fucked up yeah they love each other they love each other yeah but then also when you call elephants which you have to do in Kruger National Park and things like that well then because they get too destructive they just get too many of them and they just wait lay waste to the vegetation it just becomes the imbalance so the problem is that they're like you can't shoot them from helicopters anymore obscure because you know that's and they would kill the whole herd because you can't just kill a couple right because they go nuts and then I can't do anything with the ivory because ivory trade is illegal correct so then they store that so then you make you jack up the price of ivory which they do the same thing with rhino horn but but so what now they try to do is they try to sterilize the females right they'll try to oh good luck with that that's a lot of fun yeah that's really difficult to do as well you know they're trying to do that in the Hamptons they're trying to do that with deer they're trying to give the female deer birth control just talk and shoot dead loads into them yeah go ahead and shoot the deer oh well that's what they should do yeah yeah I mean but they didn't they decided for whatever goofy reason that what they were gonna do is try to give them birth control and they were gonna spend countless amounts of dollars to get birth control into deer like how are you gonna cat what are you gonna do you know how many there are I quit apparently it's they're infested out there well after watching Tiger King what is your take on keeping Tigers as pets it's ridiculous first of all I only watched one half of one episode I had a pause I had a pause Jamie and I were getting nad IV drips which is pretty fucking amazing what does nad that's the stuff that David Sinclair was talking about well let's get it dry on the O'Brien might be a little cheap it's expensive yeah yeah Costco pretty penny I want to live forever okay what what are you after words okay I don't know I've done too and I feel pretty good you feel any different Jamie pretty good around inside yeah but it feels like the second one really took it over the top what does it do you want I have more energy I feel like really vibrant I feel great but well this is hard to tell yeah what does that mean I don't know I'm sleeping eight hours a day I'm staying at home with my family Road you know I mean it's like how much sure this is it but apparently scientifically it's provable right lengthens your telomeres actually decreases your biological age wow it's been proven David Sinclair said that nad HGH and there was one other DHEA those three things in combination have referred you to reverse your biological yeah crazy so we're try this shit's going down I want to keep my immune system at fuckin tip-top Magoo as Joey Diaz would say [Laughter] ever but it's just one of those things where there's you know there's a few different scientific advances that they can absolutely show that will decrease your biological age and show that there's an increase in your vitality your ability to recover all these different things yeah so I'm getting them all well then the tiger came back to that but yeah you know you had 227 Tigers as pets they live in a fucking cage yeah and and and then he had chimps chimps should never be kept an occasional anybody says yeah I said certain things I just don't think should be if you're if it's a professional zoo like San Diego and they haven't at ìgreat minutes disturb but at least kids get to see them it educates you know the general population but when you've got 10,000 Tigers as pets you know I don't know my bit from triggered from 2016 I loved your old original tiger tiger quit his bits ever I know you didn't make the argument for two tigers fucking was one of the greatest bits ever you should do it you shouldn't do that fucking bed dude it's on I don't think that that is crazy you should do that bit you should revive that bit and you should you should tape it and you should put it out there it's let me say it again I've been I know comedy doing this long time it is top three bits of all time that's very nice of you but it's um I think it's might be on an audio record God it was my it was the first time I saw I'm gonna be dead someday if that bit gets destroyed in the audio you've got to see them fucking visual you have to see the visual dude when you're making the noises that was the first bit that I ever did where I realize like you have to kind of become the thing yeah like you got to become the thing like I would make noise as I try to be me still but then I realized oh I just got to become like a tiger fucking that's what I love about certain bits like for me I I do this thing about having an abusive father who was a piano teacher don't ask and I talk about his mustache mustache would belong the bristles was so thick they belonged on the back of a boar never a man's nose and I go in this whole character and I love to lose myself into that character or when I do that that English that English supervillain yes like I just fucking like it's so fun to get lost in that character because you could think like that person like that must be the appeal of like a guy like a Daniel day-lewis or of course you know someone who can really encapsulate em you know they do something where they become that yeah they become that yeah yeah they're not you know and some people never do that they're just always acting like oh here's that guy acting in a movie I know who he is yeah they're he's acting and then some people just become Jeffrey Tambor who's one bunch of enemies for you know trans paranoia he said that he for him it was about shoes he'd have to figure out what kind of shoes like he'd have to feel it first in his feet which makes sense Wow like when you wear sneakers and or you wear leather soles shoes you feel different you're not a secure and leather sole shoes you you won't have to become more formal when your toes are pushed together you know when you're constrained like that it's a weird thing to think but it does change you yeah you can't even move good now sold shoes they're slippery correct so that's what you see people I can tell a lot about somebody by their Footwear if there were in sandals typically I can tell you what their political those are those are those are dad sneakers I don't give a fuck game over and I do what I want so rubies are know jack-shit no I like trail run what they are what are they their trail run these are Solomon's they're excellent should speed cross I know all about them examples are these yeah well we were gonna go hunting with Rinella I know all about the subtraction they're awesome it says tread yeah so if you're gonna go up like slippery terrain this gives you grip I'm all wrong trails bro but I'll see you're like I don't care and I'll just wear this is that also there's no shoelaces correct so I go like this I sent some time yep they're gonna put it in here very easy I tuck it in there yeah you know we go to the airport really easy with these on - you know who's never getting caught with us you know who's never getting down nope I'll do it I don't give a fuck where these are were trucks yeah but when I if I'm doing anything in dirt they're like a middle ground between wearing a boot yeah you know like if you're a great eye where I'm hunting sometimes yeah those are I looked at those found yeah a lot of guys in elk hunting in particular because you're so mobile you're constantly chasing these massive herds and you're moving around and going through you have to come hunting yeah never been I'm I need the meat burping to me well I plenty of meat for you I have the meat for you listen you've seen me shoot you see me how my targets not that that hours ago yeah just a couple hours ago you shouldn't like you were born for it not only that I go get down that's how you notice how I said that oh yeah part of your plugs in though oh I was on radio get down also you have a you say things in a in a way that only people around you can hear that's true you don't you have the right amount of projection so the enemy never hears I speak cryptically Eddie stuff any Stanford I did as a podcast and he had me he want to see what kind of a tactical asshole I am watch it you know filling a shirt oh yeah great podcast I love him the best the best and he had me like look at like different movie scenes and break down what was wrong I was wrong off I was completely wrong about everything I thought I thought that when you shot a gun with a suppressor it was like that's pretty loud pretty that you've never shot a gun with a suppressor I have actually in Utah but it's LA I was wearing the earphones so I couldn't but it's nothing like like a rifle no like when we were hunting in Prince of Wales I had that gun with a muzzle break so loud yeah it's a seven millimeter remington ultramatic it's very loud now that's so loud outside a can her they say if you they say if you're too close to that you can damage your ears permanent one hundred percent yeah my one of my friends there was a guy who shot near him shot too close to his ear some he was at he's a guide and this guy apparently like went to swing like the the animal was close by like he's here the animals close by or something something happened was shot really close to his head and blew his ears out now he only has hearing it's Pam yes we're hearing aids cuz your your that rifle that trigger is so sensitive mm-hmm yeah the idea is they don't want you pulling hard but different people have different theories on that it's the same with archery with archery some people like a very sensitive trigger and some people like a trigger that's very hard to pull so that you you can't just jerk on it because you have to pull pull pull pull bang and then it goes off you know like when you when you shoot archery it's very interesting but you would think like say if you have like a wrist strap with a trigger on it you would think that when you draw back you go like that yeah but you - you would use your finger to hit the trigger but I actually don't some people do some people actually can do and shoot it like cam Haynes does it that way shoots very well that way but campaigns is a psychopath he's a different human being most people there's something about that thing that starts a flinch and anticipation flinch it doesn't with him but some people they get a thing called target panic so to get away from target panic what they do is instead of pulling the trigger you wrap your finger around the trigger and the trigger stiff uke and then you use your back muscles so then then you aim and you go like this you just pull with your back muscles and it goes off without without you even moving your finger huh so once I would hook my finger on it my fingers in place and then I'm just pulling in a pot it goes off oh that's nice yeah is it it's a crossbow does have more range crossbow is basically a shitty gun it is just get a gun yeah what are you doing you're not an archer no what are you doing you got a shitty gun too shitty gun do you think you need Walking Dead personally yes listen that that whole Walking Dead thing is so fraught with peril first of all how come there's no pass-throughs you're shooting into these mushy zombie heads it goes right in there why does it blow out the other side yeah it would wouldn't it fuck yeah would blow through an elk really yes she's one percent those things are going fucking 500 feet aside which is why I told any stump he should they should the Special Forces should have a crossbow division they should not they should not but also these doesn't even have real tips those crossbows they're using field tips it's basically a pencil point it's like poking you and making a hole in you it's not gonna kill you oh it's what I mean crossbows not gonna kill you with those tips on it it's a little hole it would make a little pencil hole that'll go through you and your body would seal up the wound is that true yes so you could shoot me with a crossbow with one of those arrows you'd be fucked up yeah but you would live huh but if I shot you in my heart yeah yeah that would probably kill you but like one of your lungs would probably live but if you shot someone with a crossbow that had a real broad head on it broad head would slice you wide open like a samurai sword right through your whole body that's what it's like so easy to kill why are human being so easy to kill well because we're smart we have nuclear weapons true that's how nature balances it out right Turtles are stupid as fuck that's why they have that awesome cage over their whole body it's true it's true look there's a balance to things you know that's and we respect that balance and we also we want that balance to exist in everything that's why if we see a hot girl we wanted to be stupid correct that's why correct people get caught with their pants down when you think a hot girl was stupid and she turns out to be very intelligent perhaps more intelligent than you well weird - speaking of that when I saw that we met the director of John wick today yes and he's a handsome athletic look and fella he's a good-looking guy he doesn't look like a director he used to be a stunt man he was a kickboxer and a Muay Thai guy but he's he used to be Keanu Reeves stunt double I guess yeah but I looked at him and I was like well this dude looks like a stud he's kind of like a silvery fox he's getting older like my are age but I thought to myself guy looks like a real athlete it must be a you know you definitely fit meanwhile a fucking a big director yeah and he comes there and shoots all the time all the time you said yeah they dead twice a week dude it's such a great thing to have and it's also really fun it's like you're just shooting metal targets and everything like that's but it's it's fun it's there's something it's the same thing with archery it's the same thing with a lot of stuff that you have to focus on you focus and then you execute and if you do it properly there's like sort of the meditative aspect to it which sounds crazy to say that shooting guns with earplugs on a very matter section it's very yeah it because because it's like anything else I like getting comfortable and familiar with things that scare me yes I like getting comfortable and familiar with violence I actually do what I mean yeah because whether it's hunting whether it's boxing whether it's jiu-jitsu but I like I like working at those things and putting myself in uncomfortable positions that because when you go to a shooting range like it's your first time like with me with that kind of tactical thing it's always gonna be a little uncomfortable because you're the new guy you don't know what the fuck you're doing you don't know how to unload a magazine it's it's just gonna be mechanical and print and and there's gonna be a process but there's something about being in this strange location with that those loud know that you can become very familiar with and pretty soon you get good at that shit and now you're now you're actually you don't look like a complete idiot at least you can kind of like start to you know be familiar with that language yeah I think that's and personally for me I think that shit's important well it's it's important to it'll definitely make you less scared mm-hmm there's one of the weirdest things that's watching an altercation break out and then watching men get scared like men who don't know how to defend themselves or men that are not used to being around violence getting scared that's right yeah and and that's gonna happen it's exactly like getting punched in the face if you're not boxing and getting hit well I promise you I don't care who you are when you get hit you usually get jabbed what you're gonna do is you're gonna look down and you're gonna bring your hands to your face that's what you're gonna do you're gonna go oh shit I'm gonna do this or that and then you're a dude then you're yeah and it's not until you really practice whatever it is that you can and kind of you know I'm not saying I'm there but that's your at least less apt to let's likely put yourself in a position of danger exactly like what jujitsu right once when you grab somebody what do they do like I'll grab grab boxers have never had any wrestling great boxers a banana they they turn they turn their back or like I was showing my friend he's a great boxer I was showing about vulnerably is with even an idiot like me grabs him grabbed him took him to the ground and I wrapped I put a potty Locker on his body and what did he do he we stand for my ankles I just want you to see what happens it was it was anybody would do that yeah so well I think it's good just to learn because it's difficult and because it tests you emotionally and physically yeah and and even the shooting stuff does especially because we're around these guys who are you know Terrence a real world-class competitive shooter and he's showing us his stuff and then we go to do it it looks so awkward and goofy like when you put yourself in a situation where you suck at something it's really good for you it's good to suck at things and try to get better at them it's anything and whatever it is whether it's learning how to play chess whether it's whatever it is learning how to do something you learn how to play tennis whatever the fuck it is when you learn how to do something you suck at it at first and you have to concentrate on getting better that thing of getting better translates to other aspects of your life and it's a skill getting better at stuff as a skill it doesn't mean that because you're the mindset yeah but it doesn't mean that because you're good at archery you'll be good at learning how to play the piano but if you can get good at learning how to play the piano you can get good at archery yes because it's there's a thing in there of learning how to learn well that's that's so learning how to learn a lot of times it is as simple as once you learn how to do one thing well like I said that's why one thing informs the other I think what happens is if you're in a new situation like we were today you get better at least I'm better at getting out of my own way yeah you get better at not overthinking you get better at relaxing it's the same a lot of times it's the same body position it's the same weight distribution sometimes it's it's very similar like a lot of these things have their similar language but mainly they're also a similar mindset you just put yourself in that softer that softer beginner's mind that idea of kind of like you know just just don't just open up open your mind and just just let it come to you well it's also accepting that you don't know things a lot of men in particular are really bad at learning stuff because they always they want to think that they know already so even when you tell them stuff they want to think they know yeah I got it I got it problem said well because men are natural problem solvers I have a joke about that where I say I don't know anything about cars nothing but if there's a woman on the side of the road with her hood up looking at her engine I'll make suggestions and it's it's trend I've done that like I'll be like well check the spark plug yeah I don't well today with engines you good luck no one knows what's going on in there you ever see what it looks like when they open up a brand new night like nine ninety-two of 2020 Porsche no the hood pull up opening up the hood on a 2020 Porsche it's the most ridiculous thing ever really you have no idea what anything is ya know even someone like you knows a lot of no idea what's in there I have no idea you get you get this much of a view why the ended oh yeah the view into when you open up the back here's a rear-engine car a Porsche it was most probably the most sophisticated technologically advanced cars ever built right because they've been refining the design since the 1960s pop up the rear trunk and look inside at the engine or it's not trunk it's the hood whatever look inside of the engine you don't know what the fuck that is it's two fans you see two fans that's we see see two fans she's yeah what's what's going on there I don't know I better take it to a place with computers well you need software right you need software to tune it up yeah you have to it's literally you have to they have to plug a machine into it with which analyzes the system and then the machines your hands this is fucks and that's fucked and this is falling apart when are they going to do that with people yeah soon really yeah you have inside info well here's the problem once the first guy gets his legs cut off and gets awesome new

something I can kind of live in - I'm gonna get a call an Airstream living you want something you can get away from everybody that's right you can't get away in an Airstream gonna leave that thing there and then it becomes a liability that's true you want something you get over land in Sun over land over land in it's a good idea it's the whole thing they do over Landers my land cruiser that was built by Ike on the rear seat comes out so the rear seat has these these they made it for me so this is you just pull these levers click click pull the rear seat out you could sleep in that motherfucker if you had to expensive cost money yeah that's cost money that's gonna hire artisans and craftsmen and yeah and geniuses to design things and build things for you cost money maybe just right away - right don't you want to get paid - yeah they do as well yeah you gotta pay them maybe a regular Land Cruiser regular Land Cruisers are great I'm cheap when it comes to cars what is that oh that looks like a Dodge Ram or a Ford f-150 what is like what is that what's that thing it's dragging behind it well that's where all your shit is yeah you sleep in that I have these rooftop tents that's one lows you climb in the roof top 10 let me see that let me see the one but I want to see that one well I need I need protection you want the one to the left of your cursor the gray looking thing right to the left Yeah right there you just out yeah that's that's what you look at that it looks oh man oh that's fucking that's a it looks like a Ford f-350 that's what I'm taking up a lot of gas so it's diesel nothing probably drives pretty it probably is a huge tank what are those three things is that three gas tanks it might be it might have three gas tanks I'm a fan yeah look at that thing I'm a fan I carry extra gas well we have to think differently now right I guess now press that button let's see what this thing look at it driving over fucking mountains and shit look at it so manly yeah you keep water in there you could fucking cook food in that fucking I got my weaponry I got my hunting I got everything he's good he's got oh my god he's bouncing over rocks with that thing he's got rock sliders on that big that's a pig of a being truck while you're doing that I know imagine trying to sleep that's good though why are you driving over the mountain I like that a lot yeah those are great but you could the Lincoln van there's a company called look up this company u-joint off-road you yeah I think that's what it's called u-joint off-road and what they do is they take a van like a regular van and they turn it he has an Instagram page it's pretty cool they take a regular vent like a cargo van yeah and turn into like the ultimate 4x4 vehicle they take out all the bullshit take out all the axles and the engines redo everything and put like super beefy off-road suspension off-road like live rear and front axles you have that show you that BAM motherfucker drive to the moon in that bitch yep so that's something that normally would be like something that Amazon delivers your toothpaste uh-huh it's big enough to sleep in yeah for sure look at that they did one with a school bus they redid a school bus I need you gotta have water you got a lot you got a lot of there's a lot of shit I've been obsessing now my friend Sam so halt he's a photographer and he films does a lot of outdoor filming and stuff he I've known him for years he did a school bus he purchased a school bus go to Sam so halts Instagram page he probably has a blog about the school bus because I mean it's an extensive build he did it for years and he took his school bus a regular school bus turned it into this ultimate outdoor travel vehicle that can sleep like 10 people so he has cots in it and oh it's amazing it's um it's a labor of love you know you and I spoke about getting some land we've done this a while back we were talking about this widow with a here's the thing I didn't think of it you thought of it was very smart you get land with a large pond slash Lake on it yes so you can fish so you got access to protein no matter what right then you have a garden you got it you got to be able to grow you need a well I got to irrigate I need a well I got to have my own source of water there Sam's thing so look how the side pulls out that's fucking turns into a wall tent that's crazy the side turns into a fucking wall tent look at that shit that's amazing dude it's so dope and he brings that thing up into the backcountry that's great yeah it's amazing promises a giant bus I need something a little bit more minutia you don't want that no Sam's crazy but it'd mean it's awesome what about the Swiss card what does it call the Fisker that's a lecture car what are you talking about what is that now you're back in Venice drinking cappuccino fucking expensive machine no hold on I need we have to go look at land dude where do we do it though um Colorado or Utah not California anywhere no you wanna get out of here this place slides too many fucking fires not just fires anything can happen here look we're dealing right now with this pandemic the entire country is dealing with a tack on a natural disaster and then you're really fucked you're really far for real for real I know yeah this is a tricky place California's tricky because it works when it works it's great but it's kind of like playing musical chairs like you know that fucking music is gonna stop and everyone's gonna have to sit down yeah like is there a chair for me yeah look am I stuck here right it's a musical chairs might be a bad analogy but the reality is this is unsustainable and we're basing all of this on a model that really throughout human history has only been temporary and that means a model of peace and prosperity and independence on a level a technological independence I mean Jesus Christ and we're counting on the grid counting on so many factors that have never been permanent throughout human history right they haven't existed right the grid didn't even exist until the 20th century right so in the 20th century in the time that you know people who are alive today almost we're alive the whole world is shifted and now everybody lives in these electrified cities and sewage all goes through this thing and everything go them in the ocean and oh you're counting on so many peeps so many dude but on the other hand there's so many pros to that there are but I would just like please a place I can get the fuck out of and just have like I just want to be I don't wanna be a sitting duck my biggest fear is being vulnerable well you remember when I moved to Boulder in 2008 yes but and the reason why I moved is I don't like this I don't like this traffic and when my daughter was born - I was thinking you know what this is a good time to start fresh let's just go we're somewhere where it's quieter and more people but ultimately that didn't work out because of altitude when my wife was pregnant with the second baby it's like goddamn like altitude wrecks women when when they're pregnant and we were really high we're at 8,500 feet above sea level but now I have other friends are saying hey we need to get the fuck out of here Tom Segura was saying we need to get the fuck out of here Joey Diaz was saying where we going I was like you tell me where we're going I'm going I'll go right he's like let's go to Montana let's go to fucking Billings Montana war but up economise Billings I like Billings - we were in Billings yeah yeah when we we hunted the Missouri Breaks we could create it we could literally start a comedy club somewhere great oh yeah we could like Boise doesn't have a comedy club from what I understand oh no boys all right so Coeur d'Alene I don't know we could for sure do a comedy club somewhere or move to a place like salt lake that has comedy clubs and a hundred thousand fucking people or whatever they have out there but the idea of staying here it just seems so silly it seems so silly yeah especially well you're still in show business you're still sucking on the tit yes devil yes I am you've got the devil's nipple in your mouth you still going the red carpet yeah I've also got the fire in kid we're not getting shopped and move anywhere cuz I shall be like you pussies he says that Oh would take is one more of these things yeah you made a shot would be like yeah Denver's not bad yeah you could live in evergreen you're 30 minutes from Denver yeah yeah about that well do that every would you said ice fog or just pull up evergreen I got it I got my kids people in Evergreen right now angry at me shut up you're gonna fuckin wreck evergreen evergreen it's beautiful family it's 30 minutes from Denver and it's beautiful mountain town here I got some people 9,000 people 9,500 all our friends yeah imagine but what a funny club in Denver Green a great idea just get Wendy involved Wendy from the comedy works that's what it looks lovely bro it's gorgeous it's got a beautiful historically that that's what I'm talking about burn Kalin dude woods don't elk herds wander through town come on whack one of them you eat it for six months and I want to I want to German Shepherds work you think Adams look at that go pull that fucking historic downtown evergreen that's the lake I've been did that before there's a lake and people go ice skating on the lake do you know guys yeah Matt Stone and Trey Parker they're from Evergreen that's what South Park is based on it's part of its based on that's why there's always snow in South Park it's based on Evergreen Colorado those guys are from there it's gorgeous I'm gonna get them addy if you keep talking sorry there's other places in Colorado but there's other places in Utah Park City's amazing I love Park City these grandparents gorgeous it's good move great restaurants beautiful scenery you still you're still dependent on the grid and there's not enough water I don't trust it well there is actually get some water doesn't trust we'd be fine we can some milk yes this way but I need fucking rice and oatmeal I need I need some start rice me I need some yams why do you need rice and oatmeal because I know you can grow your hams uh-huh you can grow those things yeah you need a lot of water they grow in the ground yeah but there's not a drought in Utah it's not like it's a fucking I mean there's a reason why there's so much snow Brian that's precipitation wait you can melt snow cave rows but I mean it's coming down right it snows well guess what it also rains that's yeah you can grow things there I'm gonna see all those trees yeah they use water yeah whenever you see a lot of woods assume there's water yeah probably right yeah what a match crazy fish do some look at that game look how pretty sass where's that Jamie giant lake god it's so beautiful Lake I need a lake for water does that Colorado oh my god that's an evergreen dude I wanna go off the land liveability click on that what does it say about livability don't come here ass fucks ever in Colorado what you need to know here goes looking to move to Evergreen we've got everything you want to know about the key factors that can make it the best place for you including Evergreen Colorado real estate let's start with the basics Evergreen Colorado is located in Jefferson County has a population of eight thousand six hundred and eighty-eight people that's that's a that's a show that's one show and a good-sized theater so true yeah that's one show that's not even a sold-out arena oh my god we have a cool graph below that shows the city's ethnic diversity none oh I'll check that graph right now zero it's all white people there's one black guy and they walk them watch them closely what kind of ethnic diversity let me see the graph for green let me see their graph let me see the graph about the diversity this is a graph they hide the graph looked slightly cuz it has a lot of thrown away Tonga and Samoa in there oh yeah Salt Lake you saw my aunt Salt Lake the city surprisingly diverse I have a friend who moved their median household income 79 grand nice 389 grand for a house nice population eight thousand six so it doesn't have a diversity graph they probably ditched that one things like hey delete that Oh was it say okay says ages does it say ethnicity white 97.5% 1.4 percent Asian there's one black person do 0.1% ethnicity other other it doesn't even say black it says other african-americans one of those prominent races in this country yeah and there it's other it sounds like man okay go back to that stop scrolling look at that that's crazy yeah 97.5 percent white dude 30 minutes to denver huh yeah 30 minutes to Denver I want to go gorgeous everybody you will get snowed in bro you will oh yeah is it high elevation oh the elevation 8,000 feet that's a little high it's high as fuck and you're gonna get snowed in it's not just no didn't but like several feet snow a little problem like gee ain't going nowhere bitch a problem is it really don't you just get a snow blower like a goddamn man well put on a like get out like a beaver hat get one Ella to make you a beer ass one of them real hats yes like doesn't mountain man type out I want a coyote full-length coyote yeah I know it's mean I never as I cut too much like dogs they are not a coyote jacket yes I mean I know it's cruel and I and I don't want to kill coyotes but they are very plentiful these idiots are thinking about moving wolves into Colorado it's not right didn't didn't know moving wolves into Yellowstone increase the population of everything no no is that a lie no I watch that video oh yeah the wolves changed rivers yes yeah a lot of the factors okay that that guy didn't take into consideration in terms of moving rivers one of the things was beavers they imported beavers into Yellowstone there's many many factors okay but they did reduce the undulate population which you could say was out of proportion what's an Angela Angela does cows elk cows yeah yeah the animals that you hunt in here now and guess who else on some wolves bitch yeah so it changed the way the elk behaved it reduced the population pretty substantially but there's still a healthy population of elk in Montana and there's a healthy population of wolves and they actually hunt wolves now they hunt wolves in the lot Idaho they hunt a lot of wolves in some places they're trying to resist the hunting of wolves but you got to kind of keep a balance and if you're gonna bring predators you got to realize why they killed them all in the first place they killed them all in the first place because ranchers we're losing all the crops or all their cattle that rather the guy loves wolves look you can see I have pictures of wolves all over my wall out there I'm a huge fan of wolves but you can't raise I also am a big fan of wildlife biologists and the wildlife biologists that understand balance the real ones not the ones that are animal activists that only want animals to live and they only want everybody tofu though the ones that understand that this is there's a balance from predators and prey and we missed that balance you know that's why there's no mountain lion hunting in California and people say well that's a good thing sort of but mountain lions are still getting killed in California what we don't understand mountain lions get killed by state and federal agents who have to kill mountain lions because mountain lions are killing either people's dogs or cats or livestock or I didn't know it all the time they kill the same amount of mountain lions they would if they had tags really yes but the difference is the money doesn't go to the state but everybody feels good and the government feels warm and cuddly because it because somebody with a uniform is doing it they're doing it on the sneak tip instead of like some guy posing on Instagram like hugging you ever see the way they pose with mountain lions kind of fucked up that yeah they hold them up in the air wolves yeah let you know how big they are fucking well you know what a man they are they shot this mountain lions delicious by the way it is according to everybody I know tell me it's pretty tough no no no no somebody said he said it's superb there's just words said superb he goes it's as like a superior pork no yes but they they are they eat they're carnivores yeah and supposedly delicious I can't think of any other animal we eat do we eat any animals that are total converse alligator yes alligators delicious fish yeah Fisher 100% carnivores but do not really know it's a thing but but what else do it what else animal wise you don't need any birds that are carnivores but birds will eat that is interesting right yeah like we don't eat Eagles well in the Old Testament and if you're a kosher Jew or if you're Islamic if you're Muslim you're not you're not to eat things like eagles osprey but there was a very good scientific reason for that because you would get different pathogens exercise yes yeah oh for sure yeah anything that eats you want things that have animal the chickens eat they live on meal warm and they'll eat all kinds of shit that's true but you're also supposed to cook chicken past 145 degrees yeah because you're killing off parasites yes and Salmonella and all kinds other shit right you know people who eat raw chicken you gotta be out of your fucking mind eat raw chicken stalks you know a horse will eat a chicken sometimes uh-huh there's a video of it whoa I know see how Z Birds I know did you have a horse eating a fucking check thank you and not if we're doing this and man deer deer will eat ax oh I see a lot of deer eating birds Howie person yeah I need that protein yeah they would say that they used to birds yeah they set up this net I don't think they were studying birds it's a humane way to catch them to get captured in this net and they can release them from the net gently and then they could set them free uh-uh deer would just find them in the net and eat them goddamn yeah they just pluck them around and no interesting cattle too they know the net were the net was like Oh wonderful no no chase these birds choo-choo-choo yeah Oh cow eating a chicken play that it's a horse eating one okay oh he's feeding I'm not I'm just saying almost looks like it really well yeah he's filming it horses don't fuck around my oh it's a little baby chick yeah look he's chasing that chick down bitch Champa Champa Champa yeah they just funny protein yeah my I need that quick I used to have a pitbull patties patties pitbull Chauncy badass oh love that dog a great dog and like an alligator like jaws on fucking just with feet there's a cow eating the chicken guy yes Christ chewing it apart oh my goodness she got in here a big horse a Clydesdale that horse put his head down and ran straight at that fucking dog and she was like oh fuck yeah the size of a Clydesdale he was like get the fuck out of my Corral what do you do he literally stopped me went really put his head down and went and came right out you was gonna die she just dodged out of the way she could have there's a horrible video of this guy is what is it called when you got a bunch of dogs pulling yous it called mushing I am mushing I did ride whooshing whooshing whooshing amazing mush do you mush it you mush I must personally okay so this guy it's really sad this guy is getting pulled by these dogs and this moose runs in front of him and just starts stomping his dogs what yeah it's terrible it's terrible nothing to do about it there's no so this is not it this is not it but I'm sure this is probably a similar result you know the other one was a cow moose he's either a cow moose or maybe she's that one well well they will fuck up dogs loose attack sled dog team yeah that's not it it's a recent one but it's it's real anyway it was real sad I saw it on his shield a bunch of dogs he killed a couple of them one of them they had to put down after the fact because it broke its back damn yeah I mean I'm not moose is an 1800 pound animal not hearing a peep out of a pack of dogs pack it dog that's like you get in a fight with a hamster yeah just get the fucking yep moose are so big man Kyle cheetah pull him down though cheetah grab your balls and

you start to bleed out I'll take your balls please how come your balls bow-wow yeah it's a stupid design right yeah just pull it up inside like a turtle tanks they're just tanks but sometimes they get tired yeah if you go hunting you should have a steel cup like tied like a tied cup yes one that goes through the butt like a g-string I do any discipline they say wolf wants to try to bite your balls he gets a mouthful of metal my time I take down on my leg with a with a hemp rope just to keep me honest I am yeah keep me honest and also organic yeah Brown what are you doing tie my dick down with a coarse hemp rope why keeps me honest yeah like you know those those like side holsters that people have sometimes where they have a strap on their thigh yep because they have a long gun they want to keep it from flopping up against their thoughts sure do as you do with the hog that's right sometimes I sprint with a hard-on you ever try that naked I've never run with a hard-on I mean either it's amazing all these years never hammer the heart huh I wonder how long you dick would stay hard if you were in a full gallop it's a good question it's a very good question I'd be a great gun test right if like someone broke into your house and you're in the middle of sex and you're angry but you kept your would cuz you aren't scared just get your dick super hard and just go run just take a like a hair tie and just just rubberband it to the bottom got to do that just keep the blood flow kind of tired piece down oh yeah you tie off at the end oh yeah yeah look at cock ring that's right and then just go running after him we lose a cock ring with a big ol hard-on it has a cock ring oh that's one of those things like if you have what's wrong with you don't say that because you'll get up you're gonna get 50 emails of people with alligator cock rings and all initially for you hey bro it's nothing wrong with Cochran Joe Rogan fucking experience let me show you how I make them just a cock ring do you get you got Python yeah slight down cock ring so many cock rings they all exist yeah like who's buying sex toys from stores these days you ever drive by one of them sex toy stores and you're like for real to ghost town who's pulls in there they're open still is much stronger operations may be but the hustla store still open I think on Sunset Boulevard it doesn't more of a thing for you and your girlfriend go and let's get this well used to be DVDs I remember used to be like you remember when people used to buy porn DVDs there was a day you fucking kids today are so spoiled VHS porn oh yeah I remember that that was one I used to watch porn you know I never and I'm just an all bullshit aside and I'm not because I'm a good boy I never watch porn I never ever watch porn because it doesn't do a thing for me really I don't know what it is I just nice swear to God tired I thought about I thought about that the other day I was like I haven't watched porn in three days since I was 52 I haven't watch porn in so many years is you tired from all your fuck yeah all my banging fuck cuz I fuck porn is a an oddly polarizing subject because every it's a we it's one of the weirdest things ever if you really stop and think about it because mostly everyone is healthy enjoys sex whether it's straight sex or gay sex or what kind of sex you like if you're healthy in your young even if you're not young if you're healthy your body works well you like sex but yet filming it yeah it's so tap I know I think it's because taboo it is heaven I've thought a lot about that it's I think it's because we inherently know typically that the person doing it putting themselves on camera it is a form of suicide it what I mean by that is it's a form of it's a way of ensuring that you keep yourself out of certain segments of Society right and maybe it's residue from when when sex was downright dangerous pregnancy disease that we didn't cures for I think sex had to have a lot of taboos like even in the Old Testament I think when the Israelites were not allowed to you know you had you couldn't take the women as slaves you had to kill everybody well the reason for that was unless they were virgins because the reason for that was you could get a disease like a member who broke that down but but that was always a thing where people would get you go into a town and rape all the women and stuff and then your soldiers would come down with some terrible syphilitic disease and so in the Old Testament the Israelites were you know forbidden from taking anybody who was of a certain age that's another weird thing about sex the diseases like how many goddamn diseases come from fucking and people seemed fine yeah that's the thing it's not like the flu or you know like if someone's like can we fuck like it's not like yeah I got the got the flu from Maggie that dirty bitch like we Umbro she was in bed she's sick you didn't you couldn't tell she was sick oh I thought I'd be fine like no when I was younger if you had a flu I wasn't gonna stop me but I'm sick I can't I'd be like I don't give a fuck cuz you're terrible yeah that's not my point my point is people seem fine and they have a terrible disease yes it's so weird yes like the flu is normal right wait you're sick you got a temperature oh I don't want to be near you I could catch that disease yeah but that's one of the weird things about this coronavirus in a lot of ways right because they said we were trying to figure out what the number is but there's a large percentage more than half are asymptomatic right right but they're carrying it but they're carrying it so like they seemed fine but they're spreading this horrible disease that's weird but that's sort of like some diseases some VD some of the clap yes you know you didn't have herpes and never show symptoms so you can have herpes simplex 2 and never show symptoms and you could be carrying it yes herpes ridden low yes into people and apparently all of us have been exposed to herpes and if you get cold sores from I understand this is type of herb on your lips you have you have somewhat some immunity to the to the one on your genitals mmm-hmm yeah yes but you could transfer the ones from you apparently you can't it's such every time I talk to a doctor fix that one there's no they don't have a vaccine for her they just have figured that out I think they were working on it there's too many people there are bees it like it's let it go yeah it's some crazy number it's like warts to their different kinds of warts well they have that now HPV they do have a vaccine for that yeah they do have a vaccine for that and that's very important for women because women get it cervical cancer yeah it's just the the idea that all these diseases are passed on through sex is so strange well if you think about your coming in as close contact as is possible maybe you're ingesting they're like well I come I like to run into the bathroom and clean I just think yeah man it's hard to yeah but but porn we're talking about point of why there's why is there taboo typically I think it's because people I think it's a couple things I think porn people remind us of a darker animalistic side of ourselves we don't want to admit to right so if I watch porn I'm not going to admit that to a bunch of people I don't know yet there's something shaming about watching other people have sex there's something taboo about that so if I admit so if I'm around somebody who reminds me of the fact that I that's why I've always thought it'd be the height of hypocrisy whatever people judge porn stars it's like you judge porn stars you watch porn is a multi-billion dollar industry let's be honest all of us watch it all off to it but I did I did my share I stopped a week ago my father one time looked at my my iPad and he goes the fuck is this porn porn what is it like my search history was so full of sin your dad was look into your search he was trying to he put something in when he was snooping oh and he saw this he goes what is all this I go I go look I look at my when I watch porn he went like this when I'm looking for something you should really get uncomfortable with them what is your favorite to watch exactly I'm sure he does too I'm sure everybody does but here's the thing when you're in a presence of porn people typically if you are if they're part of your crew you're they remind people of sort of their darker side and I think that's why they become also by the way though the kind of person that's willing to do that might be more self-destructive usually than yet than the average person in that sense yeah I guess I don't know yeah I mean yeah I always have to leave the door open to aberrations but there was something that I read about it was a real bummer the number of women that get into porn that have been sexually molested off the charts yes although I've met I bet I I'm thinking of two in particular Alana Evans who I got to know who and as cool a fucking human being as it gets she's just a guy love her she's a great person she just is and as a Sakura AUSA is smartest fuck and a regular like in every it's guy kept looking at her going what's going on here you're just and she's read everything she's you know she just seems incredibly well-adjusted but she has that side of her so I don't know she does ferocious gangbang yes yes it's like our mascaras gone correct she's covered in cocks not never never watched one of her porns but yes congratulations yeah because you respect there no I'm just maybe I will now maybe that'll break your three day fast exactly exactly yeah I don't know it's a it's a weird one because it is like sort of universally taboo but yet you almost universally consumed yeah it's these are very contradictory things it is very much Nicole Aniston Stevie blue-eyes my boy you know Stevie he dates Nicole Aniston and now does porn with her no yeah oh yeah what when did this TV goes from crime to stand up to porn he's doing porn with his girlfriend was his girlfriend she's a beautiful girl she's a beautiful girl and again very good businesswoman has other investments you talked to her and like she's gorgeous but you'd never think like I've had long lucid conversations with this person she's just not it just doesn't make those do he's showing his cock to the world Stevie's got a fucking piece on that piece ah ha ha ha ha are you fucking calm self Stevie blue eyes and his porn I don't think so I don't still let him open for you or is he I want to know I'd fucking I love that guy you know if he does porn people see is I don't give a fuck you should be careful he's hilarious I don't give a shit this is not good this is not good now Stevie's our guy on television I can't have some porn star open I want to be more than my I use direct I use Maalik beers you should you should be a director and come in and dressed like an old-timey director house an old-timey director dress well I would dress the way of an old-time French director dresses yes would be I would have knickers I would have boots and have a beret yes and I'd have a cane cane look like a cattle like an O riding crop yes a fucking riding crops would be dressed like an equestrian but I'm not a question like an equestrian yes and I even have a like instead of a bray a hard riding hat yes and action and scene why don't they could they talk you into doing something where you don't have sex but you are a comedic relief in a porn film we're interested in doing that I would do that would you probably see get mad at you oh you want ABC yeah ABC is very conservative yeah well they're owned by Disney yeah yeah yeah but then again hopefully I don't listen to the fighter and kid well hope of the hopefully don't listen to this we're trying to set it up action I had a good director one time I was doing the scene and he goes I don't believe you instead I don't believe I don't believe you Brian I don't believe you I was in the city now it was on MADtv really yeah director on Mac said director on Oz he goes I can see acting he whispered hey I can see you acting different I was like try something different yeah he was right well you are acting yeah she played dumb I don't know what you're saying I'm supposed to be acting right if you don't want me to act I'll go home what should have focused on stand up yes well you did eventually I love it but you do you like to acting too you're a weirdo you like those people too you secretly like those acting people the ones that I disdain I don't know about that bring them around sometimes and I get grossed out I know if that's true I have to slowly waited or I don't anymore how long ago it's been a while yeah you used to bring him around yeah like hey what the fuck is this who's this guy I don't have not counted on this guy the guy be right there I don't I don't like this guy bro but you would bring the worst like full-on liars sociopaths complete path miss miss like liars I collected misfits but they would just lie about stuff maybe they were just nervous around you or they would just make up stories though you can't do that you can just make up stories you can't and you know sometimes when someone makes up a story that's so obvious like what do you think but I would never pick up on it and you would go like this I remember one time with you and I were doing some we're shooting something for as a favor and we're getting our makeup and this guy was talking and he was dating he was actually dating some porn chick and and you were listening to him and front of everybody in front of him and everybody you went like this you went holy shit what a bullshit artist wow you're a real bullshit artist huh and it got all weird in the room I was like ah here goes Joe here goes Joe hunkering down well it's someone starts lying to you just lying to you and in front of a bunch of people and I think I remember the story I think the guy was very criminal too it wasn't it was something like is angling yeah to get something out of us and lying I was like I know where this is going you're trying to get something out of us and you're like you're a bullshit artist yes and I was like we're stopping this right now cuz you're gonna dominate this whole day and then you're gonna want us to invest in something here give you money or there was some there was some who stopped him right away yeah well there was some grouse sort of semi-aggressive hustle yeah to what he was doing and he was lying to us yes and I was like this isn't true yes and you called one record scratch it was great well was it it was one of those moments like this whole day could go to shit because we're trapped in this building with his liar right there's so many of them out that's so good to know I don't I don't have that antenna cuz I just trust people immediately well you that was an obvious it was a criminal one yes there's some guys that are like they're crumb sociopaths yeah but they're they're angling and if you don't stop it right there they're gonna get your number they're gonna get your email they're gonna get you this they're gonna get you this I want to make this meeting I'm real tight friends with Tom Cruise or this guy or that guy and it's always that yeah like name dropping because you named that effort work does that work no that's the weirdest name dropping is one of the weirdest things that people do that doesn't work yeah it's so sad and strange it doesn't work now but yet people do it yeah it's a weird one right yeah like like Fame by association yeah it never works it never works yeah but people do it and then with people like yeah you know I'm real good friends with Leo they're like these like you don't want to be that guy that's the I don't want to be all due respect but I don't want to be the good friend to the big celebrity let's you do something completely different no unless you do something that's completely outside if you don't need that person if you're not part of their entourage yeah like maybe David Sinclair talks about always friends with you that kind of thing yeah that's a no Bryan Callen I'm friends with that like that people like oh well you're a respected Harvard psychologist well I'm excited when Lex Friedman came to my show and I mean yeah he's a fucking bridge it's genius yeah yeah and a black belt in judo and jujitsu yeah great guy but that is that's different that's someone who's accomplished in a different realm it's the people that are in that business that are like trying to be producers or trying to be of this or trying to that it's like there's so much weirdness going on out here in terms of like people being inauthentic did I tell you the story about about how I was in Boston at the Wilbur and then we went to this club I tell you whether they were this these three key opium guys and my buddy's girlfriend's Ethiopian I tell you the story I don't think so oh so I'm with LEC's Freedman black belt I'm with my other boy Rob who's a black belt six for 230 I'm with Brian Cooley who owns Gracie Baja in fucking Nashville he's six six two seventy six six two seventy a Viking a fucking Viking wears his hair in a ponytail blonde giant 42 years old and still competes in jujitsu and then and then I got my boy Moloch B who came out of Mayweather's camp box at wild-card forever he's been throwing her right hands and he was seven and Moloch has is the Ethiopian girlfriend and they're these four little Ethiopian dudes who are drunk and being shitheads and actually kind of dancing with the girls that are in the group and their dad to be pushed away a couple times anyway finally the guy comes up to Moloch and says that girl belongs to us because she's our sister and you and Malik's black but he's like fucking from Louisiana right and they were you should and so Moloch whose have been fighting as I like goes well I think it's not Jesus he didn't say anything he's just too happy whatever and what'd he say and I go what are you saying to us and the guy goes that's our sister he she she shouldn't be with you guys she's with us and Ethiopian girl Helena goes you're being disrespectful so Brian coolly said they don't know they're surrounded by literally four black belts a great boxer and in me the idiot the loudmouth who's was probably the first kind of throw a punch because I'm insecure so we're all there and these four guys who are maybe five seven never done a sport in their life and Brian coolly just looks down and guy goes hey bro you know mood the movie Jaws jaws and the guy goes huh and he goes the movie Jaws you know that movie I think I goes yeah and he goes right now in this scenario you're the girl you guys are the girl swimming in the water you understand you're swimming in the water and you got no idea you're about to be pulled on there do you understand what I'm saying and he's just giant looking down and then you see the other guy go and he sees the circle kind of tightening and he's just looks everybody goes he just goes like this he goes Oh gives a double smart fuck yeah and he spends like and they they were trying to morrow and this kind of moved away in a group it would have been so bad for them men and egos so bad for them that's a greatest metaphor you know the you know the fucking movie Jaws well that's John Jaques metaphor oh it is yeah John Jaques metaphor for jujitsu ah fuck yeah he said the ground is the ocean and I'm a shark most people can't swim you know I trained with heekin well he's great all the best he's very controversial system where he's teaching people celebrities jiu-jitsu and giving them belts but they don't really spar well they're celebrities I will always spar here's the thing he teaches tomorrow he taught me a lot Greco like Greco stuff he's really cool I love it East man oh my god in 2003 in Abu Dhabi I was doing time for him in Sao Paulo I was held in the time no tell me how much time cuz he wasn't in the best of shape so he would like conserve his energy of course he's just so technical he could get away with you know beating like really good guys about being in tip-top condition I'm sure you ever see the video of him rolling with Hickson fighting with Hicks and oh yeah there's a famous jujitsu film it's in black and white and it's probably from shit 89 or 1990 or some shit like pre UFC and they're in Rio and at a jiu-jitsu jiu-jitsu turned way back when there was no jiu-jitsu to here's well what year is this he gonna what does it say he gonna had 300 and see me just it's just said 8686 look at this 86 man so this is like wow when I was just getting out of high school Wow it's Hickson on the bottom he get on top look at our relaxed zoo they had a battle dude Keegan at the time was a fucking he's way bigger than Nixon by the way she is he is he is and this is a real battle it's a really interesting to watch as well because they're both so technical he didn't studied so many other things he was an amateur boxer for a long time and then he but he did a lot of wrestling the guys rolled the trucks back he keeps getting hit since back but he gets shook off oh shit rolls him over yeah he can was a big fella yes a big strong dick sit on top Hicks enrolled them I mean these guys they really went for it too this is a it was a really wild sort of a match a lot of scrambles I didn't know this they should watch it it's really interesting I didn't know was 86 I would have guessed it was 90 or 91 now the game has changed so much sense right it has not fun applause yes but the guys who have exceptionally sharp fundamentals still dominate like hogr Gracie he's you know haunters never been a guy who adopts like the new aspects that look at that beautiful sweep but he can but Hicks encountered the Hodge has never been a guy who adopted a lot of the crazy new techniques Rodgers like Roger Gracie's all I don't actually calls himself Roger or hogr I'm not sure but he's like straight up old school armbar pass triangle like that system of the fundamental the fundamentals of a good way to see what's really good wrestlers they do the same like a high-level wrestlers they're not dude they're still doing ankle picks they're still they're still controlling the head and hips they're still double and single legging well um John Jacques has a way of talking about it he said the more jujitsu I know the less I use wow yeah yeah this is I use like five things yeah yeah and it's it's timing yeah did you ever see when jean-jacques first started competing in Abu Dhabi he was one of the first key champions to do nogi and be really successful because jean-jacques was born with a genetic deficiency in his left hand he doesn't have a left hand he just has a thumb right and so because of that he never relied on grabbing things he never relied on grabbing the ghee he relied on a more greco-roman based style of wonder so when he would roll with those guys it's like good there's nothing to grab I never grabbed anything anyway and so he you just dominate people even guys like Sakura who's a you know a top-level MMA guy just fuck Sakura Sakura Sakura ayaats Oh Sakura who's like a beast back in the day yeah he ran right through him he ran right through a bunch of guys so cool yeah and it's you know those guys that dude that style like Jean Jacques styles the same way man he's never been like a guy who does a lot of wild fancy stuff yeah but there's a lot of guys who do wild fancy stuff that it looks super successful with that too look there are great boxers great boxers that use ones and twos the whole fucking fight oh yeah they might throw two hooks yeah so I mean you know it's just finding something what's that Bruce Lee expression don't beware of the man who knows 10,000 techniques beware of the man who knows one thing that he's practiced it's like the book of five rings Miyamoto Musashi talks about like the practicing real sword fighting literally is reaching and and you have time for one strike yeah like Shabab and that's what he would practice over and over yeah I mean this night he said very rarely this ever a fight at sword fight go to a duel like a ching ching ching that doesn't happen and that shit is like its final well Musashi fought so many people he'd get bored and he started fighting people with oars what yeah he made the wooden swords out of oars and you would fight people with oars so he had a famous school where they would practice like you know where it was basically as realistic practice as you get oh yeah he said the only way to practice for that as that mindset damn imagine realistic practice with sword he would do things I get you like if you were about thing he would turn you toward the Sun so the Sun was in your eyes yeah yeah he was very and you also show up really late you really he's into showing up a really like he was two swords yeah hours late yeah hours late so you'd be freaking out for hours while he's taking a nap because the guy would be waiting on the beach and then he would show up hours late and he wouldn't even have a sword just use an oar fuck you up with an oar what yeah because oars are longer I see you got this sword and you stand there with a sword and this guy comes out with a long stick and just fucking cracks you over the head it's not a good thing well he was a big man too he was an interesting guy man I mean to understand what it takes to defeat more than 60 men in one-on-one combat well it's also not combat this is life and death Shin this is like you know a swordplay getting cut with a swords not swords are not terribly forgiving bullets are more forgiving than is a sword yeah you get you know you're not walking away from from a bloody throat it's also a very personal way fuck up dude you can hear you you feel and hear and see him breathing I mean everything someone's head just falls off when their body still stands yeah damn their body collapses or you cut their arm off oh yeah imagine living in the day where that shit was going on all the time I got France in France there were so many duels people would walk around swords and there was a time in France or just you'd see people with like I'm like they'd lose they'd have no ear that have a constant scars or you know that was like a sort of a badge of honour for Nazis Nazis had dueling scars real did you know that no oh my god pull up Nazi dueling scars now here's where it gets really weird a lot of the Operation Paperclip scientists that the United States brought over from Nazi Germany when Nazi Germany was defeated in World War two the United States took on all their scientists and brought them over to work for NASA Wernher von Braun Wernher von Braun the head of the head of NASA was a fuckin straight-up complete 100% Nazi in fact the simon wiesenthal center said that if he was alive today they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity was a real Nazi yep him and his cabinet all those fucking guys they brought over they all these massive cheek scars really yeah they had scars over their face from from from duels they would wear goggles and they would wear like like you know like some kind of protection on their on their body and their their faces would get sliced open and they they relished it it was like a cool thing to have like a big scar in your face who-who showed us that remembers I'm doing that something popped up that I hadn't seen before it's actually called modern academic fencing or the men sir and German I love we pull it slightly different though they're not just like fighting to fight yes the winner loser in it well that's interesting but this is but I want to see is just pull up the images of Nazi dueling scars because they're horrific like these guys like post duel with look at that one guy with the goggles on with his face slashed open see that down there yeah that look at that they'd cut their face like dude yeah so you'd have something that covers your nose and your eyes and look at it he's got a giant slash in his forehead a giant slash in his face he's in real yeah see that guy with the blue arrow on his face like that kind of shit those scars on the faces they would all have those click on that that guy with the right there look at that they all had those kind of scars on their face from dueling it was a big look at that guy below him lower right below him no right below him right below him the big image the big yeah right there look at that guy's face see they all had those kind of scars on their face and it was like to let everyone know these were bad motherfuckers that would you know have duels with swords that's crazy yeah it was very really common man men sir is that what you're talking about Jamie yeah yeah Emmy and Su are and what's that stand for again it's academic fencing so like there it's it was in college they did all this I bet ya fuckin crazy man the bragging scar men's sir scars or the bragging scar yeah but there was some there's some horrific pictures of these guys like post match where they were trying to piece their face back together again and you could see like they're literally like see inside their face either time and everything because their dicks been split open him yeah and it was really common and so a lot of the Nazis that they brought over from Operation Paperclip to run NASA had these fucking scars in their faces so they'd be sitting there with Wernher von Braun and JFK and you'd see this guy with his giant face scar yeah it's crazy swords man yeah and those they had those long I think it was called what they called a Ray Pierre or something like that right Pierre yeah Oh calls it Paris here it's a different version of it but they had those long pointy swords you get you know it takes this but yeah and your nose is gone oh yeah fuck that but they all like wanted to get scar of course it's like a cauliflower I got it it's all it's all it's all this time it's all this time young men yeah approve look they went into battle young men go into battle with full of ideas of linear ideas of duty and honor and glory and then unfortunately war can many times make a mockery of that Wars obviously a fog and insane and and chaotic and unfair and not linear and crazy and horrifying and all those things and and and lacks dignity and all those things you know you see that a lot it seems it seems to me that when a lot of soldiers I've spoken to add real combat experience when they come out of that they it's very difficult for them there's a lot to come to terms with and sometimes they have a lot of trouble bringing their life back into a linear how could we go from one way of life or everything is life and death yeah everywhere every corner you turn around it could be the end every day that you're out there could be the end well we as that's one thing life and death is again linear and bilateral but you know you there are a lot of things that have said goodbye linearly saying that there are certain concepts when we as human beings I think most of us have a contract with life you know you grow up and you say if I work hard and I keep swinging I'm gonna there it's gonna pay dividends right and most of us live that way most of us believe in fair play like something about the universe is somewhat fair the universe rewards hustle the universe rewards you know we have these ideas and we have to believe in those ideas and usually we're right about it right it's almost like um we we enter a game where we know I can jab and I can punch and I can hook but sometimes you get fucking kicked in the face and you go but that wasn't the role I was playing with you know it's like well hold on I was boxing you're doing MMA right and life does that to you war can do that to you to a point where you lose your faith in who wrote where the wild things are I never forgot he said they said are you a religious and he said no i'm an atheist the war took care of that for me you know he saw too many things he saw too many children starve and die and all those things and I think that when things get bad enough in war when you get that close to reality and that close to that chaos whatever contract you had gets shattered in fact it gets mocked you are mocked by the insanity of it all and any any notion so when I say linear or what I mean is sort of like I'll do this if you do this for me so it's a give-and-take the fact did you ever see the Unforgiven I love them do you remember when he kills Gene Hackman and Gene Hackman can't believe that he's gonna die mm-hmm it's not supposed to happen to him that's what that's what they say sociopaths when they get when sociopaths get convicted of life off times what happens is they look up and they go what wait what me and it all comes down because of what they what a sociopath like that a chronal sociopath usually believes is there it's impossible they'll never get caught because they're too smart yes it because they're too smart or they think the world revolves around them and so the idea both of those punished Hitler you know according to historian of cameras named Buchwald Buchholz he said I think John buckles had said Hitler was so callously self-involved self-centered that he truly believed that when the war was lost and he came to the realization the war was lost he expected Germany to self emulate and he expected Germany all Germans to burn themselves to kill themselves and light themselves on fire essentially he expected that from the German people cuz he he was going to do it he said yes and he was going to do that that that is according to Buchholz the historian who follows his stuff yes and and that's not uncommon for the great sociopaths the great you know I mean if you think about Genghis Khan he had he truly believed that and almost did that he could dominate an own the entire world these people like Alexander the Great and those kind of people who who were clearly I'm sure their enemies didn't think of them as great but they had this force of nature this ability to believe in themselves to the point where they were gonna own the world and some of them almost did well if you think about it any kind of thing where you're trying to conquer something say if you have a small tribe and there's another tribe that's close to the river and they have more resources and you're in dispute with them and you try to conquer that tribe that is one level of this game right we're gonna we're gonna get our warriors together we're gonna sneak in the middle and not that's impact them maybe yeah but the point is there's that level so let's say let's not call it a game but let's say this is an endeavor this is a thing that you're doing with anything that anybody does some people take it way further right like some people try an open mic night and they go this is kind of interesting I'll do stand-up every now and then they do it once a month other people that get obsessed they do it every fucking day and they do 10 sets a day and they live in New York City and they take fucking cabs everywhere and ubers and they do you know and they're they live it mm-hmm they're like mark Normand right they live it that's the same thing with war it's the same thing with everything same thing with fighting yeah same thing with everything yeah you know some people just they become obsessed it becomes everything it becomes their everything and they don't care about anything else they don't care about other people they don't care about the environment yeah that's trying to get really good at something but I think some people try to literally remake the world in their image I think so too but I think that obsession carries on I think the obsession took to conquer a neighboring tribe or to take over a town or to conquer a city or a country or a continent there's just there's just as weird things that people do where they take things as far as they can be taken mm-hmm and they do that even with war that scares the shit out of me with China it really does because they they oh here's something I wanted to talk about so I don't know this is something I sent you Jamie that 20 million cell phone users are missing from China where does that stat come from this is Americans this is what they don't know they don't know if this means there's 20 million casualties because it also coincides with their switch to 5g mm-hmm they switched from 5g in January so from January to March China lost 20 million cell phone users now what does that mean no it's hard to tell yeah but I think you could safely say whatever they say the casualty number is yeah is bullshit exactly that's pretty safe because they've been bullshitting left and right about the whole thing you know there's they go on Twitter there's a some branch of the government that's involved in propaganda that's trying to say this is United States government creation of course the Chinese are incredibly practical the Chinese you know a lot of people I'm speaking of the government of course but but well I think when you live in a society that has been essentially communist or really at the mercy of a central authority and an all m'l central authority for so long yeah forever it's all so that's that's a society that that treated religion with great disdain and suspicion so they didn't really have even though there are small pockets of these different but for the most part I think when you forcibly rid a population of religion what you are left with is something that takes its place sure an ideology like communism or whatever but they're not really comments anymore but I do think what happens is you get a population that deals in practicality that is I'm sure very good to each other when they know somebody that is but also deals and things like cause and effect not so much the overt and one of the things a friend of mine I'm speaking for a friend of mine who did a lot of business billions of dollars business with China and another friend in fact who does a lot of business with China it did so and speaks fluent Chinese both of them had something an interesting observation which was that when you speak about morality in a judeo-christian way when you think about you and say well that's just the wrong way to do it that in dealing in business with a Chinese company is not necessarily it that's not really the way to approach biz they are way more practical than that that doesn't mean that the average Chinese person is not moral or ethical I don't know but certainly you will get burned if you are playing by the rules that you are used to which would be just don't do it because it's not the right thing to do right that's not gonna find its way a lot of times when you're dealing in commerce with China well you're dealing with the military dictatorship but thinks about things is the same way they think about correct they are not our ally there are I believe they are our enemy into alert I mean they'll do whatever they can I think to get an upper hand they also now have enough wealth and they have a huge middle class where they can almost start they're starting to become way more self-sufficient they daren't we don't have the symbiotic relationship we used to with China China doesn't need our consumers as much as they did not even close they have their own consumers in their own country what's weird is that we need them what's weird is how much we need them for the manufacturing of Medicine 97% of all our antibiotics is so crazy it's how do we ever let that shine and India is it because money it's more fish is it more efficient or is it more cost effect it but were there because there because of magic no yes but can't we do their factories are amazing they're incredibly efficient but the Chinese see people worried about the Chinese I don't think they'll ever be in our area kotas innovators they'll delve they steal from us they take our intellectual property etc but there'll always be that'll always be a catch-up game yeah and part of the reason I think is that that I love the quote from from why nations fail I believe China yes they put their users in concentration camps you I went in Beijing the first thing they said is you cannot speak about the government if you say anything about the government you will be sent home oh and by the way here's a cellphone Brian you can use WeChat you're not using your iPhone when was this this was when I did a movie this summer two summers ago so they gave you a phone to use uh-huh and they said you can't use your phone on you and you don't get on Google you have to find thousands of firewood you have to find all different ways to get over there far because they control the internet there make no mistake so can you use a VPN I don't know what that is Virtual Private Network or you expressvpn you try to do that and then they block that too so you have to keep coming up with new ways I was right there with the production designer and assistant who is dealing with so you're essentially at the mercy of their their news of course so so here's the thing there's a great quote and I've said it before probably even on this podcast and I love it you can hold a gun to a man's head and make him move a box or a rock you cannot hold a gun to a man's head and make him have a great idea and as long any country that's great well it's a great quote so China Russia you guys have great weapons and you have great power and manufacturing you you will never be a country of great ideas because they're present because you oppress people and people can't give you motherfuckers the finger G is the most powerful man in China along with his people his is his inner circle and if you in any way look at the whistleblower isn't it interesting the whistleblowers the original was supposed on the coronavirus are dead and they were there were doctors in their thirties did they die of the disease did they or what happened the journalists and a lot of those those doctors were disappeared they just didn't they're dead or they disappeared China can do that and somebody who lived there for their whole life I was there and he was an American and said people get disappeared here all the time dude you don't you don't speak against the government it just doesn't happen and I think that's one of the great evils and that's what I worry about any time we have a pandemic like this where the government can just shut you down yeah at the behest of the scientists and doctors I suppose but I get very worried when someone like Gavin Newsom can say nobody's going back to work for a month I'm not saying that right now that isn't a sound policy I just get very worried when the government has that kind of power to shut off once they start once they start with that kind of totalitarian power of course is very difficult to turn that off that's right it's for our own good yeah if you study history it's always for the people's good well that's what an Edward Snowden is warning everybody about this now he should be when he came to power talked about that when he said this is when I think there was a there was a fire in the Reichstag and he used these starten see yeah use these emergency powers yeah to suspend civil liberties they started the fire so they could do that there's a false flag there you go yeah they did that's the same way Nero burned Rome yeah same reason yeah it's the age-old you know so just well that's the art that's what the the conspiracy theorists think that 9/11 was yeah yeah good for them I I don't mind there I I appreciate their paranoia I think that's American yes I don't think that's a bad thing and I think you should always be who what's the fundamental question into political philosophy the fundamental question who governs the governor yes very important yes very important with the fuck government who's governing the guys yeah I don't trust my government and I shouldn't no you shouldn't it's also like people that have power like the kind of unchecked power that you see in China they're not gonna give that up career populist fight for it they're gonna fight for it well you see that with career politicians you see that with this this bill that they're trying to pass to to help people that are dealing with this coronavirus because they can't work and there's slipping all kinds of stuff they're all slipping things in there about the environment arse guys that is something that politicians do they utilize this moment to try to use it to leverage their own causes their own pet causes things that they think are also important there are a group of people that did that with the invasion of Iraq when 9/11 came along they said look Iraq is harboring al-qaeda terrorists they probably are getting weapons into the hands of people like oh ok there was a whole story that was woven up and that was a way of essentially crippling the fourth largest army in the world which was Iraq and making our allies Jerry here the Bill Hicks bit he goes they said Bill Iraq is the fourth largest army he goes yeah but after the first three there's a real big drop-off he's like the fifth-largest is a Salvation Army it's so true yeah had a whole great bit about the size of armies well we've been in we were in Afghanistan for how long was it guys because he goes hey bill they say bill it's a war when there's two armies fighting yeah he goes but Bill Iraq is a fourth largest army in the world doesn't mean we want to stay there he had some great bits man some great points shit yeah outside the box that's what I'm always amazed at is how these things can carry on like if you there's somebody did a really cool funny thing about how every general in the Iraq in the Afghanistan theater every single every single year would say we are at a turning point where the Taliban will be under our control every every every time they would make a case for the Iraq war more money I'm sorry for the Afghan Afghan war more money more logistics all those things that required more troops the generals would say we are it was always the same wording we're at a turning point and we are gonna we just need a little more and that's well that's what they have to say yeah but what's interesting is if they really did accomplish that they'd actually cut off the honey pot of course it wouldn't have the money comes Ryan that's that's that's the darkest conspiracy ever that war is prolonged in order to prop up the military-industrial complex and what's really crazy about the military-industrial complex is when there was Eisenhower talking about it on TV which was really terrifying that was when the first people were introduced to this concept but Trump was talking about recently you know Trump's doing this thing he's like well you know this is a military industrial complex and these guys want to go to war like he's just saying it's very casually like hey man who are you talking about like who are these fucking there's a lot of money in it and and not only that there are other people nongovernmental organizations to that get rated by their burn rate so we're gonna build a dam here well we don't need a dam here but we're gonna build it anyway because we're a lot of that money there's a lot of that goes on so it's that's why whis conspiracy theories I'm I'm Way more apt to believe that the governments is way more incompetent that it is confident I don't it's just a massive bloated bureaucracy that doesn't run well and I know I know guys I know there's a group of people controlling everything the fuck outta here there's a little bit of that there's definitely a lot of incompetence but there's also a lot of collusion there's also a lot of people doing things specifically because they know it's profitable to make money yes yes and also look what they're doing there Bernie Sanders to try to keep him from winning the DNC from leading to the Democratic nomination they've conspired and they put a guy who literally is going scene that's what's shot that's what shocked and they're trying to pretend it's not happening how about Amy Klobuchar she's great or they're a lot of ice she didn't know who the President of Mexico was she had no idea what random yes but she's doing interview with a guy from Mexico but she's smart she's a smart woman who like I just think she's way more moderate and she seems to articulate 179 listen just because someone seems articulate doesn't mean they should be the president true if you don't know who the President of Mexico is maybe you haven't done enough studying yeah yeah do you know who the president was no idea I'm not trying to her today I barely know the guy from Canada the Trudeau guy I just know him because he's been busted with blackface my lol well his father was a it was a long time yes yeah listen man I don't think anybody should be President back yeah no I think it's a terrible idea I think you're there's no way you really can be responsible for all those things there's no way you could really be well read on all the different variables and everything when it comes to economics when it comes to the environment when it comes to military operations when it comes to the fuckin energy and industry there's no fucking way one person it should be a large group of people that are that essentially have no stake in the game it should be people that have no no ability to profit whatsoever they get a healthy income and they cannot profit outside of that there should be reg there should be some sort of a regulation and then after you're gone it should be impossible for you to make speeches to banks whether you get paid a half a mil they're supposed to be cooling off period and Elizabeth Warren wanted to year cooling off right now there's only a six-month or and a month like if you work for if you're if you work for the Department of Defense you can't go back to Raytheon or Boeing you know you're not supposed to be able to go back for at least two years oh great so two years ago man two years I'm gonna be so rich oh boy 24 months goes by quick yes it does should be 200 years I agree to the average the Scientology contract yeah where it's billions and billions of years you can never do it you know that billion-year contract it's a wonderful contract it's enforceable yeah yeah man I don't know it's not this is anything wrong with Amy Klobuchar look I think tulsi gabbard was the most interesting I liked all of them to me and they shut her out quick soon as she sank Kamala Harris it like Young Harris thing they wanted Kamala Harris to win and she sank her in one debate yeah when when she stated all those irrefutable facts and everyone's like whoa she's throwing bombs she did didn't she they fucking her out of the mix after that they cut her out of the mix quick it's interesting man because it's obviously not let's see who the people choose it's let's manipulate the opinions of the public this is what the whole game of running a campaign is let's prop someone up let's make them look great let's have these ads with wonderful music and then standing there looking presidential and then even in spite of all that you've got this poor guy in Joe Biden that is experiencing dementia c77 housing yes and Bernie's old in him Bernie's a Dior he had a heart attack right yeah walking heart attack while he's on campus and big book a few days off and like we're back yeah we're back in for the pain yeah I look Bernie at least believes what he says he's also he's also though one of the knocks on him is feel like he's not interested in if you ask him how you're gonna pay for all this you're talking about Bernie looks at the world is right and wrong and it's a moral issue for him so and he is and he did take his honeymoon in the fucking Soviet Union say what you will I do believe the guys essentially a closet communist yeah I said son-of-a-bitch I said it I said and I always marvel at socialist it's not Democratic Socialist yeah but I still marvel at the idea that if you if you really trust government again it comes down to are they as efficient as the marketplace in some ways they might be but in other ways they may not be I don't know how they're not doing a great job with the homeless situation in California are they it's the worst job ever yes they really fucked that back dunno if you could blame that on Democratic socialists that that's blamed on that's actually a law that you can't remove someone from a place unless you have another place to bring them to yes yes and it was a lot to protect poor people and people that were harassed and then it became a homeless law and now you go into the underpasses and this is my thing that everybody said like how come it's okay to litter for them like they're basically littering they have junk stacked up if you throw a fucking coffee cup rightly so out of window the cops should be able to pull you over and give you a fucking ticket and you should have to pay that goddamn ticket but if you were just tenth and you have boxes and shit and cardboard all over the place yeah you're allowed to do that and people have to leave you alone yeah it's not good for them it's not good for anybody to allow these these gigantic homeless encampments to appear under bridges and I don't know what the solution is but I just think that alone like if you put that on the governor or the President or the mayor god damn that's a problem yeah that's a problem that's gonna take so much cotton opiates it comes to mental illness they're already 40 or 50 or whatever they are were you gonna fix them do you know how hard it is to fix a person who's kind of got their shit together you know how hard is to get Bert Kreischer stop drinking right fuck how hard is it to get a person who's got their shit together but has a problem yeah like you can't stop smoking cigarettes you know can't stop gambling how many fucking people do you know that are like that I know all of our friends yes have one thing that they're just like fucking compelled now imagine compounding that to 70,000 people that are at the bottom end of it so instead of at the top end of it someone who makes a good living who has a family and has life insurance and is also a fuckup instead of that yeah you've got someone who's never had anything yeah and people been fucking them over their whole life and they've been on drugs since they were young and they were sexually abused and physically abused and they went to juvenile hall maybe they were in foster care and they were beaten and abused and then here they are at for their brains literally changed yes there's an amazing fucking book by this guy named Joe Newman called raising lions I just read it man I wish I'd read this book when my kids were three this guy they bring this guy in so in the past I don't have you know that's been in the past ten years bipolar disorder in children has been diagnosed 40 fold now that doesn't mean and you know what the solution is typically in the psychiatric ward medication medication than medication that's a third option and Joe Newman comes in a lot of times it fucking great book and he comes in and essentially will say this kids throwing tantrums and is impossible to deal with because he is profiting or she is profiting from that behavior there is a there is their kids are way smarter than you think they are and he instills sort of a very very interesting approach that I've used and that that it's it's I fucking love the book it's a short small book but when you think about without going into the book and stuff the reason I bring it up is when you think about you can change you can literally change a child's brain by with with instilling certain behaviors certain boundaries certain protocols as a parent as an adult as an educator because what you do is you get them to exercise self-control you get them to exercise a form of mood stabilization for themselves but you have to do it in a certain way when you don't do that with children when you let them go crazy freak out and put them in inside sleeps rooms a lot of times what we'll do is wait there's nothing we're doing wrong we're not doing any wrong as adults we're going to we're reasoning with them we're talking to them no no what we'll do is we'll medicate them because they're out of control and there is a window with children where you can actually let them keep going down that path and they are basically and then you put them on these mood stabilizers you put them on psychotics you put them on anticonvulsant drugs sometimes they're on four medications that are in a row and he's had great success coming in and changing all that because what happened was you just weren't getting the kid to exercise the muscles of self-control and there a way to do that it's very simple a very interesting book but what I'm saying is that there is a fucking window with kids where if you don't get to certain kids at certain time with a good behaviorist you're in deep fucking shit and and their whole life spin spirals out of control and then it goes into substance abuse and everything else so you're talking about now adults who've had all that abuse I mean it's I don't know what you would do I really don't know what the fuck you would because they're self-medicating to begin with they're self-medicating to begin with they've been addicted to drugs most of the lifes are all of their behavior has been formed while they're addicted to drugs this is a giant problem with people that are in their 40s and 50s who've been drug abusers their whole life yeah imagining a world with no drugs and no escape from reality and having to be accountable for your actions and then also having to deal with the the things that have been done to you and to try to try to figure out a way to heal from your childhood and your life is over your your your body starting to fail you right you've been abusing yourself for all these years and the idea that there's some simple solution to dealing with 70 thousand people at various stages of that that are currently homeless some some of them that may be able to recover pretty quickly they're just hot on the street for a little bit they're gonna get their shit together they're gonna get out of this they're determined there's a lot of people like that yeah I think people very wide of course they do they do they're very so the addiction rate if you look at the people that really follow this the addiction rate the amount of mental illness is very high very and I think I this is where I think like in Singapore you'd never in Singapore they just don't be put enough in homes and so every you know III do think that there's something humane about taking people who are rolling their own shit up in a ball look I mean by the way you know schizophrenic see those people need to be taken care of yeah they need to be I don't think it's a terrible thing to show up in a padded wagon and take them in to be carefully protective yeah someone might say you're fucking crazy I know scooped you up I know that's that's why I was unconstitutional well yeah that's why you you move the boundaries right and this is the argument against what we're saying right you move the boundaries in any direct Chinn yeah where it's not total freedom and then it can slide further from there that's the problem when you how do you define mental illness right so that's when you say well you're mentally ill so you can't own a gun well people go how do you define mental illness you define that as I had an anger management issue at my heart my work once I suffer from depression sometimes the most polarizing religion versus no religion there's people that think that if you are religious do you have a mental health issue and there's people who are religious that think that if you're an atheist you have a mental health issue this is a like a very polarizing line in the sand that I've heard argued by intelligent people I've never heard that not that I've seen intelligent people that have blinders on that think that if you're an atheist you're a fool and you probably have a mental illness and you probably have this extreme belief in science above God and above the the laws of the Bible and they'll say it in this articulate way like goddamn this guy believes that he really believes that all atheists have a mental health problem so if if you get a person who's in a position of power that can also run this ideology they have this ideology like one of the things that almost all presidents do but particularly right-wing presidents ever since Reagan started introducing the religious aspect of the right into like politics they made it a big deal during the Reagan campaign you see that so many presidents particularly on the right have to talk about God they have a have to they have to talk about the consternation still you bring people in this is we're you're on my side I'm not in the gods hi yeah and you see that argument argued by many people were like fevered Trump supporters the one that really really wacky one so I'm like super into God wanting Trump to be our president and then you get this group of people they get into power and you've got some law in place that says it if you're mentally ill you can be locked up how many steps does it have to take before it slides do you it might be like a few yeah and I agree I do like where I like religious thought in discourse and even in policy it's a limited but I do like the idea that when you think that you can get human beings out of all problems using human rationality mathematics and science you better be careful with that too because you can you can use math and rationality to justify some pretty horrific things and just and the Nazis did everybody else so there is something really really cool about X and you Val Harare comes in on this and so does Jonathan height you know there is something really kind of what one of these John tonight says we're all religious all human beings are religious some people are just religious about science some people really is about rationality at all costs some people are religious about you so you'll you'll time people religious about nutrition so you got to remember look look here you got to you got to take an inventory of your own brain and how you how your belief system works as well politics are as close to religion yet honor people they there's also like rewards for adhering to one or the other ideology especially in an aggressive way because then you get rewarded for being the watchdog of either right-wing values or left-wing values progressive values surprise yeah we all do a man people have done it it's it's a thing that we do it's a there's a reward there you pick it up well I got a kick out of this with this kovat thing I whenever if somebody says socialist I go like this I go I well good keep them away there get them away no no socialist and and and I always I have a very visceral reaction to people like a OC or Bernie Sanders because I think that they're socialists right but having said that this Cova disaster which nobody saw coming crippled the economy we I I know people who are very right and not right-wing but very market oriented people who said we need this fucking tomb built trillion-dollar stimulus that's a socialist measure you better I was looking for the government for a bill I don't need it but I want I want that two trillion dollars in the system that had to be mandated by government politicians and in in Akko vyd 19 scenario guess what bit of a socialist you know I find myself going ants why I think the idea of there being one or the other it should there's to this these are too complex it's too many super complex issues to lump on one side or the other it's too hard like a person who's an expert on financial intervention or industry intervention to provide medical equipment to deal with respiratory virus virus that hits people to an unprecedented rate that's not a left-wing or right-wing thing that's a thing and if that gets lumped into socialism versus libertarianism we got a fucking real problem because that's a good idea for everybody yes right yes well Jordan Peterson said something I thought I'd never forgot he said when you get that level of detail when you're trying to solve problems get food on you know get a lot of protein and carbohydrates and fats into the I'll say 300 million human bodies or you're just running a restaurant or whatever it is when you're trying to get something done get get manufacturing of medicines away from China into the United States when you get to the level of detail left-wing and right-wing politics seem to go out the fucking window yeah you're dealing with practicality now we got to get a job done and I don't I don't know if you're if you're in the fucking you know geese or you're you know if you're a transect I don't give a shit can you do the job well let's get this job done and then we can talk about the other stuff that's kind of what happens yeah I notice in a war zone when I was in Afghanistan I don't say Afghanistan anymore I like to be you became less often I like to be more American Afghanistan when I was not guys done I remember no no the soldiers would talk politics none of them they were like God that's not bad I'll talk about that right now I got a job to do I got a job to do I'm not I I know what my mission is and that's the way it is mm-hmm so when you get the level of details a lot of times it's what I think a lot of times when you deal with people who are really practical in a real world where they have to make a profit with their business or whatever they do when they're when they when they live in the real world they tend to be more moderate to maybe more market oriented and when you get people that have been in an academic setting their whole life in a political setting their whole life where they make they make laws and they make you know they and you have academics that come up with theories to support those laws they tend to be a little bit less practical a little bit more theoretical just by the nature of how they live their lives on a daily basis you know it's interesting I was just thinking this while I was talking about these complex issues like why are we voting for a person like one individual leader that handles all those things why why instead isn't there a vote for the person who's got the best solution to each of those individual problems and those are the people that run the country mmm you know I'm saying I do mean the idea that I love that that seems like that's a possible idea you mean so you'd get out you get an economic study many made a lot of money to run the economy yes yes yes you get an economic president yes yes you get a square's life that's why I like Mitt Romney otherwise guy was fucking you know and I could Malik stud against you now also Mexican his dad's Mexican I didn't know that dad tried to run for president because his dad was born in Mexico he couldn't run for president I thought he was white as could be well he is because he came from the Mormons who escaped and moved to Mexico so they can have all these wives let's keep this party rolling in community now huge and they you know that was the big story with the cartel is slaughtered nine of them they were firemen in children why did they ever find those guys they ever find out why don't I don't think they have a definitive answer obviously because everyone's dead but I think they either did it because they were always in dispute with those people from the Mormon colonies or because they mistook them for someone who was in another rival gang it's hard to tell you know the cartel you know they're not big on interviews after they yeah I know so I don't know what happened and I don't know if the people that shot them were punished by the cartel there was something that II D call Tehran said that would probably happen they would do it publicly because they don't want to start a war but like it's the whole thing's crazy we got a giant multi-billion dollar drug industry that's connected to us yeah I love legalizing it how's the fuckin work on that like imagine if you had to choose between like what are your big problems is your big problem the massive amount of drugs that are coming into the country that are killing people and addicting people or is it important to hold it down in Afghanistan some places on the other side of the planet you got a place that's connected to this directly affecting people like in this really weird way it's like the best thing ever heard Bill Maher said the best thing was when he said terrorism isn't gonna kill you America it's the corn syrup and all this shit he's right he's right he's I don't know if it's him writing or his monologue writers but they make some great points with his those monologues that he does for real time he makes some great points yes funny shit too but it's yeah the the we have a problem in that whenever you tell someone that they can't do something which I don't agree with at all don't get me wrong about this whole drug issue I don't think you should be able to tell a guy who's 60 years old he can't do meth that fucking I wants to do man I agree he should be able to do math here's the question is should it be okay for you to sell in math well that sort of gets weird because I know you're a piece of shit of your selling mouth you sell on this poor guy math you know he doesn't need math Bryan needs a hug this is what would happen if you had if you made all drugs legal they'd get zoned they'd get taxed there would be ways to do it you look you want to you want to do meth but watch this become sales would be like this it'd be exactly like this you you want to do Matt first of all if you want to work for my company no math I got a private company no math you can't do math I know it sounds crazy but you're not an efficient worker you want to be a pilot no math you want to be a cop no math you want to work in my factory heavy machinery no math video games I mean maybe it'll help you but if you want to lose your teeth god you're fucking idiot God so I think again cocaine now we're gonna have very pure cocaine and guess what to get it from leaf to powder less murder no murder in fact how's that sound it's locally sourced how's that sound you can do your blow and again you want to do blow I gotta wake up in the morning I I can't be up all night I would love to do blow I love blow I can't do it cuz we've done it probably spy six times in my life blonde fantast and you love it and you've never done it more it's the best truck of all time really it's the best drug of all time III again please like the joke is when two people are doing blough they start a business together you know how to mean it's like let's just fucking open a candle store and it's not the best idea in the world but I don't do below I don't I'm not a drug guy I don't have time yeah you know but but what the point is if you had a place I could go and it was pure and it wasn't cut with a bunch of shit I don't know about right and I knew I could do it and fucking talk to my friend or have sex with some you know whatever it is maybe if I had time but it was consistently a responsibility if there was consistency yeah like if all drugs that were dangerous for illegal yeah then maybe I could kind of get your point right but how many people died of overdoses every year of prescription drugs a lot how many people abuse prescription drugs alcohol yeah exactly which is the most destructive drugs and one the most readily available right and is an essential that's open while we're keeping social distancing yeah alcohol yeah so so so again I ask you tell me the difference so what we've done is supported a horrific criminal enterprise all over the world yes in all of Latin America would continue to yeah and and and so many innocent Mexican women and children and men and and businesses and lives destroyed and so many Central American law and and and it's just destroy the fabric of others now imagine you're supposed to take care of this problem end coronavirus end the economy okay end healthcare yeah and you're running for reelection and North Korea and Germany what all right when they call drugs legal I think it is a logical way of looking at yeah but I think that the growing pains of that okay would be people would lose their fucking minds at you if they'd lost their children during the growing pains and they can attribute their child overdosing on heroin because their son bought it legally and left it in the house and now someone's dead sure and you have a lot less of that because eventually eventually I'd have a lot of this heroin to be regulated you when you went to a store I bought heroin just like with weed you know exactly what you were getting you weren't getting shot you were getting no no what's the other fentanyl you get you get you know exactly what you were getting I'd have it I'd have a place you could do it if you wanted it'd be all kinds of stuff and then by the way and you can't sustain that habit you the people that are junkies would be junkies anyway but at least there'd be a place would be a safe place for them to go and get it maybe to do it like they do in Zurich but more importantly I legalize all fucking drugs because I don't know cuz this war on drugs ain't going so well there'd be a lot less murder I'll tell you that in my opinion well we would need someone to figure out first of all how do you have less people that are that's another Edie called how do you have less people that are even interested in doing heroin like we've obviously done something terribly wrong if we have people that are interested in heroin like why why are people willing to do drugs like crocodile you know that yes it was making there that's the real problem in fixing it with a patch left or right oriented patch be careful the tip of that thing the knife pokes through at stab me love that so much that's a gift from Edie he's the same guy that brought me to death what I want a knife dude please give me one of these I want to carry this with me I figured out how to death whistle you just blow on it I give it to you but the social distancing rule give me that shit fuck yeah it's gonna say you can't give a fuck people are watching that's true actually III but that's what I'm saying mean imagine someone who has to take care of each one of those things yeah just not sure each one of those things is ridiculous let's a president of the homeless this one guy when we do that we have like well we have drug czars we have but they don't have the kind of power that I'm gonna give them yeah I'm gonna give them presidential power I don't think one person should be able to like let people out of jail and do this and move that what if we had one person that stays in his fuckin lane like what are you really good at but we have it that we have it secretary and energy secretary we have an education here's what I work in this cabinet what I'm saying is like a king of immigration yeah this is the king this is the person of the queen of immigration the queen of environment yes so female wins it so you think giving apologies more power as the actions in Queens omit to the job I don't like this idea I call it a president called the head of mothers we do we where's ours ours fucking a king but no one big yeah but I'm talking about czar means it's their big day right the budget they do everything yeah but they do doesn't czar come from so you have the drug czar you've got the educate czar comes from Caesar right isn't that Russian for Caesar the king is that what it is it's a Russian name it's a dope bazaar anytime you can say Zhou sorry I made a drug czar I was like what I'll be the sex our number what's that I know it means Russian and Prussian I think Zara means Caesar doesn't it I think that the route is if you had one person in this country that that was autonomous they didn't need the approval of the top president guy they just had a thing to solve they don't need his like no no that'd be a terrible idea why because you're a well I mean think about an education Queen I mean like look at Betsy DeVos she's got her ideas on how to run classrooms but there's massive pushback from teachers and everybody else so so very controversial sons which one she now here's which one loves Jesus cuz that's the one I'm voting alright I heard that argument about George W someone said well George W is with Jesus so on with George w Wow yeah man there you go that's how you get in and you want to be the education Tsar what do you want teaching a bunch of fuckin pagans about Zeus and shit the fuck out of here that's that's changing we need our Jesus um technology all the way back technology as with the Enlightenment as you were able to predict the movement of the planets that was radical because I was at everyone went hey wait the Bible doesn't tell us that this guy Haley Albert Haley was able to predict Halley's Comet her or Newton or Copernicus or Galileo who are proving this stuff mathematically they were revolutionaries holy fuck it was so outrageous but the church was like wait a minute this is destroying the existence of God when Einstein came along and said time and space are relative depending on how fast you're moving wide think about how important education is right it's the most important thing and just giving someone tools to shape their mind now think of it in terms of the prestige that you get as being just a high school teacher it's nothing it's nothing no one cares you're doing one of the most important services to a young mind that ever you teaching them literally filling their minds with information imagine if someone was in charge of Education in this country who could who could convince everybody who had a real philosophy and a real strategy for educating kids and talked about it in a way like this is how we're gonna make we do have that no one person who's the president one person one person can solve these problems we elect them I'd be the terrible idea presidents know who's gonna be the president of education education yeah this is the crowds they all get together they you have to have open debate the president can have all power what this is my new take on it we need dictators that are benevolent oh my god you're a monarchist you fucking monarchist imagine that's what really works that's what used to happen they define powers have one really nice person who runs the whole thing one nice person one really I don't believe in nice people I don't think they exist I believe human beings are nice people but human beings are one of the nicest people I know but I'd be a terrible cause why I've had to like kick people out of your life it's true cuz of my game man I trust everybody I love everybody you love everybody you let everybody in I got I got fucked over recently badly fine did you there's a couple of times in your life where I've had to pull you aside yeah hey fucker yeah if I didn't love you I wouldn't be telling you this yeah it's time to run so yeah it's true I I am I suppose I'm I'd be a very bad cop because I'd be like whatever dad need dad hit you like what the fuck all right I'm gonna let you go but god damn it if you do think I'm a new buddy I'll let you know certain things I'd have no mercy for though of course yeah yeah of course yeah that's the thing right there's like things that people can do were you like you know child murder that's it see you later no coming back see you later there's things like that even if you even if I catch you with a large trove of child pornography you can't what am I gonna do dude if that's really what turns you on I got it I don't know what have you seen one of the weird you know cuz progressive ideology right like we were talking about before really is in some ways is a religion just like conservative ideologies it takes on some of the some of the characteristics of a religion the when there is people predicting this but almost in jest that one day people that are so progressive they would look at people who are pedophiles and saying that this is this is just who they are and this is like this is their sexual programming like how they are as a person and we shouldn't judge them by who they are that's fine I can even watch this I'll grant you that watch this so so let's say with like Robert Sapolsky work or people like this who are studying this stuff we don't know we don't know I don't think people choose to be pedophiles what happens is they wake up and they go I have I have this irrational attraction to children okay so you're attracted let's say there's something horrible now III grant you that your brain works this way I still can't have you if you have these impulses I can't have you out in society bro now if you want to volunteer for castration or if there's a if there's a way to get you to not have these urges now we can talk but if you if there if I don't know how to mitigate or erase that kind of deep-seated programming you've got to go away I got to know where you are at all times I can't have you near children that this is why we incarcerate these people Yeah right and so it's I think we're gonna be facing that exact question we're gonna be saying it the more we learn about the brain and that we're gonna be realizing you are programmed a certain way okay we all are now to what degree if you listen to Sam Harris Sam doesn't even believe in free will you know Sam will tell you we have no control over the the mechanics of how we make a decision when did it start I mean what happens the ball skis book behaves about this I don't know I still can't run a society that gives free rein to people that cause destructive harm you know the story about there was a guy who had tumor in his brain yeah and the tumor was literally turning him into a pedophile yes he has the tumor removed they prove it they prove the tumors there so tumor removed all these thoughts go away they come back a few years later they do another MRI and they find out the tumors returned like what do you do with that because here's a guy like you almost you he got sick he literally got sick and that sickness led to him being a criminal there's also a a you can have a lesion on your brain the size of a the head of a pen if it's in the right part of your brain it will turn you into a homicidal maniac oh we know these things so really yes yes in fact it's in a series of lectures by in the great ideas of psychology and it's really fascinating that you can by Daniel Robinson or David Robinson is an amazing guy but but but yeah and and there is that case and there has then there have been cases of this we know that there are parts of the brain when damaged can cause you to be fucking you know amazed I'm a maniac what if they did that to people like if you you really wanted to be the ultimate soldier and they had like a part of your brain that turns you into a berserker and they would just hit that switch yeah well they say that a lot of what they do psych evals on high level operators and some of those people are able to shut off certain parts of their you know they can be great fathers and husbands and brothers and they can also shut off and when it's time to shut that off everybody dies and they can it's called you can deviate it's called there's a term for it like sociopath you can deviate into a sociopath you can deviate into that space make the decisions that have to be made and then come back to morality yeah do that if you have an ideology if you're protecting your homeland or whatever it might be that's a formidable soldier who's trying to protect what he loves well and who faces the reality of the necessity of that like runs into really bad people in parts of the world that really are torturing and murdering people making videos and putting them up on you too like you run into those kind of people and you actually see them in the world you see the damage that they're doing to people in the real world I know a lot of soldiers have felt that way who saw that shit and they were like listen man that's why I killed him and I slept well last night you know there's something about what's going on now for all of us where there's this massive wake-up call as to the frailty of our society the-the-the how poorly we've thought out all the consequences of any sort of global pandemic or any natural disaster how ill-prepared we are yeah and this is a this is a good opportunity to wake up and look at what we're doing and look how fucking soft we are like it's fine to be nice it's fine to be nice well you know have you noticed that now we're in this pandemic and you don't hear there's not a lot of talk about progressive no ideas and equality well the real progressive ideas you're seeing from people like nurses and doctors and health care workers that are there putting their fucking their physical health on the line taking care of these people you're seeing people that are chipping in and food shelters and and you know when food kitchens and trying to feed people that are poor you're seeing people there's a lot of people putting together GoFundMe yes the comi store is putting together a fund right now to pay for the waitstaff there's all these different things that are happening there are people putting together that are happening organically mm-hmm this is what we want what we don't want is mandated charity mandated socialism Matt be mandated and that's what people have a problem with because what they're worried about is in great times and times that things are amazing we're worried about people who don't want to do their share we're worried about people where you've created a simple easy path for them and they're taking it every time and time again that they're lazy and they don't want to do any work they don't there's people that are like that that's different than what we're experiencing now what we're experiencing now is the best case scenario for human nature in terms of the outpouring of generosity that you get from a lot of these people that are trying to help other folks that are in need yeah you're gonna have some negative stories you're gonna have that too but what this really is is a wake up call is that we've had it really really really easy and because that we were finding things to be outraged at and the people that experienced real strife in their life and real difficulty they get angry at that stuff and they get angry at that stuff for a reason because self-indulgence is fucking dangerous yes because it's catchy and because you tell all your friends the y'all yeah but yeah you'll have a good point the government should just fucking pay us we should just get paid why these billionaires have money there should be no billionaires how about how about good grammar being racist because if you if you correct somebody's grammar maybe that person didn't have the education therefore you're being you're being racist because maybe that that person of color doesn't use the kind of grammar that's standard English this is this is a new idea too yeah there's a lot of these new ideas that people look for things to be outraged about well won't it's hard to get food and again right now the power still on okay right now everything is at least three-quarters of what it was - the unemployment right they're stuck at home but you're with the people that you love you can talk to them on your phone you can watch Netflix you can do a lot of shit still can't go to restaurants can't go to movies but you can't go to work but you you're kind of still around and then you've got your financial issues but what if what if it went one step further do we not understand how fucking fragile this is what if it went one step further one rock from the sky slams into Chicago one big-ass fucking mile wide Rock slams into Chicago kano or volcano in Montana that won't stop bubbling how about that Yellowstone thing that's a giant caldera that's 300 kilometers wide or something stupid like that okay I think it's actually 600 kilometers that's how big is the caldera climate change is a very real thing and most of us are walking around going man not for us God will protect us well the problem with that is people weaponize the idea of arguing about climate change and if you even have a question about it or even different if you it's one of those things and this is not that the experts aren't correct I am with the experts I'm with the science on it I'm a hundred percent in belief that human beings are accelerating climate change that's not my point my point is if someone even brings up how do you know if you're arguing about it voraciously right you're you're like really into fucking or you know some people that love arguing about climate change and they love putting you in your fucking place yes the oceans are gonna be on fire and they get crazy with it yes and if you even have a conversation where are you getting your information from they don't really have a good source yeah it's not like they've spent time studying these papers and looking at the trends and reading books on core samples and talking to you about these shifts and here's the problem with this shift this shift is different than the other ones cuz it's clearly co2 engine yeah I tried saying with a group of people all I try to say is I go I don't like Trump either but I will say and I was gonna say I I appreciate it as China policy and certain things I literally was met with this that I went I went but I will but I don't don't fucking go give me a but on this you know I'm like Jesus Christ yeah are you that afraid of my ideas well there's a Trump thing like you either hate Trump or you love Trump right you know you can't say like I I get criticized as being some of a closet Trump supporter because I say anything he's funny he's going to he's fun cracks me up we're professional can be hilarious he's funny look how about stuff that's not even if no one even gets hurt the one when he took Greenland and he put a giant Trump Tower on it and he tweeted I promise not to do this if we buy he's hilarious that's funny that doesn't mean you're a Nazi okay and I think this is gonna calm some of that shit down yeah this is gonna give us real things to be outraged about and this is a wake up call that you know our medical systems that we have in place to deal with pandemics they're underfunded they're underfunded they have to be or they're under underutilized or there's something wrong there's something wrong I don't want to say what the causes I really don't know I'm an idiot something has left us unprepared okay let's uh play blame anybody it is what it is no one saw this coming but now that we know that this can happen yeah this has never happened before all the years since 1776 we never walked down the country like this but we did and the whole world did so let's move forward with a fucking heavy emphasis on putting the brakes to that kind of shit figure out what we have to do is it because you only have a hundred scientists on it instead of a thousand yes let's hire nine hundred more yeah like what are we doing you're spending so much money on other things have a science King yes science let's have a fucking science King what's the difference between King as are we have a tiger King let's have a science yeah president science president everybody's a president of something economic president and that way when something goes wrong you'll go fucking if drop just opened the borders now you hear like don't know it's the border Kings problem yeah the border king says we got to keep the borders closed it's not Trump Trump doesn't get to see stuff okay we have a border King voted run king with a Sky King we have a sky Kingdom really no he runs the skies what I make sure it's clean yeah guys up there with a fucking little strip I kept testing it every day scoop and see like hey Sky King how come this guy still dirty fucking idiot I need blame the Sky King all right you can't blame Trump and his cronies you bring Sky King I like it I want an elk you do we don't invite me sorry listen you don't do it anymore you don't really do it dude I'm dead I'm gay my sweetie I love you yeah there's the level between doing what we did where you have a rifle yeah do oh you're doing BOSU in both it's so much work you get to the point where you can do it efficiently Oh cuz you're doing badly yes though I show up with a gun well you can definitely do that if the place is if it's legal to have a gun you know the place for that for you would be Hawaii really yes lanai access dear you and I have to shoot them you and I need to go to my friends property in New Zealand and sure but they probably need to shoot those to New Zealand doesn't they do they don't have any he's got fire drivers beaches Candida Branson wolves bring some wolves to New Zealand dude what could go wrong [Laughter] his jet skis with fucking orcas he sends me video he's on his jet ski on his private beach he goes yeah orcas under him the first family that gets eaten inside their tent by wolves and that can happen and has happened in history folks the first family that that ever happens to we're all gonna have a big wake-up call as to what a wolf is it's not that I don't love wolves I do love wolves and I went to that wolf connection that rescue out in in the Senate the city of palmdale I went to it really recently with for Escalante and is you seems amazing yeah hung out with them coolest fuck but it's pure wolves are hybrids most of them are hybrids um one of them was about as close to a pure wolf as you can get you couldn't do a goddamn thing with them this guy said that one time he admonished him for a food fight and he was incorrect and the dope the wolf hasn't spoken to him since why three years ago the wolves like fuck you he used to be able to pet him put him on walk take him out now the wolf won't let him anywhere near him really he decide the guy was a cunt three years ago that male male wolves will challenge you and you know certain animals like camels camels if they like you you're good if they don't like you they'll piss on you they'll spit on you whoa and they will grab you and bite you and throw you they pick you up by your neck with their teeth I've seen that don't fuck around with Cairo I saw a guy trying to kill a camel he was trying to you know there's like a certain way they killed camels for some religiously you can eat but a certain way they kill him you know with with a knife they slightly sliced her throat right and he was doing that and this camel was not having it and he grabs him by the back of the neck and just fucking whips him through the air you realize how strong a camel is yeah it bites your neck you're a 150-pound man you're going flying you're gonna fly and it he'll Chuck you just Chuck you like you throw a housecat Bourdain ate camel he said it was really good all right yeah would you was it like delicious was it taste like it's like goat you know I guess a lot of times in in Saudi Arabia you eat a camel with a huge feast you'd put a goat inside the camel Wow oh here's one these guys trying to slice yeah this is another one okay yeah right there look at that guy boom son if that thing picked him up by his head he got his whole head in there look at that guy that's his whole head oh my god that wasn't it just the neck that thing grabbed his whole head he's gotta be fucked up bro you might realize yeah no he's moving thank God look at that God yeah I just grabbed his whole house it picked him up by his head yeah dude that could easily break your neck especially thing didn't let go what if it shook him yeah just held on to the house shoved him a bunch of times that thing has mean fuck yeah don't fuck with camels yeah so it's like a goat it's a lot of meat it's a lot of meat how many people eight thirty I don't member I was kid by the way I was 14 13 I ate it so I'm saying go to eat with their hands right you would your right hand yes everything right and you watch your ass with your left hand dirty never give anybody you left so shit caught stealing traditional Saudi they would cut off your last one what was left over oh my god yeah what do you do then just kill the guy like why do you want to live like this now you live with one hand it's fine figure it out you know I don't think we got to the bottom I think Bryan Callen but it feels good to complain I agree buddy I think that's good I think we're with three hours in what three hours and yeah that goes quickly yeah I can't believe that and yeah we are Jesus I you know I'm joking around obviously about the the Kings have a king of everything joking around about it obviously it is kind of ridiculous that we ever think that one person could be the president and run this whole country it's so stupid it's so stupid and it's so tired and when something happens where it's really clear that this wasn't thought out correctly like this and that we didn't know what was coming like this we didn't we didn't ever think because it's never happened before if something's never happened before we always think it's not going to happen or it's a super volcano or an asteroid impact or even though we know that they've happened I'm not prepped enough and I need to get prepped for real people yeah we we keep talking about going somewhere and I'm not bullshitting about that how about a place we can drive to short in a short time though you could try to Utah in 10 hours really yeah yeah that's not a bad one or Vegas and that's where I can get a well and lots of guns maybe you can go to Big Bear hmm and just maybe go to Big Bear then they would shut those roads off that's what that's right then you're fucked yeah be up there stuck still stuck with Silverlight well they shut those roads off sometimes unless when it snows out you have to have chains like you have to have changed if you're driving up there yeah it's problem yeah whenever you see those roads to Big Bear that say you must build burns on your tires bill burr can drive a helicopter you can fly a helicopter that's right so bill will be our go-to guy he can't we need a boat to get out and see but we're assuming we'll have good visibility the problem with the helicopter thing is if it's fires if there's fires you ain't seeing shit if it's fires we'll figure it out if it's a pandemic against EU we need the fucking fire president that's what we mean we get the fancy we'll figure it out we need a rock solid game plan we call a fire president who hates fire we have to ever get our hates fire hates it fucking hates fire imagine awful really starting fires do you know that's a thing I know a lawyer defends a kid who starts fires dresses up like a fire and diverts traffic and they catch him all the time and he has to go and be like the kids obviously crazy so he's a sociopath he gets off on creating these issues but he loves being a fireman so he'll start fires 11 times since he was a little kid and now he's an adult and he's in jail now but he yeah he dresses up like a fireman and he likes to divert traffic and tell people where to go and give them advice it's now imagine you have to fix that guy imagine he's homeless you got to fix him you had a homeless guy who likes houses on fire pretends it's a fireman he's so far gone you gotta go to jail what do you do with but you keep him there forever that amount one day they're gonna be more fucked up and they were able to make the jail for crazy people might keep them there keep me in the pleasant chill keep forever Pleasant though forever I don't know yeah until I find a way to get him until he can exhibit that he is fit to go back to society see One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest yes how come they don't have places like that anymore one of the greatest movies of all time do they have places like many of them they have to have enough I don't know but they should have more we have mental we have hospitals for the criminally insane hospitals for you know right but do we have enough cuz I think it's almost like the answer amount of hospitals that we have regular Peter Peter early wrote a book called crazy his son suffers a mental illness and what we do with most of our mentally ill is we put them in jail and I've been to those aquariums that they keep people honest bad that's where it's fucked up too it's like you're also because you're crazy you're also committing crimes and you maybe could have been treated for whatever the mental illness was particularly it's a chemical imbalance right yeah and then you would have never done those crimes and then you have never been in jail so yeah but it mean who's responsible for it Wellum Utley we want adults to be responsible for themselves yeah well this guy said Joe Newman again who wrote raising lions I recommend it highly he said I'm training parents a lot of times you think I was training the kids a lot of times I'm training the parents and the educators on how to how to react to the kid kid is smart and the kid is even the kid is playing spacey and stuff or whatever not paying attention cutting time in school he's enjoying the frustration and the satis he gets he creates frustration in the adult and get social status from doing this I can make it very boring for him I'll make it very boring for him without interest just go hey time to take a break you got to stand over there I know it sucks but if you can throw a tantrum but the time starts for when you're done with the tantrum little things like that huge results just take the profit out of you saying this genius tells them to you to put them in timeout timeout but it's a very specific way of doing it what's his solution kids gotta go to timeout nobody well you get these kids who freaked out that to be put in isolation you argue with them that's part of the president's problem yeah so you can't put him in timeout that's probably true if there was like Nancy Pelosi had like a few timeouts yeah per year she just use it on Trump and Trump would just have to stand in the corner take her take your phone away I'm gonna take a phone away no tweet no no no I fucking legit timeout in in the corner she's that she's a kind of person that would put all of us in timeout she's she's a mom but if she could do that yeah imagine how interesting that would be she'd go like this Donald Donald when we take a break you're gonna go at the boring chair if there was like things that a person could do we had to put him in timeout we we you and I would be in timeout a lot oh and would you be in timeout per year where's a kid right now is a adult if that timeout still no but this is a thing I get a certain point Tom you become the master of your own destiny you know what he can put you in a timeout anymore unless you're at work and you get brought in I need time outs because I'm I'll find ways to procrastinate and get not to the things I'm supposed you imagine if you had a boss at the podcast they set you and Brendan down and we're talking about your job performance I have a problem with it they do that with radio shows that's what radio shows are they're like basically a podcast but with a boss I know I know you know Kevin and bean you know those guys know I love you know Kevin they just fired him I didn't know they fired Kevin I thought Kevin kind of no no no they fired him and then they fired everybody and then just told him they're done go home and they had security guards lead him out of the building yeah even Kevin yes Kevin I didn't know Kevin got fired yeah Kevin oh fuck that's very recent well being left like a year ago I know and then and Keven stayed on yeah and k-rock jimmy kimmel made a tweet about it like how dare you I just did Kevin at me I love you well it's been Kevin's morning show for like since I think January Kevin and is it who's is woman Marla a couple people sorry with her name's Dave but it's not great it's they just fired everybody I just yeah that's crazy so there's no more no no I think it probably happened I mean I don't know if it had anything to do with the corona but it was like when it was kicking in like when everyone was starting to worry about kovat 19 damn yeah I'm very very worried about just what's gonna happen all these small businesses I don't know how much we care about it's terrible that's terrible we need a plan I gotta come is there any good news on this how about this hydrochloric quinine with our myosin does that actually help with sorry guys I'm a doctor is that how I read about that and read that there's some promise to that and I read that there's that in a combination of some other medication so it's essentially this drug that they use to treat malaria it's an old-school drug treatment Lera hydrochloric and then there something else with it yes hydroxychloroquine ein you should be quinine outside it's that different it's that people did that didn't work for malaria anymore and so now as that and you combine that with acid throw myosin like a z-pack I guess and so those two things apparently mitigate the effects of the virus from what I heard but then I heard no so I don't know yeah I mean who the fuck knows there's also intravenous vitamin C apparently has an effect a positive effect on people that are suffering from the illness but again this is all anecdotal they don't have like a real strict protocol of how you handle this disease it's very disease I haven't been as good as I should be I eat food that's prepared by people yeah you never know so you never know yeah they they didn't know before the Carnival Cruise Line thing that it could stay on surfaces as long as 17 days well I heard nine hours it depends on no no no no this is the latest geez the people that are examining the cruise ship or the people are stuck on even people that were asymptomatic they still found traces of this shit 17 days later in their cabins well guess what I'm done how crazy is that asymptomatic people and you can find the stuff in their cab and 17 days later it's still alive waiting for a host I don't think Kristen Lee has left his house germaphobe I just he's just not left his house so he also has a new baby yeah you know but but you know you get something delivered from Amazon you don't know yeah
