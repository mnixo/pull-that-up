welcome back head good to see you again man thank you for having me back well I'm happy you're back but I'm not happy that there was a motivation to bring you back based on the violence you know the violence that is going on between the cartels and it was the Mormons and then there was we were just talking about this other person that got shot because they ran what explain it again they were ran a cartel roadblock yeah basically in Tamaulipas a lot of the cartel groups actually make they build their roadblocks in the on the south state and local roads and according to what I've heard from some of the people that I know they're this family ran one of those roadblocks they didn't know if it was cops or not and they apparently decided to run the roadblock and they cartel guys shot them what should someone do if they encounter a cartel roadblock slow down I mean if if anything I would probably avoid traveling through those areas that's the number one widens usually you know and I've actually gone through some of those myself really yeah and it's it's all about they're all there they're looking out for the four rivals moving through their territory they're looking for government personnel maybe spying on them and usually didn't usually they'll just shake you down for some money and they'll let you go on your way unless you have a 4x4 truck that can use for their you know their own purposes which is what they might take your truck yeah the specifically intimate liepa's 4x4 trucks are a commodity for them they use them for their ongoing turf war all right especially someone else's they don't mind getting shot up yeah I mean most of the trucks that you see eight went that are arm up armored or they have the rifles on top are usually stolen vehicles all of them are sold in vehicles and a lot of them are you know Americans crossing into Mexico some other Americans crossing into Mexico and just getting trucks stolen Jesus is that that's a real common thing it's it's it's starting to be pretty common I recently saw a case of an apparent abduction in in in Tamaulipas you see the video and and in the cartel guys come out of the car they grab the the the owner of a pickup truck they get him out the car they take his cell phone leave it on the sidewalk because they're they're aware of all the SOS technology and they take him inside inside of another car and they take the truck and you thought he would think you know it's it's because he did something or he's involved in something they let him go a few blocks later and just took the truck it was all about the truck Wow yeah it's resources you know they're just acquiring resources for their for the war basically nice of them to let him go nice of them to let him go you know it's not always the case it was a case but it's pretty yeah I think most people in America are just now waking up to the chaos that's going on down there I think that the Mormon assassination was a real wake-up call but I think people are paying much more attention now I mean we've we talked about this was last time you were on it was like five months yes a lot of the stuff we talked about those five months ago kind of that's how things progressed we actually did mention the Mormon community on there which was kind of eerie yeah and we talked about the possible designation of cartels as terrorist attack terror groups yeah you you had an interesting take on that so Trump was saying that they were gonna designate them as terrorist groups and that they were gonna have military action against them yeah and then there was some sort of negotiation with the President of Mexico what do you think went down there so I mean this is just you know from what I see and from how things traditionally happened down there Mexico's currently has a current currently a leftist president now there he's ready to the left so much to the left that he he recently gave ever Morales a deposed leftist president of Bolivia asylum in the country and there's been a lot of you know pro-left political stuff going on in Mexico basically as soon as the designation threat by the u.s. came down there was some sort of negotiation and a lot of things happened after after some US officials went down there and talked to the government among them Evo Morales is out he's he went to Cuba apparently and then went to Argentina so he's not gonna stay in Mexico hmm former head of public security under the Calderon administration which is two administrations past the president Calderon is the one that started the drug war he was arrested for cartel involvement and basically for seeing money from the cartels I saw that yeah he was going through his immigration process and he was actually asking for full citizenship and they got him on lying through the authority of the immigration authorities he said that he'd never received money from the cartels and apparently he did a lot of it right so all these things happen after after they walked back the threat of designating cartels as a terrorist organization so there has been some action so it must have made some negotiation where Trump had said listen we're gonna do this and he's saying hold up let's was talk yeah I mean a main thing is one of the things that this current president unrest manoa lopez obrador ran on was creating a national police force right a national guard is what he calls it which had already kind of been done before but you know change the name change the uniform change the packaging and it's a new thing right he wanted he wanted the army out of the drug war because the casualties were mounting on both sides and he said it wasn't a military shouldn't be a military operation and he ran in a platform that was called a vassals noble lassos which means hugs not bullets right so pastries is crushed amnesty for the cartels was basically kind of the main theme of that so we got into power the first thing he did militarized police forces and create a national garden and dissol and try to dissolve the federal police and most of that National Guard force was designated to border patrol duties on the Mexican side so some of them went to the south of the border I saw the southern Mexican border and some of them went to the northern Mexican were basically to stem the whole illegal immigration crisis with the caravans that's what kind of happened and it was a kind of a collaboration between the US and the Mexican government so that was one of the key points of collaboration that they had and when this whole designation thing went up that was kind of like a bargaining chip that the Mexican government had with the US and the rest of the things that kind of transpired afterwards you know it's pretty interesting how a lot of things happened after that meeting down there and how they walked back the terrorist designation so the terroristic terrorist designation would mean that Trump would have some sort of incentive to invade Mexico it would it would it would open up the possibility for military direct military action against rikes strikes without permission of the the nation that has strikes we're going to take place also targeting finances or anything related to cartel activities would be targeted we have where do the cartels keep their cash well it's it's it's a it's right now it's a myriad of things they diversified long ago so it's not like they're keeping buried cash in a containment container somewhere in the in the jungle like Escobar you to do right right they're still finding some some like rotted cash from the 80s they're putting their money in cryptocurrency that really yeah they're diversifying their other their investments in actual companies like legit companies so they clean their money that way real estate hotels property on the US side so they're also investing on the US side of the border as well so you know money's it's not you know it's not under the mattress or you know giant stacks of cash in the room so what what kind of banks do business with the cartels how do they negotiate that I'm not gonna say names but there's been a few cases of pretty large banks that have been involved in money laundering for the cartels recently and people can look that up easily but you would think you would have a designate cartel you would have cartels designated as terrorists so now they're banks involved in funding terrorism so that would change things that's you know there's a lot of things that would happen you know some some of these consequence designating was a terrorist and sent drones down there things that they kind of don't talk about is that if a terrorist designation does happen most people seeking asylum in the u.s. from Mexico now have the claim of running from terrorists in Mexico so now they can claim that as far as a you know asylum seeking people can claim that now it's a different thing you know that the main argument that a lot of people say is that cartels aren't can't be considered a terrorist terrorist group because they don't have political aspirations the problem with that theory is that we have a lot of political killings by cartels in Mexico where they shoot the candidate of one side of the political spectrum because it's not good for them so they influence politics they also pay off a lot of politicians down there and they also examples of the new generation cartel from Wall Ihara giving out Christmas gifts or groceries to the poor basically doing hearts and minds type tactics in the area are clear political movements yeah so you know how does it turn why is terrorism have to be connected to politics well that's that's in classical the classical definition of that is of a terrorist group that's what they're basing it on I think the cartels and narco-terrorism is a thing in and of itself it's a new phenomenon it should be terrorism should be reclassified to include it I think you know most people that live through that type of situation in that type of and in that diaper area in the country they're facing some of these cartel threats that have fled it we'll call it what it is yeah terrorism terrorism they're terrified yeah I mean that's literally I mean who's more terrifying than the cartels yeah so what's going on with the Mormons now is are they moving out of there now are they gonna go back to Utah just take one wife okay that's what it all started out with right yeah well the fundamentalist group and they they went down there and kind of proceeded with their because customs I'm in contact with with a few of the members of that family and you know cut I was in contact before but when I went on here they kind of like one of them reached out hmm what's going on what's up what do we need to do yeah and then you know it was like a friendly hello from them from past interactions and then this happened and you know I kind of advised a little bit but that's you know it's it's a mess a lot of a lot of they're leaving the communities down there there's a lot of them down there a lot of communities in Sonora kalila and you know that leaving is leaving the area it's just too dangerous yeah it only makes sense I mean they just don't have the arms they don't have the tactics and power and and they're also in the middle of one of the most important regions in Mexico right now for a lot of reasons main thing there's two things that are really really kind of happening in that region one the traffic the trafficking of fentanyl and heroin and all these drugs through one of the main drug routes up into the u.s. and there's a few factions fighting over that region los Salazar which are a small card self action that has allegiances to Sinaloa cartel and the linea cartel which is historically been in control of Ciudad Juarez so they're both kind of buying for control of the area a few hours before the the massacre actually took place there were a bunch of firefights between these two factions in the area so one of the main theories is that these the this group of Mormons basically were case of mistaken identity kind of driving into some of the areas where they're being protected by some of these people it's one theory right the other thing that people kind of need to think about is that the largest my noble my noble deposits of lithium on the planet right now are a few hours away from where that massacre took place really yes and that is you know not conspiracy theory or theorizing here but it's a pretty important thing in that region and there's a lot of interest in that space and control for that space and they're not mining it currently there's a bunch of projects in play right now so they've identified the deposits yeah you know people can look up the numbers but it's it's the largest my novel deposit of lithium on the planet well and there was some sort of deal in the past where a Canadian mining agency was going to have rights to it and the mining agency was bought by the Chinese company so again after that Massacre a lot of things happened a lot of the negotiations happened that problem that deal was one of the things that got killed after that situation Oh No all right so it's it's it's it's an interesting area there's a lot of things happening there that's got to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the cartels in some way right well historically any sort of any sort of mining operation usually has industry around it which is perfect for the cartels you know extortion protection rackets feeding the the drug use in the area from the workers you know that's is there any way that you could see in the future the cartels being extracted from the positions of power that they're in now I mean or is this something the people in Mexico are gonna have to live with forever and I guess people the United States as well or is this something that can be fixed you you've you've talked about before in some of your podcast and I listened to them a lot great podcast thanks Gatewood great you're on - thank you you talk about legalization and how that would help that definitely is part of the solution and it is it is definitely part of the solution legalizing some drugs you know not all drugs are made the same maybe not fentanyl you know yeah but that would help out some things there's there's multiple things that could be done to guide us towards a place where things could save lives down there and a lot of it is not gonna be able to be done in Mexico it's gonna have to be done up here right basically you know when you you have to take care of the US has to take care of the drug market up here the illegal drug market and certain things that have happened like legalization of marijuana and marijuana and some places up here have changed the dynamics of what happens down there some for the better some for some bad some bad things have happened talking to my friend John Norris who was on here as well and comparing notes seeing how a lot of the drug recruits are up here the pot the illegal pot grills are up here exactly like the ones that I found in Baja six seven years ago and how some of that drug money made from those fields are staying in the u.s. it's not being sent back so that means you have an active growing cartel presence in the US that is us-based so I think that one of the the problems that people have is perception is that that's a Mexican problem it's a it's a us-mexico problem you know you have border there but the problem has two root causes right social economic inequality and destabilization and corrupt government down there and a thriving illegal drug market up here and you know those two have to be solved to set me in a combined way how many members when you combine all the cartels how many members are we talking about that's that mean it's pretty hard to put a number on how I will say this more than a million I will say this they defeated the Mexican army in Sinaloa yeah that was bananas yeah when they captured El Chapo son yeah and then the army gave it back yeah like yeah you're gonna have him back well sorry that whole situation and it was like I remember that was happening and I was getting asked questions about her and it was wife it was all of a sudden just popped off you know basically a supposedly official story from the Mexican government is that they send a special police unit to capture him right which is completely false I think because you don't send 35 agents to capture one of the the heads of one of the biggest Sinaloa cartel cells right so it's pretty much by chance they spot at this party people were on there they went there all of a sudden I'll chop one is it so you think they just stumbled into him there's a I posted a video on my feed of the capture of this Chapel son you can see it and you can see the surprise and really how the agents are kind of uncomfortable or are fearful of what they just stumbling on imagine US agents stumbling on one of the America's Most Wanted individuals up here they're gonna put them on the ground I'm gonna handcuff it mm-hmm and the video you can see that they point their rifles at him and he calmly takes out his gun and hands it to somebody inside of the inside of the house he was in and walks out and kind of tries to negotiate with the people outside the federal agents are trying to arrest him and you can see that the agents are like oh what did we stumble in on Wow all right so that happened they grabbed them they reported back to Mexico they captured him they started to announce the capture and his brother his half-brother Archibald Oh basically called in all of the reinforcements from all surrounding towns and regions in Sinaloa and it was flooded with a bunch of armed cartel guys all of us you know it was wasn't there video of the government people in the cartel people talking yeah there's all that there's it's on my feed yeah you can see it if you want it's a it's basically a an army unit that was being sent to reinforce security in Culiacan being surrounded by cartel members yeah is this it right here yeah that's it obviously the guys running around with a vest and wearing skinny jeans or some of these you know oil cartel members and they just talk it through I mean they're outnumbered and also there was there's talk about there's a there's a specific immunity out there and seen in law where all the army families members live and they were apparently being held hostage by cartel guys as a bargain bargaining chip so all these guys we're seeing here they dressed in civilian clothes with the vest those are all cartel guys those are real cartel guys Jesus Christ and that those shaking hands with everybody well you know hey what's up call me I mean they again we go back into the hole what what is the fight they have in them right mmm Sinaloa cartel was basically surrounding some of their communities and Helen holding their family members hostage so that went out over the radio so as an army remember going in to fight the cartel so you know what I'm out of this fight yeah so they raised their hands so then they release the hostages everybody backed out yeah I mean there's they defeated the Mexican government basically anything that went up against you know it surrounded the city usually you'll see classic classic Mexican cartel activity they close off the streets going into the city by burning semis and trailers and stuff like that so you would see all these burning semi trailers in the region so if you want to move in you can't and if you want to use your helicopters the cartels have entire craft capabilities so they broke out a bunch of people from the prison just taking advantage of the whole chaos you can see there's a few other videos whether there's a armored trucks with 50 cals and ma Douce is on the back of them just moving around the city there's no way there's no way you can this is a breakout state prison you know took advantage of the whole chaos and just you know let's just let's let's break some of our friends out all right it's just pure chaos eventually they let that the government decided to let him go that's the the official story but according to the people there there was no government saying let him go there was like the guys holding him said you know what it's not worth it yeah that's one of the the technicals as they call him up here yeah dump trucks the armor plate the sides and put somebody else I'm a Giunta person living there what else is this that's what I'm trying to picture yeah what life is like for the civilians and most of these videos are all done now by civilians so yeah there's a certain normal we'll see in some of these cases especially in Encino law it's part of its it's part of the culture there and as far as sides go you know hey the Army's coming to save us that's not usually what's you keep some people and some of these communities think you know because the cartels are those are the guys in charge so sinaloa always been like that like how long Sinaloa has traditionally being been a cradle for like the origins of some of the hot some of the more successful cartel heads right isn't that where Julio Cesar Chavez is from yeah yes yeah and you know a lot lots of lots of anybody that anybody in law has some sort of relationship to the cartels because they're part of culture there no way getting around it had a surreal experience once when I went there I did a class out there and the was running around this bumpy road and then all of a sudden just flat beautiful road oh yeah this is the cartel part of the road that they build it's like okay so it's like certainly the mob in Vegas and like the 50 gets exact exactly but it's now and way more hardcore way more hardcore yeah some of their grave they have a happiness little Maya is called as is the narco Cemetery they have and it's basically luxury condos they look like I mean I went there I thought it was a church and it turned out to be a tomb Wow all right so the the opulence and the money or it's just overt you know and and how they move around they roll around in vehicles with guns and nobody does anything because they own the city what can be what are they planning on doing it was anybody have any plans or is it just they're just accepting this well you know you you you get a lot of rhetoric about collaboration yeah that's that's hard Unadilla maya all of those are graves some of them have CCTV video inside air conditioning you know alarms there's grave those are grave sites and the cartel guys heads go there on the day of the dead have music live bands to throw a case in through the air nobody does anything Wow Jesus Christ that's crazy yeah I mean the opulence is mate I mean just seeing it you know it's like having several Escobar's in one place you know it's not you know it's like a lot of car a lot of cartels ahead are from that region and a lot of their kids grew up in that and you know the opulence is amazing fuck like is this gonna grow I think it is it's good I mean I don't think it is it is growing you know again going back to my friend John Norris and having seeing his experiences up here finding all these illegal drug rows in public lands it's growing it's growing over here - yeah so roots yeah so I think the thing that a lot of people have to think about a lot of these cartel guys had their kids up here so they made their money down there and they sent their wives up here and a lot of these kids that were born in the late 80s Early 90s coming with age up here with that cartel pedigree so and they're US citizens u.s. passport so you're gonna you're gonna see some sort of shift and you know they're coming of age they'll get experience you get you know a handoff of reins I'm the older generation to your new generation you're gonna see definitely it's definitely growing it seems so crazy to watch because it seems like it's not discussed nearly enough and it it seems like if it keeps getting stronger like what we saw with El Chapo son being released what it what's to stop it from taking over Mexico entirely well I mean you would have people arguing that it already has in different ways so I think another thing that people gonna have to kind of figure out and realize is that there's factions in Mexicans in the Mexican government so you will see a federal government that apparently is being paid off by a very specific large cartel group and then you'll see state governments that are a different political party influenced paying off by other cartel event groups so you'll see you know military units moving on the town and the state police blocking their way to get in there because they play for different teams right whoa you know there's a there's a lot of talk right now about Felipe calderón's tenure and how his head of security of Public Safety was on the payroll of the Sinaloa cartel which actually came out during El Chapo's trial so now you're talking about basically a federal police force that was on don't Apple aside so he had free rein to grow and do whatever he had to do in that region with the support of the federal government in a way so that technically you know who's in control of some regions and and realistically some regions of Mexico are completely cartel control now we discussed this on the last podcast but let's give people a little just a recap of this just so people can understand your position when you first started working on for the with the the Mexican government with this it wasn't like it is now it was so well you give everybody just a rundown of how it went down so I went to I went to work for her state government down in Mexico in Baja specifically and this was and this was 2004 right right before the start of the official start of the kick off of the drug war as take off the kick off but there was you know that the official start was when Felipe Calderon came into office said you know what gloves off gonna go after the organized crime right we're gonna send the military into into this onto the streets and they're gonna head up spearhead operations against the cartels but before that things were happening still you know Sinaloa cartel was growing there was a rift between the Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel and fragmentation cartel heads were being killed and one cartel 203 all this fragmentation and then you know they basically militarized the war on drugs with Calderon came in militarized war on drugs immediately you start seeing that drug drug enforcement efforts were being put towards a single or a group of cartel groups but not the month but not a major one like Sinaloa cartel so you start seeing how they were basically taking sides they were breaking up the competition that's what you would gather from the making it look like progress yeah and oh and also old chapel has been built up into this mythical figure aqui was the head of the Sinaloa cartel he's the main guy and that's not true at all he was an operator for the Sinaloa cartel but not the main operator you know there's different theories and and and about who is actually who was actually in charge or the brain it's behind the whole operation when you say Sinaloa cartel it's not one group it's several it's a federation of several criminal groups enterprises uniting and working in conjunction to put drugs into the into the United States well one of the things they did was put drugs into United States you do a lot of things but that's one of the things they do so you know certain people sure there's a lot of people out there that theorized that mile sambata which is El Chapo's compadre who's still out there is the actual head of the Sinaloa cartel and has been since a start but you see how some of these people become celebrities and as soon as somebody becomes a celebrity like el chapo who escaped from custody a few times you know under you know pretty interesting situated in the situations now the government has a celebrity that can go after so they can point at that guy and that guy's a bad guy right so that you saw a lot of that a lot of theatrics around him as far as him being the head of whatever you know group or operation was but at the same time you started seeing you know the DEA and and the in the US government been decorating and putting all these awards on a guy like Luna who was the guy that got arrested recently who was head of security down in Mexico and now all of a sudden he's no no he's not you know he was recognized by the US government as being a player for the good guys and now he's arrested so you start seeing all these you know different interests different political political kind of movements around the drug war and what that turned into and you know you know what you don't know what they think right each and each also each US administration has changed the way they do things and when it comes to the drug war and also benefits certain groups down there so you know who knows realistic fuck yeah it's just you know I went to Chichen itzá I think in Shh mm - maybe 2003 somewhere around the that time and there was no concern yeah yeah it's a different time yeah that's but that's 16 17 years ago that's so recent in terms of like human history yeah that a region changes so radically so quickly well it's it's it there's a lot of things happening you know there's a lot of interest China has a lot of interest in Mexico and you go back and you see something like this you see things like the the whole house um armed groups started popping up in Mexico in the Michoacan area fighting back against the cartels the the whole it was like series like a documentary on them the the outlaw defense as they would they would call basically like vigilante groups and then you later on you realize that they were all fighting for basically protecting or kink or working around security for illegal Chinese or Myer mining in the area whoa yeah it's all it was all about Chinese ore mining iron ore mining illegal Chinese or mine so the Chinese or miners they just made a deal yeah and then you know that's we can get in on it so let's arm all these guys and we're protecting our communities but they're oh it was a lot of well not not all of them but a lot of there was a lot of shady stuff going on in the region and when it comes to that now you see things like that stuff that's going on in Sonora and there's a lot of lithium there that's pretty valuable thing you know Sonora is a place that a lot of hunters go yeah Sonora has these big hunting ranches and it's like it's famous for giant mule deer yeah yeah yeah it's a I've been up out there hunting myself and it's a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful part of Mexico but that seems like a sketchy spot - but it's venturing its - it's perfect because it it's perfect with them because of rule so there's nobody around but if you were like a guy from Texas want to drive your truck down there it's a little hunting I mean not my recommendation is this if you have a 4x4 don't take it down there take a fucking you go we do have the largest population of American citizens living outside of the country in Mexico for some reason so really yeah in all throughout Mexico yeah I mean all throughout Mexico this one down there well a lot of people like Cabo people love Mexican food yeah yeah yeah there's there's there's there's a certain chaotic freedom in Mexico which out you know I've cut being some a child of Mexico and then moving up here and seeing you guys talk about freedom not that but but there's there's I get the I get the draw you know and some of these communities down there pretty safe but some are you know they're safe until they're not safe and safe until they until they all of a sudden you're in the middle of a someplace that it's gonna be disputed which is I think is something a long one is that what happened to some of these Mormon communities down there hmm you know you're on your you're in the middle of your community and your movements are in the middle of our route could you please get out of the way what's the ceiling on this like if if they can continue to grow I mean it's it's really is it possible that we're looking at a country that might be completely run and overrun by criminal organizations and drug sellers some parts of it are already so what I think is gonna happen is you'll see escalations a clear sign or a clear group that is like a sign of things to come is the is a new generation cartel the new generation cartel is a cartel that was it used to be called los amatis etis there was basically an armed enforcing group that Sinaloa cartel made to go after their main rivals isettas which were originally members of special Mexican special forces that said you know what we're gonna be cartel guys oh now in cartel enforcers now so they whole sordid history these it was a militarized group that was formed formed to go after them right and their whole kind of play was that we're gonna be against extortion against abducting people against the effect in the community we're going to enforce the law in our communities but we're also gonna move drugs through here right but that you know that's kind of their thing so you see this group started kind of rolling in the region and right now it's pretty big it's rivaling the Sinaloa cartel as far as power and reach but the way they do their things is militarized it's very militaristic and kind of paramilitary and it kind of reminds me a little bit about of the like the the FARC groups in Colombia hearts and minds they go into the communities that community policing in the area that he originally said you know we were where the government wants to fight drugs here in the region we agree with their fight but we are also going to fight against these guys that are affecting community as well and they have like groups of people they have they have training camps no medical militaristic trading camps where they recruit people they take them there and they're being trained in gorilla warfare and shooting and apparently there's some SF guys from the US that that advise them so that's that's the next thing the escalation of a simple ragtag group of cartel guys in force in the region to an actual cohesive paramilitary group now trying to vie for control not just of the of the drug routes but also have the populace and confidence of the populace as in them so it could turn political at some point right it just seems like it's the genies out of the bottle it hit I mean it is I mean it is in a lot of ways you know and going after it just as a you know drug enforcement issue it's not you know it's it's so much bigger than that yeah it's a cultural it's an economic you know some of these kids I've got posted up some of these cartels soldier kids at 12 years old plated guns gold plated guns you know they don't have an OP they don't have options in their lives right it's that or nothing right it's either awesome life or short Austrian poverty short awesome life yeah a short awesome life or extreme poverty so that's when a component to it another component is systemic corruption as a society from who knows when you know it's always been a thing in Mexico people that grew up down there you get stopped at red light and you're like can I pay the fine here you know people that are from now there will be aware of this yeah show you the chill the paperwork you slide that thing in there you know that's you know that's part of the culture that's affecting a lot of things as well you know people don't pay attention to the small rules so the big rules don't matter right and just being next to the largest drug market on the planet you know and having money firearms rounds going down and fentanyl that it's being fabricated in Mexico now and some of the Chinese fentanyl making its way through into the u.s. kind of filling the voids that some of the the drug market has right now so they're making fentanyl laced fake fentanyl laced pills they're going to be they're being put into US and fentanyl laced heroin right so that's where they're going towards now that's what you see this epidemic up here and a lot of things traditionally kind of focused on pot before it was legalized in a lot of arenas up here now is heroin and fentanyl so it's actually kind of accelerated the production of the more harmful and dangerous drugs in some ways yes I mean they had to find another you know it was it went pot meth and now fentanyl-laced heroin or fentanyl laced pills see in the problem with the idea of legalization is that if you try to be the person who says hey folks we need to legalize drugs here in America because we've got this problem with the cartels politically that suicide yeah no no one I mean even though it's probably right it is I think it is I think it is very right it's one of those things that's so counterintuitive that most people are gonna go you're crazy you're gonna make my kids hooked on drugs well I'll say this I was I fought in the drug war I literally a drug war veteran yeah and if I had a white flag I would hand it over to you you know it's like I that this it's a useless fight I got to destroyed pot fields realistically thinking about all the effort and all the blood I'm like yeah and it's so quick to grow back I mean that yeah it is it is a fruitless fight fentanyl heroin may be different drugs fentanyl in particulars but a lot of that fentanyl is coming from China it's not a Mexican thing oh yeah a lot of people that are making or producing fentanyl in places like Mexico are from China setting up laboratories in Mexico so it's a it's a Chinese Mexican us problem as well god damn what can be done other than the legalization what could be done I mean how does and unless the United States literally goes to war with the Mexican cartels and you may have faced talking about that I mean I'd say designation is one I think that's a nation should it's it's going to happen a terrorist designation it's gonna happen I mean again we just saw the murder the massacre of Mexican they were dual citizenship nine people kids women it's not uncommon for that to happen to Mexican nationals it's pretty uncommon for that to happen to American nationals down there and that woke up woke up a bunch of people you know mm-hmm and now we another recent murder of another American national you know kid with his parents down there you know people will say but just don't go down to Mexico but but some of these people you know live down there and have family down there and have communities down there it's just ultra violent you know that people have to wake up on this side to realize this problem is not going to get any better this problem is not just a Mexican problem it's a US Mexican problem and you know they'll get to a point where it's gonna be you know I think in my lifetime it's gonna be some sort of armed intimate intervention in Mexico at some point really so you anticipate almost like in a civil war I think something's gonna happen in Mexico is going to destabilize it so much that the u.s. won't have another option but to put boots on the ground probably that's I think that's that's where we're headed the problem and again another of the problems is that the government is part of the problem so you can go down there and negotiate with this government but six years later it's gonna be another government you got to renegotiate with yeah and also use you palm grease yeah and then you put all your faith in the military and the military gets compromised you put all the fate and the Mexican Marines and then they get compromised and now who do you have all right so it's systemic don't tell that to trump he'll use as an excuse we can't count on them we're going in I I mean I wonder where it all goes because it is obviously growing very fast it's obviously huge and incredibly powerful and and it affects I mean I'm up here now and I could see the effects of it up here walking through LA seeing all the needles on the ground going to Seattle seeing the same light brown fentanyl-laced heroin that I saw in shanty towns down ah it's like wow so this is where it kind of ends up oh yeah so you said you see the effects of it throughout so you know you you you realize quickly as somebody from both sides that I am you realize that there realistically there's no border there's kind of no border when it comes to this problem it was brought this problem doesn't respect a border wall right right submarines will go around it tunnels will go under it drones will fly over it and it's a it's a problem that just keeps you know producing an effect and I think the majority of the United States citizens are completely unaware of the complexity and the depth of the problem yeah I mean it is well it's in it's also I think most people seeing the Iran thing right now most people know more about that oh yeah when off going on halfway across the world yeah then what's going on just you know that's what's crazy to me it's like you know we're we're into invading countries that are really barely affecting us that are like a 17 hour plane flight yeah I think I think the again I don't I don't want to be Ed Adamas and you know predict stuff Eddie Thomas but the fact that we have a lot of lithium incident is going to be a factor for a reason to clean it up it should be it should be it's pretty important it's a pretty important resource yeah but if they can't hold on the El Chapo's Sun huh that's that's why I think us gun is gonna have to you know put foot something boots on the ground down there Wow now if you had to make a bet like if there's a betting line in Vegas like how many how many days or how many years from now weirdly be American soldiers deployed to Mexico I'd say five years maybe whoa in five years really I mean we we are on we just passed this this past year has been the most violent year in Mexico in recorded history really and it's the first year of administration of this new president right who's been trying to hugs hugs how to not not bullets ever a saloon or molasses you know this instead of that it's been his first year and you know give him a chance he's he's doing whatever he's only the most violent year in history yeah cut the guy a break exactly that's what they say but then I go down there and I have a lot of a lot of my friends that are still down there people that have trained still down there and I hear from them directly like I have some young kids that are in the tender media which is like a federal police force that patrols all of Mexico and some of the federal federal police guys they tell me like head we're we they said or you sign the new contract to be the water thing yes or no and lower your pay and all your all of the stuff that all your benefits will be gone or you just stay on here and limbo and just stay at the base and a lot of them are staying at the base so it's nothing nothing's nothing's nothing's being done well I imagine that if it seems overwhelming and it seems helpless and it seems like the cartels are just taking over and they're making a shitload of money and you're not making any money I mean that that is the real crazy thing about right there if the the government is asking people in this sort of already compromised situation environment asking them to work for a small amount of money to go after people that are making a tremendous amount of money yeah and you're gonna be a war with these people these people they're basically your neighbors yeah and also you go there with a federal uniform but for another federal government you go into a community where you the federal government doesn't do anything for them right the church is made by the cartels cartel made the road Christmas was brought brought to you by the cartels you know they they're the good guys so these guys come in here like with you guys like what are they they work we're not gonna so that's you know it's it's it's it's it is it's it's a mess it's a mess Wow but could boots on the ground actually fix anything I mean I'm not a I'm not a I'm not a military expert but there has to be some sort of outside force that is completely uncompromised by cartel money and influence how long before they compromise those people well when you put the Marines on the border a few of them got picked up on smuggling people from the border so yeah that's what I'm saying it's it's and it's also it's a different war field because a lot of you know a lot of our war fighters and law enforcement are have some sort blood ties to Mexico mmm of course and not only down I was just watching some video where there was this guy who is a u.s. veteran been deployed overseas fought for this country and his mom was getting deported and he said he felt betrayed like here he is in America is his mother brought him over here had him over here he's a US citizen and they're deporting his mom as if his mom was a danger or the problem there's a community of Army marine and several veterans that are deported veterans that live in in place like Tijuana that's fucking crazy that is fucking crazy you all right for the country man you get a DUI in here but how nuts is that it is pretty nuts it's fucking ridiculous fight for this country youyou literally risk your life and there's assholes out there that haven't done a goddamn thing been mooching off the system forever and their citizens and you're not yeah I mean my perspective in my life life path you know when I came up here I want it I want to earn it right I don't know I came up here motivated want to do a difference work and apparently you know I've had I have had some you know static in my in my endeavors my kid was born in the US and parented her mom's American right when I went to to the hospital to pay for the the insurance part of it the laughs that means that you shouldn't pay any of this you're Mexican you just can claim benefits alright that that was in California so that was like oh but I can afford it no you just ways around this no and that's when I knew you know there's America there's California America all right California America is different yeah California America is very different it's a subtle blend I mean there's there's ways around stuff you know there's free stuff you know get it it's weird yeah again I travel across the country just get to experience different parts of the u.s. I spent New Year's in Kentucky and that's pretty interesting huh oh it's good I mean I like it you know maybe it's like a it's like a white Mexico is it yeah how so people were shooting guns into the air and on Year's Eve that's pretty Mexican they do that indexes to oh well you know again you know I don't know it's it's it's not good some lady got shot oh it's completely was standing in her driveway grandma with her family and the bullet fell out of the sky and hit her in the chest yeah when we when you really would come we would park underneath the bridges and in Baja to not get you know there's firearms are legal in Mexico and then you know racing right tracer rounds it's going oh my god I like tracer rounds okay you know it's it's it's again Mexico is a weird place you know it's why I call it the upside down you know you know there's there's there's a chaotic freedom to Mexico which I get I mean I love my I love Mexico as a country as a culture I don't like the government though the government is just you know at all levels it's just you know it's not a good well it seems like it's always been that way I'm reading this book about Kit Carson and the Old West and when the United States you know conquered parts of California and and took over parts of California and in the West from Mexico and it was crazy back then yeah yeah and they were they were talking about the the chaos in in the Mexican government and the Mexican military back then in the 1800s yeah yeah I mean so so people kind of figured realized if you want to be an officer in the in the Mexican army you have to go through War College and there's different ways to go about it but there's a lot of hereditary stuff going on already Terry okay my dad was a general okay yeah there's a lot of that going on also the army down there has a monopoly over selling guns it's only one gun store in all of Mexico and it's run by the army what yep one gun story no man all Mexico and is run by the army and you have to fly to Mexico City to to get a license and to procure a firearm so if you live in the Yucatan you have to fly them and get a fly to Mexico City to get a gun which makes which basically makes the only options buying a gun on the black market or flying over there and expending all this money so there's a now it's a class so only only people that can afford the plane ticket and to do all this process are the ones that can have guns so it's a that's class you know the class is involved in there as well what kind of rights do you have with guns versus the United States Second Amendment is it somewhere so the Constitution Mexican Constitution allows for guns for self-defense but a lot of amendments and a lot of corrupt governments down there said you mean maybe you're not a good idea to have this here so progressively throughout New Mexican region Mexican history it's become more and more strict all right certain rounds aren't allowed certain calibers aren't allowed and this just plainly the sale of firearms in all of Mexico is just relegated to a single gun store in Mexico City so you can't carry them without without a permit and to get a permit you have to know knows the Presidente or a general something but what about all those gentlemen we saw in that video just walking in front of those government agents with with guns why didn't they arrest them they should have they should have their homes like theirs yeah well long break the only people that respect those laws are you know law-abiding citizens there was a case in Veracruz of an old man a former army guy old older gentleman his son tried to get abducted some something like that he had this old Mauser rifle and he shot dead one of the guys that was chasing him is trying to abduct him he was arrested for the the firearm possession and the Hauser's would leave Harvey Oswald supposedly used on JFK yeah that's an old ass gun well there's a lot of weird old ass stuff down there you mean as far as the stuff that gets handed over or just the weird exotic firearms down there a lot of people called Mexico the US is a garage and likely like garages you just find weird stuff down there from old world war ii era pistols and explosives to new stuff like there's a friend of mine that works for the government down there told me that they found a bunch of parts for a minigun in it you know how somewhere down there what's a minigun it's basically a remember that go ahead remember that Terminator 2 yeah oh yeah yeah yeah pretty hard to get you know one of those apparently there's one out there somewhere on a vehicle of some sort well Jesus it's basically a obliterated everything well we talked about the IDI holder fast and furious deal last time that you were here and that to me still is one of the most bizarre cases in in the history of an undercover operation that doesn't make any sense at all yeah they sold guns like literally sold working guns to a specific cartel down there to tried it was so they could track them or I remember what kind of bullshit argument that was the the the interesting part or if you want to go into the you know questions that they benefited a single cartel the Sinaloa cartel that's the that's the thing you know that's most of the guns went to that if you had a guess if you were a conspiracy if there's like put on your tinfoil hat what do you think that was all about they would probably as a nation you were probably one wanting to only worry about a single threat as far as cartels and not a lot of cartels so they empowered one cartel yeah really I mean where that was coming off the Patriot Act era Bush era thing I remember vividly people putting geiger counters in some of the drug tunnels that we would find so they were worried about nukes getting put into drug tunnels at some point during during that whole post 9/11 era so it would make sense that if you are worried about national security you would want to not worry about a lot of cartels maybe focus on one support one and just keep us in the know do you think this was a covert operation a sense of the Sinaloa cartel was not aware that they were doing this to empower them to eliminate the competition to strengthen one group because they just knew it was inevitable that someone there's a lot control there's a lot of people that are now coming out after the whole there's a lot of things that were said at the Chapo trial that are that would lead somebody to believe that there was some sort of official support from the US government to the Sinaloa cartel as far as then having deals with these cartels specifically to keep things to keep them in the know about things happening down there supporting them to be that be in the position so they can keep control over their region and basically as an information group so they can have have a clear eye and ear in a chaotic area like Mexico on the bad guys side that's what I that's why I gathered from it Jesus Christ but that kind of it's it's all it's almost like they feel like it's helpless like they have to do something like that that they have to do that because there's no way to fix it so what you got to do is kind of try to manage it or move it and directions so there's this there's all up like every night every now and then I post some stuff about that type of situation and everybody goes to well the CIA has been running drugs into the u.s. for years and using planes it's not like that there is there are instances of CIA involvement and different stuff down in Mexico that are pretty obvious now from the 80s and then in the 90s as far as supporting certain groups or just trying to keep tabs on these people but you know I think we're coming to a point in our history where a lot of these people are dead a lot of these people are in jail a lot of these people got book deals and people are talking and I mean it's interesting seeing some of the stuff that it's coming out now that in my time when I was active would have gotten you in a hole probably somewhere if he talked about it mmm so there's definitely I mean I my mind was blown when I was seeing all Chappell and Netflix because a lot of stuff that was going on in that Joe is fictionalized stuff that I went through myself so I was like this is on Netflix now how accurate was there's some pretty good accurate parts so there's a there's a character in that show called so we're talking about narcos and we're talking about the Mexican version of narcos right because without their zombie in first yeah they're there's a narcos is pretty good there's a there's a chapel series on Netflix as well oh there is yeah it's in Spanish it's very popular but it's pretty accurate there's a guy in that in the subtitles it does there's a guy in the show Conrado solo is his name which would nobody would people are trying to figure out who that was it's basically a government guy that had a deal with El Chapo and they both kind of escalated in power it turns out it was Luna right so this show was showing him the character El Sol which depicts Luna as a corrupt politician that was working security was working both sides and all of a sudden you know recently a few months a few weeks back they arrested the guy so the show was kind of predicted do you think that the show had anything to do with him being arrested I mean it probably put I put the idea and the zeitgeist of people to ask questions you know yeah that's weird that shows actually do do that like saving surviving r.kelly that's what got him arrested I mean everybody knew he not people I'm like fuckin 20 years ago he's peeing on little kids yeah now it gives people like a good it's interesting you see you see fictionalized forms up stuff that happened down there the narcos show as well is another thing you know see fictionalized things mmm how some of these powerful cartel groups kind of originated themselves in fiction and now that is in the public kind of domain as far as collective knowledge so people start asking questions and some of these things parent lis people in power also ask questions as well Jesus Christ it's just it's so strange how popular it's become you know and it's such a popular focal point of fiction as well and in fashion you know chapels picture with uh Sean Penn yeah the shirt was fire everybody wanted that shirt you know that Conor McGregor like wore something to mimic it when on purpose with a pro in the press conference for Rafael dos Anjos did you know that yeah her stood he stood in the same stance like look at him look at him I mean he's doing it on purpose yeah it's like a subtle nod to El Chapo yeah I mean he's a chaplet achieved legendary status now or sure now his kid that was freed by the the the cartel down there he was wearing a scalpel REO which is like you could I don't know if you can see it in there it's an interesting just big piece of a cultural thing from Mexico what is going on in this video that was just handed the gun over it what his personal gun over to one of his bodyguard said was not even these guys don't even care about him they had a head camera thing and they're putting everybody out there and personally I would put everybody in zip ties and on the ground personally so these guys all have guns drawn and there's people inside with guns drawn at them and they realize they realize who they have so they're like should we forcefully put him in cuffs are we not so how do you know that they're realizing this right is because of the language they're saying I've went through a lot of the same training that they went through and I did a lot of this type of stuff and all of them would have been in zip ties on the ground this girl went reached out and grabbed their guns and put their guns down compose there's there's fear in these people they realize that they messed up oh Jesus right so that's what you know people question and there are these streaming this video live that they they have that in their head cam a head cam and they're streaming it not well it's not you know that they have cording recording it and it gets sent back to the command post so when he was moving around he had one of these on this is a SCAP Ilario it's called it's like a religious catholic iconography thing what is yours what is it this is a santa marta one right it's like a holy death effigy so he had that on he had his was a Santoni Niall at Tojo which is like a Catholic to say yeah Christ baby st. they have as soon as that picture of him went on online they were sold out all throughout seeing law everybody was wearing that they have to work you know they work it was work cousin Frank got him Freya's areas that's a that's a scapular do something you handsome guy yeah that's an also an interesting cultural thing the occult part of it were that that's Anthony you know that torch a shrine is right now it's probably most popular shrines in Mexico or that one because they work and then you go to the holy death shrines down there as well and you see how how both sides both Mexican government forces and the cartel they they both been irate kind of the same Saints so with that again that's a weird kind of a thing they share that faith what does that picture of his truck down there Jamie you have some wacky truck no just two regular truck that's his yeah that's one of those little bullets he gave out cars on Christmas he as a like he did this pointy - any like townspeople or how many cars do you get out I have no like a lot of them there's pictures of the El Chapo's Sun gives out cars on Christmas and there's a bunch of cars there you know again who who are you like who are you gonna go towards and of course government you know are you don't give me anything yeah they like you said hearts and minds they're really yeah Hines and and and you know they they pay for a college education so there's a whole generation of lawyers a whole generation of doctors they pay for immigration procedures so hey you want to you know yeah I'll pay for your immigration but you know I'm gonna call in some favors later on okay Wow so that's you know that's that's how that's how you grow it's full-on mafia shit yeah I mean they learned one day I'll come to you Al Capone Al Capone you know Scarface you know all these things are kind of venerated by them that's kind of their cultural backing off cultural backing they kind of look to the mob era guys as influence or as inspiration you see you know insane paintings of The Godfather or Scarface in some of these safe houses what these people are all right and you're like okay or you see cartel influenced series for Netflix like there's one called la reina del sewer which is about a female cartel head and the lady that stars in that show was the one that took Sean Penn down there de miel Chapel because no Chapel was a fan of that show really that's how it got going when they finally caught up to him he had the whole series on DVDs that is pretty humanized another oh my god that that whole scene with Sean Penn going down there and writing a story for Rolling Stone was uber bizarre yeah well if they get the the terrorist designation he basically went down there to meet with a terrorist what happens to him then is it all retroactive I don't know I don't know but they he helped get him arrested in a sense right you basically that whole commotion put eyes on on the movements of El Chapo by the Mexican government why would hell chapo agree to do something like that he was a fan of the show that seems so crazy though doesn't it seem crazy that he was willing to take that kind of a risk and take a photo with Sean Penn and that that actress well I was what's her name again okay got it got the cut that cuts to you yeah right there yeah chapo is probably banging that right a fighter yes there's rumors there's rumors of a meeting that's about it I don't know anything else yeah uh-huh yes I don't say yeah that's just the whole thing with Sean Penn smiling hey here's my friend the murderer I mean I get the eye I mean I've heard some of the stuff Sean Penn said about you know Chavez in Venezuela and stuff like that oh he's Pro Chavez and Suffolk gonna have people friends of mine that live in men as well under to that regime so he's a pretty kooky guy he has some pretty interesting ideas about he can't possibly be that informed I don't know I mean how you you really have to have boots on the ground to understand what the fuck you're talking about and you have to be there for you know if you want to know what's going on in Venezuela there's so many different stories my friend Abby Martin it's been down there multiple times and she gives me a story that's so different than anything that you're getting in mainstream news and she goes there she goes there and talks to people yeah spends time well I have a there's a there's a resistance group that is based in the US that works down there and you know they put up videos all the time of people picking up garbage and trying to recycle garbage to feed themselves in some places Instagram immediately takes all those downs right really yeah why does Instagram take those down I have a lot of that going on as well when I post something completely news related about something and then get shadow banned or things just go down depending on what I post up like weird things posted up a Venezuelan people throwing rocks at this armored vehicle and one of them when the got run run over and I got taken down I didn't show the part where he got run over but just the people protesting and how would that get taken down they got flagged as support for a hate group or something like that support for a hate group by showing the news yeah or showing a picture of cartel and again I don't post anything graphic on my feed because I don't want to get banned but I'm still shadow band right so well you showed that one by the way edie manifesto that's how you find it edie manifesto that's that that's Ed's page you posted that one where you you saw a guy getting abducted yeah by fake cops yeah yeah and and that one get pulled yeah it did yeah all of that all of the recent scene a long video ones are our fault were all pulled off the Instagram account that's why I had to real upload them all I just don't understand their logic I mean look I can understand them saying caution some of these images and videos are sensitive you know like with some bloody things and things along those lines something changed in the algorithms a year back like when I was on your first time I was on the show I got obviously I saw a spike thank you by the way but all of the pro Second Amendment pages and people like there's a guy crispy it was yeah yeah also you got a lot all of a sudden all this started seeing a lot of us are flagged yeah his stuff got taken down yeah and yeah I think he got a there was a photo of him with Donald Trump that got taken down yeah my sense I think was Donald Trump do you like what the fuck is wrong with you people yeah just because you don't align with someone politically you can't take down photos and you can't pretend that he's posing with Hitler or something like yeah fuck is wrong with you it's uh it's the people can report things anonymously I think and yes and if you hurt my feelings there you go so if there's enough people that flag your video and say this is hurtful or this is they don't even look into it they just pull it down yeah so who do you think is doing do you think this Mexican government is doing that do you think it's the cartels that are doing that page I think it's mostly Americans that have sensibilities that are completely beyond my comprehension that see a gun in a picture and they're afraid of the gun and it is terrorism they're supporting terrorism a group let's report that picture or video well I could understand how some of what you're reporting on truthful as it may be would be disturbing to be able to find out that truth but you gotta let people do that I mean I mean what does Instagram want it I mean do they want to put parameters on what kind of truth you're allowed to distribute so just for people to get some contacts I I do work for to to magazine companies and I do do articles so in that regard I do provide news in in in certain ways but when I post something on my page it's a personal view of something I purposefully don't go into graphic material because I don't want to get flagged but sometimes there's always people with a certain affinity to when they see a gun in a post or where they see an animal being butchered for something like in a picture or when they see hunting related stuff or when they see some sort of I remember posting up a picture of the make Tijuana great again hats that they were making down their red hats that said make Tijuana great again when the caravans went into TJ and people started protesting caravans in TJ that got flagged what that is so crazy oh yeah if you want to confuse if you want to make people angry and confused just wear one of those hats through the air well lady got maced in the face for wearing one that said make Bitcoin great again yeah some guy maced her in the face Johana I saw somebody walked out walking an airport with a make hentai great again hat anything great again you go you can't do it be close yeah it's too close I mean you know the Hat you know right I have never seen anything more divisive in this country I mean other than like a swastika or something like overtly disgusting I I started my immigration process when he got elected oh no it's it's it's been a trip you know how does that work like if you are Mexican born citizen and you want to become the United States citizen obviously it's very difficult it so married to an American have an American kid that's how I went through the process myself and you know I got a green card the the thing is that when he got elected everybody said you know what maybe our time to get a green card is gonna get be less and less so let's all try and get one mmm so what would take normally six months took two years oh wow so in those two years you can't leave the country so if you what happens to people that are illegal over that's what's fucked up about it right it's like there's people that came over here illegally 20 30 years ago and they've done no crimes they've been an integral part of society they've had great lives but they they can't pay taxes they can't vote they have to live undercover yeah I mean fuck that's stupid they're there you know the end they do provide you know they decide they pay taxes through other other sales tax buying things but they're not paying taxes they're not kept in but if you made them citizens you would make money yeah well it's not a popular view it's a stupid view yeah it's it's stupid that we have these people and they're permanent illegals yeah and they will be here until they die illegally and we know they're here like how about work with what you've got look you've already do you doing your best to stop the border traffic great fantastic but listen let's just forget about the past these people are here they're here and they're a part of our community like how you how are you gonna deny them citizenship to the day they die and they're still here well legal immigration it's like I went through is hard enough you gotta find some American lady that's just difficult yeah I did and you know but it was a hard process it's uh it's it's it's a difficult process and you speak fluent English yes that's another thing I saw people in the line with me you know that did not speak a lick of English but they were from a country that had a like Holland or some shit from has a vote it's hard for Canadians man I have friends from Canada that have come over here to try to become citizens it's a fuckin grind yeah and and and don't get me wrong I love this country a bit I'm new here and I like what I see I don't like where it's going in some places what don't you like I don't like the I mean I left my country because I couldn't defend myself from the bad people out there whose second amendment second amendment yeah it's a beautiful thing you have no idea how beautiful that thing is till you don't have an option to have it that's one thing I like to do opportunities this country provides I've had a lot of opportunities I would never get anywhere else I like the UK actually work and work you're the work you put in matters here I like like I was segmented and different you go to Tennessee and you meet people out there and they're great people you know there's some you know people have preconceived notions of what some part of the countries are but I've loved it and then you go to California and you meet people that are on the same boat as I was and they're forgot completely what Mexico is and they're completely recognized Americanized and they're completely against you as a new a new person here really yeah so you find that really like Americanized Mexicans or like second third generation Mexicans the worst enemy of a Mexican is another Mexican that's a classic but that's a classic that's a classic Mexican saying and it's true well that that's a classic Mexican saying but really most of the negativity negativity I got from being on your show the first time was from Latinos specifically Mexican Latinos what was the negativity what was their criticism when I talked about how Mexicans protested the caravans going through Tijuana and wrecking their city that was viewed as extreme to the right or conservative viewpoint apparently yeah but that was a fact but the apparently facts don't matter oh that's so silly but that's people that's that's a good that's a good example of people that are not there yeah out of talking about it you're not saying you didn't make a value judgment saying that those people coming through were protested by Mexicans need to go back were fucking rice paddy they come from you didn't say any of that so so this is what I saw when I when I talked about it looks like experience that I wasn't I was in TJ for a while when that was happening firing caravan goes through obviously a lot of those guys were gang members a lot of them were not all of them a lot of them more covered in tattoos it's pretty hot outside wearing all of our important hoodies cameras came by the females and the children were being put in front parading from the media to anybody was there you could see the circus I was going on hmm and then a lot of the a lot of the camp encampments they would they would you know litter the encampments with needles on the outside one of them was next to a school they've had to be closed down a niece of mine had a kid in there and the school had to be closed down because it was next to one of these encampments they would protest and close down lanes most people that live in TJ some of them are Americans and they commute so that's affecting their livelihood people that work on terrorism and TJ white book hood went down so the fact that these people came and disrupted all that whole thing and then you would see these Californian you know hippie Americans guys come down there and do puppet shows for these people and hand over a donations in the form of canned food blankets uh stuff like that and then you would see these guys go to the back door and sell all that stuff in the back and just get money for whatever they were gonna use the money for we would laugh at it but it also you know it's pretty disheartening having that point of view online because I started posting some of this stuff online for people this is what's happening and that was like no no no you're going against the earth now the narrative yeah the narrative and the and the people that are talking about you going against a narrative have really no idea they don't care about the truth that's what's crazy the absolute is thing so if you're against it if you're against this caravan going through Tijuana and affecting your you're probably a trump supporter that's that's that I'm like so simple I can't even vote up here yet don't have to be a full citizen to vote so that it doesn't even factor in oh god damn it's so crazy what else about America bothers you I think you know there's there's definitely this tendency in America that I see the youth in america like i like i have i have a weird mental comparison of seeing my nephews down there playing soccer going out and getting into trouble going to cock fights which is probably pretty dangerous but they go to cock fight stuff like that and I see kids up here on their tablet you know playing games video games getting offended by something you know down there you can still punch somebody in the face if they get into your face in school I'll be allowed to do that in school I mean you're gonna be some issues but it's fine you know you know there's there's still that you know up here it's gone all that's gone you're gonna get into some issues is probably gonna get you out of school or something you know you see this weird puss if ocation of american children safe spaces yeah don't say that that's politically correct classification it's a good word for it what's the play come up with a politically correct word for that that has just as much kick and I'll use that no they can't it doesn't exist it it's the pacification yeah I mean and when I came up here the first year I was up here I saw the California gun laws change like I got to see the weird California compliant rifles come to the range and you have to push a button to release the magazine mm-hmm yeah and make it more difficult to reload yeah so strange well I mean if if I've never seen a California compliant gun in the hands of a criminal myself right so why why are they good like the good citizens following the law yeah the idea that you just can't really cap law-abiding citizen citizens and that's gonna somehow or another save lives in mass shootings and here's the other thing about you and I'm waiting for this to happen but it's just not happening they're never addressing people using psychotropic drugs they're not they don't address that all those school shooters all those mass shooters are all on drugs yeah they're all on some kind of psyched drugs and there's there's no mention of it whatsoever like what what is the action of these things it's all about the guns yeah and the guns are a huge issue means these people who are fucked up yeah that they have access and they can get access to these guns and they can wind up shooting people yes that is one issue securities another issue there's another issue and that's mental health and this that to me is the biggest one because without the mental health issue you don't get mass shooters and that's a interesting thing we wouldn't I get people and conversations about the violence in Mexico and proper perspective Mexico cartel guys you know go into a town shoot up a bunch of people and it's pretty horrible but on the Mexican side we only had one school shooting that like a notable one right and it was mentally ill kid yeah took a gun to school right and our as Mexicans we look at what happens in the US and schools and we're horrified by that's like completely you know horrific I'm not amazing it's again being on both sides I'm just trying to figure things what about pharmaceuticals being prescribed to children in Mexico is it similar not at all not I mean we're so behind in some and some instances as far as you know there I didn't know about PTSD so I came up here or TBI right really yeah I didn't know anything about that when did you learn about TBI I when I started talking truck we should say what that is post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury yeah for people well I learned about kids I learned about it from talking to most of my marine friends that were coming back from there like he had like what you're describing that you're feeling sounds like TBI really yeah you should get yourself checked out and then you go down there and I was like I you know things would happen and people would get you know yeah it's just straight get a few days off take a few shots of tequila you're fine yeah get back at it well that's the old school mentality man that's what they had to deal with in World War two and Vietnam and yeah yeah but you yep yeah I mean when it comes to that but mental health down in Mexico there's like it's not it's not anywhere as far as medicating it kids being diagnosed with things like office when autism is a thing that I only recently kind of heard about and 15 years ago in Mexico and Mexico and what about antipsychotic drugs and all these different drugs that you're seeing that these a lot of these school shooters are taking in Mexico that's not a thing you know people think that it's pretty permissive in Mexico they can get any drug if you pay somebody off the thing is that a lot of these psychiatric level they're they're not they're not available down there were people that you can go to they're like what do you want no this is not available here so it's not a part of the culture it's not a mark now no yeah in America it's such a huge part of the culture that people want the people are constantly wanting to take something to take the edge off or take something so they could feel better or take something to you know to just just to alter their state and the doctor prescribed it to them and then the pharmaceutical drug companies are just raking in the cash from it so it just becomes a part of reality yeah there's there was a few people like way back when I first started you know things were pretty laxed when I got in you know they would get you know urine tested for cocaine and whatever but some people would go to Oaxaca and go on mushroom trips like some of the veteran guys that would go through whatever there's a there's a place in Oaxaca and in Veracruz where they'd go up into the hills and get some of those but they call them Belarus which is like basically going to midnight and they would smoke these mushrooms and take them and they would come back apparently fix someone that was like this story mm-hmm it was pretty good for them to work their things out well John Hopkins is there doing Studies on psilocybin and there's been studies done in psilocybin with troops with PTSD and then they've found that that it does help them MDMA is another one that Maps is doing all these studies with MDMA and troops coming back with PTSD yeah I mean a lot of this stuff has been around for a long time down there yeah like remember the Beatles and members of The Doors went down there - yep - Edina and they found out about it was a Life magazine article from the 1950s that was one of the first really mainstream gyms here if you find who wrote that it was a life article in the 50s I'm trying to remember that the guy's name Wasserman Wasserman I feel like it's Wasserman who was one of the very first guys to sort of mainstream psilocybin mushrooms and it was because of Mexican tribal cultures Maria Vina was like the the figurehead of that movement she was a lady that would do these mushroom trips for people that would come up in the hillside whether she would take her was it Gordon Watson I was close yeah it was something like that Gordon Watson that's right yeah so this was seeking the magic mushroom and I believe this was what year was this cherry I think it's in the 50s I typed in 1950 at 57 okay Vina left a whole legacy of that in Mexico and she had a lot of people that learn from her and a lot of these people are all over Mexico doing you know healing and spiritual work well that's the other thing about Mexico Mexico has some you have some freedom like my friend Edie Edie clay he had a ibogaine retreat down there where people would go to get off the pills yeah because it's one of the iboga is one of the best ways to get off of particularly opiates yeah there's you know there's this enforcement is hard in a country like Mexico so you're not gonna have people trying to go inspect things and run these parts so that's why there's a lot of places like that you still to this day you can go to places where Hawkeye where technically that's taking mushrooms illegal but they go on the hillsides it didn't they kind of like decriminalize a lot of different things down there for personal use so the quantities now matter more than they used to so sometimes you would get caught with a certain quantity of something and that means you're selling it so how many grams of mushrooms can you have I have I would have looked up but everybody has a different opinion on what personal uses I mean I remember the first time I saw like a bucks a box of them and I'm like a load of these and you know later on I figured out what they were and you know they were a thing they're a thing in Mexico there's their big thing in Mexico hmm there's a lot of people grown they're a big thing to anyone who finds out about them to eat them they become a big thing yeah yeah apparently I think they use them in rituals and all sorts of weird rituals down there as a doorway type done element like there's a there's a ritual where they do with where they bury you alive in a shallow grave oh Jesus yeah it's pretty basically an isolation chamber love really poor man's isolation chamber they bury you alive in the shell grave with a rope with a bell on it and they give you a bunch of mushrooms so you can think about things in there and if you freak out you ring that bell you know they dig you out yeah Oh God yeah how you breathing down there they go to percents a shallow grave it's just basically you know about that much dirt there's a hole where the rub goes through your so you're gonna fine but it's a it's a part of the death cult down there they do that to kind of initiate people into it but it's it's mushrooms late they take mushrooms there's a bunch of weird stuff that goes down down there as far as the the the the use of psychotropics like mushrooms and other things to put people in them and that mindset of you know accepting a very specific deity or truth out there mm-hmm yeah so let's get back to what's fucked up about America I always liked talking to people that are here from somewhere else and just sort of look at it with a fresh eye because obviously I've been here my whole life I'm I'm used to it yeah and I'm third generation oh you are yeah okay my parents were second generation my grandparents came over here so it's all I'm ingrained you know I'm in the system I don't know I'm blind what else is fucked up about this place I mean I don't know I mean I when I travel around I get to see different parts of America and all of them you know there's there's certain certain places I've been called ah you're you're you're one of the good Mexicans at good ones I won't say what those parts of the country are but I've gotten some of that you know well you the United States is almost like Europe where like there's all these different countries except they all speak the same language yeah you know like Europe has France and they have Germany and you go over there there's this one then the Sweden and then it's all in this fucking big landmass yeah but the United States is landmass is continuous and they all speak the same language but you want to tell me that Montana's the same as Florida you're out of your fucking mind well I take those comments in stride you know that you're one of the good Mexicans I mean being racist and of racial like that and just messing with each other is it think Mexicans do that all the time right so I take it in stride it's fascinating to me that people are second-generation Mexicans up here take more offense to something like that and then I would somebody say you're one of the good next week yeah yeah yeah whatever you know it's it to me it's like a thing I I take it well the easier things get the more people get quickly offended yeah yeah yeah hard times produce hard men or hard men produce soft times soft times produce weak men yeah so when I come up here I see some you know softness and a lot of the society and a lot of feelings get hurt having to watch what I say as far as you know I was yeah I was tell this to people first off I'm from Mexico I come from a Mexican education system it's a third world country so please take everything I say with that in mind right and then I go into whatever I'm gonna say and like when you do like when you teach class when I have a class where I have a like I just recently did a conference with a bunch of bodyguards and security professionals that work internationally I had to start with that one just to not offend anybody you know that's hilarious you're teaching security guards and bodyguards and you have to worry about being offended every now and then you get somebody you know what you said something oh Christ you fucking babies yeah so never read the comment section never never stay behind and talk to people especially if they they look like they're they want to speak to the manager you know oh did you get that you teach class and right now and then I guess what did they say - yeah you know I think yeah I think your point of view is is a skewed because you work for the government down there and you weren't part of the like the poor class and like I'm losing part of the pork loss if you work for like where I worked when we were pretty poor pretty / poor right it's not like you know what's the middle class it was pretty poor or or they or they try to tell me the realities of where I'm from oh that must be hilarious oh that's pretty good that's pretty good Edie you're just fear-mongering about Mexico I go down to Rosarito all the time with my family it's fine while Rosarito fine go downtown we'll leave us where the shooting happened and tell me the same thing you know it's perspective they really say that to you I can't imagine someone talk particularly talking to someone like you yeah who's got like real-world experience there's there's people out there that kind of I believe you yeah I mean I do people are so fucking dumb I do believe you yeah yeah but it is really true that it's the the people that live the softest easiest lives that are most offended and the people that have experienced like real hardship and seen real violence that are a little more hesitant to comment on things like that oh yeah that's that is possible yeah that is real yeah and and that's one of the other things that I really think is good about your page and it really makes me angry that Instagram censors it is that you're giving real world perspective you're showing real video of a lot of this stuff and you put it up with with also your educated experience on what these people are actually involved in yeah and and it's a I'm not involved in a news agency and a lot of this like both of those videos came in through direct messenger to my phone from people that are out there and this is happening here like okay mmm you talk about it okay I'll talk about it but when the Mormon thing happened the people the people that reach out to me to talk about it were part of the family and was real and it wasn't national news when I posted it up all right so the some of the first like social media post about it that I could kind of try and look for it and it was wasn't anywhere so I talked about it and like that that evening it went national news and but most of it is directly from having connections and people out there that still talk to me keep my ear open to that type of stuff specifically from that region because that's that's my thing that's where I came from well there's not a lot of mainstream news that's dedicated to this crisis dedicated to what's going on it just it takes a big event like that to sort of break through all the noise and become a signal it reaches us over here yeah yeah and it's you know again and things happen somewhere else and now all the attention that most people aren't focused on Iran now yeah the whole what happened down there there yeah it's just fucking crazy okay there's a giant problem right next door you could walk to it literally I mean if you live in San Diego it's a fifteen minute drive yeah yeah like it's right there well it's just to me it's I love San Diego and I love going down there but every time I go down there I'm like you guys could walk to Mexico like this is so crazy like especially La Jolla yeah La Jolla which is one of the most richest parts of the country fucking unbelievably beautiful there's stunning views gorgeous mansions everybody's driving a Mercedes you're 15 minutes away from Tijuana yeah and if we have heavy rains in Tijuana all of our sewage is gonna go right through there really yes that what happens a lot of the soot like recently we have major major rain in Tijuana all the sewage goes across the border to a Tijuana estuary there's a there's a processing facility the US has on this side but it can't manage all that and they have to close all the beaches in the air oh wow which is again it's fascinating how to see how the effect there's a boy there's a poor wall there but are you getting a boat you grow over there it takes three minutes oh you can parkour yeah I recently posted up a bunch of videos of people park chorong over that wall I saw it yeah look I admire ingenuity I admire people that find solutions to problems watching that guy scale that goddamn wall like Batman yeah it's amazing yeah they're coming up with weird ways like I saw some people using powdered titanium to to melt the bars on on one of the slats how did titanium again I had to research it basically it's a powder titanium Prince at a very high rate and when you start it it's kind of hard to put it out so they might hold on and this wall would powder that with some sort of powder titanium mix that's like that shit what was that shit that they were talking about with 911 where all the conspiracy theorists thought that it melted steel goddamn it pyrite tanner something like that right or just talk to my head oh yeah that's the one yeah I feel like that's the stuff they blow shit up with right now they sell these things they call breach bends like and they there's there's the four tactical applications of these pens that B sticks that you start and you can burn chains open stuff like that with them really yeah so basically a ghetto version of that is what they're using you know in some of these places I know the the I mean the the wall as they're making it and speaking to some of the Border Patrol agents that I that I know it does it job at as far as slowing people down yeah so there's not an overflow of people coming yeah it's not like what would happen if it was that that's all night Banzai yeah what would happen if everybody if there was no border everybody's like five Mexico's United States nights is Mexico have a good time yeah it would be chaotic of course how long ten years I don't know how long I mean once everybody got in yeah other people go there yeah I mean if what if United States and Mexico came to a deal and they said yeah well call wasn't there a thing that they were gonna do there was a North American agreement there was like they were trying to do that with the United States and set up a single currency yes yeah that's a lot of conspiracy theories around the Amero yeah that's something like that look they were gonna do it with Canada we're all gonna be coming you see I could see like Canada yeah but maybe not you know Mexico well look we could all spread all the good around yeah and then also like look Mexico's got some awesome spots wouldn't be great if US industry moved in there and with you yes maybe that's gonna hold with you well Colombia did a great job in eradicating all the the problems with narcotics I think it is with well not all because it still have a gorilla gorilla group down there that recently the FARC that went amnesty and then they got active again but they're still there's still a lot of cocaine being produced there oh yeah yeah but it's not nothing like when there's no no what did they do well they were facing just just a few criminal groups large ones and Mexico is facing a lot of them that's interesting they have the u.s. right next door that is pumping money into the issue directly didn't have to fly in no yeah it's not a long plane flight it's a short walk I also Mexico is a pretty big country I think people kind of missed that also it's a pretty big pretty big country do you remember when there was a CIA drug plane that had like several tons of cocaine on it and it crashed cuz the Mexican government wouldn't let them land and refuel yeah yeah I mean all sorts of conspiracy theories that was a real CIA drug plane that had been to Guantanamo Bay at least twice yeah like it was documented yeah and they for whatever reason I mean I flying back with a lot of coke look at that coke I imagine imagine government groups everywhere have a voice yeah yeah you have Cowboys when people try to say the CIA brings in drugs no no people who work for the CIA realize they can make a shitload of money if they bring in drugs and they pass that money around and they work it out but the CIA itself does not bring in drugs yeah customers Customs and Border Protection agent agent sand just Homeland Security as an agency has the most corruption charges as far as all law enforcement agencies is it really you have federal federal charges for corruption because they are on border and money other were of course that's that's why right it totally makes sense and you know I mean it maybe it was a CIA guy that said you know could make some money through here well I mean that was the whole Barry seals thing that Tom Cruise movie I mean it was it called made in America I think I made in America that was about bringing in drugs with the with Cowboys that work for the CIA yeah I mean when I was working down there in New Mexico and I got to see different agencies that we would work with all of a sudden were like hey can you guys just go like look over there or just were there like what's going on and you would see like some sort of you know what's going on you know but lands plane takes off nothing nobody saw nothing you know money exchanges and just you know that's in Europe just an agent you know she's in the background well that's the thing that's so scary about what's going on with the cartels is that the quantity of money is so extraordinary yeah it's almost like they can do anything yeah I mean they have their own cell phone networks in some places what yeah called that we good if I knew but their kind of coverage they have pretty good coverage in their areas I mean they dismantled some cell phone networks in the past also like whole cities with hidden cameras that are cartel controlled to see who kills in and out of the of the towns Wow like so sophisticated oh yeah so the Mexicans Mexican government is working with uniformed agents patrolling and pickup trucks in the back and these guys are living in 2025 and using drones to to surveil the the patrols in the area and they're using their own cell phone network so they don't have to worry worried about government tapping into their communications they're utilizing encrypted phone technology that is available now commercially throughout the world to get around some of these things and and they're in there working they're constantly evolving and how they work you know I remember the first time I was working in Baja and all the cartel guys were we move around in suburban stressed like federal agents and they would look exactly like the legit federal agents or there were federal agents with the cartel guys so you would oh my god so they'd be together yeah and then we started working with the military and the military didn't give a shit who you were so I would stop everybody she would everybody and the guys immediately saying so now we're using taxicabs to move around and different types of cars and we're gonna paint the the the vans like taxi vans or we're gonna move around in ambulances so they change their tactics so we were always after these convoys of Suburbans and now they're doing something else so that's how they evolved they just you know you're trying to go after it with a hammer and these guys are mosquitos does it make you want to move to Canada furthest you can get away from all the game you know yeah must be going on up there as well right they know suburbs so I interviewed a smuggler a coyote for one of the articles I wrote and he you know asked him directly like what do you think about the the border wall and the immigration policies of this current administration it's good for business you know it makes it seem like it's harder to put people in the United States so I mean that wall is pretty hard like how would you do it I fly them to Canada and they walk down well we talked about it before that the border the United States is a wall to Mexico the border from the United States to Canada is a giant clearing that's a hundred yards wide it's real clear you can see it's almost like they make it easy hey just go right here yeah I mean a lot of people that want to get to the into u.s. here you hear numbers from $8,000 to $15,000 depending on who you are what you're trying to do how you're trying to get up here as far as being smuggled up and he's like past Mexican Passport get a Mexican passport if you're Mexican we'll get you a Mexican Passport we'll put two thousand dollars in an account somewhere so if they want to verify if you're just financially solvent they will check that and just fly to Canada and just walk down and that's what we do well can a super liberal now to it Justin Trudeau guys that's a lot of a lot of there a lot of their business as far as among people that's how they do it right now instead of going through the desert you know there is that there is a lot of that going on now to like some there's a lot of people moved from Africa Africa not migrants coming into into Mexico people Middle East as well which is worrying for some people coming in through Mexico trying to make their way up but it's pretty hard for these people now because there's a lot of security now on both sides of the border Mexican why didn't as you're now and on this side of the border things are kind of more stringent a lot of the people that claim the Siloam like a lot of the neck my Caravan members coming to the u.s. claiming asylum and say okay there's your number to wait but you're gonna wait in Mexico so they get sent back even if they're not from Mexico they we have to wait in Mexico it's very interesting yeah there's a lot of these immigrant waiting encampments and places like Texas and even Tijuana it's places where people get cross Asylum okay here's your number you don't have to wait in Mexico they get sent back oh yeah man are you hopeful things is gonna work out okay when you mean this okay this is what we're all talking about yeah that's gonna become better a better situation in the future or is it gonna get more and more crazy is the United States gonna become like Mexico I think at a global scale we're gonna need each other before before you know before too long you know you guys are gonna need Mexico and Mexico is gonna need you there's gonna be some sort of situation we're gonna have to come together probably you mean like a global war I don't know could be oh jesus said I mean there's a lot I mean there's a lot of Chinese influences and in industry in Mexico yes as soon as Trump said we're gonna when he when Trump was going in to put into office he said we're gonna bring jobs back you know this whole thing so a lot of factories American factories and businesses moved out of Mexico and the Chinese moved in absolutely well that's what's dumb about shortsightedness right yeah well not understanding for deep three dimensional chess you know there's a lot of moving pieces yeah and and and you know people can say whatever they want about the United States American companies and Mexico are pretty good companies and they're pretty good their workers and their ethics are pretty good a lot better than China a lot better than China you know it's a it's a different it's a different game and you know it's it's again you see these influences going into Mexico because they realize that Mexico is a valuable place for them to have influence in especially with what you're talking about with lithium I mean what I mean with battery technology and green technology becoming in the forefront of American culture right now I mean everybody wants electric cars all these manufacturers Ford Mercedes they're all coming out with electric cars Porsche is gonna electric car now yeah I mean that's a big deal yeah and those batteries yeah that's the next you know that's the next oil quick that oil type situation is going to be lithium and that's right next door all right so I think again I think as a second largest consumer of American products in the world is Mexico second largest so economies are intertwined they have a lot of Americans living down there there's a lot of blood ties to within the country of course Americans don't want America to be Mexico and of course a lot of Mexicans want Mexico to be more like America that's what would fix things increasing the opportunities and making Mexico a better place yeah we need to make some make Mexico great again shirts and yeah and get getting fights at the airport really if we're connected to Mexico if Mexico was like Canada where you know like Canada is fucking wonderful you go over there there's amazing cities it's it's great it's safe it's clean if we can make Mexico like that then we'd have you know it would be better for everybody including Mexico including the United States everybody post-911 at the border you could see how businesses started failing in San Diego because it became harder to cross the border mmm so you interested since there's there's symbiotic relationship with some of these border towns specifically California is very dependent on some port towns in Mexico yeah we were sent three a day without Mexicans yeah shut this whole fucking place down man there's nothing going on without Mexicans here yeah that's why anti-mexican racism some of the dumbest racism in all of the united states but particularly for California it's so stupid I you know I got to see how like in places like Fallbrook California where the the avocado capital of the world cutting down all the avocado trees because there's a drought and there's nobody to pick them really yeah there's less no one to pick less people coming up and it's harder to maintain like don't people they hire illegals and there's holy shit these farms need to organize start working on border control it's like the whole I don't know man i i'm i'm one of those people that believes in borders but I also believe if you're a hard-working person who wants to do better you should have an opportunity and and I don't think a lot of people particularly poor people that aren't very well educated there's not an opportunity you can't there's no reason for them to be over here so if they apply for United States Citizenship well there's well why you want to come here well I want to come here for opportunity what do you have to offer I'm you know I'm a hard worker there's a lot of hard workers I mean that's really the attitude yeah you know and I think we all just got I mean me I got lucky I got lucky my grandparents came here dad got lucky that's all it is it's just luck and to deny that and to deny these other people this opportunity this just got to be a way to filter out bad people yeah maybe as technology gets better we could recognize bad people better yeah I mean I went through a bunch of questioning they look at my background I got a lot of questions before I show you right I got a looks and it's fine you know and I you know I was like I didn't you know I didn't do anything wrong so I'm like I'm here it's fine but you know there's a lot of people like again the Luna Garcia Luna was here on a green card and he got nabbed when he went to process his full citizenship so he was here for a long time Wow he should just stuck with the green card I would have kept quiet for a layer that's he's in jail right he lied to a to an immigration agent that's one of the charges he has on Wow right so it's pretty interesting that people like him have spent a long time of year things like open secrets and you know yeah I mean again not all not all Mexicans good good guys you know not all humans are good yeah I know yeah so you know hardworking people come up here I got some of the people that that I've met out here that are kind of on the same boat as I am fresh in the country you know doing manual labor construction working at Kentucky ice I met a bunch of guys that were working on the Kentucky Derby or the horse stalls around them all Mexicans you could smell you know the tortillas the good food is usually you can smell you know you can you know where they are dude there's a place if you're hungry there's a place I don't tell anybody the name because I don't want to fuck it up okay and I place down the street from here that like
