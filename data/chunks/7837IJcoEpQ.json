the girag and experience it's gonna happen but there's always gonna be people to do there always have bins from Amelia Earhart to you know fill in the blank yeah all throughout history has always been women that have figured out a way to achieve and and do things that they really truly enjoyed doing like our flight attendant we are hijacked for the longest time I've ever been hijacked as an adult no Tommy and I were having a fun little conversation and we ordered a little glass of wine because we're gentlemen and we're on a business trip we decided to have a little wine and we're sitting there and the woman came over and she made a joke about the temperature of the wine and I made the mistake of going um is it like you're apologizing it's too cold that's funny I've never heard anybody apologize of wine is too cold just huh well if you remember the scene from sideways yeah I've never really been much into wine the only time I drink wine is in church but there's a funny thing about wine I knew a guy and the guy was a wine connoisseur and they brought him a bottle of wine and said should we put this in the refrigerator you spit don't you touch it and put it in the refrigerator don't you put a hand on that wine and bring in the raw I thought it was so funny but of course I don't drink the only time I drink the joy and he went on and on and on yes to the point where I was lucky because I was in the window so I just abandoned Tommy I lifted up the window and I put my face to the glass then I reached into my lap talk bad but I pulled up pulled out my notepad and I started writing down I wrote in my note that flight attendant won't shut the fuck up yeah I wrote that in my notepad I started writing it in front of her too and then Tommy yes well first of all she came out when she came over she goes doing something to drink I said yeah you have Pinot Noir which is not that crazy to say sometimes ago we know we have cab like this yeah won't shut the fuck up yeah that's great this has to be addressed when I said do you have Pinot Noir she goes uh excuse me and I go Pinot Noir she goes do you think you're in Lyon France yeah and I was like no even if it's not yeah it's not crazy and she was like we got red or white and I was like all right red and then when she came back it was sideways it was the sommelier at Macy's who when I worked at the hospital they brought him the wine and he says that Chile's and he and we're talking about the most like boring sentences oh yeah these were these are incredibly boring senses the work was just like oh god when she left when she left and we go like what the fuck was that she left she came back and I just made I just looked up she goes Jeff see the movie Simon okay uh uh she was like my favorite scene in that is a wine scene and I was like all right she was and I this is when I zone - she's like Bruce Willis and she was like eh not over it all the wine fall I thought was a Great Satan and I was like she wouldn't stop yeah and you know what's really fascinating before this happened before this happened Tommy nailed her personality cuz we may or may not have had before we got on that plane and so we were it was just starting to kick in and mid-flight and he goes you know what I think I think that they put her on this small plane because she can't work well with others oh right and that the other students don't like working with her so they stick her on these small planes because she doesn't she doesn't want to be around anybody she probably been doing this a long time and they know she doesn't work well with others and then she came over and just right away gave us the ferocious ear beating yes right yes it was an ear beating was also she gave us an ear beating on Church shutting off the phone's to like everything Eldin up her phone yeah pressing this button and we didn't have our phones on it's not like we were resisting we shut our phones off but she did it for the whole thing like this is what I want you to do you see this button I want you to press this button not in airplane mode folks not an airplane mode I want you to shut this button if you have an iPhone I want you to slide that over the to shut it off and I mean she's going on and on and on it taking a long-ass time yeah and if you wanted to read a book or if you want to you know listen to your iPod yeah that's not happening no you're dealing with this nonsense yeah you're dealing with the end you can't even fight against that nonsense because if you argue at all about anything they kick you off the plant yep she's got the power over I have a friend get kicked off the plane because he was upset that they didn't find a seat for his son next to him like they didn't find anybody that was willing to move it was an hour-and-a-half flight from San Francisco to Seattle it's a quick ass flight and they you know he said is there is it possible she was like sure we've tried there's nothing we could do he goes I have a five-year-old though like why did you guys sell me a ticket I told you who's five years old you can't have a five-year-old sit by himself he's terrified of flying in the first place like all I'm asking is someone if you ask if someone could switch seats and she said sir I've tried there's nothing we can do please take your seat and he was like you guys are the most unfamilar like you guys are horrible I can't believe you're doing this so that's all he says he goes and sits down and the fucking captain comes up to him so sorry gonna have to come off the tan they say you're aggressive and you're it was like what he goes you gotta be you must be joking he goes all I asked is if they could find a seat for my son I didn't use profanity I didn't raise my voice I said you guys are the most unfamilar line that I've ever seen that's all I said because you weren't even willing to like look for someone and they kicked him off the point enough yeah amy was like I can't believe this because I'm not aggressive like but we saw that was a you and I that saw that who did we see what we we on a plane we saw two guys arguing about the the bin uh I don't know it's me on that one I don't think I've seen Terry we'll kick though I might have been Mari I've seen a lady get kicked off for having attitude about later a whole day she was like anything you put me late on this shit and now me and fucking that and she was just complaining complaining complaining and you know she was I think aggressive speaking to them boom boot and I saw one who got kicked her whole family off and she had small children she was breastfeeding one of them and they were like we're gonna taxi now and you need to you know I watching a character she gave the lady attitude about the flight attendant attitude when the flight attendant asked her I don't know if she asked her to stop breastfeeding well we were gonna taxi but she told her like you know why don't you just worry about the drinks while I'm breastfeeding and they were like uh-uh and then we stopped and they actually that one they had police come out to the to the point even go back please came out they opened the door they just get off on the power absolutely I think sometimes I think sometimes they they absolutely want to protect themselves and they have to you know you can't have somebody whose actual threat right the flight but I think I think there's definitely a thrill in knowing that if somebody gives you kind of a little jab kind of a little attitude like I could fuck up your day right now yeah pretty pretty badly too and I can justify it and we were talking about that that this ability to hijack you is kind of the same thing because in a normal scenario you don't have to listen to this person you're not stuck in a chair literally strapped in with a fucking belt yeah you have to listen like it's an image they can just hover over you and just shit in your face yeah your headphones on in your hood and your glasses that's why you do that in the middle of a conversation there's a conversation with another guy and then you're having a wine and then all sudden boom your stars the glasses I don't know if you remember the glasses where these they're like tasting glasses they weren't very small very small and the first time I had two sips and his empty and she goes doing refill and I go yeah she goes we had a couple of drinkers up here I was like it's kind of like you know I can see a certain person not me personally but I could see that comment really setting somebody off the input the outside yeah implication of like whatever a couple of drunk I want to say any ones that no no no need to say any more than we were he said we already got to cruel poor lady she's lonely she wants to talk to people that's it it's crush and it's also commercials that's okay yeah that's all I know I feel I don't feel right about it but don't you think it's an inability to read social cues yes all there's no doubt she has no de niro ability she wasn't good at it or she didn't care just wanted to talk yeah you know who knows you know a lot of people by the way or a little pilled up and they don't even know that you don't want them to talk to you like there's some every peep everything's gonna be okay folks there's a few of those people that are antidepressant the fuck up yes super duper common if you look at the number of prescriptions sold the number of antidepressant prescriptions that are sold in this country every year it's staggering I believe it's like 30 million 30 million people I can see let's see how many people aren't antidepressants let's just guess I'm saying it's about 30 million yeah I think member that book prozac nation was out in the 90s that's when they started it to explode and like everyone was on in pro six but it's such a huge industry I know I know handful of you have a friend on Prozac yes good guy too great guy astounding increase in antidepressant use by Americans a Harvard University study Harvard health publications from Harvard Medical School where you could just smoke weed right people 12 and over increase by almost 400% Wow between 1988 to 1994 and then from 2005 to 2008 that's incredible holy shit 23% of all people and antidepressants are women and their 40s and 50s no no excuse me 23% of women in their 40s and 50s are on antidepressants well an apposite four yeah but that makes men 3% you're going through the change in life a higher percentage than any other group by age or sex just stop and think about that 23% of women in their 40s and 50s are on a pill that keeps them happy statistically there's a really good chance that our flight attendant is one of those people that's what I'm saying yeah that's what I'm saying look I had a friend that was on it and one of the things he said to me was that when he was on it nothing bothered him he was on Zoloft he's like nothing bothers me nothing nothing can faze me no everything's fine nothing bothers me yeah and those kind of people they don't see things coming they don't see so they're not aware that they're being weird wonder what they've interesting obviously won't happen but to hear what her version of that dialogue would be dude I mean so like it's also kind of like it was great talk to those guys so much fun these two guys work in wine we had a great conversation you love me they love my fuckin anecdotes about us hey I told them the sideways story and I never seen two guys have a better time they were pretty they were pretty I'm into the fuckin bottle you know one of them had two drinks the other one had about fine ah maybe a total of four ounces they was ready they were they were really little glasses sippin glass of wine
