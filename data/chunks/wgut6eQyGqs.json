the gyro gun experience yeah I took fourth grade and I know those kids are grownups and that's really cool good some of them told me it was the best year of their lives they come to see me to stand up oh that's amazing who you teach it what worth great you know everything but fourth graders like different that's science everything I mean yeah it's different than what you did because you went to set people who had like an interest and a love for something and when did it explore it be what you were doing but mine is different they had to be there so right I my thing was about self-esteem I figure I can't teach these subjects are gonna come and go in their lives but teaching him self-esteem and some of the most rewarding things were like had this one kid he was real shy he was so shy he's real tall my name it was embarrassed by it and he would stay in the clinic cloten cloakroom they'd call it you know where all the coats he just stay in here won't come out I go this guy used to calm sky King because he was a space cadet go sky you gotta come out he can't stay I can't let a kid just sit and you know and by the end of me just like working his self-esteem and all he was in the middle of the class just what everybody else waving his hand and his mother came up to me and she was like really touched by it and told me that I changed his life and you know that's kind of shit school and now I got like a couple of the girls come to see me as she goes one of the girls goes mister why did you let us do so much stuff you know like good I said because you were smarter than me I said she wanted me I said look you know I was I had more knowledge because I was an adult but you know you kids Lonnie you had more brain power to me I know I wasn't dumb I was smart enough to know that I was in that's why you ran the class so you were an easy teacher that's what's really easy I told them at the beginning of the year I said look I want this to be the most fun year of your life only you can mess it up I said a fucking awesome opportunity that must have been and I said I want to go to the gym this one I was playing basketball I said I want to go to the gym more than you do so the real you know we're gonna have a party every Friday afternoon I would have we would have like kids that would do breakdancing and stuff and really yeah it was that's awesome it was great did you ever try to pitch that as a sitcom no but somebody else had an idea for a couple times would be hilarious sitcom it seems like a natural yeah you as a funny teacher because you really did it it's legit and if you really stop and think about it that would be like for a kid that's like one of the greatest rolls of the dice a kid can get for the fourth-grade teacher yeah yeah down where our for your fourth-grade teacher you're still causing mr. I rarer she's 26 years old right when I said whatever and they're closing mister I rarer all right and I go Theresa first of all you're taller than me she's hot blonde like oh you stop with the mister you could call me dumb because I just can't call you dumb that's funny like she's got you got me damaged mr.rai rare that's good that'll keep you from being a dirty bird she's a little girl let her talk call you mr. barish tryin to stablish boundaries do you think that becoming more aware or reaching a higher state of consciousness because of your experiences will actually help you because it'll abandon a lot of the distractions that you present yourself it's almost unknowingly yeah well it helps me it helps me in training and particularly when I'm running now because I used to listen to like Pantera and and yeah like vision of disorder when I was running and I'd worked myself into like a rage so I would run to exhaustion that was kind of how I trained and I trained all the way through my career like that and the last couple of fights have switched it up ever listening to a lot more like more like boring binaural beat type of stuff when I'm running so I can get into more like a meditative stage you know we're doing a lot of yoga as well and trying to find the same thing where you just you you you within yourself and you're not focusing on anything else so your body's almost like on autopilot yeah that you the music that you listen to when you train can have a profound effect on approach your training yeah it really can it's so important and that's why I've always been so vocal about all the stuff I listen to like at a light training camp playlist so I've tweet everyday songs I was listening to and that kind of thing it is important and and and the other thing is well like earlier on in my career I would use music to anchor feelings so like like when I fought Ludwick I used the song called iron by Woodkid which was the first time I'd switched it up from Inglot belongs to me for like you know a bunch of fires so like for the 12 weeks of that fight I was training with Frank Mir we were going up to Red Lobster Mount Charleston and now into Red Rock and like doing Hill running and stuff and we had some real tough sessions I mean you know we really put ourselves through it for that training camp and as soon as I got back in my truck after the session after the session if I felt like it was a good session it was productive and I felt positive I would put that song on and I would constantly connect those feelings to that that song so then when when I'm walking out and that song comes on immediately I get that feeling again huh you know and it's just like you know just like when you listen to a song and you think of a person like oh I heard that you made that connection immediately but you can also train yourself to do it yes that's why I listened to Cypress Hill now and it will take me back to fighting cage warriors like you know back in 2006 Wow and I have songs all the way through like that and now I don't listen to because it'll like my first two fights I came out to Pantera dragged the waters by the time I got to the cage I was so wound up and so angry that I would just add ran outta gas immediately and and now whenever I listen to those songs I get that feeling of like exhaustion like oh and I look at what's out there some answers make no sense to me and they seem to lead down really unhealthy paths so thank you but no thanks other answers make more sense or maybe they don't and I come up with my own but it's basic it really is boiled down to the Bruce Lee you know research your own experience reject what is useless absorb what is useful and add what's specifically Iran you know his basic methodology for how to approach knowledge I mean he applied it to martial arts but really is a brilliant way of approach just any kind of knowledge whether is ready it's about life yeah yeah that's hard for people to accept that right it's it's much easier to follow the pattern that your families for all I'm a Lutheran because of grandmas Lutheran right grandpa always said that no matter what we'll be Lutheran's yeah I'm talking to this girl and she said that she was gonna get a tattoo of a cross and I said I said oh I go you're really religious Sheils not really but you know what I was born Catholic and I figure out no matter what that's the one thing that I'll be for the rest of my life I'd be and I remember saying I'm like you know I didn't know her very well so I was like okay how do you know like how do you know you won't change your mind about that she's like oh my god my family would kill me and I was like oh okay well good luck with that good luck with that at war war two gun different there would be people today's like not really Nazi but you know if I don't put the swastika on my grandma I would her feelings will get really hurt and so it's I don't hate the Jews but grandma fucking hates Jews I love grandma yes exactly it's like I don't want to make them sad what's hilarious is that she was gonna get a Catholic tattoo in the first place because like in the Bible it very specifically says so like getting a religious tattoo it's like well you not listening to me no only I listen when it's convenient but a cross tattoo is so sexy it makes Milk spiritual and it thins out my back that's the other point of people get pissed when you argue create your own it's like what do you mean create your own it well there are some absolute truths that fall from have stopped making up their own shit anyway I mean when people say they follow something it's bullshit really they are making up their own thing because they will edit some parts that they don't like they will focus on the parts they like and pretend that it's the one and all the interpretation and say if you're gonna do that might as well be honest and just pick from any source if you're gonna pick and choose
