mmm to bunt boomp hotep Jesus how are you sir I always wanted to say that wanted to call somebody that I've made that drop how the fuck to get a name like hotep Jesus had that come about it wasn't my idea you know I was uh I had just went through my spiritual awakening I just know our industry and I went through like that mace thing you know you go what are you doing on top my hair down this is black big so yes so here chill wakening yeah I had the spiritual awakening and I'm you know tweeting on Twitter like I do write and uh somebody said what do you think you are some kind of hotep Jesus oh yes I do think I'm who - that's perfect then now you own it that person is probably fuck god damn it that was a great name I gave that dude yeah I don't know who that person is or was or where they are now shout out to whoever you are exactly and vibe high your Twitter why didn't you switch it to hotep Jesus can you switch it ah does anybody only hotep Jesus I do you so you have hotep Jesus on Twitter - yeah reserved it oh dude I think they could probably swap do you have a little one of them cute little blue checkmarks yeah no - put the fuck is that how do you get one of those I don't know yeah there's some people that have those that have like a thousand followers oh yeah are you getting it like if you work for the New York Times or sometimes you had them I'll do Joe and then I get verified I don't know how Twitter feels about me I mean I think Jack likes me he's been in a couple of times but I think the whole there they're weird man they want I mean I think all social media all tech companies want you to toe a line right now and if you're not towing that line and you're bring on forbidden guests and you have people that have controversial ideas you know they then have that finger on the button of getting rid of you they don't know what to do it's just like radio mm-hmm you know like radio a lot of people don't know but radio has to play happy songs cuz happy people buy things I mean yeah that's well that's what the studies say allegedly the marketing studies and advertising studies say people who aren't a good mood tend to buy things right so the radio is supposed to play happy songs all day long and the radio works for the advertisers kind of like media and so on so forth so social media is no different they have advertisers so if there's people on the platform who are creating disgruntled crowds it could be hurting the bottom line yeah but Facebook's algorithm actually favors that the way Facebook has it set up like say if if you if you get into debates with people on abortion or something like very controversial they will start sending that shit to your feed that will they will prop it will sort of steer it in your direction because the more you engage the more clicks they get the more money they get the more advertising dollars they get absolutely absolutely the Facebook algorithm is quite unique and the way that things can go viral there um Twitter I feel like the Twitter safety and Councilman yeah what do they call it trust and safety yeah that what is some like that yeah so when I go and look at the entities that contribute to that board I kind of start saying oh okay I see why certain topics are taboo mm-hmm you know there's when you when there's a board those people on the board are the voice they're the ones that have the opinion you know so if your group isn't represented maybe you need to figure out how to get on that board you know what I mean right I don't know anybody's doing it more nah it's not gonna happen and you better be left-wing we're gonna get on that board yeah what do you think Blackbird is I think Jack's more like in the middle yes I think he's closer to the middle I don't think it's Jack I think it's you know Jack's working on a bunch of different projects mm-hmm but I think it's probably you know whoever else is in the office making the data days decisions yeah I'd like to jack a lot but I think jack is in the middle of a gigantic corporation mm-hmm and there's so many people with so many idea essentially the founding fathers of our country had a great idea when it comes to freedom of expression they felt like it was very important that you have free speech and they don't you can't be silenced you can't be it can't be undermined by people who disagree with you because it's dangerous it's dangerous from someone can just decide that you can't have a voice anymore and only if there can be heard and we're kind of seeing that with Twitter and we're kind of seeing that with Facebook and with Google and they're they're deciding what could be heard and whatnot come here they think they're doing it for good reasons they think they're doing it to preserve our culture and our civilization and they want to protect people from the election it read it shut down the donald the the the donald trump support reddit page yeah that's not a good idea the right right before the DIMM yeah them to be right before the democratic debate and you know that was like where all the funny memes come from and look man this you can't do that i mean just because if you have some people that are saying some shit that's bad on there get rid of those people get rid of that but you can't just shut down a whole forum like it seems that seems insane is there a reason for it it's not shut down it says it's quarantined yeah we're fuck does that mean does it have a disease for like a temporary Scott Ebola it's happens to people they gotta do something I don't know it says there's violent threats I'm looking to see what Oh Enid misbehaviour violent threats skeptical very seems weird right I feel like all this stuff isn't it like we're seeing what the First Amendment is really all about why it exists we're seeing it play out yeah with all these social media sites I really think you know my thing is with like the reddit thing right it's very easy to create an actor right the left can create a right wing actor online to pretend like it's something about sure it's something else they can go in and read it do something malicious to get the whole reddit banned right like an agent provocateur yeah exactly and I never leave that off the table when I look at instances like this we know somebody who's it's the Internet everybody's anonymous thing how are you tracking this back to who it is you know I mean do you know what's conservative do you know as a Republican are you sure so you know I take these things these pieces of information with a grain of salt yeah you should but is this election meddling the kind of is right is what it feels like if you're killing a whole sub what does it depends I mean so if they're really that would be really interesting if it turns out that it was someone for the left that was posing as someone from the right in order to shut down a forum and pretend there's death threat sir I mean you look at YouTube right what what's been happening with YouTube even just the algorithm you know I'm pretty good with keywords I do SEO and marketing so when I type in certain keywords to find certain things I know what's gonna come up or what type of content comes up now when I type in those keywords it's like ABC ABC ABC and then and I'm like that's not what I wanted they don't even talk about these keywords what are you talking about yeah so when you start seeing that you start thinking about ink sock in Orwell in 1984 and socialism and communism and fascism and the degradation of society and a lot of control coming down you know people you know in some ways it's like was the internet created for freedom or was it contributes to different pathways we could probably look at that but it seems like in many ways they set us up to be controlled and they're doing it through monopolies Google controls search through YouTube and Google and by what you search you can think it's a truth but what did Kanye say Kanye say Google lied to you you know so Johnny says a lot of crazy shit though you don't really think about that he does and I like crazy I'm a big fan of crazy I'm a little crazy a lot of crazy sometimes so I appreciate his crazy side more than his calm side hmm well great things come from wild thoughts right exactly I think the internet was initially created to exchange information and then when it got loose to the general public they realized what a crazy idea that was mm-hmm well I think we're seeing right now with the algorithms is that these corporations are influencing these companies to say hey when someone's looking for these things how about you send them over to ABC how about you send them over to NBC how about you you know like we want to be able to get the first views on these things so if someone's searching for that I don't know how they do it I don't know what they whether they have agreements with them maybe I mean there's also a lot of copy written shit that's on there the could get YouTube in some significant trouble if they have a really decided to pursue it right and how many videos are on YouTube that people have on their channel that are just straight off of Fox News or NBC News or there's a lot of like copyright protected content that YouTube is essentially profiting off of oh yeah yeah they make a ton of money off of that stuff yeah um so they might have deals but I say look we'll send these people to you know this first yeah and that's why I say you know that's what control comes in you know the advertisers when advertisers are the ones paying you know for the platform so yeah I think it's not us the users that are paying for YouTube's free so who's paying right yeah they're they're monetizing us they're monetizing us the users and the viewers yeah that's where it gets tricky right because as soon as the advertisers get onboard they said look we you know we want to give you money but this content it's not advertiser friendly right and then they start moving stuff around and D monetizing things and and with D monetization the real thing that they're doing in a lot of ways whether it's intentional or not is you're influencing what people post you're kind of sent you you're asking them to self-censor because if you say hey you guys want to discuss abortion rights or you know it could there's there's some things that you start discussing them and they will automatically dump D monetize you yeah well who is the girl that put out the abortion documentary right any which girl's snatch that down I forget what it's called I'm bad at memorizing these things but there was an uh basically an anti-abortion thing that exposed some things about abortion as a documentary I believe the day it went up it got shut down she had to read up load it was it lawrence other might have been yeah there's those two cute white chicks nobody thinks are super racist lauren southern and tammy the other one Lauren Tommy Lauren Tommy Lauren so she did a documentary but then you have like the James O'Keefe thing where you know he put up the expose in YouTube and then that got you know obviously they're gonna take it after the most recent one that exposed Google right right yeah I've been asking people about that I'm like okay break this down for me is there any way that this could have been deceptively advertise or deceptively edited like is it seems to me like they're saying that they're going to manipulate search results and they're gonna manipulate the way people see things because of the 2016 election they don't want that happening again in 2020 that's what it seems when I'm looking absolutely exactly looks like could it be doctored of course good you know yeah that's always possible but when you go and experience it for yourself like I was talking about with you know doing a keyword search you start yeah seeing the power of those and then you know Uncle hotep you know is his channel was you know doing great and then the algorithm flipped and they see no like he wasn't making the same money anymore so it's like I don't have to go to some doctor video or whatever video to understand his problem the people around me are being affected by it you know this is a primary source I don't have to look at some on internet but no no it's it's in a way I don't like playing victim with the topic right stare platform do what you want with it we choose to be there we don't have to be there there's not another game in town though it's not it's weird right when you think about how big the internet is and there's only one YouTube right in Vimeo and all those other ones they're great but well the you're not always related to the black community you know the black community always say oh you know white people that is white people that white people describe but without they're not giving us opportunity and it's always like well is that the only opportunity can you not create your own opportunity you know what I mean so I never want to take a victim mentality and say oh you know let's take Google to court you know all this stuff it's like if you want to do that that's fine that's not how I'm looking at this I'm looking at it long-term like hooking up with Andrew table over at Gap you know what I mean and building tools so you know we do the quaint bits app calm and creators can actually it's based upon approval right now but creators can go on there and receive Bitcoin as a donation you know so we're circumventing the things that happen like with the deep platforming at patreon right and the other payment platforms for creators so we're creating tools to circumvent these things so that's how look at it I'm like Oh Google's doing this great this is a great opportunity here let me seize it and let me build it and be you know the alternative you know I love to see that is the alternative going to be YouTube and as popular of course not it's just not but it's still a viable option you can still communicate with your people the number one communication tool for an influencer with it with their raw community is email build your email list right people still subscribe to your email list right that's not YouTube that's not Google that's your email list that's your contact list so it's like you can complain about YouTube or Google but you can build your audience almost anywhere it depends on how powerful you are are you powerful enough to convince people to come to this other platform or to whatever you are a lot of people are powerful enough to pack a room at two thousand dollars ticket you tell me you can't get somebody to go to another platform for free who charges two thousand dollars a ticket oh I mean a lot of these speakers you know like the Tony Robbins type carrots this is right he charges two thousand bucks I think charge like ten yes I thinks I think some of his stuff was like ten yeah but he's doing like these week-long events where everybody gets together I'm gonna change your life doing karate kicks well that's the how you get the bigger check you guys create a bigger experience yeah so it's like alright so we'll do a one-day it 2k right it's like well how do I get 10k it's like well let's just extend it for the week and you know had like you know the kickboxing class and then you know we'll chat at this sauna you just you know create that's part of marketing you know yeah but yeah I'm not complaining about these tech companies these tech companies man I'm not scared of these dudes Manny's did the content is us the content is certainly us and like I get what I got from talking to Jack and Vidya was it's almost impossible man a site like that the just the influx of no like I used to have a message board on my website one of the things that I noticed before we shut it down was I was getting thousands and thousands of Russian emails that were signing up for my website remember that Jamie this is years ago there's like three years ago okay I mean fucking like tens of thousands of Russian email dresses were signing up like similar addresses hmm it was something like the IRA something like the internet research agency which does that which is responsible for all those fake pages on Facebook and Google and Instagram and all that said and they were signing up for websites and that had message boards and then they would jump on and pretend that they were whatever the fuck they were right pretend that they were a social justice warrior pretend that they're with black lives matter Indian and they just start fights start arguments yeah and it was like wow this is fascinating and then when it out and when it also happened and then it happened with Facebook and it became a big part of the election you realize like this is like concerted effort to use these platforms to wiggle so when you're Jack or you're whoever runs good you have to look at that and go okay how the fuck do we manage that I mean if we're in a free speech we should just let these people manipulate everybody right wait let it be wah wah was how can I mean it's when you have these people that are working for the Russians or even people that are working on the Left that are trying I mean if there really really is someone that's doing that to the Donald subreddit on reddit mm-hmm what do you do if you're in the free speech you're supposed to allow that right you could just create a metric you know or some sort of mechanism that red flag can account publicly right but I think this is where it gets slippery right because then you're talking about an algorithm you're talking about manipulating search results you're talking not that route what I'm saying not that rub but this is where it goes right if you just keep managing the content instead like someone like like gab where they just let the content flow free yeah obviously you go there there's a lot of dumpster fires man sort of fucking chaos I'll do that oh yeah absolutely nothing's gonna be perfect right you know um I think whenever you see bad that's good right okay oh yeah that is a portal to good it is an opportunity to fix something because at some point that problem was going to emerge right it just emerged now so it's like oh wow okay here's this problem the solution every problem lies within the problem so technically there is no problem so let's just go ahead and solve this problem and move on to the next one you know but I love problems I love solving problems I think it's really fun so when I see a problem I go hmm good let's let's think about this and sometimes it's not a one-person job you know it's a whole committee and a whole bunch of Minds have to get together so when I look at the conservative community I think about like you know aren't you have all these minds but are your minds working to complain or your minds working to solve the problem and it seems like the minds aren't working to solve the problem their work in a complaint right so for example during the early 20th century early 1900s do with this newspaper super popular in New York and he put some inflammatory things about a certain family in New York City and all the department stores boycott the newspapers he has no advertisers so they did that to put him out of business and this gentleman takes the space and gives it to the proletariat or the you know small business guys in the area and he gets some full front page ads right stuff that the department stores couldn't buy and then what happened was after the the newspaper guard is circling like that at department stores department stores came back and they said yo all right all right fine fine we'll pay will come back and he said no I'll need you anymore you know I have people that can do this I can do this with the people and his newspaper was successful into the day he died so when I look at that example that was able to thrive in 19 you know 20 in something or in 1910 and whatever it was I look at it and I'm like if this guy just stood on his laurels and didn't bow you know then why can't we do it as a nation or as a team you know I think it's very possible to so for example like we look at gap right there's a new competitor I'm not gonna mention a name but it's like they whoever was the establishment created this alternative platform to compete with gap there's one other laundress yeah you don't wanna mention them in now screwed up really yeah oh my what's bad about them their establishment right oh so so when I look at so establishments created another free speech platform allegedly allegedly they're just gonna collect the data on these people and then you know sell it off well makes you think that intuition you know hotels have been told you you know make sure that you VA sure oh we got a shirt hotels been told you that's our show oh yeah I mean I go to a show every Thursday 8:00 p.m. you see Tom so yeah you know uh I can I can kind of i've been calling a lot of these shots and a lot of these things and there's just certain things that you know I'm a tech startup founder right so it's certain things I can see within a business that the average person can't see and I'm like God it doesn't make sense that doesn't look right and you see uh you know as a tech startup it's really hard to get going right at first but when you see like MSNBC and it's just like how'd you get all these covers that fast who do you know you and I mean and then you start seeing the influencers that going over there and pushing them like oh these are all established I see what's going on what you didn't want you didn't want an alternative platform that you didn't control mmm okay so they're creating an alternative platform that they can control they can control air quotes alternative correct yeah well I think the writing is on the wall right if they look at the there's only one Twitter there's only one Instagram there's only one YouTube and those are giant and Facebook is basically the only thing like that right I mean there's really no competitor to Facebook and in that space I mean this is four of them they're all trashed let's be honest oh my goodness it's all trash hotep is going off ha ha Facebook trash I've been saying that for like the past decade Facebook's trash I stopped using Facebook a decade ago right if I used it it was just like forced you know I use it as a publishing outlet I want to put this tour dates or something like that I put it on Facebook Brown engage right exactly yeah so you know I can I can respect that I don't use Instagram I left it months ago when Farrakhan got kicked off her platform a bunch of conservative got kicked off her platform like I don't need this shit neither it's not left and also to keep your account just in case yeah absolutely yeah it's bookmarked um you know I got to automate a bot I'm gonna set up and all that say yeah yeah so you know if these platforms we don't need them they're not that great if you look at the story on in - gram Instagram was a lucky project Oh serendipitous right basically what happened was some kids built a project it was called Instagram they were working on a whole bunch of other things some popular kids started using a platform it blew up and then they pass it onto Facebook from the very inception I said this is a very trash product product it's just horrible horribly curated right it's so horribly curated that Facebook can't even monetize the platform properly right but that's a whole nother story but the platform itself and its functionality is stupid it's just popular we know what's weird is like replying to people and reading replies like what in the comments like you can't even keep up with nothing no and you can't get all your notifications the notifications aren't curated properly it's just it's like as if they don't care right they don't care right they don't care or is it that it got so big so quick and it's stuck in this format you'd have to kind of reformat the way it's they don't care don't think so they don't care they don't care if you if you want to build a product for your user you can do that if you want to build a product for advertisers you can do that they built the product for advertisers and not for users if they build it for users you will now be able to have a conversation on there well isn't it originally wasn't it text America was that the same thing was text America the original one that's the one where I have the picture of the prostitute in the bathroom I mean like where you would text something to you send a photo you send a photo and go up to an internet website it would be like on a site like imager so I'm not like a feed where people would follow you like that wasn't no there was a thing that you'd fall ok good fuck that's where that picture came for I know that but I didn't remember it being like a website or anything like that was back when there was no applications ma'am because I took that from a flip phone Anthony ghio that's the difference yeah I found like a smartphone yeah there was no smartphones pregnant and then you would have to go to a website to see all your photos so like you have a young Jaime page on texts America and all the pictures that you had taken the first photos on Instagram a lot of people were you'd be like shit as a photographer you'd be kind of like shit on if you weren't taking with your iPhone only mmm I can you were uploading DSLR photos you'd be like rah you're fucking look at your right but now it filters like some of these girls you look like cartoons they didn't look like humans you know comes down to is like you know what should Kahuna's right so you know a lot of people told me I was like oh you missed not a lot of money on Facebook you missed not a lot of Instagram money on Instagram my homies a millionaire off of Instagram and Facebook advertisement ain't towing button I'm like you online is for money bro I got a message to get across and I can't get it across on these platforms they suck right but are you gonna have the cojones to come and say I'm choosing my laurels over I'm choosing my morals over the money because it's a lot of people out here that are on the Facebook platform just for money I spoke to a conservative influencer and brother basically said I'm trying to feed my daughter but the stuff he's putting out on Facebook he doesn't believe in it so he's just doing it for profit she's doing it for profit oh that that's where it gets weird right he says then people are not gonna believe you once say well I was doing that for money but now I'm telling the truth but these I'm talking about this these are the people that everybody believes these are the ones that have captured a large audience I mean talking about you know type of money you can pull in on on Facebook mm-hmm but you know he literally says you know I'll go on Twitter I'll make one tweet and then I get like two thousand retweets and then you know you know I his his brain just blows up like that but it's because he knows the the buzzwords right he knows what to say they get the people going I'll go that route you know what I mean if I don't like Facebook I'm not gonna use if I don't like Facebook I'm not gonna use Instagram you know I'm just gonna you know stick with what I like I like Twitter not old people in 2009 I gonna I'm Twitter you know I deal in marketing so I always say focus on one channel when it comes to social media just one channel unless you have the staff - well Twitter's how I found out about you and that's all I found out about your videos and it found out about you've watched your videos and if if that didn't exist and the the portal for the video you're putting your videos on YouTube right mhm I mean what how else would someone get their message out if you if you if you think that these platforms are all trash if they didn't exist I wouldn't find out about you Twitter is great remember I would never mention Twitter you said all of them are trash but all of them excesses what Twitter is what is my baby man I love Twitter like so much about Twitter it's uh it's it's it's it's a perfect platform to crowd source information number one right like you said without Twitter I wouldn't be sitting here right now I couldn't never got to you on Facebook or Instagram that wouldn't never happen maybe Instagram some a friend most of it is like hey one of my friend says check out this guy this guy's cool this guy's interesting right B you should talk to this guy okay that's how it usually happens and then I'll go to your page and I checked it out and I saw a lot of interesting conversations you were having and right saw some videos well the thing is Instagram doesn't allow you to see in my heart they don't allow you to see in the soul Twitter I can really connect with people how come you can't do that on Instagram algorithm huh you know you oh you mean because it hides stuff and stuff yeah but once you develop a good following it doesn't really matter people would go to your page for how well fuck for you but how often can you post on Instagram often can you post well you can't do it like Twitter where you could just do it every couple minutes you see what I'm saying yeah so if I wanted to I could go from deep to where my middle-aged white women at right in 15 minutes time right you know I can take you deep and then I can make you laugh yeah you don't I mean and I can share you know something else I can share my video and you could have photos on Twitter just like you could have on Instagram I wanted to I can go live mm-hmm and so Twitter is great at how they curate the live feature I mean it lands at the top year falling on mobile right it's beautiful like like they like they get product you know I feel like Instagram gets product um but Twitter's is you know matter of fact this is a great time I brought you my book I thought those McDonald's or Burger King not what is he eating there's my book right here Twitter marketing I brought that for you it retails on on how to build a cult-like following yeah and that's basically all my secrets on how I got on it Joe Rogan experience I want to I'm trying to remember who told me about you I want to give someone the credit I uh well you know they people said to me you know you should go on Joe Rogan i retweeted it and then it started this fire storming your mansions and then you followed me yeah and then i retweeted a guy followed you because someone told me though right after trying to remember who the fuck it is oh it's somebody you know yeah somebody I knew oh okay I was like a serendipitous thing then I don't even know if they had seen you post that you're trying to get on the podcast oh I think someone had just contacted me and said hey check out this guy's shit oh I watched some of the YouTube conversations you just look like you're having a good time but you were talking about serious shit yeah yeah it's it's you know so I got kids so when I said when I teach my kids it's always to edutainment know if I can't make my kids laugh while I'm doing my lecture every day when they come home from school or I try to do every day there's a lecture we inform I want to talk about something real in life how many kids yeah three my daughter's 16 and my boys are odd 2010 are twin boys Dallas Phoenix and Sydney they're one named out two cities so every day they come home I have a lecture waiting for him but when I prepare my lectures for them I always figure how am I gonna make him laugh because my son Dallas he's a very linear in thinking I could lecture and he'll sit there and listen to every single word the other two like me they'll just like zone out so your twins not are they're identical to my maternal fraternal yeah so his brother and his sister just like me with all two now and going to lala land it's gonna be weird when you have two kids that were born the exact same time they're twins but yeah they're totally different yeah and he looked different that's so ones brown skinned ones last game whoa well come out of the box at the same time if you hit you know it's a crazy dynamic the burst headaches are nuts man yeah their personalities are very different that is one of the things that tripped me out the most about having kids mm-hmm is how how does they are their own little person out of the fucking box yeah but you influenced them a little you teach them you can give them morals and ethics and you can set a good example but boy they come with their own unique set of ingredients yeah they do you getting to and you know I don't I don't try to change that all I try to do is push them in that direction like whichever way you're going I'm just going to try and assist that you know I don't try to like bring you back this way so my son Dallas he likes to draw it you know I'm like alright well here's some youtube videos tutorials do it every day you know my son Phoenix is like I want to have my own comic book I will start writing it he starts writing his comic book and Annie comes and he asked me questions and I help them we share in a Google Doc and we just we just do the damn thing you know what I mean that's cool yeah they're little startups so you kind of just got it you just gotta feed them you know that's a good way of looking at it yeah you know you've got a water room man and just let them grow I think sometimes we try to prune them too much hmm well you definitely see that a lot with people that are - they're just way too heavy-handed with their kids and the kids just always resisting oh yeah just constantly get the fuck away from me man that shit's unnecessary it's unnecessary it's unproductive and you're gonna develop a rift between you and your kids yeah so so this story I always tell is um you know when you black and you go in a supermarket you get that talk like but not going hey but not touched man don't ask for nothing right so well you know that's how I grew up a lot of us grew up so when I go into the supermarket or I went to the supermarket there's one time and my son is uh Phoenix my twin he's running around in the supermarket and you know I don't I try not to yell at my kids and all that stuff right so I just tap his brother and sister on the show nice a look at him look at him look at him and they looking and we just started laughing at him so he turns around he goes like why are you laughing at me and I start imitating all that type stuff and he so he's I put the mirror in front of the mirror and when he does that never again yeah we can I didn't have to yell at him I'd have to hit him I had a custom mount and after threaten that's great you know it's just it's just basic psychology yeah that's one of the hardest things for people to do to see how other people see them when someone sees you with humor and you look like a fool look that's me exactly so you've got put your mirror but you know Twitter you know I handle I handle everything you know I figure you can't change culture through lecture you change coach at the winter tainment what do you think about all this talk like Elizabeth Warren's talked about it and some other candidates have talked about his mother politicians have talked about breaking up these big companies breaking up Facebook it's too big break up Google break up Twitter mm-hmm what do you think about that well I think we have to study what happened to standard oil what happened in standard standard oil they broke it up and it became Exxon Chevron Texaco I think BP don't quote me on that one but does anybody have brand loyalty to gas there's anybody like dude I'm a Chevron man they create those those cards right those oils gas cards oh okay yeah yeah that's how they create a little tea right here does the evolution of standard oil Jamie pulled it up on the screen yeah there you go wow so standard oil was too big yeah like fucked this place right we have to move it around a little bit 1911 standard oil of Kentucky 1911 they did this right so if you look at it it's broken up into I think it says 34 right 34 companies right so you start on one on the left right and then as you go what do you see you see a consolidation don't you you see these merges yeah so when you break up a monopoly you're not really breaking up with not monopolies what you're doing is you're creating a divide and conquer dynamic so it's like okay I'll let my brother control this one my sister control that with my cousin controls and you actually corner the market so breaking up would not believe isn't exactly a good thing in that case yeah in that case and I think we'll see the same thing with Google if we break up Google what you're gonna do is just have little subsidiaries or little satellite things that will just control a certain segment under a different name which will make it harder to track back to its source hmm so I'm you know when I say you know break up monopolies I think that the establishments like yeah come on break me up baby do you think so I don't think they want to lose any control certainly not like Facebook does it's not yours and get rid of the Zuckerberg forever ah right aren't you trying to get rid of him the board members like that's a day claim but get that robot out of here Leslie wait drinks water right he does look like a robot we drink water in front Congress but isn't that socialism mm-hmm that's socialism when you oh my god comes in and tells you what you can do with your corporation yeah that's socialism so so what I feel is like the powers that be are pushing socialism are they we can use this as an excuse to infiltrate corporations and you know and start controlling this internet space so the internet space is now communist I'm of the opinion though that if we believe in freedom of speech and you create something that's so big that it's essentially a town square which is what I think these platforms are you if you ban people especially if you ban people shit like learn to code like things that don't make any sense oh yeah there's people there getting banned for some pretty ridiculous ideas yeah that as soon as you start doing something like that you are going against the fundamental ideas of this country is founded on absolute freedom of speech I think yeah it's incredibly important that if you have someone saying something that you think is wrong or is hurtful there should be a avenue where people can examine that and talk about it and combat it with good speech yeah with speech that makes sense yeah well you know a couple years ago or last year Africa no it's about a couple years ago I was lambasted for defending white nationalists you know when they first got deep platform some of them got deep platform or just white nationalists period I'm like well if this is how these people feel let's listen to them it's listen to their gripes what are they mad about right and then people like oh how could you these people are racist not only I don't care if they're races like that doesn't affect me right I'm not asking them for a job so they can't be racist towards me you know what I mean but um when you have these these groups that people call fringe I feel like the people that are fringe are the test for freedom of speech it's not the people in the middle it's the fringe groups on the outside if they don't have freedom of speech everybody in the middle screw hmm so I stood up now say yo let these dues talk like stop doing that like like you know I don't care you know if they're racist or whatever people call me names but then now you see it coming down and we lost you know Louis Farrakhan he got the platform he lost his verification you know and it's like what was there anything specifically that he said that allowed him to do that did you they just make a sweeping because they got rid of Milo they got rid of Gavin McInnes they got rid of a bunch of people that were on Instagram and Facebook that they hadn't D platformed but it didn't seem like there was anything that happened that caused them to do that it seemed like they just made some sort of a decision yeah that I think was probably based on preparing for the 2020 elections absolutely you saw it so what I think what happened was the the banning of Louis Farrakhan there's just a theory but they were like all right if we ban these conservatives the conservative crowd is going to just go apeshit right but if we throw them Louis Farrakhan it'll kind of settle things down a little bit cuz it'll look like we're fair I think you're exactly right yeah so I'm like so that's what they did and like I let's throw them in there now mm-hmm you know smooth things over that's exactly what I thought when I saw yeah yeah I was like this seems weird yeah yeah it's like they you have to justify like no we got rid of him too you know yeah yeah it's uh it's a strange time because there's even though there is gab and there's minds and there's is a couple other startups that are yeah trying to make their way and the the Jordan Peterson one and there's nothing that really stands out and once someone starts once a giant group of people starts using something unless it's like what Solaris is one day one of them vanished like MySpace how fucking badly did they manage my space because myspace had at all they had everybody yeah and then it just fucking died and still around but now it's like some fringe music publishing platform it's very weird you know it still exists but what Twitter is right now and what Facebook is right now and what Instagram is right now it seems like there's no real competitors but specifically YouTube there's no real competitor see cuz because when you know I don't want to you know dog pile on no minds or gab or anything but the problem is when you build a social network and this is why I will not build a social network at least not into the next 10 years you have to understand that you can't build a social network that mimics another one mmm that's the brain has to be different that's why Snap is still here right Snap is inside a certain demographic that's my daughter's you know generation right that's them right they're on snap so when you build these things you really have to sit down and say like you know what's the what are we gonna focus on like with Minds right you post videos you post photos and then how did the photos appear right so when I look at mines mines is my Instagram when you when you look at mines on mobile that the fonts really small so it's like I can't read this so I'm just gonna use this or photos when I put the photos it pops up right so it's like is mine's going to go that route are they gonna go the video route are they gonna go the tweet route you gotta pick one and then grow from there if you look at Twitter Twitter didn't have all these features in the beginning you just had tweet that's it there's no threads it's none of that yeah so you have to start at your core but when you the other problem they do is they try to build these social networks completely robust right with all the bells and whistles of the Giants nah bro you got to start small and slim and then let your audience tell you what the next feature is so what would you if you were gonna start one up what would it be or do not give out that information no it's not I don't want to give it out information I think information to be free but you know I I hate I hate the idea that people want to create social networks I'm like they exist let's use the ones that exist and let's just figure out how to make them better right but when you do that then those have so much power because they can dictate who's on who's not on right so what you do is when you have something like a Twitter you use your Twitter to congregate your minds right but then your you know your your bills of the world your your Andrew tours of the world have to listen to the community and and then curate their product around what the community needs right Andrew Tauber figured out what the dissenter when he found out oh the Internet is blocking comments mm-hmm so he created you know you can comment on anywhere on the Internet and then Google Chrome smashed it right I say get that out of here yeah why did they do that what was the justification for getting rid of that they want a censor they want to censor information is that what they want to do or they want to the competitor from using their platform and profiting off of it that's how I looked at it I looked at it from about marketing or a business perspective not any whereabouts name because it could be but if it becomes huge I mean anything can become huge if it's useful yeah it seemed useful to me that they were going to be able to comment on anything you'll have like a little link and if you use gab you can comment on anything that comes up yeah yeah you can look at it like that I don't I feel like you know their budgets is so huge you know their cash reserves are so huge that they're not worried about competition at all you know what they're worried about is a controlling thought hmm and and that's their primary goal control thought right for the betterment of the ruling class and that's to me that's that's the end all be all of it all but you these these you know these these people that create tech products like when we create coin bits app or for example my app Jeff itas Jeff it sighs do you only do one thing on Zipit eyes the only thing you can do is save a video or or Jif from Twitter I always called a gif is it Jeff shit I think it's Jeff I've never I don't think I ever hear anybody say it gif could be correct do you call Jamie called a gif yes okay Jeff gif gif is peanut butter but our app does one thing right and people love it when I first came on as a co-founder this AB did more than that and when it did more than that it didn't do as well as it does now what it used to do we had incentives to share the app you could edit gifts you could put text on them crop them all types of like it had an editor in there so I was like you know take this editor toss it out all we had a keyboard you know it still has a keyboard by was they took some of the functionalities and I've started taking stuff out just like it decided I could just have a kit deficit and slim it down as soon as we slimmed it down we chain gave it a new face boom our revenue quadrupled once again tell people yeah gif at eyes give it is Jamie's got it yeah GI fitr Z the ultimate Twitter gift downloader yeah yeah and this is this things about to be super huge we have a gallery coming soon and that's gonna be awesome I'm gonna be perfectly curated I'll speak to my partner Simone this morning about that that's one of the fun things about Twitter when someone says something stupid and then you look at all the gifts underneath it all the names and gifts yeah so we empower people like yeah black Twitter's on our app so whenever there's a new video Wow you know something funny happens and you're using as a reaction so we I us there's no way to save it now you can with our app but I have only does one thing and everybody's they love it right that's that's the core of the business what's the core of mine's what's the core of gap what's the core feature is anybody know there is not a core feature yeah wouldn't I would say just something as an alternative to traditional media you see what I'm saying yeah so there is no uniqueness where there is no uniqueness you can't compete you have to first create uniqueness mmm or or fill a need there's no need for me to be on these other platforms the problems and you get on those other platforms and there's no one there yeah let me go back to Twitter real quick yeah and that's why I say when you build a social network the before you build a network you have I mean before you build the platform you have to build a network mmm well it's interesting if you go back to like 2003 when myspace was king mm-hmm and then you imagine what the world would be like 16 years later no one would have saw this coming no one would have saw all these social media platforms and that it's used as a way of breaking news now I mean especially in places that don't have real objective news so if you're in some country that's some war-torn country and some horrible shit is going down you see the news breaking on Twitter before anywhere oh yeah really interesting oh yeah that's why I tell people like screw Facebook and Instagram the news breaks on on Twitter you know about it Tom you know by the time I show all my friend of my friend shows me a video I'm like I saw it on Twitter like two weeks ago bro because he's on Facebook or he's on Instagram right so it's like how do you market a product or market yourself when you're two weeks behind mmm behind an Instagram though I get a lot of shit on Instagram too like what your Joe Rogan yeah it depends on who you're surrounded by right right so we talk about our network is like you know who are the people connected to you following who you interacting with right but I get like wow that's not true it's gonna say I get like most of the fucked up videos of news stories of bad things of happening in the news come to me on Instagram but I think send it to you yeah but I think it's even I think it's even with Instagram and Twitter mm-hmm sending me things well you did when you're Joe Rogan even if your hotel Jesus like a people who say to me how do you know so much I'm like yo my father were still yeah books and links and stuff like that like they're just sending it to me I'm you know sometimes I ask them sums I don't but they're volunteering information so when you're in that position you know you can afford it but when so the key to marketing is this you know you got your four PS of marketing but the key to marketing is relevance if what you're talking about is irrelevant nobody's paying attention to you right yeah so the only thing that makes somebody's platform's relevant is the juxtaposition to the big tech giants you remove the tech giants are you still relevant what makes you relevant Brian right that's where a lot of people that do content whether they're you know podcasters or whatever they probably should be thinking about developing an email list and putting things on the website having something available independently of these big platforms mm-hmm I've been thinking about that a lot lately doing what but something that independent of these big platforms where like if you mean you see all these people that have gotten deep platforms yeah and I don't think I'm at the risk of that but if the core I didn't think these people were just a few years ago as the climate shifts and people get more and more radical with this idea of deep platforming I think it becomes like a game of like shooting ducks people get excited about it they like taking people out whether it makes sense or not and I think there's a lot of that going on where people are calling for people to be TD platform just because they disagree with them and so far these big tech companies have resisted some of it but not not enough of it for my taste yeah yeah you know my boy Alex Jones they got him out of here I think you know if I was Alex my ego would be so huge after getting deep platformed well when we did a podcast together after he was deep platforming it was one of the biggest podcast of all time yeah what are you like 16 million YouTube videos that's your high he's won meanwhile YouTube did not deem monetize that one we let them know in advance just heads up Alex Jones is coming on yeah and then they just took that money it's interesting how it works right like what they choose to deep platform what they don't choose to you know it's um I mean I don't like the argument that they're they're doing it for our good I don't I don't think they are who made them god yeah who made them you know mom and said this is good for you do you think they should be forced to follow the First Amendment no what do you think they should be forced to do nothing nothing nothing I think I think they should be operating in a manner that doesn't hurt earth you know it doesn't hurt so nature right if they're polluting or doing something that harms somebody specifically then yes right so if they become a giant monopolies just because they're better than everything else that's available like u2 has become then they run the show but there's always the underground yeah look at hip-hop right there's always been a hunger underground hip hop comedy as well comedy as well you know so you got dudes you know so I was talking to somebody today would talk about consciousness conscious hip-hop and do say all there's no money in conscious hip-hop I'm like what like feral March tours consistently dead prez dead prez yeah tours a sister never had any mainstream at all the only the closest thing they had to mainstream's when they were Dave Chappelle's block party okay that was about it yeah yeah so it's like you don't need mainstream we don't need me stream you know me here's the thing with mainstream when you get mainstream you dat bitch now you gotta play by the rules you know and and once you break those rules you get D platforms what you need to do is you need to focus on building your own platform so they can't touch you when I get to a certain place say if you were helping me out I called you in hotep Jesus yeah I need some help right what do I do with this platform this platform right here oh dang if they come down on us uh I so you got a self-hosted probably on blockchain um I would definitely bitch you just locked oh how do I self hosted on blockchain I don't know blockchain is one of those words that I use that I don't really understand me I just say cuz it's a cool buzzword it sounds like if you eat some dude as a tech guy like yourself as a tech startup and you start talking about blockchain I go oh yeah I just nod my head BOC trained my friend uploaded mp3 to the bsv network maybe okay it's just very confusing you know I was trying to ask him or like a knowledge that's on there yeah Wow how are people gonna get it and like he wanted to just be like the first on there which he is whatever I did might not be bsv I might be speaking right you wrap her friend yes okay hey he's just like yeah but that's where it's at I was like talking to him for that like he's almost my guinea pig like alright you did it how you figured it out now how do I get a three hour podcast on there right how are people gonna get it it's like it's not figured out yet people are definitely working on it and then every day there's been advances yeah I just don't know I don't know how it's gonna go I mean you could build your own clout yes you know build your own cloud and self host and you know you you know else you could do you could connect with all your other celebrity buddies pull your resources together and just build a competitor and then on this space be like I'm the new YouTube it's called Rogan tube now hmm you know what I mean you could do that and then everybody just runs to your platform I'd support it I'd have to have been way better name do that without using Google's cloud services we need to do is buy Vimeo demeo's dying on the vine that bitch is barely alive what's so so Mike so these questions that you ask right like there's a late day on the internet kind of right almost so these these questions that you ask I don't know I don't code right so what we do is we we get the best tech minds in the building and we ask them the questions hey answer this it's not like they can't answer them they're gonna find solutions there's always away you know just got to put the right mods in the room mm-hmm you know the right minds in the room and the right people that are influencers they can get the word out yeah you have to you gotta follow the drop on a napkin rule and you know when you put the the drop on the napkin it spreads out right so you got a figure you know who's your network and then you know maybe build like 12 people around and make sure that these people are linked you know based upon interest right so then it starts at those interest points or affinities and then the next tier grows out from there but as long as that tight-knit group all right so the problem gap right it's all people say oh it's all Nazis right well that's that tight-knit group tight-knit group of Nazis so shirt says that it's not just that it's not just that you know 100 regular folks in one Nazi that Nazi becomes the defining factor of the group well there's nazis in there right so you know it's not that at all but there is a strong white nationalist movement that first gravitated over there if he didn't have that there would be no gap do you think so I mean I don't think so at all really yeah like what would go there people that got kicked off of Twitter but the only people that got kicked off sweat in the early days with a white nationalist well who's the first people like one if you go back to McKenna's yeah Gavin McGuinness is an interesting character he does not identify as a white nationalist no he does not and his wife is actually Native American he's he's just made some stupid choices right well I mean like Baked Alaska was kind of thrown into that yeah but he just saw me maker God makes funny memes very funny right entertaining but I think it comes down to who's dangerous or not yeah well the proud boys became a dangerous idea because once you have a group and you don't control who joins the group then assholes can join your group and then your group has made out of assholes like well I didn't want it to be assholes but well you let anybody in if you let anybody in a group yeah I just have a joke about vegans about that the problem with any group is the same like if you get any group of a hundred people if you in a room with a hundred people yeah what's the odds that one of them's gonna be a fucking idiot what's a hundred percent one of them's gonna be a fucking idiot well if you have 300 million people you're gonna have by odds three million fucking idiots right and the joke was a lot of them are vegans yeah yeah it doesn't it's not there's anything wrong with vegans it's wrong with a group and people just identify they get in that group and this is my group and I'm here to represent and then it's just dummies did the thing with the brow boys is the ruling elite are afraid of men you know it's a huge toy boy movement coming down it's gonna buck on a pike right I mean so everywhere if anybody's listening right now or everybody that's listening right now soy is bad for you it's not good it is very bad it's processed nonsense using estrogen yes well it acts based of phytoestrogens known as 8:05 phytoestrogens that attacked the integrins endocrine glands system now we look at the endocrine gland system of people in the spiritual world endocrine gland system is the physical manifestation of the so called chakras right now at the heart chakra what we have is called the thymus gland and the thymus gland is the one that controls your sexual maturity and when you have an endocrine gland disrupter your sexual maturity is affected so a man who would ordinarily like women now likes you see what I'm saying but wouldn't you have to have massive quantities of soy for that that's that subjective based upon your biological structure I always think of it as more it's like a fun thing to say I don't think you know here's a tofu you turn into a bitch well here's think you can't go in a grocery store and find something that doesn't have silly when you go look at your cheez-its or your crackers it was sa soy less it then soy and everything so your way right they use it as filler for some meats so the whole vegan movement right you go and you go get you your burger burger yeah right a lot of these burgers a soy-based lot of more plant-based for sure plant-based oils right but so is not good for you right and then you also look at the links between soy and cancer but that's a whole nother story but when you have something that's disrupting your so called chakras you can see how you can start affecting an entire population of people right you start affecting their development at an early age and then you know you got these men who are acting like women who can't even you know control their wives you got some men out here that uh let another man sleep with their girlfriend right oh dear I don't know about here well you're saying out here well when I see how here I mean that's everywhere yeah yeah but not just people just kinky in a weird shit well no you know think so no what do you think it is I think it's pushed I think debauchery is highly pushed yeah by who the ruling elite ruling class I want to say really because I'm not a lead to sit around and go you know we need to do we need to push the bout right well when you look at the degradation of Russia right for the Bolshevik Revolution what they do is they come in first with alcohol right said he purchase your hops and your barley and he produced alcohol then what they do is they sell the alcohol to the farmer on credit cuz he ain't got no money right because he'd been drunk he hasn't been producing the crops like he should he falls into credit he falls into debt when he falls into debt he's now a slave to the land he once owned now and I can sell whatever I want to this population or give this population whatever I want because they are now technically my slave but in order to rule a nation of people you have to destroy morality you have to just oi integrity so you feed them drugs alcohol and sex and in tear apart the family but do you think that that's just a natural progression of people's slovenly instincts or do you think that some sort of a granny we have a slovenly instinct some people do yeah I think some people are lazy and some people weak and some people greedy and some people just they lean towards they lean towards just pleasure without sacrifice and discipline because it's easy they just lay in bed a jerk-off I don't think anybody's telling them I don't think there's any sinister government manipulating their strings that makes them watch porn all day I think they're just yeah it actually you know Instagram is a gateway to porn Instagram you can't go any screen without looking at some booty right yeah but it's also a gateway to sunsets and people's kids and muscle cars come on Joe cool shit anybody going on Instagram it has sunsets people are going to Instagram to look at booty there's a lot of that no yoga community has went from hey check out my back asana to check out my backside yeah that's right a lot of yoga pants' pecs booty booty booty just booty alone is an industry it is a giant industry it's the grand yeah so what happens is you you wake up in the morning you check your notifications then your homie tags you look at this chick bone right now you have an erection what's the first thing you do you like ah let me go to my browser open incognito browsing hit point home boom now you out of here right now your days done you just depleted your energy right and this coming out in my book where I talk about you know why you shouldn't go off and all that stuff but you write that you shouldn't jerk off yeah you never well there's a calculation algorithm yeah there's a jerk off algorithm it's a creative audit out the Taoists sexology and i think it's your age times to know your age divided by two times when I do I forget what it is it's in my book I can't remember it but I got it from the towel right which is why I don't memorize time point eight times point two things age times point two and then they tell you how many days right so at my age I'm 38 now my age it's about seven and a half days between ejaculation to mean to maintain Who I am really yeah and to him yes so a man's strength is his balls frankness right every time you deplete yourself you're not the same man anymore you lose your superpowers now when you lose your superpowers to some you know IG model it's not even worthy your orgasm doesn't feel the same as a natural interaction with a woman right you know I mean true so yeah you're wasting your superpower on like a fictional fantasy so you're wasting a percentage of your vital energy your vital energy as well as the proteins and minerals and zinc and magnesium and all that stuff that you know is lost yeah you know I think it's equivalent to like two New York strip steaks eggs oranges and apples or something like that really oh yeah it's a lot of vitamins there so I have a wound on the size of loads you shoot though no oh you should swallow whoa Jesus ladies I'm sorry that's why you should ingest it if the man is healthy because it's a full meal it's a full meal it's a full meal of nutrients that a man loses there's a vial available that way one of em is done studies I'm sure they have I bet people done like nutrition slash load studies probably a startup out there like trying to do this right now yeah it calculated into an app mm-hmm where is this conversation going now we're talking about manipulating you turning you into a soy boy oh yeah you you think there's actually this is where we differ you think there's actual manipulation taking place I think it's just natural instincts and then I think that people see it around them and then they cater to those natural instincts and then they support those natural instincts I think people have a natural instinct to be undisciplined and lazy and just gratuitous and you know yeah dive into pleasure before sacrifice and commitment and so are we making excuses for it not making excuses I think it's a also the softness of the world we live in oh yeah maybe we live in this incredibly easy to get by in the world right you know where the poor people are fat yeah there's never been a time in history where poor people are fat yeah yeah dad that comes down to we're in the actual food yeah so coffee it's certainly that is certainly the food is garbage but it's also that this is a strange lack of discipline because it's not yeah it's not necessary all you do is just show up to your job put in the the least amount of effort you can without getting fired and you can exist right that didn't a that didn't happen in the wild world when people hunters and gatherers if you didn't put 100% effort if you didn't really struggle you didn't make it you're wearing a benefit to the tribe and they kicked your ass out and you got eaten yeah yeah yeah yeah that's how it's supposed to be I do agree with that yeah I do agree with that discipline is is you know what we have to demand from people you know but you know your your culture has to recognize the battery in and and shun it and ban it and say like hey you know we don't want this here mm-hmm you know porn is readily available on Twitter and watch your writing your feet sometimes girl on my feet I know like that's a weird thing about Twitter isn't it that it's a giant platform but they allow porn yeah so you know when I had jack on and with Tim Poole and I think Tim Poole didn't even know the poem was legal on it yeah right yeah I found it a little bit of information I don't know accurate samples Twitter use no on the ejaculation frequency recommended by the towels yeah it said the most respected of the town theorists son Samia quoted above recommends ejaculation no more than once every 20 days for men over 50 oh Jesus and no more than once every hundred days for men over 60 without I should be dead okay and it has to do it there's no energy how am I getting everything done you're getting age retarding hormones as you're about to ejaculate and then there's a level you want to keep before you ejaculate so so allowance what you're before you excrete the hormones that's what it's saying so Tantra you're supposed to come and turn there's a yeah there's a level you can like optimize yourself in Jack ulation and Kolya must be one of their fucking minds I'm trying to get rid of this shit I've always said that it helps you think because too many times with a man of your your mind is clouded by sexual desire if you could just jerk off and then you can think clearly I always tell myself a bit about it I say jerk off first then think about it like if you jerk off and then you want to call girls because you love her you're not just trying to fuck you actually I like her as a human being you want to be around her you don't just be want to want to be around it for sex you actually really love her yeah I think there's a level of discipline right so yeah if you got about to make that that risky text message yeah you might want to shoot shallow and that's what I'm talking about but you like what I'm gonna watch some fucking documentary ahead phone down but that's for undisciplined man yes right so a discipline man is gonna say no I'm not gonna send this thirst trap you know this this thirsty comment I'm gonna stay disciplined in who I am because in order to get the woman I have to stay away from the woman yeah you know in order to get the woman I have to stay away from the line yeah and and and and and keeping your your at your vital man energy for me keeps me like on edge like I'm always like an animal you know right right um because I want to release right I'm saying so what I do is I'll work up that energy and then channel it into work mmm I'll just immediately pull my laptop out just bang out because it's like that frustration there and then just you got to release it that way I'll go run and I'll go work out mmm but when I get around women what a full sec I'm not the same as when I'm empty yes and they see you can see the difference in how they attracted you you sit up different your chest pokes out hmm when you're around other men you're like a little bit more edgy yeah yeah you know I mean after you blow your load you're kind of like chilled out yeah a non competitive non-competitive yeah you hold on to that like fighters you know how to fight go fight Mike Tyson never did that Mike Tyson said no oh always like the kammath much as possible fun I'm not distracted just shoot his loads and I beat the fuck out of everybody but I think Mike had a lot of extra loads I think if you had a guess his level he was just that ultra man you know there was it was not a regular man a research published by the US National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health found that after seven days of not ejaculating men's testosterone levels reached 145 point 7 percent of the baseline the interesting thing is that they didn't observe significant fluctuations from the baseline on Days two through five the research also showed that the peak levels were at day seven yeah risks Dow it's actually Dow by the way it's ta oh it sucks you say it is brow okay the Dow of gee kundo okay risks of to frequent ejaculation when sex is performed with the recommended Dow frequency it becomes an inexhaustible source of energy like a well that never runs dry yeah however when a jack layton frequency exceeds the capacity of the body to fully replenish the semen man can experience chronic fatigue low resistance loss of sex drive loss of focus and irritability long-term excessive exact ulation can cause chronic low zinc conditions which can cause chronic fatigue mental confusion and significant loss of sexual drive but what if you're with a freak like that girl will Harris was talking about my friend will Harris was in here the other day and who say he used to meet these girls and go over see Oh it's also considered harmful to ejaculate when ill drunk or gorged with food whoa here's the night the next line Oh which one jack in control and discipline is not to be confused the frequency of sex there are significant physiologic phys what's a word physiological I'm think there supposed to be a period there Oh physiologic and therapeutic benefits to having sex frequent sex intercourse maintains a man's interest in the acts as well as his capacity to continue indefinitely until his partner is fully satisfied so they're saying fuck but don't come yes don't be brother fucker mine I come every time I fuck yo III I used to all try to get rid of stuff I used to fuck fucker girls heads like that we would not come yeah really they start crying Wow I had a girl like straight down break yo cry I can't please you is it me is it no I'm just like no I just wanted you to be happy how you feel feel good good then I go and I hit the laptop and it just tears me up said oh really because Eicher wants them to get you to come yes women only respect a discipline man you know what's true once a woman can drop your defenses she's no longer attracted to you if she can control you she's not attracted to you a woman once a man she could chase in my book I'll talk about how women are the apex predator they're the ones that chase after sex I mean they can have sex endlessly right once we nut is like we're pretty much done like I mean give me a couple minutes to recharge but it could keep going yes so they're you know technically like you know freaks or whatever but just because she's undisciplined in her sexual energy doesn't mean you have to be and if she feels like she has to go outside of the relationship to go get her fix that's the one hood it has nothing to do with you your aspirations as a man are higher than sex a woman's role is to create life and support the man the man's role is to create the fortune the future of humanity you know building things and innovation it is true that a woman is not attracted to God without discipline like men who are lazy and weak that a giant turn-off - yeah a woman but if a woman is hot she could be pretty lazy absolutely they are the laziest people we don't care men okay I don't care if a girl's lazy she's hot well long as her body holds up why she can get to the gym I used to make girls work to get me man really yeah like you know I would say you know I'm working on his project you know I'm saying a spreadsheet over I need you to go organize it and if she'd say no I'd just be like all right well you're worthless to my life I need I need some lions gonna bill with me right well if she's building on her own shit fuck her shit go Pilcher shit you know if you need help I'll help you right but you know you want a partner you don't want just a lover that's what we're saying no no you want someone to help you no I want her to prove her worth whoa she got to be worried you to get me like you know it's easy to get a girl he's gonna get him good man you know you only gonna fire one hotep Jesus in your life I could find a ton of you shorty Wow you everywhere Instagram after Joe Rogan is there gonna be they gonna be everywhere okay but now some would say that that's a sexist generalization sure I don't care what I don't care look you can have that conversation like bring me your platform we could talk you know if you want to call it sexes it is what it is have you ever had a conversation with like a radical feminist about this kind of thinking no they won't talk to me they all blocked me they block you know the whole black laughs and feminists the reason why he blocked me is cuz they can't beat me right when we have conversations I'm so objective that it's too dangerous for them to engage with me though cuz I'll be like it's sexist yes and so let's let's continue the conversation and then that's where they don't want to go then they're gonna have to provide reinforcement in evidence and a deal with an educated man and I'm gonna come with my evidence and facts so you don't have a problem being sexist that's what the problem is because if someone calls you sexist and you go yeah yeah I'm sexist - this is like a somebody called me racist or whatever I don't care what your opinion is I don't care about these isms that you create I understand nature I understand myself that's an interesting thing that I see today this I find really strange is that people that are eyeing evolutionary biology I mean there's yeah decades of research being done why people behave the way they behave what women are attracted to what men are attracted to and what the spectrum ISM hmm and then they say scientists racist yeah that's what's weird science is sexist it'll fuck your science it's fucking fascinating to me when people don't want to look at it because it doesn't support their ideology they want to deny all this research deny all these really objective geniuses that have been studying all this stuff and the best minds in the field have come to these conclusions based on just insurmountable amounts of data mm-hmm not interested yeah so fine I'll patriarchy yeah I have a shirt that says I am the patriarchy like no matter what you throw at me I'm just gonna embrace it and I say yeah Israel there is a patriarchy there's also a matriarchy mm-hmm you need to handle your matriarchy and stop worrying about the patriarchy because if you handled you a matriarchy the patriarchy wouldn't be your problem your problem is you don't have to be a woman what do you think is a good piece of advice for women on how to be a woman a good piece of advice I watch it like woman Hotel hotel teaches women Hotel teaches women hmm what's a good emotional control emotional and so it said the number-one problem I see with women is uh a lot here right all right let's go here okay women let they friends they tell a frenzied business yes stop that stop telling your friends your business tops to you when I have problems with you know my girl or no in the past when I have problems with women and run.bat you'll guess woman you mean we don't do that if my friends do that they better be laughing right if my friend goes to decide to believe with this said to me I think they give you a hard time but but if they go to the New Moon she wants me to quit my job like hey don't do that to me man yeah put that shit on me yeah you know um so so so I think women also you have to understand that they're they're giving this information to a friend who is also single why a woman gets in a relationship she loses a friend right because now you have less time to spend with your bestie so the besties jealous of the relationships and whenever you go back and tell her she's never gonna give you sound advice true she's always gonna take your side yep so you have to judge your friends and say well if I'm giving this information to my friend is she an objective friend or she a subjective friend she's gonna feed my ego then you can't analyze that on your own then you'll never have peace in your relationship because the worst thing to do is here's the problem the relationships built on trust so if a man and a woman come together and you tell all my business to your friend where's the trust where's our privacy hmm we have done right we have none we don't have a relationship you have a relationship with your friend so go be with your friend I don't got time to be you know I something happens in my personal life I'm gonna go tell this strange girl what happened in my personal life something I told you that was private to relate it to something else that could be happening in our relationship I mean yeah I think we have different instincts women have the instinct to gossip they love it it comes from that hunter-gatherer culture mm-hmm we're back in the day that's what happened the men would go out and try to hunt the food and the women would stay home and they would talk shit yeah absolutely yeah again discipline yourself women yeah another thing get a hobby a healthy one hmm women don't have hobbies their hobbies are like consumerism don't all of them halt not not all oh I know women with hobbies all of them but you know in my book I say you know say all because it gets to people go right um get some upset yeah it gets people gone cuz they always go well no it's um it's like I know it's some you moron you know what I'm saying but I say all just to get people going but majority women don't have hobbies you know do Saudi think that is because they're inundated with advertising you know their hobbies become consumerism you know you know retail therapy or you know I do makeup for fun no you don't do makeup for fun that's not what you do that's not a hobby makeups not a hobby I'm sorry ladies a hobby is something that develops your your individual person something that makes you better it's some kind of a discipline an art form right some way to express yes yeah some physical thing that you do like so we're like one of my hobbies is chess right that helps me focus when I when I see that my attention span is getting short because I spent too much time on social media I go to chess and I'll spend time on chess to bring that back to reality you play physical chess when you play online ah ah ah yeah I can do Oh TV but you know I do what's ot be over the board oh that's that means physical pause that's how that's what you call it yes call TV yes you do speed chess we hit the timer do you do regular chess or online I do speeches I do 5-minute games that's impressive yeah yeah it's it's it's a whole nother I'm in scared of chess I've always been scared of chess I have an obsession with games yeah real problems and chess is it's one of them I've played it a little bit yeah but I'm like fuck this could take over my life it would yeah yeah yeah you know if I'm not careful I'll be sleeping and and playing chess uh yeah like sometimes I'll be chilling like we'll be having a conversation and I'll space out and be doing chess problems in my head so that happens sometimes oh you know a lot especially on days that I play a lot of chess I remember Howard Stern was really getting in chess and he was taking private lessons he was talking about all the time but I think he found the same thing do you remember that I think he found the same thing I think he just got too obsessed with it's like I can't fucking do this anymore yeah yeah well one of my life goals is to be a chess master one day really yeah yeah you know and when you say chess master what do you have to do to be a master okay so you have national master the International master and then you have game master or the GM I forget what it's called national master you have to participate and I believe one of the tournaments one of the I forget the Federation but you have to enter in one of these tournaments and you have to place a certain you know I think it's maybe top two or top three at a certain tournament don't quote me on this stuff but you have to go through the tournament's and I think in order to become international you have to first become national master and the national master you can go be international if I'm not mistaken and then you know GM do you ever see the video of Eddie Fisher or Bob Fisher when Bobby Fisher was walking this row of chess games he was playing yeah like ten different games simultaneously yeah the the the champ now Carlsen does something similar where Carlsen will play you know several people or he'll play without a board that always interested me I've seen people do that yeah I knew who went to prison was playing with it's his pool hall that he's play out in White Plains executive billiards and this kid was a chess master as like a 16 year old I don't know master I'm he's remote chess genius right 16 year old kid and he was playing with this dude who was like in his 40s who had been in prison he learned how to play chess with no board in prison so there was just sitting across from each other talking he's saying the moves and then they were both like recognize where the pieces were on the board yeah really interesting yeah I mean that that level of visualization is where humanity has to take itself you know that's why I say chess is great because it allows you to visualize and in order manifest your desires in this world you have to be able to visualize what you want mmm the more you can focus the more you can visualize the better your mind is I believe because our life is based upon visualization museums and yeah a woman need to get back to that tool visualizing goal I think women are are very spiritual so in Africa there's this I'm slippin on my studies I study it's a long time ago but the man is holding a child and the woman is pointing up to the sky right and it's like the man is like that earthly thing like we handle things in a physical and the woman's sort of like that into intuitive being women have to get back to being that intuitive being because if you notice our women always seem to warn us about stuff right oh damn I should have listened to that time yeah you don't I'm saying they have to get back to their spiritual nature and I think a lot of them get away from that and now to ground them to when they won't need so much emotional support from friends and family because they are back in their spiritual nature well how does a woman do that you just our meditation you know meditate and being happy which is being alone with yourself a lot of people can't be alone with themselves yeah you know they always need like some sort of device this is an interesting that it's attractive when people are capable of being alone yeah I remember these two girls were talking about some guy that one of them was dating and she goes yeah he's really into his career which is a huge turn-on I was like oh that's interesting yeah he just needs time he's disciplined he works all the time he's always working on his career which is a huge turn-on you told those people Cluckers well women have to get back to that to like yeah I'll learn how to pick a good man sometimes y'all at picking crap men based upon the money or things that they have you getting relate to you find a hundred thousand dollars in debt he's got these things I think women have to get better at seeing potential in men but don't they have to be tricked a few times before they can see the the problems yeah yeah that's yeah that's a fucking dirty thing for a girl let some loser fuck you and go god damn it yeah yeah I had him thought I had a winner yeah I mean I I've been a victim of debt well not in the victim but you know I've done that too many of myself sorry ladies no day yeah yeah I've done some wrong stuff well you become a different person as time goes on yes you grow from it part of evolution of the human yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I I think society's expectations and women are it's very difficult for a man to understand it you know we see it from the outside but to feel it there's a woman it's got to be very different I mean and there's a lot of women out there that are looking for a man like a successful man they're looking for a successful man and they want to attach themselves and that's like that's the goal yeah there's no that's not a goal of men so it's very difficult for us to understand that our goal for pretty now obviously we're generalizing right but our goal is to be successful ourselves right well you can't you can't know what man you want unless you know who you are hmm and a lot of people are getting in relationships without being in relationship with themselves first so when you know in order to have a sound relationship you have to know your socio-economic stance it's sad when you get into a relationship with a conservative and get liberal and I start arguing about Donald Trump mmm and a relationship breaks because he's on one side these are the conversations that you need to have up front and if you don't know where you are politically in socio-economic Lee for example they say a lot of relationships break up because of money right mm-hmm you got one person's a bad spender the other ones thrifty right these are the conversation you know at first how do you manage your money no are you good with your money you know and if you guys don't agree with how you want to pull your resource and how you want to pull your money and what you want to do with it in the future you know some people and you might get in relationship with a girl and she's like I want to push you know I want to land rover and I'm like I want a business I want a VC you know what I mean yeah so you have two people that are going separate directions one's going it's consumer and one's going in and pending you know producer out so you have to first see are you a consumer maybe you need to be acquainted with a consumer are you a producer you don't need to be with a consume what you need to find some - producer so if you if you agree on social economics you'll have a better relationship with people but you have to know what you want out of life first and then find people connect based upon that not the physical looks and all that other stuff yeah and I think sometimes people think they want something because it's very difficult to attain they see these things they go oh that's the that's the prize yeah we know the thing is he stuff aren't hard to obtain like you know getting a Porsche isn't hard right it's hard for a lot of people depends on how much make what you do what kind of job you're trapped in heart is relative right you know like like I tell my kids heart is basically undiscovered that's all it is right so for example when you first do algebra it's hard right but that's just because it's new so hard equals new that's what hard means it's new because once you do algebra three four five ten times it's not new anymore and therefore it's not hard so once you break past the the newness of a thing it's no longer hard like building a business it's not new to me therefore it's not hard it's very easy for me to build a business yeah because I've done it so many times in my life you see I'm saying Japheth eyes is cash flowing Forex what it was doing when I first joined the company I know I did was make a few tweaks that's only because I'm not new to the tech started space I've been working with over 20 startups over 20 startups in a matter of two three years as a consultant so this stuff when people say oh it's hard it's like no that's how hard it's new and you're an idiot and you don't know what you're doing it's not hard to achieve anything his life my you know I just work for 50 cent right and uh yeah when I lived in New Brunswick right by Rutgers I wasn't really a 50 cent fan I enjoyed his music I wasn't a fan to buy a poster I bought this poster was him and g-unit and had this big stash of money I was like yo this just this poster motivates me you fast forward 10 years and some other things I did to get close to 50 and I actually work with 50 that was technically hard right it's not easy to get next to 50 but when I did it it happened like that then I started working with Carmelo Anthony so you're saying once it actually happened it turned out it wasn't actually hard no hardly there's some people know they're just not disciplined hmm hard hard is dealing with yourself that's what's hard can you defeat your own mind so it when I wake up every morning the only thing I got to defeat is doubt it's the only thing I have to defeat once I defeat doubt I live in a limitless world infinite possibilities I can literally do anything so so people told me Oh in order to be in tech you know you need a million dollars and and that's that and the dirt dude I got equity in three tech companies three tech companies and I'm not rich I didn't you know put up millions to get into these companies I'm part of these companies because I built me and it wasn't hard well he wasn't hard to get to these companies I just had something to offer and they saw value in me I want to be the next Elon Musk I want to be the next Bill Gates I want to be the guy that Zuckerberg hates you see I'm saying I want to be the guy that that builds the new Silicon Valley on the East Coast you know that like that's those are my aspirations so when people tell me what you can and can't not do when it's hard I'm like dude I'm selling Bitcoin how many black dudes do you know sell Bitcoin none I'll call anybody who sells Bitcoin exactly and people are telling me this is hard it's not hard you you you get what you want and and I didn't get in the Bitcoin out of dumb luck I manifested that I said I wanted to sell Bitcoin how can I manifest it then I let it go and the universe brought me the opportunity and then it happened when I said when I first said I want to be a VC first thing I want to do is start building a portfolio I didn't look for companies they found me it just I just had to ask the universe and it presented opportunities and I just had to so what do you mean buddy had to ask the universe I had to put the intention out there so do you think that literally by thinking about things you can make them happen you can make the opportunity present itself and then you have to be ready to take advantage so let's we got to walk through the story - 50 cent thing right so I get invited to his bus launch right for the company now I'm sitting on the bus they move me to the back because of security reasons so I'm in the back of the bus when the bus start moving in my head fear kicks in and doubt kicks in and I'm telling myself I should just hop with the bus stop and I said I should just hop up and just start screaming I'm on a bus or 50 cent and I'm like no I don't do a damn fight at you I hear you got to sit here and that's not right and you know all these things society says is right so I stand up and I go yo want to boss a fitty cent right and in the whole crowd rushes the bus after the crowd finishes they take one of the energy drink shirts they throw it on me throw the head on me they bring me to the front of the bus now I'm sitting next to 50 cent fast forward two years later I'm in a 50 cent company but it's because I started off with defeat in doubt but also listening to my intuition my intuition said to hop up and do that right the opportunity was presented to me I didn't I didn't create opportunity they DM me and said yo we want you to come I didn't ask they invited me but it's because I kept putting that 50 cent energy out there hmm these names I kept putting that out there like y'all wanna mess with 50 cent I want missing for ten years I've been putting information that that energy out there 50 of you listening yo holla at me I want to work with you again on but I really just really love 15 his attitude he's just really a fun dude you know he had a funny thing about Father's Day this is round about Father's Day there's your Father's Day and Mother's Day but you know the universe anything you ask for it will present the opportunity the only thing is are you woke enough to see it can you identify it when it hits and and and can you defeat the fear to 10 do you have all the other bases in your life covered we have the bandwidth to tackle some correct difficult correct correct but usually the universe only present you opportunities you can handle they don't usually it doesn't because if you couldn't handle it you wouldn't be able to recognize it do you say this like the universe presents us to you this like a spiritual concept I mean is this like are you manifesting reality with your thoughts and intentions do you really believe that all of that why do you believe that because I lived it I was very still but you lived it and you're successful at it see that's why my perspective on that is always you hear about things like the secret in the law of attraction you hear that from people that are successful there I willed it into existence yeah but what about the people that tried to will it into existence and nothing ever worked out right well or at labora right or at labora latin for work and praying a lot of people going to the secret just praying but they ain't working right that's support you know so I did see what you say I don't look it in the same way but I look at it in a similar way I think there is something to intention there's something and there's something also to having that kind of faith to believe in intention whereas I think a lot of people they're reluctant to give in to that because it seems to woowoo and games like some crystals and fucking astrology and horseshit you know I mean because there's a lot of that out there a lot of it's a the New Age has ruined the law of attraction mmm you know I mean oh just speaking into assistant habit no that's not true you have to first educate yourself so we talked about hotep right I mean talk about hotep you got to bring up the five percent nation you got to bring up supreme mathematics zero site for one knowledge to wisdom three understanding but it first starts it to number one right number one is knowledge so the problem is people are trying to manifest but he ain't got no knowledge of anything right so how do you manifest something with no knowledge you got to educate yourself you've got to first start educating yourself discipline yourself so that you can educate yourself as well right and also knowledge is the springboard for imagination right so if there's a complicated calculus problem but you don't know what calculus is how can intuition feed you insight or inspiration to solve a calculus problem you first have to have the knowledge of calculus then when you get it you get all this influx of inspiration like Einstein talks about you know you sits down and kind of meditates and then the inspiration comes but the inspiration can only talk to you based upon your understanding saying yes so the problem is people out here not educating themselves you know I my day begins and ends with educating myself begins ends in during the day I'm just reading books hopping between books and reading and listening to lectures and people think I'm deep and I'm like I don't know I don't know whatever whatever one might eligible really my secret is consuming as much information as possible hmm that's my secret and then from that I'm able to say oh well you know you know studying history you know you can you do a lot of things but if you're not educating yourself or doing you got to do something like just start you know what I mean when you said you're gonna write a new book you're in the middle of writing a book are you putting this kind of stuff in your book all right so the next ID lines like that I'm sorry to interrupt yeah guidelines like that is that thing that's very critical when someone sees someone who's successful and see someone they see someone is disciplined and focused like okay what are you what are your guidelines how do you do this and how like so a year laying it out like right now so so this book here right this Twitter marketing yeah this book is the how how do you do it right like how do you physically build a brand from start using Twitter as a platform now this book can actually be used for any platform I just use Twitter as the example right but this is the how that people won't tell you about what marketers won't tell you about this is the house right that's all the seekers in there now the next book I have is with the editor it's done it's written that's for men and how to have peaceful relationships with women right because as we see it as a gender war in America so we need to create peace and what I say is the fault isn't on the women to focus on the men right so that book was the cover was designed by Rollo Tomassi the rational male author then we have the book a hotel as what you're talking about which is already written I wrote it two three years ago and it's that that structure for your life so you can manifest these things you know so you can use spirit in your work to manifest these things if you're a Christian there's secrets in the Bible that show you how to you know manifest things mmm so you have to you can't ignore your spiritual self if you ever watch Doctor Strange she pushes him out in his astral body come down so the human being is dual nature we have our physical body than we have a hash-table body if you never connect with your astral body you only use a half of your potential what's your astral body it's it's basically an ethereal version of your physical body but it's not bound by time and space so what do you mean by that thought what does that mean what do you mean what is that the real version of your spiritual body like it's not physical you can't touch it okay right you can't like interact with it right okay but it can travel through space and time right all we talked about our higher selves or we can to make things more understandable because all this stuff is based upon a subconscious mind right so you use your subconscious mind to program I mean use your conscious mind to program your - smile then subconscious mind communicated to your higher mind in a higher mind that's what the magic stuff happens it's out of your control now the higher mind or spirit or God or Jesus whatever you want to believe in that's when they start working on this stuff but it has to be a part of you and then life starts reflecting what's in your subconscious mind but the the astral body thing is kind of like something that we use to either communicate with people in long distance travel to time to see things that have happened in foreign lands at different times get inspiration so when we look at Think and Grow Rich write the book thinking we're rich was to tell you to do it tells you create a Council of I think he says dead people or something like that right they created Council of dead people your council right so if I did mine and probably like Malcolm X to PI Nipsey Hussle you know like a whole bunch of people right and you have this congregation meeting of minds you can't do that with your physical body so who's gonna be present at this meeting the astral body has to be present is me so that's an example of how we've seen that science taught in thinking corwich right so we can't stay this stuff is like but aren't you saying when you're talking about like a council of dead people you're saying like your imagination you're looking at this council of dead people like what would Tupac do like that yeah shit but how would I draw inspiration from Muhammad Ali how would I how would I take the the the knowledge of you know fill in the blank whoever's dead yeah brilliant yeah so there is that aspect right where it's your imagination right what would Jesus do right well that's that is that's the thing right so but what we have to understand is there's going to be a sliver of inspirational insight so let's say 90% of your meeting with these people are pure physical your mind imagining these things but then there's that one sliver that 110 percent that slides through that gives you that piece of inspiration that you never would have thought about it's like an idea you know sometimes you're telling it like oh oh yeah you know that idea that just pops in your head that is what happens now once you get more advanced you can get more of that influx of inspiration from you know spirit or whatever you want to call it get more advanced meaning practice this all the time yeah yeah yeah practicing you know using your astral body to project out and being in another space a happy gilmore calls it his happy space movie yeah all right so what did he do in order to manifest his dreams he went to his happy place to detach himself from his physical problems mmm and then he came back and he put he did the impossible so it's like e-trial that you know so if you were to construct this and put this down into guidelines you you're basically streamlining the process of how to be as successful and how to how to just yeah make your dream come true make make your reality how to be a person who's got their shit together yeah you know the the main thing is problem with people especially young people is they don't know what they want to do I didn't know that passion or purpose and again it just comes back to knowledge are you studying take your interest and study it when you get bored with it drop it move on to the next thing but you know over the years I've collected a lot of skills all of them being used now you know like I'm not a Photoshop guy but I know how to use Photoshop but that happened because at one point I was running a blog I had to know how to edit something or do something you know what I mean mm-hm so just because it's not a skill you want like at one point I had photography business well myspace was probably at a photography business now I don't do photography anymore but I understand it so when I'm someplace I can still use these skills whether it's for a product or something or event I can still use these skills to my advantage you know I mean so even if you don't like that skill at that time it might come in play it wrong right but the bottom line is you have to start with your knowledge and then and then allow the spirit or intuition to feed it right allowed to feed it like I'll use my logical mind my logical - is only for after inspiration all right you get that yeah so you get inspired and then you use your logical mind to figure out how to make this work right if you and that's where we have to be let the let the logical mind just carry out the menial tasks let the higher mana into wish and lead the way now do you think of these things as being like separate entities or is this all all a part of you it's all one so you think when you think of your your higher mind how do you visualize this do you do D visualizes is something that you don't necessarily have control of but you can tap into yeah I guess you can look at it like that like you know I'm not the Dalai Lama on this topic you know I mean but you know I for one exercise what I might do is I'll uh I'll put light around my head I'll visualize a sphere of light around my head and you see this in religious texts and in art the OEC jesus christ or saints they always have this glow around the head they call it a halo right but really the halo is like your aura right but also the second aspect is that when I want to use my brain in an advanced way I can start the firing of neutrons or whatever the technical term is by visualizing something even if I want to visualize you know thunderstorms in my head you know that'll get the brain working you know but usually like light if I want to do distant healing right let's say you tell me you sick rang I probably should be seeing this but um if I want to do distant healing I would envelop you in light I would sit at home rest make sure you sleep then I would picture light around Shore okay do you think that you can do that you think you can actually heal people from a distance no you're not healing anything what you're doing is you're giving the intention to God that you want this person to be healed in God of the universe is healing we can't heal a damn thing right but you really think that by thinking about something you can put that intention out and a little change the so yes really what makes you think that well they have these scientific tests I haven't studied this in a while but there's a test where they fire like these electrons or something like that and the electrons are supposed to be like on a predictable path and then when they introduce people to the experiment the intense is you don't take the wave spirit you know the problem is that's misinterpreted okay the the real change is in observing it yes but the changes in observing it because you're measuring it so by measuring it you're changing the pattern like if you talk to a real physicist about it they've added all this whoo-whoo to this right that's unnecessary because really what it is is just the tools the instrument to use them to measure it or change the results yeah yeah I could definitely see that the thing is that physics has to marry spirituality in spirituality estimate has to marry physics if you don't have that connection between the two we don't got the whole picture mmm spirituality is a weird word what does that mean it's a very taboo word it's a very abused word it's abused for sure it's not really just for them spiritual like that kind of shit yeah yes where it gets weird yeah I don't like that at all you know when I speak about spirituality I'm speaking about something that really can't be put into words its unfathomable you know our language isn't designed to talk about this stuff mm-hmm you know when we look at oh well a new speak there's certain words that don't exist for this stuff you'd have to use a instant language and even ancient language you try translating to English is like we don't have a word for it you know you're seen seen like ancient Hebrew when they try to translate things right ancient Hebrew had all the numbers were actually all the letters were other Aisling numbers as well correct correct yeah do you know when you talk about halos that the original halo was a mushroom cap what yeah a mushroom cap yeah oh you something okay I got you the original halo mm-hmm was well there's a book called the sacred mushroom in the cross it's by John Marco Allegro and he was a biblical scholar that was one of the guys that was assigned to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls which is the oldest version of the Bible yes the only one I think that they've ever found it's written Aramaic and it was found in Qumran and these clay clay tap these clay jars and it's there it's all made unwritten on animal skins to decipher it they actually had to run DNA tests on the animal skins to figure out which skins belong to which animal so they could put all the stuff together to figure out all this all these pieces were a part of this one scroll yeah well this guy John Marco Allegro studied it for 14 years and it was his conclusion after he was done that the entire Christian religion was a giant misunderstanding what it was originally about was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals mm-hmm and they started doing all of these like these different scholars who studied ancient art and ancient religious art they started finding these this mushroom iconography and all this ancient artwork mm-hmm and one of the things they notice is that the bottom of a mushroom if you take a look particularly the Amanita muscaria mushroom which is the one that they connect to to the Christian religion look at the bottom of it and see what it looks like with all those lines now look at that that was the original halo okay if you see that picture about with Jesus with the halo around his head the halo was essentially the bottom of a mushroom cap and the idea they believed was that these people were the ones that were consuming the psychedelic mushroom so they had this great wisdom and this connection to God mmm that's what they thought mana was as they thought these psychedelic mushrooms were the flesh of God I liked it yeah and so that when you have these ancient religions that were possibly based on the consumptions of these psychedelic mushrooms all that stuff has kind of been lost in the translation over years and years and years and then even the visualization of the halos changed yeah and there's there's also some really crazy ones of naked people dancing in ecstasy surrounded by this translucent mushroom image so the idea that they were in these mushroom induced euphoric states and that they were dancing around these all these religious depictions yeah very interesting because if you think about ancient religions right no no science they had no idea what shape the world was they didn't know anything but they did know if he found these mushrooms and you took them you trip your fucking balls off right he would have this incredible experience and they thought that was God you know then there was that was their connection to God mm-hmm you know so there's that's interesting yeah it's a great book and the Catholic Church actually bought it out and they they they got rid of it and then you could only buy used copies of it but then it was republished recently over the last few years someone got the rights to it mmm yeah it's intense stuff yeah I like that conversation yeah that's sexy yeah you know anything that goes away from the norm I think is real sexy son needs to end need to be taught it needs to be talked about you know at the speaking of sexy woman that accused Trump rape rape being sexy yes and Anderson Cooper's like we'll be right back cut the commercials let's yeah she's a loony bin well she seems like she might be medicated yeah you can definitely tell there's something off to ya baby maybe she's super nervous being on television - that's also I don't know it's hard to figure out how people are when you see them on television because I like to consider myself a good judge of character she's off her rocker she seems off a rocker I don't know him personally some people really do have panic attacks when their cameras on that white light during the CNN studios and then it just comes out weird and then they look the fuck was wrong with me right right yeah yeah I could see that I don't think in her case I think she's just really like do you think you just try to sell a book just on something she definitely want some attention yeah but Teflon Tommy she can't do that Teflon Don it is crazy how he's been able to shake everything off everything if you stand ten toes down he cam how you doing that until you that's why I keep saying like don't worry about these tech companies stand ten toes down stand ten toes down yeah it was I mean Stanley if you know Stanley a foot like you know I stand your ground you know don't waver just because somebody says something I get criticized a lot in my responses I said what I said you know how I'll infuriate the left and I fury ate the right and the right to feel like well last week you were pro Trump but now you're saying something that's different it's like and well you got the most shit I think for that Starbucks video the stars video was hilarious thank you walked into Starbucks and you said I hear you out you guys are racist I'm gonna get my free Starbucks and that lady was like okay Amanda shout out to Amanda she's like yeah I heard that hold on I'll get your coffee it's like I didn't know you could just give away coffee you work at Starbucks but I guess she just did I manifested death where was that that was a New Jersey what Barry calm is more hilarious yeah but you know like I manifested it and you can go look at that the tweet two weeks before said I said if you want to be on mainstream media pretend to be a liberal then I also said I said that my followers I said can y'all get me on Fox News the next week I pulled this stunt and then got on Fox News now when they had you on Fox News what was the premise what were they gonna target would they say haze wonder story this one right this one some it's one of specificity and they also probably want a little bit of potential outrage asking for coffee reparations yeah you got a black guy who's asking for reparations they kind of like that especially when it's spoofing the left so yeah they you know they kind of want to weaponize me yeah so yeah there's a lot of that I thought it was funny I thought that you're very friendly about it you know was like you were being angry anything did you have your son with you or someone - yeah my voice - whole family wasn't me that's funny yeah yeah my son didn't he I told him I go here and get free coffee Yeah right your dad's really about to pull this off you had a debate recently about reparations with CJ Pearson yes that young guy who's very he's an interesting guy very very intelligent and articulate fellow it's new like 19 years old or something 16 16 yeah it's really only 16 yeah really did they say at least I thought he was older than that he brights for Colette and he's he really only 16 yeah CJ Pearson is oh yeah fine I hold ears that seems crazy he's got drink grease age 16 wow she's got fucking smartest shit no he's not what no he's not why do you think he's not smart it's not smart smart people create things stupid but he's fucking 16 you don't think he's got an exceptional vocabulary and ability to express himself at 16 and what does that mean it means you got something going on I don't mean shit it doesn't mean shit it's an exceptional absolut sometimes what is it about is vocabulary mean you memorize some words well you have use of them at access instantaneous access that means they're in your mind all the time which means you've done a lot of reading which means you've done a lot of studying which means you have a command of the English language which was the only thing that we have if you speak English that you can use to express your intent right and Orwell talks about these political types who sound very educated he says it they sound very educated on it right and then when you break down what they actually said it's so very vague it's so very nonspecific there's actually no solutions you know all they do is talk about problems what is your platform CJ Pearson Candace Owens what is your platform is your platform I hate Democrats where's your platform I want something for the people because it seems like when you watch these people they're all saying the same thing for cliques like I told you my homeboy it makes her have money on Facebook he's doing the Candice all wins and CJ Pearson thing for money but the other is saying they're not they don't have the same ideology see they're Pearson's and Candice Owens they're cut from the same cloth you think so they're the same person he's just younger version I heard him speak on the Sam Harris show I believe it was him right was it him CJ Google that CJ Pearson on say I'm pretty sure it's the same cat mm-hmm and I was very impressed especially with someone his age yeah I mean he talks very well and that's hard to do no hearing no dates of America's not in like they're both the names of nothing okay maybe it's different dude they have pre that's why I thought he was older catchphrases pre-plan catchphrases your you're learning you're just learning another language and that's and that's what he's he's speaking that language no damn that's that's little bro you know I see I see what you're saying so you're saying that they have this sort of ideology that are subscribing to this predetermined pattern of behavior they know what works and then they just follow it sort of like top 40 DJ talks there you go right right you know what what has what new thought has he created I don't know yeah yeah I just listened to that debate and it's a conversation that I think is a fascinating one the conversation of reparations because it can be no doubt that something horrible happened to the black community and they're still suffering from it but especially in the deep south when you look at these places where the people who lived are the direct descendants of slaves yeah and then these are the same impoverished neighborhoods that no one's ever done anything to try to fix right so how do you fix it you first have to start with the subconscious mind at the black mark the problem with the black mind is the fact that the black man starts off with a defeatist mentality from the day you're born you're taught the white man is out to get you so you start off with a boogie man and then you're taught that you're a slave right so when your subconscious mind believes that the beginnings of your race is a slave how do you aspire to be more than that so in order to correct the black community you have to teach black history or so-called black history or what I would say African history in chronological order before we were slaves we were kings so how do you how do you have a whole entire nation of 40 some-odd million black people and majority of them never heard of Queen Angola who never heard of the songhai empire the Mali Empire you know none of this stuff right King Massimo so how do you how do you how do you raise the peoples level of awareness about this stuff and how do you elevate them to want to do things in life when they think they are slave that's the first thing that you have to do to help black people you have to teach them who they are that expression before they were slaves they were kings the problem with that as a king as a monarch in a mark is one person who controls giant groups of people you can't have a bunch of kings there's not a lot of kings kind of a nation of kings correct but that's very different from saying you know that we had four kings right let's say there were just four right that's better than saying Harriet Tubman Frederick Douglass and these free slaves right you actually have to see at least one King I see where you say you know at least say so see one advanced human being that also looks like you that came from the same part of the world where your ancestors came from so recognize that the trajectory that you and your family are on as a direct result of being enslaved that someone was enslaved in the past and brought over here against their will that's why there's the negative mindset that's why there's a negative self-image is because there's this great history of oppression yeah yeah you know when you think you are slave you can't operate outside of that and even if you don't think you're a slave if you think you're inferior you know God you know miss Patty's no hilarious comedian one of the funniest human beings alive and she was here and one thing she was talking about was when she was younger that when she would see white people she wouldn't look them in the eye she would get nervous she felt inferior being around them she just wanted to get away she didn't feel like she belonged right right and that's a product of not knowing who you are not knowing your own personal power you know when you look at the second Punic Wars of Carthage you had a Hannibal went through the Alps which is a mission impossible and he went all the way to to the doors of Rome and Rome said you're Wayne coming outside to fight you breath I mean coming that's how strong the power for the Army was they said we don't want to fight they knew if they came outside those gates they would get their ass whooped so how do you how do you have a people that walk around not knowing that Hannibal Barca is a well-studied war general today the Pentagon still studies him right so how do you how are you operating in America as a black person and not know who Hannibal bar goes well it's difficult I think for people that were born in America and all the known ancestors from America to even relate like I'm my families mostly from Italy and Sicily and some of them from Ireland mm-hmm I don't relate at all I visited Li in the sorting arms I don't relate at all right so then the other the other side up is the fact that we would inators we were not brought here on slave ships that's not economically sound there's a main sense so when Christopher Columbus guy I want to do well Chris problem has got to the Caribbean according to a primary source right they basically said the first thing he did was take slaves he didn't bring slaves he took slaves from the island he captured people so when you have colonization you gotta remember it knighted stage there's only built 13 colonies at first rank you think this whole land was empty no there were natives here but today we're taught that natives are some other people no natives are the Mellen ated African being that has come here since the the beginning of the Mali Empire was talking about fourteen thirteenth century we had already come here from Africa really oh yeah yeah we had already come here to the United States or to this layer messed that's landmass we call the United States so the way to the ocean current works is it works from Africa leaves out of West Africa comes to South America and the Caribbean that's just how the currents go you don't need no paddle boat and nothing it is just currents and to take you there and then you travel up but we had already been here all you got to do is look up the story of sarah rector sarah right there's a wealthy so-called Native American I think she was a Choctaw tribe or one of these tribes but she was wealthy and she wanted to VI pass to go somewhere and they had her classified as a free person why don't we know about the wealthy so-called black people in America why don't we know that there were black slave owners in America why is that not talk why how many black slavery was work man is that the natives here had slaves they were trading slaves with the so-called white man well they definitely did that natives enslaved people of other tribes right so if those if those people are us the so-called black man those natives were us then we have to tell that history and say how we did have territories and we did you know carry out commerce and we weren't slaves we were slave owners what but the majority of African Americans that lived here were brought over here no no no that's not economically sound what do you mean by it's not economically sound like there were Staters right all right let's say you wanted to have you wanted to sell marijuana right right would you import marijuana would you grow it here if it's already here well it depends on whether or not marijuana grew here well can you go marijuana here you can but we're just talking about marijuana like what so it's not something that you can't grow here so so what I'm saying is people were already here does it make sense to go all the way to this other continent to bring people on the boat when we know that half of your stock is gonna die you wouldn't do that so how many people do you think were brought over from Africa on slave ships cuz that definitely happened I don't believe it what do you mean you don't believe it I don't believe that story you don't believe that Africans are brought over on slave ships correct I believe it may have happened you know maybe people were brought over as slaves but I don't think that the black people in America came from Africa on slave ships I believe the people that were here were slowly conquered first they got the East Coast and then they started spreading out west little by little conquering and when you conquer a tribe what do you do you enslave them they're POWs right okay that's what you do so you after you conquered this tribe you you you make them slaves now how do you conquer the natives here so let's say you got this tribe is warned against this tribe well this tribe goes talk to the white man women says you know if you help me wipe out these people then boom you know I'll help you with whatever whatever so they get together and they wipe out this other tribe now guess what the white man now outnumbers this tribe so he wipes them out you just killed two birds with one stone you just keep moving like that but I'm still confused there's a great history of slave ships being brought over from Africa with Africans that became slaves and worked in the south do you think that's lies history is his story right what about my story is my story not valid but if you do 23andme on someone from these parts of the country you'll find out one day that's real so so where's 23andme so when I when I when I take a 23andme test right yeah what's it gonna tell me about Africa it's good question which it finds out I'll be gonna say oh you're from Kenya you're from Angola you're right right these things these borders were created by Europe in terms yes right in terms of like what parts of Africa and how its distributed in what's a country and what's not a country yeah these my name's Connors and Dutch yeah okay yeah so you can't classify me based upon a European name I understand that but they're saying geographically mm-hm geographic location you could call whatever name you want right they can tell you where your genetics originated right I've got some weird shit in me I go like 1% Asian I don't know why it's there 1.6 percent African okay there's also a weird stuff that you find in your DNA that like your ancestors and ancestors ancestors so that's was somewhere let's walk down right so either way if you take black people here in America and you do they DNA sample and it point back to Africa what does that say says black people in America are Africans now the argument is what we brought here or were we already here did we bring ourselves here or the white man bring us here you see when you say the white man brought us here what you're doing is you're removing our ability to transport ourselves you're saying oh we didn't know anything about boats that's what John told me you trying to tell me that we didn't know that there was a landmass here the only the the wholly white man knew there was land to the west but when you look at the wholly white man he said when we got here we met black people go look at the primary source you got met black people we got the Caribbean we met black people you think the Caribbean is right next to America and a Warren in America that's interesting to see make any sense well are you go to sow that sense that you do have people that have whether it's Polynesians that traveled to Hawaii or people I mean there's the Olmecs who has thousands and thousands of years ago in South America they have purely clearly African faces yes I mean really letting the noses the lipst I mean they look African brand that was a South American culture that existed and we don't know anything about them other than the fact that they have these gigantic stone sculptures that have African faces well like again again just go to if you can pull up the ocean currents I've seen that I've heard about them yeah he read his stuff it's really God saying because he's all about that he's all about the fact that the idea that human beings were probably living in advanced civilizations far longer than fourteen thousand years ago they did travel all over the world and that you do find the remnants of these ancient cultures that we have no explanation for throughout the Amazon you know and throughout different parts of South America and Central America I mean when you go and you look at railed European history hmm you had the Magyars would believe that if they took a bath that was bad right they didn't even want to change their clothes they thought that dirty was purity when we talk about the Moors going into Spain and into Europe the stories in the history our history says that when we met the so-called Caucasian he was sleeping in the barn with the animals we told him no you can't sleep in the barn with animals we taught them etiquette we taught them running water we brought that technology to Europe now if we brought the technology to Europe that saved Europe from the Black Plague you mean to tell me that if we saved the white race that we weren't already in America already when we brought the technology when Rome was dependent on Africa for food remember when the black black plague hit Rome the cause was one of the officials was still in the green that was coming from Africa so there was famine hit wrong if your source of sustenance is from Africa how will you superior you're not you get your fool from me so if you get you a fool from me who's more likely to travel this globe me I'm the source of food and that's the first thing you need to survive on this planet so if your whole civilization is dependent me to plot the plot depending on me to supply food I made it to America first it's just that you want a war you've got to tell the story but is that their only source of food I mean it's a source of food that Rome had right but Rome is also very close to Africa well let's talk about that what kinds of food did they have well I don't know it's a very rudimentary it was a very rudimentary civilization it wasn't all what is cracked up to be when you go look at what the Greeks said about Egypt when he going to eat it just like yellow it's like New York City at that time the ultimate if you really want to talk about African civilization being advanced Egypt is the ultimate Egypt to this day still unexplained not what no one really understands how they built those things no understands that how old the culture is that's another thing that Graham Hancock and dr. Robert Schoch from Boston University who's a geologist he's pointing to water erosion and the Temple of the Sphinx that leads you to believe that that place might have been as old as 9,000 plus BC so absolutely yes there's also different styles of architecture right there's like older styles of architectures they find deeper in the sand they think it might have been indicative of an earlier Kingdom and then there's also the Nubian structures of some of the faces particularly the Sphinx yeah you know the Sphinx they believe had a lion's face and then when they were conquered by the Nubians they changed the actual structure of the face of the Sphinx and turned it into a king's face what a way it was was that it is upper and lower egypt so upper egypt is actually our new south right that's our south and what what the way has taught to me was that was the mind of egypt and the economic section of egypt was what we see giza pyramids and its economic because if you look at it it's it's between three continents on the mediterranean sea so it's a perfect place to carry out mm-hmm it's the perfect place that's why everybody wants to beat us why is there war in the Middle East because it's a perfect place to be so do you believe that some Africans came over here in slave ships or none very minimal very minimal really minimum so you think it's a myth almost now is there any scholars that support these opinions are these your opinions or were you getting this from so here's the thing this is stuff I've studied probably close to 15 years ago so I don't remember a lot of my sources or who I learned it from but I can give you a couple of names but you got to do is you got to look up Shaka Hawk most you got to look up dr. Carr becoming dr. Phil Valens huh Bobby Hemi who else is a good each of Tyler's up shock jock Moses real good Egyptologist I think you should start date with shock most but um these are these are videos I used to watch and lectures I used to watch back in a day now I focus on like startups nets where my brain is mmm that's where my knowledge is focused on right but a lot of this stuff comes from my own common sense it just does not make sense logistically to take people from all the way from over there to bring them here especially when half your stock is gonna die when you got people right here you have Human Resources right here all I got to do is pop him shoot a couple of them the rest of them are like all right fine and you enslave them and none of them died except for the ones I actually killed right I got a whole millions of people right here like why would I go all the Krait all the way across the ocean to bring people back across the ocean it doesn't make sense it's a stupid that didn't nobody run a business like that what's up Joe PBS how many the title was how many slaves landed in the u.s. mm-hmm well scroll that up scroll it up so I could read that whole thing okay right to there perhaps you like me were raised essentially to think of the slave experience primarily in terms of our black ancestors here in the United States in other words slavery is primarily about us right from the Crispus attacks and Phillip Wheatley Benjamin Banneker and Richard Allen all the way to Harriet Tubman Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass think of it as an instance we were might think of as African American exceptionalism in other words that it's the black experience it's got to be about black Americans well black Americans will think again the most comprehensive analysis of shipping records over the course of slave trade is a transatlantic slave trade database edited by professors David Altis and David Richardson while the editors are careful to say that all the figures are estimates they believe that the best estimates that we have the proverbial gold standard in the field the study of the slave trade between 1525 and 1866 the in the entire has to the slave trade to the new world according to the transatlantic slave trade database 12.5 million Africans were shipped to the new world ten point seven million survived the dreaded Middle Passage disembarking in North America the Caribbean and South America how many of this ten point seven million Africans were shipped directly to North America only about three hundred and eighty eight thousand that's right a tiny percentage so a small percentage of all the Africans that were enslaved were actually shipped to North America that's probably close to the truth hmm they come from Africa bro that don't make no sense no I run a business like that well they're saying that a lot of people did though that's ten point seven million people came on boats that's what they're saying slave trader I don't know if that means that they necessarily came here they could have been going to Europe well no they were saying they were saying that trade does not have to come from Africa I can trade with you right here in America but was it why are they not it said to directly to North America there's only the under 400,000 right right involved in the shipping and going in all over the world it could be going anywhere but from Africa that's less than 10% African shipped yes right yes less than 10% less than 10% in North America but ten point seven million Africans enslaved well and moved one day out ten points ever survived right we were shipped but didn't say where they were shipped to the new world new world is very very very only three hundred eighty eight thousand actually meters of this to North America slave I could trade from Haiti or Jamaica or something right so do you think yeah right so you think that there was probably already a significant population of Africans that were see barring that made it all the way over here yes well if you listen to the words of Hancock and the discussion of pre-historic well we would consider prehistoric use of boats and ships it's probably likely look at ancient Egypt don't you see pictures of boats oh yeah oh yeah so they would buried that I mean if you could there was the what is the big Science Museum in LA that had the the Egypt exhibit really recently it's fucking incredible they they had a depiction of the boats that they used yeah I mean they had boats for sure they definitely traveled so so how can you tell me that a civilization had boats before Europe was literate didn't come to America didn't set up shop it's just not common I mean just I don't need to read a book to understand that but definitely makes sense if they made it to South America I mean if the Olmecs were I mean if you look at you pull up an image of the Olmec heads this is heavily disputed John Henry Clark is the author you should study John Henry Clark has a book they come before Columbus I mean look at that look at these Olmec heads they all look like that I thought America yeah so it kind of if you have a zhing you there has to be a large population of people in order to create these things yeah has to be you know you'd have to be advanced so if they're here already in South America why do you all go across the sea when you got people right here you just enslave South America is connected to America you think we didn't come up north you think wait take that what right it's just common sense well particularly when they're finding all this evidence of people that were here thousands and thousands years before they ever thought people were yeah well or the evidence in the Grand Canyon from Egypt what I don't know about that what's that is you heard about that part of it yeah yes there might be some gold down there is this Egyptian gold in the Grand Canyon hey man they found a fucking the Egyptian tomb and there's Egyptian stuff that's been found in Ohio yeah yeah I was looking some stuff up but grandmas telling me I went home and looked up the serpent mound stuff and like right up the road from where the serpent mound is there's been a couple artifacts found there like it's artifacts Nicole now pulls yeah there's mounds in America which yeah supposed to be like pyramids I wouldn't hang so there's even an Egypt Ohio I don't think it's named after that but it's literally like in the same spot yeah yeah this the history of human travels fucking finally circumnavigated this globe before man this isn't new stuff it's new to Europe it wasn't new to the African race man we've been here they got the mounds too archaeological evidence from Egypt and the Grand Canyon it's right there see I've never heard that before that is interesting archaeological evidence in the Grand Canyon says it's not part of his story mmm he's got to keep you thinking he's got to keep the black people thinking you were slaves and you came from Africa on boats that's what they got to keep you particularly but you really think that there's some sort of a grand conspiracy to withhold information yeah the university's scholars all these people that are talking about the history of the world universities indoctrination centers still that the worst thing you could do is send a child college unless they're going to learn a hard science you know you go to you think Gender Studies is bullshit of course what are you saying please make believe degrees Gender Studies bro serious stuff yeah gender study you know there's it's a social construct I stand I study gender in the bedroom that's why study gender okay ain't no such thing as no genders Texas school tell me but there is you're getting you're gonna pay for it and you'd be in debt you're studying Gender Studies you get a fat degree yeah do you find anything about Egyptian when I found it I was down a deep hole so like I can't just find it that way I'm trying to somebody so I'm gonna I'll find in a second Davis bury it there I just found the picture ground hey pull it up let me see some shit this is this is this hotels got against glasses on we're getting serious this is the good stuff man if we look at his head you see his head right there yes that's not nappy hair uh well that's a tie Buddha so that's not his hair I think those are braids this was like an ornament wears braids a lot of people including the Romans Oh like Rachel Dolezal what is this is a draw this is from an old book that's why I was telling it's really old this is a drawing of all the inscriptions that were found on this piece of stone mm-hmm and a lot of these are very they're like hieroglyphs and whatnot see it's notable there's like a somewhere on here's that I think that looks just like that serpent from the mound that's in oh wow Wow yeah I figure that's necessarily Egyptian but certainly yeah it might not be Egyptian necessarily man when I found it that's what it was tagged as Oh from that time period or very similar but that is the Pennsylvania archaeology this is what the book is found from okay I did this how I got to it yeah I've never seen this before but there's some archaeological evidence on the walls like you said a lot of people don't even know that Egypt's in Africa oh that's hilarious when you start talking to people about look think about that African culture why change is Africa why don't they want the seven wonders of the world to be associated with Africa well cuz Africa's our continent I guess they think of it in terms of because you eat gypped is so unbelievably unique globally yeah like there's nothing like it in the world we know stone henges in Europe yeah but Stonehenge is clunky in comparison to the shit that you find in Egypt oh yeah it is but they but they they they still pop up Stonehenge like it's some great thing you know it's in Europe yes don't hand just fascinating it's fascinating like hmm why they do this there's a lot of shit in Europe too they're finding now with lidar where they're using this uh they're there they can map into the ground and find these structures and roads and pathways that existed and that the long since been reclaimed by Nature yeah finding that like it was one of the Graham Hancock things and he was talking about how you look at South America when they're going through the Amazon you're finding these incredible structures and incredible roadways and irrigations and that they believe that at one point in time there was a civilization of 20 million people living in the Amazon and that when the European settlers came over they brought smallpox and wiped everybody out boom yeah boom just like they did with the Native Americans that's a thing that people don't know when they talk about Native American genocide yeah the vast majority is disease is disease yeah so when people say oh you know the white man came over here with violence like I don't know if he was that vile I'll do enough bullets to kill that many people they killed 90% with disease straight disease man it's just fucking crazy so where the disease come from you're dirty people so so like in the streets so how can you tell me that you know I'm just a slave right when the filth the degeneration of Europe is what came to America greatness didn't come to America degeneration came to America stood to I mean I mean we talked about the people that came here they were escaping the oppression of yes Europe they were the undesirables in Europe mm-hmm right or other people would try to get away from religious persecution right things like that yeah but these were the dregs of the society right in many ways yeah so you come here and you're dirty and you infect the people and maybe now that's why you gotta go to everybody's everybody's dead what what if you had just like if you were speaking in front of Congress yeah and you were talking about reparations what would you have to say keep the conversation going open up the conversation let's get more Minds involved don't shoot it down in Dems must pay you know I got the hashtag go and Dems must pay why Dems because it's a great start number one so you know when we had to debate with CJ Pearson he said you know in his rant you know he went off about God and he said if anything the damage should pay is the Liberals because they had the KKK they had they own slavery they ran a slave trade so as I well that's the case then why don't we make them pay the other thing is you know if you're conservative and you you know you having this elect election race or whatever why don't you just take the wild card away from them you know from the left and say well yeah you know if there is a reparations conversation you know that was the Democrats that was the Dixiecrat that installed Black Codes in South Carolina they're the ones that that's an interesting conversation right when you say that yeah wait what yeah actually the Democrats are responsible yeah you had the thing called Black Codes and if you were considered black then you didn't have rights the funny thing is you could be technically African and be white white isn't a color it's a status Elon Musk what do you mean it's from Africa is he yep well I knew that he's not in Africa well he was born in Africa but he's not in Africa South Africa but so so when we do his uh 23andme what is this probably a Dutch or some titled a it's actually something right Europe okay yes but there is why people that their lineage from historically it's from Africa sure well I mean the Sephardic people that lived in northern Africa right mm-hmm yeah where it's considered more Middle East right right right you can see some of that absolutely but these people aren't the African right people come from Turkey right right I'm from Kiev Russia mm-hmm no that's where they come from the they've migrated into Africa that's not what are you from right their bodies aren't even biologically conducive to that environment you know I'm not conducive to the New York environment my foe is exactly where why folks is running on the street when shorts and I'm just like oh I need a jacket but there's definitely a biological difference data we got a recognize for sure know where we came from yeah yeah it's a lot to this conversation there's a lot to this conversation but it's so heavily weighted people don't want to be objective about it right what's up the thing I found about the Egyptians in Ohio was actually from a paper that was written it's it's postulating it I guess they took a lot of the evidence that had they had been finding and saying this shows that there might have actually been Egyptians there that's from 1937 that's when the guy was I think bornus is 40 years ago that amulet was brass apparently and it was found here Cincinnati and where I actually think it might have been trading trade routes because there was some like stones that have been found in various parts of the world that are from specifically Ohio because it's like a rainbow shale that was using like arrowheads and stuff a long long time ago that area was used to make weapons like the first like 12,000 years ago when the first people were kind of in North America but that area in Ohio also is known as the stand stone capital of the world and I don't know if that's related to the Egyptians that's what the pyramids are there's tons of sandstone that is very specific to that region mm-hmm pyramids made of sandstone I thought so yeah yes there's 21 from 1800 to 1980 21 times the amount of sandstone that made the Great Pyramid was shipped out of Ohio to make various buildings all over the world you know most of them United States obviously but all over the place just weird facts I found a history of the human we don't know history we know some only the only history that we know is the one we go discover on our own time the one that's presented to us is not history I saw it lies I was not all all of this some light on that too it lost civilization in Grand Canyon was weight Egyptian the Smithsonian published some stuff in 1909 oh I guess that where all this came from there was an article that got written and I don't know how much of it they proved orpurt was proven or was just newspaper bait back in the day the more amazing the artifact didn't match up to anything on the known record rather than appearing to be of Native American origin as one might expect the object had distinct Egyptian or Tibetan designs could there have been an entire civilization of Egyptians living here if so how did they get here man you got cats dad leave Africa and try to come to Spain all these places or take away yeah it is interesting right like the population of Cuba cube is so insanely diverse it's right there like what is the history of that other than the slave routes like what is the history of Cuba because Cuba's very distinct African people living there mm-hmm the whole Caribbean all that whole area it's a lot of African roots to it but that's just a place that was conquered by the Spain you know by about the cortezes you know those type of people but what really disturbs me is there's no way to know exactly what happened it's like you're piecing things together based on artifacts and historical record things that people wrote down and journals and logs and yes there's people that have traveled so again I've studied it so long ago but I remember reading primary source from somebody that traveled with Cristobal cologne aka Christopher Columbus and he was saying very specific things about his accounts when he reached these different places you know and he was saying things like we got to the land and we found Africans and I remember him specifically saying so no matter where we go we find Africans and he said it as if he was disappointed and then he started talking about like you know this is they started talking about the culture and describing their culture you just got to go look at the people that travel with Cristobal Cologne and and there's some first-hand accounts there and they're very honest about it you know dude I'm gonna look into that now that's it very interesting I'm gonna ask gram about that too what he knows about it yes he studied me especially on his latest book he studied a lot about the various cultures that made it to North America and South America okay yeah yeah this is very rich in history very I gotta wrap this up but thanks for coming man I had a great time talking to you tell everybody it's a vibe high on H I on Twitter no more Instagram no Instagram don't you show your YouTube show hotels been told you every Thursday 8:00 p.m. it's a great name alright and my main website
