the Joe Rogan experience how does Larry David handle it he's not bad yeah yeah I'm a big fan thank you you know I've seen him go through because it was it I saw him become famous you know he was at Friday's he created Seinfeld but that still wasn't the fame that he has now so I saw him through Curb Your Enthusiasm yeah become truly iconic so he's had trouble figuring out how to people want to take a picture of people you know yeah how do I do it and it's always changing he's never an asshole it's truly one of the greatest comedy shows of all time well thank you I understand and I have to say the new season we're about to film in October the story line maybe my favorite and it's really subtle and fun it's like one of those things like oh I it's like I think people watching it will feel that they're living a fantasy and after the first one airs I'm happy to come back and talk about it you know I mean because that premise of where we're going is delightful I love how HBO gives him sort of carte blanche they're like you know take a couple years off do whatever the fuck you want like yeah takes him pretty great yeah well for Larry it's not about the money of course it's about can I do another good show that makes us different than most shows in history yeah and he he only wants to do good work and enjoy himself otherwise there's no reason yeah and HBO is smart that way they're genius there I mean look if you think about the show Sopranos fucking Game of Thrones you know they know or how to let a show a show they from what I understand they give a lot of notes on their pilots but once you become a series they kind of leave you alone that's amazing you know whereas when you're doing a network show or from other paid sources I've heard that the notes never stop well when I was on the radio is the easiest thing to ruin with notes drama can survive notes comedy cannot because it's like the you know doing comedies like you know the the the dominoes and if you take one of those and just move it a little to the left to the right you're screwing up the whole thing dude Tom Cruise is fucking legit John Travolta has done some silly nonsense but he's he's also done pulp fucking vision he did Carrie when he was like real good actor face dude he's a very cutter knife that was a terrible movie face off when they cut the face off and put it on the other person structure magically changes and Nic Cage looks like bro okay what happened if Brian put it on you I would think people are like damn Gators yeah there's a monster here no first of all your head's way bigger so your skin a bit like some 60-year old lady from bel-air oh those are 60 year old ladies where their mouth looks like it's so big icky your head because they've been pulling they're pulling their skin back to their mouths like a joker they lose fat in their face as you get older you Meryl you used to make fun of me of for taking acting class and I stayed in acting last for eight years longer than I needed to because I love a train wreck and these two guys did a scene Jeffrey Tambor was teaching and these two guys did a scene from face-off and you the curtain comes up and and one guys hanging for a chain and the other guys torturing him and then it's like and then he goes yeah and so he's hitting him and it's crazy and at the end of the scenes like scene everybody's like and then jeffrey tambor just takes a sip of his coffee he goes what was that scene and the guy's face off face huh what is that cuz it's a movie it's an action movie charge both in an occasion that scene is banned forever [Laughter] okay cock a man who is desperate for acceptance approval and affection from women oh no it's different this desperation has led to the compromise of his beliefs and values the desecration of his dignity and self-worth and his inability to stand up for himself there's a 4chan right this and what he deserves as a human being example loyalty fidelity and honesty and a romantic relationship okay okay look at look at the example they gave hold on a second I know John's always wanted a girlfriend but since him and Mary started dating he's become a cock she spends all of his money and flirts openly with openly with other men I can tell it bothers him but he's so afraid of losing her that he doesn't say anything that's a cock sounds like a male feminist also I can't believe you went there I don't yeah that male feminist thing I've known a few that were real creeps that were fake creeps you know they're like on the side they what they're dealing was they were they're posturing as an alternative to these men who don't want monogamous relationships or would break the woman's heart or not willing to compromise and bend the will of the woman mm-hmm and they put these women on a platform and worship these women and I am the alternative and I'm the powerful alternative and these men are assholes and then they try to shit on those men and take those but all does is make those men appear even more attractive to these women secretly these men these feminist men and these women have these weird relationships where it doesn't work and they're never sexual or if they are sexual the women aren't really sexually attracted to him so they withhold sex and just it gets super weird yeah obviously I just generalized a lot about a giant group of people's relationships but what I've seen it's just it's they they don't run fast they can't pick things up they're not attractive so they tried their little weasels they're trying to find another way in yeah yeah I mean I think men who not all men who call themselves feminists are male feminists so in that I think men who ascribe to women being equal that's a good thing yeah I think a lot of guys will say yeah I'm feminists because they think that's the right thing to do that's the socially acceptable thing that's the way we should be but then the ones who run around and say you know really really push it and make that their identity and really sell themselves as male feminists those are the guys I have an issue with because like you said they're sneaky they know what they're doing yeah they're not being honest well you could almost always tell but you you see them yeah they're they're a type mm-hmm you know they're just they're an unattractive type they're not attractive to women and they try to figure out a way mm-hmm like how am I gonna do this what's gonna be the way yeah I gotta figure out a way to stand out and this is the way I'm gonna just what what are these women want to hear they want to hear that I'm gonna say that yeah egalitarians great you know someone who believes in equality is great but as soon as you stat like you're proclaiming yourself to be more interested in the opposite gender and more supportive of them than males and even though you are a male mm-hmm that should be a red flag that's a giant red flag you should be into humans mm-hmm I like people mm-hmm I like people I like I'm gay I like I'm straight I like people I like when they're nice you're nice to me I'm nice to you that's what I like I don't want you get discriminated against in any way shape or form yeah but I don't want to pretend that one group is better than other groups they if he had no makeup on nobody in Kingman who Sasha Baron Cohen is do you know I mean the crazy thing is these put people must have had to sign releases yeah and I did hidden camera shit so I know how that works two ways there's money which is always the best way and you make them sign before mmm that's that's it there's there's the way yeah you make them sign you know we're gonna be featuring you on this say we did this bit Ian Edwards and I did this bit for a Comedy Central for the show that never went I don't know if I've ever told you this but we this bit was so fun to do we made a thing called melon Mayo mayonnaise mayonnaise that she'd that made you darker real shit and we put food coloring in Mayo but we introduced it as new Brown Mayo it's a new generation of Mayo and so we got people in this test group we know like real people in a real test group that go and take tests all the time and they emanate sample shit we put them in a room we made them eat the sandwiches just fucking Mayo was male they eat the sandwiches all these white people eat the sandwiches and then when they're done we send in this black dude al and she shows them a video and it was a pre-taped video basically of white people confessionals who have turned we've you know we photoshopped them to have turned more Brown to turn start to turn black oh my and we're like in three to five weeks you start to see results you start to see cultural results mental results you know getting you're getting more black by culture you're getting smarter black you're getting cooler black in your neighborhood to your friends like their face it their faces were perfect if we didn't have any volume Yuda laughed everyone's like wait a minute no one said we'd be black we'd be turning black I mean they lost their fucking minds people got so scared it was amazing that bit was a date MTV never I mean coming central never heir to any of them where is it Comedy Central Party hasn't a fucking vault they threw away oh my god yeah that was one of our favorite bits that we that made us laugh so fucking hard their faces that one woman though one woman to her credit she goes you know people are freaking out and the room people starting yelling at him and they're like this is I'm gonna fucking show you I'm gonna and he's black and he said wipe oh I'm gonna fucking sue your ass if I'm black it's like the flooded to watch him go it's not as bad as you're making it out to be I mean I was bi was born black and I'm liking it a lot and one woman goes you know it's disturbing cuz it's shocking just to spring this on me but I don't um I'm not scared I could take on being black I'll just let's let's we'll see what happens I mean she was like she goes will just I'll just live with it we'll just figure this out I guess I mean it was insane that they bought into it but also that that's how we did it we fucking made him sign before him and then you paid him out and when it's over we broke him off more money so they wouldn't say no because they still have the legal right to be like I'm pulling that or you pull it or I'm suing you so once it was over did they understand that for Comedy Central after after everything was said and done and then do they laugh a few did not laugh if you laughed a few people or not but that was one of my favorite things Mellon and mayo and man did it work like a charm people were like this mayonnaise is delicious it was fucking Hellmann's or whatever with a little brown dye in it it's unconventional but I really like this is so stupid [Applause]
