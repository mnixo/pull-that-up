[Music] and if you don't have this full range of options and possibilities inside the Octagon you're most likely limiting yourself agreed agreed I see that ya possibilities are nice where do you change things up and again like I said earlier confuse the brain get them thinking about something else and then you do something else so it's always nice but I think right now we're seeing like there's a there's a pack right there's like the standard pack of athletes that are doing things in a certain way and then there's a few that are moving away from the pack and they're expanding the potential of MMA I think you're one of those people I appreciate that and I think you for sure are one of those coaches and there's a few guys out there I know you don't like to hear but Dominick Cruz is one of them he's also doing it and we were talking about him today that like his style is so fucking odd you know he's technically not sound actually you know but he uses it the right ways he's got awesome timing yeah he's got a great cardio he's got a great chin you know and then you can get away with the the bad things he does cuz he does him for the right way for himself yeah I don't necessarily think you can say it's technically bad because he's so fucking successful yeah and he knows how to do I just think it's not standard you know like he doesn't like we were using Ramon Decker's as an example he does not throw kicks and punches like Ramon Decker's but what he does do is he throws him like Dominick Cruz where he's moving like a pendulum back and forth and it's footwork is so weird and he's overwhelming your mind with possibilities and he doesn't do the same thing twice he mixes things up so well that he's a tough nut to crack indeed yeah he's tricky he is trickier than I expected for sure but the you know piece of that again game planning is the talks up to the fight to get the emotionally invested yes and then it becomes a bit trickier to find the head right so that's the goal when you were when you were leading up to the fight he was talking so much yet yeah and you could tell that you were getting so upset but that is a big factor in fights right because fights are so emotional yeah because it's one of the only sports in the world where your health is on the line like literally like this the option it's not like you might get in a car accident when you're racing cars that that's a possibility but the goal of them is for you to fuck up someone's body yeah absolutely man um the other thing you hit thing with him - that makes pisses you off so much is that he'll attack anything and just talk about something doesn't even make sense just to talk and talk louder and faster and not give you a chance to talk it's like highschool girls just like just bickering at each other you know I think that's what pisses you off the most you know cuz he's not even actually making a great point he's just making it and making it louder it's very articulate yeah it's a good good analyst because good you know so what technique if you get a chance to fight him again for the title yeah I bet which your hand line yeah right obviously well you lost a very close decision to him and then you beat Hoffa on Sun South which in my opinion was we were talking about this today was an excellent example of how far you progress because you guys had a really tough fight the first time you fought it was a close fight this fight was not close he just ran away from him it ran away with the the fight rather not ran away from him but rant mean you were just it was a clear victory it was like you just were so much more technical there was so many more options you were presenting him and he was basically the same fighter that he was back then maybe slightly better but you're a way better if I appreciate him and we've worked hard we've heard long hours wears really hard you know it's crazy how like you said the support works out how quick things can change you know I mean I could be on 11 fight win streak right now and a split decision loss to Hoffy Austin so you know I thought I won that fight a very close fight with Dominick Cruz that I felt I won as well those two fights go my way I'm on 11 fight win streak you still have the belt you know known as hopefully one of the greatest pom-pom fighters in the world you know I for sure [Music]
