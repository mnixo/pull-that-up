alpha brain is the best best common combination of cognitive enhancing supplements we could find and that's what we did we just took the best shit available and the what's the most recent science on this stuff and we try to sell you the best supplements that we can get we sell kettlebells now and battle robes all things that I think are the the best pieces of equipment as far as for strength and conditioning there's some of the best exercises equipment you can have kettlebells are amazing if you've never done it before there's a hundred videos online you can you know on YouTube there's also we have Keith Webber's extreme kettlebell cardio workout DVD for sale and we're actually going to make our own I want to take people through one of my fucking savage kettlebell routines and you get to

now lead lieutenant of the Joe Rogan army you've got to keep those people in close proximity they're the ones who can do extreme physical things you're like a google of warriors that's what they're doing here at on it aren't you we're trying to put together strong as human beings possible we're trying to help people become as strong as possible look having a strong body is fucking awesome if you don't think it is because you've never had a strong body like when someone can give you a jar mayonnaise and always know that you're gonna be the guy that opens that bitch when you have to pick something up and you can because your body can do it you can't do you don't have to call somebody and oh man I need some help aw fuck now you just hoist it up yourself because your body works really good I don't know why anybody wouldn't want that to me that is a really weird sort of a distinction that people have made where they try to separate intelligence from physical performance and it somehow or another well I spend my time being intelligent I don't have any time for physical performance but yet you exists in the same world that I do I know this world this world is very physical and for you to not enhance your physical body makes me think you're dumb you're dumb in some way no if you're if you if you're if your physical body worked better your life would be enhanced but unless you're your physical parts are just like laying on the couch at HOD casting and fucking okay you're a very rare don't need to be people I don't need to be fit if you did though if you don't you think you'd have more energy I don't fuck those girls better the stick around long that's what those boner pills are for Scala you don't need to do anything you just take ones boner pills they can't take it do you remember what Tim Ferriss said there's some acid reflux remember what didn't first though about there's no biological free lunch you're paying for that for did for you to get that that goes crazy super boners from these boner pills yeah I got to think that somewhere on the other end of that well what it does is it makes all your blood go to your dick right I consider that like like you know like helping the flow of blood throughout your body more active efficiently you're right actually in fact they actually use whatever the fuck the active ingredient in Proffitt all or some whatever their actives in viagra as a performance-enhancing supplements banned now by Olympic Committee's why well because it makes you it's it's it has a very similar response to these nitric oxide supplements which are all the rage and what some of them are actually fucking dangerous like that jack3d people die on that shit like a woman just died she was a marathon runner in London like 26 years old get take some jack3d runs a marathon boom her ticker just fucking blows it if she was laying on the couch watching fucking TV she'd still be alive that's why I'm trying to say like look at this guy this this bode miller on on it bori bori bori bori he's like a famous gear I know look at that shit imagine doing that shit I could but man I have a friend a very good friend who was on the US Ski Team dr. Steve Wright he's called in the show for when we're explaining the cyborg physique the female cyborg and how how is that possible but dr. Steve is on the US Ski Team and he has massive fucking scars all over his legs he's had I believe some insane number like 25 26 surgeries on his knees incredible if the covers of his knees where his cartilages was so chewed away that they resurfaced it with like it looks like steel I mean I don't know what it is it's like some shiny metal I don't know whether it's titanium or what the fuck it is but they resurfaced that did caps of his fucking bones so he doesn't have bone on bone contact anymore so this cap sits on the bone and it just they roll together he's kind of like everything in his knees fucked he's had everything replaced like just last year he had another ACL operation I mean it's just over and over and over again this guy and so when I see skiing that's what I see yeah I see knees yeah I say hey laying on the couch this would not happen so this is what I was saying I say balance my friend there's a balance and everything I've had a few operations my body works great though you only have so many heartbeats Joe and the more you use them that's not true it is true no it's not true do you think that fat people's hearts just beated extra-fast and that's why they died off quick yeah no to being obese your body is not just not healthy what imagine if you did if you actually did only have a hunt you know a certain amount of heartbeats yeah that was the key the key was just like just staying calm but then what about good movies what about blowjobs what about a lot of shit that gets your heart rate up well that's okay but but if you spend an hour a day doing it time fifty you know that's a lot of heartbeats instead of getting like a quick blowjob it's you mean if an hour a day of exercise right hardcore exercise opposed to your regimen right just a blowjob in TV don't you think till you would like have better performance in podcasting and in in your life I'd have to move my face a lot so you're just happy with your body just doing the minimum amount and get you from point A to point B yeah because I don't want a thousand knee surgeries I don't want fucking ringworm on my asshole I want looking into that shit I wonder I'm gonna be clean and and and luck luxurious for women so that they will don't be scared homey calm okay your fucking pussy we scared a little thing where about your butthole Brodie Miller bode Cody Miller yeah yeah look at that guy's skiing is kind of fog it looks like a fucking Tron guy yeah it doesn't even look real ninja how fast you think he's going to pilot 50 or 60 fucking miles an hour right there look at his poles all been right no shit silly that's trippy those ridiculous doing that of mushrooms he must be fucking flying right there who I snowplow and I don't ever go that fence the scariest thing for me is the seen people that are doing those those things where they drop them off a helicopter on a snowboard and they go down the side of a fucking mountain yeah those guys are animals and that's items sorry I was just going to saying sometimes like they get caught in avalanches the Avalanche is like behind them as they're coming down it's terrifying to watch that's why you guys have this strong zone enjoy full enjoys energy at the end of that because that's the actual active ingredients called strong sorry I don't have my fuck up my computer in front of me I google you the the ingredients um I forgot to bring my laptop you want to borrow one yeah no no I got a mini I'm not sure yeah maybe just in case I need to Google some shit cuz I do often times talk out of my ass and I like to correct myself there's battery here anyway go to on it calm and check out the full range of supplements and again use a codename Rogan you'll save yourself ten percent off that doesn't apply to the fitness equipment

you talk to Lazar or laser laser why do these kind of bookshelf see even existing where you have like old books and stuff because now it's just like you know touch of gray or whatever and stuff right

like yeah like Pinocchio and Jaws yeah quite honestly I trust you wait laughs if I go over your house and you have a lot of that shit if you have books like that I really I would think that you're a manufactured person what are you reading Oh Peter Pan that's that's nice well it's not even that it's like look at the volume look at how those books look I mean like who is this guy wouldwould with the fucking buying where are you buying these do you are you just getting this all as a big set that makes you look classy what is this I bet there's some secrets in these books - right okay I beg you open it up with his fucking guns and they're cut out every one of them got a gun in it its reptilian could you imagine if every one of his fucking books was actually just a gun holder and this whole time he smiled and then one day the dot did someone goes to pick up the book and he they pick up the wrong one or gun falls out and like what the fuck then they realized dude had a hundred guns it was just super compulsive and he collected handguns and put them inside books sorry that's why knows nobody wants I ever read those books if you have one of those shiny banging books with the old-style binding that's real super fancy you have one of those in your shelf who the fuck's gonna pick that up and read it even a robber is not going to read that no one will ever touch it this is sublimino of paint big penises right here the only way someone's going to touch that is if you left a little kid in the room by himself that's the only way those books get in touched but a grown adult will do that's like DNA yeah when you reverse him yeah look at it versus he becomes satanic and then all that shit becomes DNA well this is rude because this guy like works for on it Oh obviously he's not really reptilian lazy gentleman he's a he's world Brad you're a physicist you shouldn't do this to his image to doctor later he would fuckhead my boat this guy works for honor no you probably should do giggling look everything it's mad he's happy about it you don't know about that you can't do that well look at this picture that's not him anyway scan unto who he really is yeah who's that guy

You dr. laser he's just messing around this guy he's wacky but you get you get to love him trust me right now I know it's weird it's tenuous but trust me he's a good dude all right cue the podcast you dirty fucker the Joe Rogan experience join my gang Joe Rogan podcast my night powerful Brian Redman it's just you and me buddy we haven't done one of these for a while and now it's create a mini for me did you have a you got a little laptop oh yeah it needs it's like I get the charger okay the were waiting for freeway Rick Ross I should say I say freeway Rick Ross because we have to make the distinction between him and the guy who's the rapper who calls himself Rick Ross who says he got his nickname through some mother he has got the one some wacky it's explanation for why he has the same name as this guy who was once an actual huge drug dealer who was actually involved unbeknownst to him to the whole iran-contra scandal because back when the CIA or whoever the hell it was was illegally selling drugs in Los Angeles to fund covert operations overseas that they didn't want to get approval for it's really kind of crazy shit this guy was involved in that unbeknownst to him he was just out there slangin he was just out there slang in and didn't realize that he was making so much money cuz he was sort of in cahoots with Uncle Sam well not even Uncle Sam just you know corrupt aspects of Uncle Sam I mean I'm sure he can't say all of Uncle Sam was corrupt that would be pretty douchey do you think we got to our yesterday I think we did I kind of felt bad you find that why because it seemed like it very reminded me of just how are you thinking like this right like like oh shit maybe we should have done this off the air because maybe this is like he's going through some shit like maybe he's smoking too much weed like maybe he's fucking like what if he is smoking just mad amounts a week well it definitely is but I don't think it's that I just think it's a matter of our he's a very smart guy and when you when you're smart person and you see something that's really stupid you can have a really adverse reaction to it where it gets illogical and he's he's allowing himself to get it logical and he's allowing himself to get upset at those people and the end result is you're not really being victimized your yes your your losing a little bit of the privacy of what you bring on board but we understand that and we know we're going to do that but I think Ari had to relook at it and I think once he did he started like seeing it a different way which shows you how smart he is to know that he can get caught up in a fucked up way of thinking but it's just that can happen to you you can get caught up in a fucked up way of thinking and it's it's not beneficial it's not and it's not the only way you could look at it but it seems like it is at the time at the time it just seems like the way to go I know like no fuck that but really you know when you look at all the shit to be pissed at that's not it's not up there yeah and you could tell you what he was kind of realizing it yeah you know so near the end of it you tell he was second-guessing himself in her well you know his point about the seats the plane seats makes more sense but still he's yeah Ari's a good dude he really is a good person he's just got you know he's got a little a little bit of anger that comes out of him sometimes when it comes to certain things and when when he gets angry about something like it's very hard for him to look at any other point of view that's super common you know alive I used to have that a lot I used to have a real problem with once I got angry about something I could never think that it was my fault that it started in the first place I always would try to justify it for myself and then I had to like look at that I'm like we don't why am i why am i making excuses for this like look at this for what it actually is like what what what actually is going on there it's very hard to do and a lot of people are bad at it you know and it doesn't mean that you're a bad person it means you can get caught in a fucked up way of thinking and so you'll just snap you know and Ferrari could have been something else could have been a girl problem it could have been you know it could have been a little bit on edge and then you get in front of somebody and then they do something that you think it's just so stupid just fucking stuff and then before you know it you're yeah you don't even know what you're doing you're just yelling at someone and you know you're not you're not taking a big deep breath and going what is this really you know how much of it inconvenience is this how much should I be reacting you know what is really going on here I see a bunch of people doing their job and the ultimate goal stop planes from blowing up but Sir you know mm-hmm but that's once you're there once you're at ten you know like he was like he was yelling at them and shed he was he was at ten he was at and he was at the point where I was long I was going goddammit I'm gonna have to get a fucking lawyer I'm gonna have to call lawyer like how do I get a guy out of jail I've never had to get somebody out of jail so if our ego you know if he gets arrested it like fuck what do I have to do here you know he needs he seems like he needs to get back into doing jujitsu like he seems like he has these rage issues you know like in the past you with you know like Bobby Lee and with that with all that other stuff and I'd say I think it would certainly help him if he had some sort of serious exercise but I don't think he's really into it yeah he does um basketball I know he does I like once a week or something like that yeah but not basketball with black guys basketball plays best well with little comics cigarette smokers right yeah it's so true it's so true that basketballs a joke kind of cardio those fucks have oh I think Merv is on a few murders he's this big guy that plays one of the the capital one commercial Vikings he's in on the basketball team ah so risk is a huge guy oh that's funny the capital one Vikings commercial you know like what's in your wallet do you buy things based on cool commercials do you ever do that no but it really it really tells me like hey like Sonos I don't know if you know my Sonu says this is a company that has this bluetooth speaker and it's fucking it sounds amazing I bought them for my whole family for Christmas it's just as the bleep you go on your iPhone and yes you know yes it's great and the smalls like a rectangle right yeah it's like a little little box is a little blue in the center of it I just got it it's it's great it's one of my favorite things ever it's best like in your bedroom just yeah what was I talking about now oh you're so hot I look at you what were we just talking about talking abou a bluetooth Oh shit what commercials buying something oh they had a really cool commercial as an example I was like what is this Bluetooth speaker and I went on Amazon went and read some reviews and stuff like that and I did kind of it kind of made me go well if they have such a cool commercial they are a cool company because you know they have a cool marketing company well they have a cool advertising company right hired I mean have you ever gone to someone's website and you know they suck but the websites awesome yeah I just hired somebody cool right figured it out yeah but there's certain ads where like you know he out of respect you know you see the ad you'll be eboshit like I know somebody who buys Geico because she thinks the Geico ad is hilarious right so she's always like you ever seen the one when pigs can fly yeah it's so much better than like take progressive I don't want to fuck that girl why it's Gator we'll get away from okay that's not true a lot of guys want to fuck that girl really yeah a progressive girl or I don't want a lot of dudes have a type like that I guess do you have a weird type yeah Asian so weird oh they're amazing man for white people from Ohio that's about as exotic as you get right they're cute too yeah they're like little toys asian girls very attractive I don't know did you always like Asians not always no um I think Asians are the the idea for white guys is that well it's exotic this is crazy she's like another species and they're super smart you know you get all the danger without dating a black chick you know you kicked a check you get all the the danger of being around someone alien Terry or your culture yeah but you get this exotic sex girl it's like you know thought to be like really submissive and you know like that's what people always love like the Asian girls will stay in their place and they'll be submissive and take care of their man and like guys will say oh I got an Asian wife I'll tell you what I'll never go back to white girls again a lot of guys say shit like that you know is it a certain part of your age that you become a vietnam vietnam vet like like you'd like that you just get into asians like hardcore because it seems like fuck listen to that question if you you use that question you could use that in court to the judge to like on paper the way that's work that question was written right they would like it would take away whoever's taking care of you they would bring you somewhere else there's something wrong with his development look at the way he's talking I knew this one asian girl that she would clean me every night and she'd put lotion under my eyes and then clean my fingers and make that popping noise and stuff and like whoa or you do this for professional like how do you know to do that popping noise on your fingers and and then take care yeah she's taking care of you washes me with a washcloth it's amazing but then you know normal girls are just like trying to puke in like your trash can and stuff and well yeah I mean well you gettin real personal here fella but your situation you know without talking about it yeah I mean you got told it's not my current situation I know it's not your current situation but that situation that grow you know you either get that and you have a nice girl who takes care of you or you go on wild freak sex orgies when you're on ecstasy those are your two options in this world that you find yourself in you're presented with very unique challenges you know not a lot of people have those those problems you know with the most guys the problem is actually just getting laid you it's the problem is trying to figure out you know it's it's a crazy the world but when you're talented mm-hmm when you're in a position when you have some people paying attention to you you get like superpowers and you've right now you got freak superpowers so you got to deal with that and this is the way to deal with that is either you go on a fuck rampage or you find it good when you settle down those are your two options because you know either you either use that power for evil and you go out there and spread your super AIDS or are you a good girl the problem is finding someone that you actually like and then finding someone they can actually tolerate for long periods of time and then like actually still enjoying being around them so rare so rare and it's not necessarily the man's problem it's not necessarily the woman's problem it's like the ides of you finding someone that whatever is wrong with them fits in whatever is wrong with you and they both like Clank and then like fit in perfect and you actually enhance each other you actually make each other's lives better if you can do that but it's fucking stupid hard to find you know it is possible but you're definitely not going to find it when you're doing those coke ecstasy binge situations like then you just it's all about rehydrating and then you know finding out how long do you have to wait before you dig and get hard again every day with those pills Joe yeah but I'm telling you man you might break something in your brain I don't think you're supposed to take that shit every day I don't actually well but I do I say once a week I do that you know you see the deviation you're so crazy you don't even buy the pharmaceuticals you just go to that fucking drug store counter Mexican taco version yeah that shit at the gas station yeah that's sitting on the front counter I had to get one at 7-eleven the other day what the fuck's in there I know I got this one at 7-eleven yet the other day showed you in Vegas that says yeah I'm the big thing it's like uh it's like watch out for counterfeits but it's printed onto the box like why would they even say watch out for counterfeits and it was such a huge symbol and then on the back it was like also peel the sauce off if you want to use it as a calling card or something like so it was a calling card slash a dick pill thing so you could like use like long distance yeah like like it you can make it like a gift card like when you go do like a gift card place it was fucking weird gift card are you talking about a calling card like for like a pay phone it was like the pay phone number those yeah yeah it was just like they still sell those do they still sell remember when he hundred collect remember when that was around that was a big thing there was all those 1-800 collect companies yeah remember that there was like no there was a sprint one that's right yeah they would offer you but our were those things that are offering you like a phone that you use through the internet what is that that still goes on but it's like a late-night commercial it's a phone that works something it cause your cost down the guy's dialing internationally like what is like a Skype phone know what it is yeah it's like mr. jackoff or Jess something along those lines yeah it's it's uh it's you plug it in and it just pretty much does what like Skype does it's just like a USB thing that you attach like headphones to or something like that if I remember correctly but that's all it is so it's not like an actual phone no it's just like what you know like charter or Skype is or any of these voice over so you have to do the dialing through a computer no I think you could set it up where you can you I don't I don't know I think there's like a phone jack in it that's what it was it's a phone jack on one side on the other side was a USB plug and what it does is it just pretty much converts your phone into a voice over the internet so it makes so you're using Skype with but with a phone line so it will ring in its it why bother with it yeah well that seems like it was kind of around more when it used to cost money to like be like in other states with your phone right like most people don't have like out of state roaming right I don't know and you don't have issues with out of state far as I know like the minutes and my aversion I can use it all over the country and I'm not roaming right now right but remember if you used to like Drive just a little bit out of your house right you were fucking roaming you would be in some area where you don't really have coverage yeah so you have to use somebody else's coverage some other company and they bill your phone coming your phone company bills you like double or triple or whatever the fuck it was and for then back then it was there was a big deal to like make a long-distance call holy shit yeah long-distance calls were crazy do you remember when they had phones and planes that's one of the only pieces of technology that slipped backwards was the phones and planes that's right you never see that you never see that you know when you used to open up your seat inside your console there was a phone you'd slide a credit card down at ya and you enter in your card information and then you would fucking use the phone you know why you know why they don't want you to turn on your cell phones and work because now they don't want anyone to describe the terrorist events because they're all undercover you know government agents and there's really no hijackers it's like oh you know what I mean like they don't want communication just in case if they have to take down another that would blame Alex Jones way of looking at the situation it's very clear these people don't want you making calls these people are the enemies of Liberty if you're um if you're on a plane and some shit goes down now you just have to draw pictures better be like a sketch artist at a fucking courthouse that's right is that not one of the stupidest gigs ever like let's uh well you know we can still you can show what happened but you can't be really really good about describing it so only draw it yeah we have a that's show I do Monday we have a sketch artist that draws we had this guy do a Doctor Who drawing sketch artist for real are like a last that is what is that this is we have every show but what is that picture it's from Doctor Who Doctor Who and then all our faces are in the stomach there's me and there's Brody sketch artists are seriously that that domain not the artists themselves are just people with a gig but the idea behind it is seriously one of the most arcane aspects of our our judicial system it's fucking ridiculous when you see those photos on TV when a guy's in court and you see the TV shows you the new shows you are drawing like look what the fuck am I seeing here that is to me like such a sign of like a fucking dorky world that it's so it's so screwed up and ridiculous and so nonsensical that they'll they'll film a drawing of some stuff that happened in a time where photographs exist it's not like they're not pretending that they have no idea what happened that courthouse we have no news for you know we had a guy in there but they wouldn't let him take pictures but they would let him draw you'd be like what who the fuck's in charge here you'd pull them over and go what is this why is this here what are we doing here let them take a fucking picture it's 2013 asshole you don't need to draw pictures take a look why did they do that though because for someone wants a lie someone wants to be able to lie someone wants to be able to control the access to the images that get displayed from the situation someone wants to be able to control the situation that's all it is if they wanted the American public which they should have especially in cases of criminal cases we have to worry about whether or not this person is a bad person or out there like trying to victimize people they're trying to limit your access to the to how the court works to limit your access to how what what actually takes place in the courtroom because a lot of times is bullying you know there's a lot of bullshit that goes on in court there's a lot of shit that goes on in court did you know that people that get charged with medical marijuana when they get arrested they get arrested federally most of the time and they're not even allowed to use the word medical they can't say medical marijuana they just sold marijuana like if they use the word medical they just throw them in jail it says contempt of court the throw in jail because they don't believe that marijuana is a medicinal substance or it's not their law the federal government they're allowed to say that there is no law so you can't say medical marijuana so even though you're defending yourself in the same country as where medical marijuana is legal you're not even allowed to bring it up in a federal court if that's not some crazy bullying you know it's stupid that that they could censor that yeah it's unbelievable it just it's what I mean if if people knew about these things if you're watching video footage of courts you know of constant you know I know they had court TV for a while that was kind of fascinating that was like our first time we take it resist I think it wasn't that popular mostly cases sucked and quite honestly there's a lot of shit that's more interesting than watching trials all day yeah and then they had the OJ trial though that was on Court TV dude wasn't it yeah I think so that was on everything now remember that it was like a television event I was kind of like Oliver North where every channel was all about Oliver North what was the first time we really were sure that a celebrity had killed a woman like we're pretty sure right you know there was some speculation about other people in the past Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe no yes Kennedy Monroe yeah a lot of people thought that Marilyn Monroe was talking too much shit but that's what they would always think she could it could have been that she was just a crazy bitch she did a lot of pills or whatever and died I heard she gave him her piece do you heard that he started it here's the first precious patient zero in the herpes war did herpes exist before those 16 no when with herpes invented hmm I bet it's been around forever if I had a guess I'd say that shit came from France what is the patient zeros from France I guarantee you who I was actually under a video search on Google when I searched for herpes first Oh the show too young video oh yeah shingles is apparently a type of herpes did you know that shingles is like that shit that some people get this bad breakouts all over the back yeah I know somebody that has that it's supposed to be horrible yeah I heard somebody got chickenpox a rare chickenpox the other day some famous person and she had had already had chickenpox so it was her second chicken pock I thought that's never supposed to I know like it was somebody like weird like Betty White or somebody what yeah hmm if you're that old man you get chickenpox you're fucked when you're really old you have to wash your hands all the time that should be a meme my if I was gonna make fun of me and my points on on medical science if you're really old you should wash your hands a lot but you really should you know that's them they say that's one of the best ways to prevent diseases just not constant don't get nutty but keep your fucking hands clean that's where you pick up most of it I guess going from hand to mouth you don't even realize it it's kind of rude that we have this weird war going on between our bodies and these strange little things that attack us that make us feel like shit and literally weaken your body and they're so common they happen every year there's a whole season with the attack and some sometimes they get people some people die off people that avoid medication people that are old people with compromised immune systems colds get them every year it's crazy it's like we don't even think about it but colds are monsters it's just not that effective actually Barbara Walters hit with chickenpox a rare a rare version of it did it say she had it already um I find it someday yeah what is she not vaccinated she is 83 mama this is a lot of words yeah hmm that sucks though that can't be fun yeah yeah those are those weird fucking things like the mumps when the mumps comes around like what is going on what is this shit where's this coming from I can't work but all sudden some kid has the mumps there's a mumps outbreak in New Jersey like who was the first to get that mumps like how does that how does the something like that reemerge or that other disease that supposedly porn that just got back in the porn that was really oh yeah was that syphilis syphilis yeah fuck that shit super dangerous that shit kills the fuck out of you I think syphilis is what got Al Capone I'm pretty sure yeah I think syphilis does like horrible things to you before it kills you too it's really bad Oh hilarious court TV is now true TV really and true TV is the fakest of all TV show channel so that's crazy court TV is like you know what we're losing money on real let's go get some fake money let's get some fake I was watching that that that show I just got into that storage war show oh this is so stupid it's it's one of my it's so addicting because I want to see what's inside this things and I'm thinking why doesn't like alright these storage companies auction these off right why don't they just go through it and then sell everything and become and make a ton of money these storage companies well I'm pretty sure that it's a hundred percent horseshit well that does happen though they do have auction storge what am i watching those shows they are not taking any chances right as to whether or not they find shit they just pretend to find shit are you sure that that's a fake show I'm almost positive that a good percentage of all reality TV is fuckery that what you're seeing is overproduced fuckery yes why when you watch it it's real obvious when you watch like I watched I told you I've watched a whole episode of Jersey Shore where the whole episode was about well that's fake yeah one dude wanted to leave the situation wanted to leave Snooki want to stay that's the whole episode The Situation's like come on let's get out of here so he's like yo he wanted to fucking leave fuck him and there's a come on go get out of here like there was a whole episode and you know that they like they can cock these fucking things I mean they decide that there's gonna be some sort of an issue okay here's the issue ready go when when when they were trying to do minding the store it was one of the reasons why Duncan didn't want to be involved because like it was gonna be orchestrated like they were gonna have like this is what's gonna happen you're gonna go looking for some Mexican food you can't find it you look for some Chinese food it doesn't look good and you go and finally get a sell on this and like they had like a script and they worked it out it's like it's a sketch it's just a really bad sketch with no creativity instead of it's not reality you know I follow a guy around it's like a sketch about someone finding an old record player in a storage container oh my goodness is this this could be worth a lot of money we bet you know exactly what that's worth you put it there you fuck that's what you're watching you're watching shitty sketch TV why wouldn't they just do real ones then because it's more fun for them to be able to orchestrate it yeah but even the fake ones would be crazy I'm sure they're fine like bodies and sometimes sometimes you don't find anything sometimes you find a bag of newspapers then what the fuck do you do sometimes you find a guy who collected newspaper oh great it's got a hundred thousand issues of the New York Times here every day for the last 50 what the fuck alright you'd be so bored yeah I bet you got to go a lot of storage containers before you find something wacky so you can't just keep filming and you can't keep buying these things either can't keep rolling the dice you might go into one and there's nothing in there so I think that if I know the way the studio's think you know they want to maximize their cash so listen is there any is anyone opposed just fucking leaving a body here let's just leave about here they'll go get a fake body they'll put a body in and let's say we found a body that one of the fucking line the one guy on the show I forget his name but he just goes yo the whole time he just goes you up and he's like where's hat say ye up on it and shirts and his car set you up on it that's his thing yeah that's his trademark oh my god trademark yup yeah somebody should drop a meteor on his head yeah how do you trademark yup cuz I do possible yeah well I think you have to has to be like his belt is why you you you pee or something like that so it's more of like oh it's not a real word or so that's gross I can't even watch that show I've only watched a couple times but one of the guys who left didn't one of the guys who left side say it was all bullshit it was all staged who it was the same guy that yup guy oh really he said it was all staged oh wow yeah I might not listen to him about anything I know maybe maybe just a drama queen yeah maybe he's a lying bitch he's just trying to ruin the whole show maybe I'm wrong maybe Bigfoot hunters are really looking for Bigfoot Finding Bigfoot yeah they keep they keep doing the same show over and over again they have to find something did you ask Tyson about Bigfoot I do not know cuz that would be weird to see if him yes it would I wanted to ask him about space stuff mostly because that's his specialty but um yeah I would like to see his take the rid of really fascinating a professional take on it is the jane goodall take that one really sways me because obviously I'm no scholar of primatology and I don't really know that much about apes I just know what I've read and documentaries and stuff but I've never liked formally studied it so when someone like Jane Goodall who when I was in high school you know we watched documentaries in class that was as a Jane Goodall documentary was a we we read books about Jane Goodall and when she says that she's sure there's a undiscovered primate living in the Pacific Northwest I go damn when she says that she believes in the the Yeti as well she thinks it's probably the same animal yeah but maybe you know she's got Bing order in her age and she picked the soul that she this is this is the journey she yeah boy I got more tweets about Melissa Etheridge and the most etheridge podcast in any podcast in recent Matthew 7 Neil Tyson but people were either going nuts and loved it or they were like goddamn Melissa Etheridge is off her rocker yeah well I mean half the time I was totally on board though you know it was just that once in a while where something came out I was like she well you know what her point of view is really fascinating because like I said it's it's like almost like a religious point of view it's like you're empowering yourself with this it's way way of looking at the world but it's like oh I don't know it's it's it's a tricky thing to think that you're creating your entire world and that you're controlling your own destiny like that it's very weird weird to not recognize that there's a lot of interactions and to ignore all of them like if you see all the interactions like on a street corner just see people walking across the street and see cars stopping and not stopping and people texting and people not realizing that the lights turn green you see all that randomness you see people like on their phone with their hand up to their head and they don't see a car that's merging to the right hand side because their head is being covered by the phone that's that's really common you can't control all that okay and if you're there you're telling me that you that you're safe you're going to be okay because you haven't you haven't arranged to have this happened in your existence I say wow I say wow I say maybe though shit I don't know she might be right it you mean what a strange thing it would be if we found out that all this time we what we were really lacking was just confidence understanding of our capabilities and that you really can completely manifest your own reality with your mind and that your your whole world that you live in you can orchestrate with your mind Wow that mean in the future one day that tone turns out that that's the next evolving capability of human beings then where they just weren't aware of it but some of them made it happen on their own and didn't know why they were doing it and then the other ones made their life a complete and total mess but it was all essentially their own choice their own choice to do so yeah be fascinating but it's it's for me personally I see why she commits to it I see why it would be empowering and I see why it makes her feel like really strong and powerful and I see all the benefit in it but my point of view is always way more who the fuck knows there's way more who the fuck knows to anything I can't confirm like for sure 100% I don't have anything in front of me that tells me that that could be real I don't have anything it might be I mean it's one of the possible scenarios the imagination could conjure up you could conjure up a million different scenarios as to why you're here why you're built like you are while you have the interest you have you can come up with a million different combinations of hypothesis as to why and what happens in the previous life if there is a previous life but you're really just making things up that's reality the really the reality is you being in another dimension and you're choosing this life like you're really just making that up I don't know if that it might be real it might be real it absolutely might be real she almost was borderline talking about being similar simulation theory meaning like like you chose the player you picked the outfit you know and then you went and like like she was almost saying that we played a game we we we made our character and we chose the level that we were going to do where what part of the map we were going to live on and it was weird if you thought of it that way like she always almost doing some kind of hippie version of the simulation theory yeah very much so yeah I think the people that believe in the secret and the people that believe in simulation theory me there's a definitely a cross over there right I mean if you're really creating your own reality no without fuck did see the promise reality is so slippery and weird that the idea that we're creating our own reality doesn't seem that far-fetched you know if we found out that this world really is a simulation I don't think it would be that much different than it is right now because if if we didn't know the world was a simulation you you know if there's no if it never was even a theory and you just looked at this world and you go oh does this make it sense now this world is filled with shit that doesn't make sense all the the the I mean besides the marijuana laws and sketch artists in courtrooms and there's a million fucking things that make no sense as a million things they're stacked up all over the place and then there's a million things that are like so beyond our capability of even the people that are enthusiasts in them like when it comes to cellphones or when it comes to that Bluetooth device you were talking about the Sonos thing those things are so outside of our understanding we like and read that oh bluetooth is this bandwidth not you know 108 111 B with a okay yeah all right it comes to this way do you know how to make that do you do you know what you would have to do do you know what reactions that are causing the interaction between those two devices I have no fucking clue and these things exist right alongside sketch artists it's like it's all together like a giant joke it's like a joke of a movie and if you were gonna make a simulation about the Wild West of the Roaring Twenties of the technological era it would look exactly like this day and time so if we really are players in a simulation it makes a lot of sense this the the the beyond bizarre nature of this reality makes a lot of sense of its fake the problem is it sounds retarded you say that you sound like a fucking idiot beside weirdo selling a dumbass he said but scientists way smarter than us are the ones who are proposing this it's not us like I didn't invent the idea of simulation theory I became fascinated with it I talk about it all the time but it absolutely never came from my mind it came from me reading something that a scientist wrote about it or I was like what it was not even a thought that I ever even entertained the idea that the whole world is like some sort of massive computer program yeah it's craziness this grows Jo did you see that this uh this video right here yet it's a community access Channel show it's a guy that wants to be like one of those guys that go on like The Tonight Show and brings the animals you know no but this is like like did a mature like this is the open mic of being one of those guys this guy is the biggest idiot in the world he just MIT what he does he has a table and he puts a ton of animals on there and he mixes animals together that are not supposed to be together like cats and birds come on like check this check this out one of my favorite ones monkey and a bird he's think they taste good too now when he's chewing on my finger like this what I do is I techno and I poke my finger down his throat like that he gags and then he stops okay now we let him do it again it's important to do this little while his teeth is small and he can't hurt me we tell no poke your finger down the time Rick Ross is here let's talk about feathers here now bird feathers iguanas are easy to take care of as long as they have the right diet we're better off to just keep them away from you all if it's possible have nothing to grip against they're gonna grow a lot faster even all the other nails whoops give me on the floor well looks puppy down hello puppy it's important that you really work hard and ferret on the floor now it's important that you really work hard in obedience training oh excuse me Barney all right now if you had now this kitten never saw a dog before so he's scared okay okay the first time he's been here much now if you hold the kitten how did that bother you with I always go they chose what is on I'm not gonna even appreciate this very weird what so what does it if they want to Google axis guys it's under it's on liveleak and it's what the fuck this shirt isn't animal it starts off it ends with like dogs and Turtles okay shut the Shiva see what happens we not here Rick Ross meanwhile the fuckers playing Turtles or wrestling with cats and all kinds of man I apologize no worries man it's always they told me don't leave oh really well this so that what ladies and gentlemen we said before if you don't know who Rick is Rick is at one time aspiring tennis player in Los Angeles that was a young man that didn't have even the ability to read and became a gigantic cocaine kingpin wound up going to jail learned how to read the became studied the law learned that they fucked him got out of jail because it and found out that there's a dude using his name who's rapper and it's the craziest thing ever is name you mean if you if you know rapping you know Rick Ross a lot of people like oh shit Rick Ross is gonna be on the Joe Rogan podcast and then they tune in they go who the fuck is this guy the dog hey people stopped me on the street all the time say man I saw you on Joe Rogan matter of fact hey let me show you this here you put me in the t-shirt business what is it what is this shit oh the real Rick Ross got a rapper by the way a dude came to my one of my Chicago shows he had one of those hey this your work man oh that's beautiful good day the real Rick Ross is it's not a rapper you know what got me the t-shirt bitch well I'm gonna wear it I'll wear it with honors I brought you to here beautiful thank you yeah yeah I want to thank you man for putting me up on that game working if people want to buy them working together or they can go to a freeway so social media calm freeways social media calm there you're gonna get hit with an avalanche right now you think so hope you think they're going to point me they're gonna support the fuck out of you man what the fuck are you gonna get hit with an Lancel orders then you make that shirt look good me so one more time the website they didn't write it down freeway social media comm freeway social media calm and get yourself the real Rick Ross is not a rapper man you see the new business that Joe Rogan put me in you I'm saying now not only am i 70 shirts I start off selling t-shirts but now I'm manufacturing them I'm putting them together and everything oh that's beautiful you gave me a whole new career what's a great career too because you know what man this guy's made a lot of fuckin money off you you should make a lot of money off you too I hope so and this this is the way to do it to to you know to explain like what the fuck it's a crazy story man it is a dude running around pretending to be you and almost got killed last weekend was that real because I know 50 cent in him if you don't know the whole gangster rap world ladies and gentlemen 50 cent and the fake Rick Ross do not like each other at all at all not 50 sad who I've met his very nice guy he apparently has been saying that the whole thing was staged cuz none of bullets hit the car amazing that's amazing it didn't get no car no because a que I heard it was a a cake I don't know what it was who wasn't one of the horrible trashed his Rolls Royce the worst shot ever have an APA if you get a giant fat dude in front of you in a murse allusive Rolls Royce and Rose Royce a nice-looking Rolls Royce - yeah he didn't pity some mix-a-lot sup it's a lot of sense so you know I thought about it after he said that cuz cuz I mean I couldn't you know I couldn't just graph that at first and I'm like I mean who would going in a community in Incheon let off 15 rounds just in buildings and how do you miss how do you miss 15 times I mean I guess you can the right circumstances but yeah he's very lucky but if he set that up I mean if he actually would set something up like that with a real gun and shooting in an occupied community I mean he may really wind up being a gangster one day in prison or it could be that someone was just trying to scare him and they weren't trying to kill him they're trying to get him to give money and if he gives them money you know you can't give money when you're dead so they don't really want to shoot him what they want to do is scare the shit out of them let them know they might and that's when he cried that's when I thought too that's why and that's what I feel I felt did it was a warning shot you know pay what you owe yeah you know and get on your business and for people don't know that side of the story apparently like he used someone's name in a rap and there's a group of gentlemen they call themselves the Gangster Disciples they apparently the game of warning once and he did something else I was in jail with some of those guys oh yeah yeah yeah they don't enjoy his use of their vernacular and the the image I mean I mean who would who would want somebody to come represent their thing something that you've worked hard for to put together and here this guy come in he hasn't paid any dues but he enjoys all benefits it's a strange case of Americana in my opinion I find it quite fascinating because you know we are in so many ways was so silly with our culture and our are going way out of the way to pretend to be something that we're not and selling an image and you know and portraying an image and his case his story is one of the most fascinating ones that I've ever seen because he's making all kind of users like members cd40 the Chris Rock yeah it's like an updated version of that he's a corrections officer I mean it sounds worse than CD 4 it sounds like you're writing a movie right a corrections officer who's known to be like didn't he like get like employee of the month and she did he did got a warranty ok season you know action do you know what you had to do to get award as a correctional officer what do you have to do look at a lot of balls and assholes you got a fine thing I mean that was your jobs that would be a job that that would suit me right if it was a female facility oh yeah not even that but what if you're pulling dynamiter chicks pussies all day I did a little Paris he'll be fine but at a men's facility yeah I don't think so not me I'm gonna have to wait so the guy pretends to be this guy with this crazy criminal past of selling drugs and he tattoos your name on hands Wow your name Rick Ross is tattooed on his hands he's got like money tattooed all over all kinds all the crazy shit it's really interesting and it just keeps coming out more and more that he gets busted with all this bullshit yeah yeah more and more they just did a story on him in her oh and was saying that he comes from a suburban area you know he's not even from the hood so uh I mean I mean you know just it just doesn't end with this guy and he's making records though ya know yeah he's the first major artist they ever had to cancel with a concert from death threats you know what's really fucked up though I think he could have done everything he did with a different name I really do I really do really hard work yeah and some hard way he did some hard work it's not like you didn't do any hard work at all he definitely put out those albums he definitely does those shows he's definitely hustling right yeah so why the fuck did he have to try to do it under your name it's like he showed just as grand weakness as a man you know who are you yeah you know if you it's one thing if you invent your name like you want to be jay-z you know or even jay-z supposedly there was a dude named jazz oh that was in his community that was like an older rapper that was really badass so he's sort of like damn chair yet magazine you're doing it how do you know I know shit I got my thumb on the pulse of a part of the hood yeah probably we know you know Joe connected man Joey is connected I try to pay attention to shit dude but I mean it's one thing to make your own name you know to call yourself 50 cent or whatever but if you get you take another man's name you're dealing with a completely different thing like that's not you didn't make up a name you're a crazy person well you know the whole thing about being successful I mean I mean the way when I came up the whole thing about being for sex successful was to be able to do it yourself right you know not to where you come and you know somebody just come and they bless you with everything that you need and and here you are you know you're successful now but you didn't earn it you don't know how you did it right uh when I started I wanted to make a name for myself in and I felt that what he's doing right now he's making a name for me yeah you know not for himself he's helping you trust me with everybody else's help this is all helping you I guarantee you it's way better than if this guy wasn't around this guy wasn't around you got out of jail it's like well you know sort of life as usual and people gonna want to listen your story but now the story becomes uber crazy yeah it becomes really sure cuz it's not like you know there's a lot of dudes you like gangster rappers especially they'll they'll sort of have like a tribute name like to call themselves something Gambino or you know I mean but they won't use the whole name you know they won't say I'm Al Capone like come on you can't say you know what you say I'm your Rick Ross he did that I think thinking you would never come out of jail yeah yeah I don't think that they thought I would ever get out in you know was vacant they felt it's a vacant house nobody's watching the house move in yeah because it was really like a squatter yeah you know he was a squatter so he squatted on my name and it's also your your reality happened before the internet your your the craziness of your you know you're selling drugs you're you know basically being one of the biggest drug dealers the country has ever known like all that happened pre-internet yeah it happened today he would never be able to use that name oh no no no no absolutely yeah but you know I mean it is what it is Joe assassinating he got it you know I'm saying and now he has a name in what I want right now is just for him to stop using it and then pay me a little my dividends that you you know made from using my name I'll tell you this keep backing he's never gonna stop using it and he's got that hard luck that in why won't it watch it tattooed was a phony stop waiting they remove text but once it's Abdullah man's name on your fucking hands you got me and you got a fight you got a fight that uh in love with you for sure that has got to be crazy every time he jerks off he sees your name on his head that's crazy brushing his teeth he sees your name on his hands and and he knows how you feel about it too you know it's it's not like you know you're like some dude who's like living Tibet and hiding in a village he doesn't have to have connect with you know I'm out there you know grinding I believe truly believe it's a gift I really do I think the whole thing is a gift he's a ridiculous human being we've been right Oh God everything you told me to do so boy he was right about it I'm an idiot savant man trust me on this the I think that he's him being so ridiculous he's a preposterous human being he's obese he's covered in in tattoos he's a fake rapper who was at one point in time a corrections officer for that guy to take your name it's glorious yeah it's like you couldn't if anybody could ask anything better I couldn't ask for a better candidate because when they investigated they go check this motherfucker out and here's what's even better he's actually talented so a lot of people are gonna hear about him yeah so a lot of people gonna hear his name a lot of people gonna hear the story so he's a gift to you he really is this guy is the greatest PR representative you could have ever hired by far no one could ever reach as many people and somehow another give the seeds of your story as this guy pretending to be you know what I got a guy he wants to meet you yeah he may be able to reach more kaizen than that guy he's uh he's the world's greatest Bammer the world's greatest spammer his name is Bill Wagner I don't think I want to be in the room with that dude yeah what are we gonna fight with him that was like a I'm the shit out of it ago you know what and he said that he does he does have like a little father one he doesn't know who they are right but he says every time he goes on the show if somebody calls in and bad-mouthing with these guys going getting really and sitting like a thousand pizzas that's fine but the bill wants to meet you man we'll hook it up I have this this guy though what I'm going back to the fake Rick Ross his him as a publicist like if you hired him to get your name in scoria watch it do you know how much money it would cost to just to get as much attention as it's got the fact that he stole your name and the fact that so many people are talking about I mean that's an incredible story that like I would have to think noon well I did look at it get it like that millions of people heard that story now you know how I'm more to the point to where you know the guy stole my name he didn't had a decency to come and say yo look man I borrowed your name I'm gonna give it back I'm just trying to change the whole way you look at it because I really believe the universe gave you a gift you're looking at it like this dude came along and he victimized you and he fucked you over and he owes you and I see that too but I say the universe owes you a gift I gave you a gift and that gift is you got an idiot you got a silly person pretending to be you who's super talented I mean the guys really that everyday I'm hustling that's a badass song that's a badass song even if he stole your like the way you talk about shit like you said that that was like your quote everyday I'm hustling right yeah yeah well I couldn't put it in a song anyway the guy did a great job with it what I'm saying is that and so so many people will pay attention to him because how good he is no he's a fucking talented guy yeah and then on top of that he's got your name tattooed on his hands and then it just spills out from there it's beautiful he's like a it's like a Trojan horse like he'll get your story into neighborhoods where it would never ordinarily be if people investigate him all you have to do is Google the real Rick Ross boom the story pops up within the first two or three paragraphs yeah and everybody's gonna go what if he comes crazy yeah I think it's a gift I mean uh when you look at it from that aspect I mean I guess you're right you can't lose you're not losing you can't stop you from using your name no your real name is fucking Rick Ross he can't say shit but there's a lot of circles that you know like Simmons I want to go to Universal and get a record deal it's not gonna happen yeah that would be interesting if I want to go to one of brothers and get a record deal cuz he's already working with him yeah how what would they do if you what if you were just undeniable and you had a gigantic following you the baddest fucking rapper on earth but your name was also Rick Ross what the fuck would they do well they do you gotta change your name man but you need a stage name Rick Ross you can't be Rick Ross maybe I'll be waiting Robert Lee William Roberts is the actual fake Rick Ross's name that's what you should do I should change my name yeah you Rob yeah and see if I can make that make Jack Daniel Roberts is kind of a badass now yeah there's nothing wrong with William Roberts dad thought it was pretty good yeah it's a good man that's a strong name you know William Roberts that's hurt there's nothing wrong with that name you know is that look Henry Winkler lived his whole life as Henry Winkler he turned out great Henry Winkler can't fuck with that William hob William that sounds gangster - yeah does we leave our sounds wrong sounds like a dude holding a glass of cognac with a pistol when I'm saying Jack Daniels yeah I'm fascinated by the most ridiculous aspects of our culture yeah one of the most ridiculous aspects of our culture are fakers you know people like you know whether it's a guy who pretends that he was a Navy SEAL who wasn't and he gets caught I love reading that shit man there was a dude that was on this mixed martial arts for him he was like one of the oldest guys to ever fight in an MMA fight he fought an MMA fight when he was like 60 guy was crazy big yoked up dude at 62 but apparently it was a big crazy liar - and he like pretended to be like in the Special Forces and pretended to like have a bunch of kills in Vietnam and meanwhile he like work behind a desk somewhere like they finally was a total liar just made up a store but he had a whole security company and everything I am fascinated by that shit yeah I'm fascinated I can't lie I when I find fakers fakers to me are there they're perplexing well I think we Breeden a whole culture now fakers I mean when you watch TV with the reality shows yeah and it's just so much and I think that could be bad for us like that for our kids you know for our kids to get that that that that idea is that you know you can fake it and be successful and really not be successful I mean it's kind of me I don't know yeah we've we've given a whole generation of people the idea that you can become famous for having no qualities yeah exactly nothing there's nothing there other than you know some people want to fuck you I guess no you're like you want you watch one of those Kim Kardashian shows and you you we'll shut that TV off and just stare at the wall for an hour going what the fuck is going on what did I just watch I just watched a dumb girl go shopping I mean this is the crazy shit ever that they made a TV show out of this yeah they got someone to crazy stuff on TV now innit and most of its about faking yeah the basketball wives and I think that's going to be a backlash though I think one of the things we're dealing with is first of all the fact that TV has really only been around for a couple generations you know the television the reality of it when did it start in the 50s that's not enough time for us to really get a handle of what the fuck it's doing to our culture and then do something about it and whenever there's any sort of an opportunity to be opportunistic to make some cash the easiest way to make some cash is just put some stupid people on TV and make them do ridiculous shit so people go what the fuck are they doing but you're watching dummy and then they sell you tied in the commercials yeah and you know but it wants to make some money that you don't want smart people on TV I don't believe that I really think that it's just it's not something they don't want smart people on TV it's just that they want a lot of people to watch and it's lazy but the easy way to get a lot of people to watch it's just put ridiculous shit on like Jersey Shore like you know just Real Housewives well you know these bitches gonna scream and yell at each other over nothing they talk about nonsense their minds are filled with air there's no nothing going on other than she said this and I said this and I was like fuck you bitch you don't even fucking know me don't fuck with me what are you watching you're watching moron squawk you're not even watching a language you're watching birds going that's what you're watching watching the human equivalent to crows their nonsense people but you can make money off them you put them on TV if you're lazy but the people that are producing those shows is that their true interests you know no I mean it this in some ways it's kind of fun because it's like the fast food of television you know if you're sitting there eating lunch she turned on the TV real quick and you watch two bitches yell at each other you fucking who I might teach a real you know you watch that shit it'll you'll laugh you goof at it yeah but the problem is that it becomes a major part of our programming when you know it's X amount of percentage of all that's on television to the absolute absolutely and it affects us in ways that so many people don't really understand I mean even like with myself when I look back at my life I know that television movies affected how I made my decisions because that became my reality you know and when you're young and you impressionable then you see something you say oh man that shit is real yeah I'm gonna try that myself and see if it works for me you know just like with this guy William Roberts the rapid is using my name Rick Ross I believe that he's giving kids the wrong impression that you can go out and sell drugs and parlay that into a record career and I believe this is going to have a tremendous backlash on on our young on our young people that's also an issue with you with you this guy using your name it's not a guy like jay-z that's use your name who's a you know an excellent member of the community a guy who's a real good businessman a guy who's very smart doesn't say stupid shit his raps your nose Beyonce knows beyond today that's all I care yeah I mean you're looking at a guy who's a preposterous person and so you know his his whole persona is sort of really the polar opposite of everything that you have been speaking about since you got out of jail when I learned I mean you know I learned now that I was duped yeah and that I was bamboozled into believing that that I was one thing and and I could have been anything you know yeah if somebody would have came to me like you did and gave me the t-shirt game that I would have been selling t-shirts yeah so I believe that what he's doing is he basically what he's doing is lacing the kids boots just like you did with me but he's lacing them for negativity and it's a bullshit story his story's a bullshit story absolutely doesn't work it's a fairy tale yeah it's a fairy tale so I think that your story is also a very important story for people to listen to when there's a lot of folks that have that sort of nonsense you got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality when it comes to certain aspects of our society especially people that grow up the impoverished areas people that grow up in the ghetto there's this sort of well you got to fucking make it out on your own sort of mentality I think that's a crazy way to look at raising children I do too I think it's insane I think this does not only one way to raise children correctly love and and someone who they can respect and someone who provides a good example absolute someone who they can learn from and if a kid is not around that there it's it's a free-for-all absolutely you don't know where he's gonna land right and they're being raised essentially by a bunch of people that grew up in the same exact environment so there's no breaking that cycle it's a cycle and I think that's one of the biggest problems in our entire society and I think that we spent all this time looking at things that can weaken America overseas when the number one most important commodity in in in our in our culture is us itself human beings the movie with all everything that's been built every good thing that's been invented everything that's been engineered everything that's on this earth that makes our life better it's made by a human yeah that means a human invented that that means all this potential that's in these impoverished communities gets ignored all this potential of discovery of curiosity of of creativity all of it gets wasted in a world of crime and and repeating cycles and that as a resource no one looks at no one no one in this country looks at that we look at oh we need oil we got to go over here we look at that our number-one resources human beings are the bet I mean and when you look at resources like what is important to us as humans other humans man other humans have it set up so we don't have to go hunt some food we can go to the store and buy a steak you know you don't even have to cook it you go right next door this place is badass they'll they'll cook it for you yeah they know what to do they know the right seasonings it's like we've we've simplified the whole game of being a human being because we're important because so many of us get together and we provide the resources for each other and we have a system and it all works out well well you got a got a look at it in terms of where where does that all come from it all comes from children it all comes from that's when you really have your you really have your shot when you're growing and developing and learning things so your your story is a really really important story to be told because you're finding yourself in a situation where you couldn't read and you're any guide to high school and you you find yourself all of a sudden involved in this drug game and that seems like the only prospect ya seen you couldn't go to school for four for tennis because he didn't know how to read you made it through school system without knowing how to read and that's common that's that happens a lot a lot more than people want to admit sixty-five percent of the guys in prison can't read that's fucking crazy yeah you need that is fuckin crazy you know someone posted something cuz I'm always talking about this about how many different prisons are privatized in this country and how many are actually privately owned institutions yes that's the big business right now there's it's it's somewhere around eight to ten percent depending on who you ask of all the prisons in this country and it's what you notice now when I was in prison they were trying out even the prison that was owned by the federal government were starting to turn the prisons over to to wagon hood Jesus Christ it's really it's really crazy the idea that you could put people in jail and you can make money from it and that there's actually like a whole crop of people they're gonna come out of this one area as long as you ignore it well we're not they say that they can tell from a kid that's in the third grade if he's going to prison was a psychologist or sailors that's what they saying yeah that's ridiculous though you can't tell that you can pull that kid out of there and straighten them out I mean almost any kid can be raised correctly it's just almost every kid can be fucked up if they're not raised crab solutely I don't think that it did it that it matters really the kid it's it's really the environment you know if you leave a kid in an environment where there's crime they'll start to adapt to the crime you know I think the crime is okay and then so it's I mean because I had got to the point where I believed it that was a way of life no that's how everybody did it yeah I think that's the environment that you grow up in is a huge factor on who you become it's a huge retractor and like I said the one of the weakest areas of our country are the places with the most crime and the pace is with the most despair and that's the places that also get the least attention it's like it's like we're we're a person that has like a pile of garbage in the corner of the house and we keep saying we're going to get to it but we just ignore it and walk around it instead of just fixing it sitting is just fixing the situation if we put just 1/10 of what we put into our military budget just 1/10 to just settle the inner cities down provide guidance put put places in where people can stay if they have nowhere to go and just educate people better just make it so there's profit in rebuilding cities the same way there's profit in rebuilding cities away we bomb the fuck out of them yeah we could just figure out how to do that we'll see me and you need to go up in White House and help Obama out because I say take some of that money they spend on the drug war yeah you know they spend like sixty billion dollars a year fighting fighting drugs yeah you know what the problem with stopping the drug war is there's a whole lot of people fighting the drug war and they'll be out of work that's gonna be a real problem yeah one of the things that keeps drugs certain drugs illegal as they you know the prison guards actually have lobbyists yeah they want to make sure that certain drug laws are there they stay in place because that keeps them in business absolutely which is crazy that someone would actually without having to be there and see the look in a person's eyes when they slam that's the sell on them when I'll actually be there and experience their pain they're willing to make that decision because they're so far removed from it it's just them you know talking to a lobbyist and you know writing something down and they sign something and make an agreement shake some hands then all sudden boom this sell somewhere down the line gets shut on a man and a man loses his life he loses the the reality of the life that he lived because someone is making some money off of him being in jail George was a fine Lindsay yeah children lose a father the wife loses a husband and crazy and for victimless crimes and for say means something completely illogical like most drugs when you look at most drugs the harm that most drugs dude there's nothing compared to the harm that legal shit like alcohol does which nobody's trying to stop I never heard a single politician say we need to stop people smoking cigarettes I've never heard one I'm just waiting for one person to stand up and say do you know that there is a company that is selling poison that kills half a million people every year every year in this country half a million people die because of that this company that's selling poison that they know kills people and they're making billions of dollars well you know what he's gonna lose his contribution so he can't say yeah they can't say they never will say it but I mean if a new company came along that was just selling poison to kids would it really be as bad as cigarettes I mean I don't want to compare cigarettes to math because math does a quicker job I mean I don't want to exaggerate the effect but when you see a dude who's like 70 years old been smoking cigarettes us all live he's doing this and then he takes another drag and you go whoa they got that dude yeah they got him when they trying to get new ones cuz they always kill any customers yeah I mean but but they keep you around they slow-cook you you know they're like a smoker it's only 150 degrees take a day to cook you takes a long time to kill you with cigarettes it's not a quick thing but it to me it's it's amazing that no one ever brings it up it never even gets talked about well somebody like you you know that we need people that's gonna stand up and go in and educate our people man I have too many skeletons in my closet they need someone who listens to me that's got the fucking feet on the straight and narrow hey I mean nobody's perfect but we all got we all got our folks oh I know we all go far but you know that's my path is definitely not to be in any form of political office it's not it's not for me I don't know at that time I don't want to like listen to anybody you know I don't want to have to do shit I don't want to do yeah you know I don't want that responsibility this system too I feel like jumping into this system it's like it just jumped into a tank full of sharks it's like you don't know the rules you don't know how these fucking crazy assholes been operating now let me talk to Arnold I would like to see ask him what the fuck was it like to go from being mr. Olympia to be in a governor of California you don't think he'd come here and sit down with you he might he might I bet I could get him maybe in a year like maybe not right now I'm starting to get bigger examples I'd have to find someone to actually do something know someone who knows a Bryan Callen did a movie with him he said he was great so he's a great guy this is fun this is like after the scandal with his maid and everything so you know how many men get to have two wives living in the same house Arnold is he's a quite a character I would like to talk to you about what it was like to be a governor whether it was what he thought it was gonna be like cuz you look at that shit from the outside you know what is it what the hell do you do once you get in there you know how could you fix any of this stuff look any like we don't have any money like god damn like the money for schools and money for all these programs you want in this EA there's really not that much resources it's gotta be really difficult and then you got all these people are trying to steal all these people trying to get all I'm trying to steal they trying to steal from each other you know you got to hide the money from his I would love to get high with Obama though if I had like one thing if you said would you like to be able to fly like through the air like Superman for three hours fly wherever you want or sit down smoke weed with Obama for three hours I will take the ladder I would smoke with Obama more than I would fly like Superman for three hours and that's it a lot because flying like Superman would be cool as fuck yeah if you could do that especially if you were high and you flew like Superman like a super go better flying a superwoman what because you have boobs in - shut up you always say this it's not true it's way better chick and then you start crawling our get your period halfway in the middle of your flight you know stop I would ever eat I would love to talk shut up I would love to talk to that dude and find out what it's like to actually be the president yeah I'll tell you the truth tell my guys from homeboys in prison for nonviolent offenses when you gonna let him out do you think he would do it do you think he would ever sit down with someone like you and have a conversation he might be the only God I mean every political regna sit down with me you know yeah but he's way too vol lame duck it's like you can't we can't win again you imagine the headlines President Obama sits down with drug dealer yeah yeah but you know you've shown since you've got out that you've been trying to put people on a path different than the one that you've been on I think that's all you can ask for a man you can't ask serve and not make mistakes we ask for a man is to once he's made mistakes be honest about those mistakes and try to help people to keep them from making the same mistakes themselves you've done that that's an exempt Lee Yammer society they still you know want to tell the drug dealer the drug beards listen they don't appreciate that you were a bad motherfucker in an illegal business okay that's what it is they don't appreciate that bad motherfuckers in illegal business are still bad motherfuckers you know you just you you focused your energy and I didn't put a gun in nobody's here you know I've never I never walked up to nobody and say look motherfucker you gonna smoke this here right get the pipe pick the pipe up put it on air and smoke it right now why don't why do you think you would availa I mean it's really kind of I hate to say this again but it really kind of is a gift that you got stopped from from you know from continuing to sell drugs because there's no old drug dealers there's no bold drug dealers and there's no old drug dealers not in the certainly no old bold drug dealers right you get to a certain point in time and somebody wants your spot or something there's something going on or there's a lot of money involved shit goes down but you managed to avoid all of that well I did 20 years though you did and you learn how to write okay and when you came out look at you now looking at you you're positive you're happy every time I see you're smiling you have a warm way about you you're you know you're very personable with people like I would never wish twenty years in prison on anybody but you handled it about as good as a person can do yeah well you know when I was there I made am I I wasn't on that prison to me right I know a lot of guys when they come near they mope around they cry about being there and what I said is that you know what i'ma make the best of this because I'm goin home even though I had a life sentence I always had in the back of my mind that I was gonna get out one day and so I started preparing to do that because I knew nobody was gonna hire me you know I'm told me say man if you ever get out the first thing they're gonna say about you is you're a drug dealer so you got to do something to where you can get in and you don't have to need anybody to approve you you know like so many guys they get out they have to go to people you know go to McDonald's fill out an application and hoping that they accept them well I don't work like that right I work to a way where nobody has to approve me but myself well that's what you the way you would like to work yeah everybody everybody would like to be in that situation but you demand that and that's what made you a bad motherfucker in an illegal business and that's what makes you a bad motherfucker and legal business is that you focus yourself on yeah it's it's really it's I think like for someone like Obama or anyone to meet with you I think it's it's important to give people the the first of all to show people your story and second of all to let people know that when you make mistakes in life you can correct those and be better because of it and then have part of your contribution is explaining mistakes and letting you think that's important it's very important I think it's very important that the people who made mistakes come back and tell others well you know what if you go that way this is what's going to happen but a lot of people you know they they don't look at it that way you know like sometimes I want to go out and speak to kids and they one day I met a US High School in LA and uh they call the news and tell them hey they got a drug deal on the campus and so the news crew they shoot down to the school and just as I'm walking out and they like where's the drug do they sense a drug dealer on campus and I said no it's an extra drug dealer and uh they say oh no we thought it was somebody else so you know sensationalism they're just looking for for things to be exciting well you know negative news say yeah you know they're not looking for anything positive they don't want to portray the positiveness in what I'm doing and you know and I can deal with that because I'm not doing it for their approval I'm doing it because this is what I like doing and I think it's the right thing for me to do I think it's rushing credited to and I think that what you said about that it's good for people to see these examples of people who've made mistakes and explained their mistakes I think it's something that's missing in our world you know and I think that if there were more books written instead of just about crime and glorifying crime how about it written about dudes who did shit and wish they could take it back right you know how about talk to dudes who murdered their wife and like goddammit I love that girl like what the fuck was wrong with me once you settle down you realize how crazy were when you killed someone and then there's nothing very few books where people are honest about that about we let some of those guys in prisons you know I think that we should have a system where guys that are in prison in these maximum-security prison get away to tell the kids what is night you know sitting in a cell by yourself 23 hours a day or 24 hours a day I know they had that scared straight you know they had that scared straight program that they were doing kids for a while to hell it made a lot of videos about that remember that I remember that when I was growing up I mean something even more because I don't I don't know if that was real or not right seem a little theatrical right yeah I'm talking about something that that's really because a lot of those guys in prison you know even like the guy Larry Hoover who who the rapper rapped about I think a guy like him he's famous and he would be great to reach out to the kids and tell the kids what it's like to live in the maximum you know one of the most secure printed Penitentiary's in the United States I mean cuz I'm even fascinated with what it's like in there you know I hear that they locked down 23 hours a day their shower moves to their door so you know you don't come out your cell to shower your mail comes over a screen I mean it's like turrible you have any human contact Wow so everyone is essentially in solitary yep and then one hour a day you are you allowed to mingle with people well you to go out in the Sun and there's other people out there as well I don't think so so you go out and some by yourself right what into in a little box I think it's a little box you know what world oh my god the Sun can shine down probably through a window or something you know they let you play handball or something like that oh my god but uh I hear it's awful thing you know and we got guys there that should be able to tell the stories yeah that's a crazy life that's the world changes not the way I had planned on living my life and you know I was close to living like that yeah you know I missed that by really just a few decisions you know I made a few of the right decisions you know at the right time and it's backed me from being in that position because I could have made you know some decisions that could have landed me here yeah it was times that other people would suggest not doing this here doing this here something violent something violent you know somebody had run off with some money and you know my guys and yeah let's teach him a lesson you know and something just you know just told me you not ain't the way to go well the very intelligent that you did that it's uh I think it's your story like I said it's very important for young people I remember very clearly how stupid I was when I was 13 or 14 or I'll think about the future and where I would be and I really remember like I could have made a million dumb decisions when I was that age and I think every time you as a young man get to see the example of people who've made mistakes and corrected them or you know but went the wrong way in life and then rewrote their path later in life and became successful I think those are really important for for young people to shape their vision of the world to understand that there's going to be decisions you're going to have to make and part of the learning process is making the wrong decision absolutely you know one time I read a book about a guy and he was saying that people think that he is smart and he said that he don't think he's smart he just made a lot of bad decisions and by making so many bad decisions he made a few correct ones yeah that that is a weird thing where we want people to never made any bad decisions we want you to only be correct all the time yeah and and you have to develop you know one of the things that that that that that I've been telling the young people I'm working with right now you know I got a young artist and I'm then I'm working with right now c.carter shout out to see quarter y'all check out at I am see Carla are you managing I'm managing imagine see dope to see Carter is sealed like the letter C yeah and then another see arte our yep see Carter and when the main things that I'm trying to get her to understand and see how that she's had to see has a remarkable story - when people investigate and find out what she comes from and she was telling me just she's never had anybody like me to give her the advice that I'm giving it and one of the things that I tell her is that you must continue to develop and in order to develop you have to try new things and when you try new things you're going to make some mistakes long as you don't make mistakes that's going to send you to prison or kill you you good yeah as long as you make the mistakes that you're just taking chances you're not doing something fucked up exactly yeah there's a lot of mistakes that are most important things that you're ever going to do in your life some of the failures that I've had over the years have been like the motivating factors for success times a million like if I done well instead of just failed miserably maybe I wouldn't gotten so excited about picking up the pieces getting my shit together again you know I think that some of the the biggest fuck-ups I've ever had or like the most motivating factors in my life yeah you know I think people need to hear that ma'am we're definitely for mine you know one of the biggest mistakes I made was to get involved with selling cocaine yeah you know but it's been one of the property of most educational things in my whole life you know I spent in the whole game I spent about 28 years you know selling it for eight and in the 20 years I did in prison so it was a big chunk of my life that I spent in that game but I learned so much from that that uh man I couldn't I wouldn't give it back for nothing it's a fascinating thing isn't it just the life that you think you're gonna live when you're a kid watching TV shows the actual life that you've lived for all these years yeah it's it gets very strange doesn't it it does it does it does now you I know you're in the middle of some sort of a court case with this dude who's stealing your name what where does it stand right now oh we have a trial date right now against Warner Brothers we go to trial August 27 just come from court for that right now yeah can't talk about it right but you know I'm not gonna give up you know no matter what they do you know they throw all these lawyers at me you know if they tried to give you a settlement or has anybody tried to would you ever license your name if you want like like hey I get 30% of everything you do I don't want to you know but at the same time you know I'm really tired of dealing with with this issue you know maybe good license it openly on the internet a lot of people can become a burden yeah I will make it a website you reckon Lud the internet would Rick Ross's if you did like as a PayPal thing where it's only five bucks and for five bucks you could use the name Rick Ross so all these people's Rhett web sites like the newest of the new Rick Ross and like obvious like white dudes with red hair pretending to be the newest Rick Ross because they think they'll eyesand that for five bucks and then that shit becomes a joke and then he becomes a ridiculous person you know you know I might ride that man and he probably make a lot of fucking money and by the way the other people how long they're gonna keep using that name like a week they're gonna jizz gonna fuck around you don't think the whitey might adopt it forever a lot of people would though Miller and tattoo it on him ISM their problems but at least one at least one who would tattoo it on him did you see that crazy girl who met a dude for 24 hours and then had him tattoo his name on her face yes that was the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my life let me find the pull of the picture when you can is it's unbelievable yes it was in Russia or something like that yeah her whole face was this dude's name like hurled the whole side of her face he tattooed in giant black letters his name Wow yeah whoa I might try to find out a thing no that's not yeah it's not good not a bad idea you can be mom you won't quite see anything licensed the use of the name Rick Ross it cost you five dollars the only problem with that is then it sets a precedent and then the the rick ross rapper goes well I'll give you five bucks shit alright look at this look at this this horrific tattoo this girl guy on the left in the right side of her face that's unbelievable she was dead there car wrecks this guy just tattooed his name across her face and this photo looks like she was a pretty girl oh she was beautiful they had a picture of her before the the tattoo it's crazy what was she thinking about I don't know she's nuts and look at the good-looking guy he's got tattoos all over his face oh look at how she was really ready to throw that scroll back up again this guy is a just letting her dress he looks Michael baby letting her dude he did it to her he's it he tattooed her what a jerk he's not a nice guy well makes me mad world's fucked man there's at least one dude who will tattoo your name on their knuckles we've been trying to go you've been out try that yeah let's not try that until after the settlement after the settlement after Rick in evidence he's gonna have to pay you is inevitably gonna have to pay you but when he pays you what does he do does it become rosy does he change his name and just become Rosa and that's his new he uses he sort of got like a escape identity right he sort of got a bit of an escape identity with that other name right yeah yeah yeah he came up with that to offset it's not a bad move he should really commit to that I think he should commit to it to his real name I mean you got that proud of it yeah you know you guys still around you didn't come to a concert that's my son of deer and if he's built like his dad does dad probably around I would change my name to r2 r2d2 no just r2 r2 Rick Ross - just our - yes that's kind of hit RR dos the whole thing's a mess man it is it surreal to you I mean how does it feel like to have a guy that you see on the cover Rolling Stone magazine you see your name on it and you just like what is the work when you know what it kind of lets me know that I did accomplish something in life right I mean you know when people start naming themselves after you you know you came right you did it so it's such a fascinating way because you did it first of all you avoided violence and then you got out and then learn how to read went through through jail and everything and then you came out and you like this peaceful person it's like you managed to avoid like a lot of the negative karma and negative repercussions of that situation but you also managed to keep that that name I mean you you are Rick Ross you're the real Rick Grimes no really I heard about you before you went to jail or heard about you in the news yeah yeah fuck yeah yeah a long time ago I think I wasn't we know what I used to believe when I was in the drug business I believed I was under the radar I didn't think people know about me right because I see use fake names yeah you know to hide myself right when I go around people who didn't know me you know how my friends would call me hey Charlie a joke all the time different names yeah yeah yeah yeah you know because you don't want nobody knowing your name because the body knows your name now they can tell the cops hey right that guy's the guy that's the guy right there Rick Ross oh right no we would go to clubs and stuff like that people would call me anything but Rick Ross you know now when you found out when you I guess you said you were in jail when you found out about the whole connection to the iran-contra scandal yeah how did you find that out well for the folks who don't know well wasn't even given the look in will write down run down well it was my lawyer you calls me when I mean I call my lawyer one day and we talking about my case and he tells me he says man this reporter calls me and since he got some stuff for us uh but he's not gonna give us what he got us and we give me what we got you want to talk to him I'm looking at a life sentence so I'm like man I got nothing to lose right tell him to come on down what are you gonna do you can't do no more than already done so he comes down we start talking and he's telling me about how menacing is bigger than you and you don't know what she was into and then all of a sudden I'm thinking like wow cuz I just went through the thing with the crooked cops you know right at least here if there was planted drugs and still in the money and had the houses you know in Arizona River and and whatnot right so I'm saying be here maybe these might be DEA agents and it's crooked right so uh I don't know so then all of a sudden we go to trial we start trial and then he doesn't give us the information but what he does is he started to ask questions to my lawyer and he starts to talk about Ronald Reagan and Enrique renew tears and the Nicaraguan Contras in them like the Nicaraguan Contras welcome so I go back to my cell I start studying what was the Contras you know who is Enrique remuda and in the whole nine yards he still doesn't tell me I don't find out the whole scoop until his newspaper drop when his newspaper dropped in the San Jose Mercury News I'm on the front cover and it says that the CIA backed army was selling drugs to me which they was I knew you know a new blend um but I didn't know he was working with the CIA I mean like Dan the guy I'm working with you should have told me we could have really liked it really got it in right so that's when I first found out that was my first I had a lot of people you know they don't believe me when I tell them that I had no knowledge but I had absolutely no knowledge that he was a CIA operative it's crazy that the people that busted you were not aware of your whole situation they were not aware of who you were making money for no well so that just shows you how much chaos is in that whole world of black ops we don't know that drug that drug businessman is it's it's so big you know and I'm not just saying from the street level but from four DEA you know I watched a documentary about two weeks ago I spoke at a church in Compton and they had some cops on there and were saying that these cops wouldn't investigate homicides because you get a better promotion by investigating drugs if you want to if you want to go and be the captain of the station you don't go to homicide if you are homicide you want to switch to drug enforcement because that's where they were given all the promotion to tie up that story for the folks who don't know the story or listening to this for the first time what he was saying was that while he was selling drugs hid the money that he was earning with the selling the drugs that the drugs were actually coming from the CIA which was using that money to fund the Contra army right right against the Sandinistas that was backed by Reagan so you north yeah Reagan over and all that stuff that was on trial the iran-contra trials that Oliver North you know they say Oliver North might be coming out speaking now really yeah so you should get on this you know really speaking about what what's he's gonna tell the truth but everything he's gonna come clean uh well guys told me that he's doing a documentary and uh when the producers were saying he's interested in having me in his documentary oh my god so you already know what I'm gonna tell him yeah yeah you're gonna be in it how do you not sit down and tell your story to that guy that's a fascinating situation yeah so I mean I would be the last link so he was the guy that would he was a big part of the organization of the whole thing well he was the guy that bit that dealt with the White House you know it stopped it out of a North Wow you know it didn't go to bush in in in Reagan out of a North stopped it at him I still have an ollie north for president t-shirt I didn't even know the story I was like fucking 16 or something I thought he was bad motherfucker I mean you know he was trying to say to country yeah the idea behind it though is fascinating the way they chose to do it it just shows you that that is that the most ridiculous conspiracy theory you could ever come up with the CIA is selling drugs in the ghetto and then they're using that money to fund illegal Wars you know it's crazy how do I keep getting mixed up in these types of situations right I got the craziest rapper in the world right you've got an interesting like my friend take my name yeah and then I was involved with out of the norm yeah I mean that is one of the craziest drug stories ever and the fact that you got out of it completely unscathed I mean how many dudes are even still alive that you were in business with 20 years a lot of my friends are dead must be right a lot of friends a day a lot of in prison with life sentences Wow and you know one of my goals is to change those laws and bring those guys home because you know I don't think a guy should do 30 years he didn't kill anybody yeah I agree with you 100% and more so I think that we need to reevaluate what's legal and illegal in this country because we got a we have a corrupt series of politicians that have been bought off and have put a bunch of laws in place and have allowed people to sell all kinds of shit that kills people all the time and people voted to let make marijuana legal and they still won't yeah they voted to make it medically legal it's even the legal the legality of its statewide in Colorado and Washington State's company questioned federally you know that I mean there's a bunch of gangsters running this country and they're not nice people and a lot of the shit they're doing is stupid and it's unnecessary and you know we want a government we want a police force we want a fire department we want a president we want all that shit we just don't want the corruption that comes with it almost inevitably and it's unfortunate but your story is a perfect example of how fucked the whole system is the fact that the CIA was absolutely selling drugs right I mean they're selling it through you the guy well I can't say that they wasn't actually selling it themselves right it was their operatives that was selling it so these guys they made it very clear what it when I wasn't an agency I yeah he wasn't hating well that's how they make it he was just on our payroll yeah see the difference I guess you'd be on the payroll you can get a check on the CIA but you're not a CIA agent yeah it's not without he's not CIA he's just CIA it's a it's a fucked up world I I had hoped that when Obama got in and he represented something different and maybe he does maybe it's just it's so hard to change that it takes a long fucking time to turn anything oh my phone was popping OH takes a long fucking time to turn anything around but it's it's not want to find is he gonna do anything for the hood yeah well no now's the time right he's got reelected exactly and they voted him in you know the hood came out good don't vote right yeah but they came out for Obama yeah twice yeah so you know we opened it uh did he'll you know take this time and do something put some programs in the hood yeah yeah and like I said one-tenth of what's used to blow up other countries to change everything radically we could have an incredible nation if we started focusing our resources on on putting money I mean it's if we spend so much money in rehabilitating cities after we invade them you know how much money do we spend in Iraq how much money as Halliburton made but how much money did when they do it on money hookers gasoline yeah love shit man listen I got to wrap this up thank you very much for coming by again and if
