sometimes everybody wants to go home they want the party to be over and you want to come I love Jesus service I love gene Simmons too but that fucking Weaver's gotta go god it's getting really bad yeah you can see it's like old spider webs this is it's like the spy the worse the must is they just painted a black and put on his fucking head there's all rockers man nobody ever did that before nobody ever got old in front of us you know nobody was ever young and then it made it all the way to being like an old dude still doing the same act you know that never really happened before right I mean I guess it sort of happened in the 40s and 50s and shit but a lot of those dudes just died you know like Elvis died and Buddy Holly died and you know I mean not that many dudes just really I carry the with the jail yeah that's my boy right John Lennon got shot the beatles broke up George Harrison's dead you know it's just not not a whole lot of dudes that went all the way from the 70s all the way to today rocking out doing the same thing you know well they're the Rolling Stones man they're still fucking pulling it off right books still pulling her off still going to Brazil and banging tens is it didn't he just like have a baby or something Mick Jagger bro let me tell you something he's got 19 more babies in a little sports bag motherfucker they decided bro what he he tricked his own wife yeah his own are in another country she's like well I go he's like bitch check the flag print I said okay I paid that guy eight dollars shit don't work is that legit can you do that I don't think that way jagged did it he's toss to prank listen bro big Jagger's were the best business bit of my time but I was living a boulder they played Boulder at the stadium it was like a three-hour delay like a month late I was telling us of people to like dog Mick Jagger showed up I see that the tickets was still had be behind the stage you didn't give a fuck that they could see I can go in those days do you sell those tickets really he made them sell out those fucking tickets it couldn't even see this to get them for Half Price we gotta get something wow I'm so fuckin business with really fuck yeah three hours late to your saddle Ken how do you know that it was him was his decision then the fucking was the businessman he was last of all he could spit you have a mechanic's hat on well is it from the new movie yeah but I'm supporting the old one respect you see I wouldn't fucking watch them with my balls of this loyalist watching our plane it was yeah it was ok it wasn't bad I like that dude I like them Tobin a little Charles Bronson you know yeah that's the problem then when you can't do it what we do mean you play a great assassin if you call it the mechanic and then you have sort of the same sort of plot twist you know he takes on a protege and it didn't make sense that he took on a protege in this movie in Charles Bronson's movie Charles Bronson seems like legitimately troubled this guy seemed like all of a sudden he's breaking his own rules and he's hanging out with his dude just cuz he killed his dad but without fuck and it didn't it didn't I didn't buy it in the Charles Bronson movie I thought it was troubled it was a bad mother fucker dude when he was doing hard times he was like 50 you know that when he did that fuckin cage fighting movie remember that shit fuck yeah he was like 50 years old me to them thanks for doing the podcast but yo later oh bam podcast is over alright spear you know you and Bryan how little hissy fit how you think you guys recovered from that's not a his foot no wasn't mostly it was just the point was that you need to trust the people they do stuff around no matter what even a few trust but people don't know we're talking about they they had a psychedelic adventure to save develops you do looks like it doesn't be in a place where you feel comfortable yeah like podcast yes six comedian comedy being smoking at the UFC and then doing edibles at USC to then then move up to feeling comfortable enough in this environment where I can do a sit I wouldn't do that my first so I second here's my plan announced right here okay I'm having a scavenger hunt for edibles I don't know how to do it yet yes anybody guys I know how I'm gonna do it but there's gonna be some way that if you find a phrase and come find me and say whatever the phrase that is like president is amazing whatever it is I'll be like boom there you go have a good trip I think you are at early on grossly underestimated the power of the podcast you're fucked right now you're fucked man all right scavenger hunt and officers of the law would be able to easily do that hey I am the secret word is I'm a cop and you're under arrest [Laughter] there's a rebel he's a practical regular unrest Thompson though there's no it was just fucking it's fine nobody's gonna curse on this one we might get hurt but if you're one of those guys we're gonna figure out a way just scavenger hunt and if I leave clues tape don't be the do shit fucking rips them off because I have to think that through right right so the first clue to know what else we got it yeah you can't do that you can't cheat because maybe you should have some rules yeah gotta have a way to I get it their neck non-stop yeah well it'll make like go to this concession stand the third say the safest way to do it is to hide the stuff somewhere to say that you're gonna put it like go to some like shirt and put it like under the skull t-shirt and then Twitter it Twitter where you put it and then leave oh oh oh I thought it was like I thought he didn't have it that way but you actually just find a thing I had like Jonah's caption for clue this little took you there that clue takes you there and then that gives you the prize but then yeah surprise is kind of complicated for stoners so just where it is if you just decide to take brownies and insert them in places like there's the gayest cowboy boots on the face of the earth they're in this store yes I'm like that reach inside you find those yeah and then come my I had my mind that they would come up to me like to see who they were just flushing dude but you know what fuck it you tell me you know we say aye I've heard it if you go to that store you can find the gayest boots in the world and inside that boot is a brownie could just be a rumor to say that that way you'll absolve yourself of any criminal not know just that's the word the word on the street is is a brownie in those gay cowboy boots you know whatever something like that I see a purple plant all right all right got a plan folks July 2nd shits going down talking monkey is not in love with [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] ya another beautiful day in Southern California and I'm with my pal Duncan Trussell hi we just got done doing the podcast and you introduced me to the Whitest Kids u know the pledge of allegiance yeah Pledge of Allegiance Whitest Kids u know check it out fuckin genius subversive shove this into the that into the podcast we'll get to probably get in trouble for it oh good talk about one it's so good that I think the widest kids you know will probably be dead within a week really I think they're they're planes going down don't think you look if you're on a plane with the widest kids you know get off yeah get off freak out have a freakout yeah I'm going to jail it's worth going to jail stay alive it's brilliant though the the Pledge of Allegiance thing it's fucking amazing it's perfect it's like talking about how creepy it is having kids recital I tell you anymore it's just it's all yeah it's good check it out do we always go to some crazy deep ass fucking weird place when we do this yeah yes but you don't do that that much on your lavender hour right well it yeah it did not as much as we do on this I don't do this that much anywhere these kinds of conversations like I'll have them with Natasha we're not recording stuff but I don't have them on all the time I'd probably be in a hospital or something these are the kind of Kyle ivg pushing a cart down awesome Sriman me yes screaming what is it about this podcast that brings it out in you and makes you have these crazy conversations with us it's probably combination of the super strong marijuana you put cats in the coconut water yeah its nature coming together yeah it's some sort of a weird concocted combination of chemicals and events yeah maybe it's your tattoo maybe like a you get sucked in t tattoo oh that's this one okay Susan could all sleeved up you take the pain I can't take the pain man I just I don't know I don't know what to put on my arm I can't make the decision I changed my mind see much Nikola Tesla with a bottle that's a great idea man but the part this is why I don't attach to here's what I don't attach to it why Nikola Tesla fucking that pigeon that he loves something no cuz you gotta explain it to everybody it creates a talking point for strangers well if you ever break up with your check you go you got something right yeah slap that thing down at the bar my girls we go what is that fucking a pigeon yeah well you don't know the Nikola Tesla story honey yeah that's exactly how I operate I happen to have a DVD in my fanny pack why it's amazing I did a thing called drunk history and HBO you might have seen it yeah here check can we put that on the podcast the drunk history can we show people that well it's on YouTube I don't know if you can it's not mine so probably not it's a visit HBO we just stick it in here and put it on YouTube it's on youtube if you embed a youtube link just YouTube's drunk history Tesla but it's not see this is the beginning you they got their fingers in you now it's true yeah stroke once we started getting on Sirius and you know in the end bringing in lawyers but I think lawyers what scares me I think about with our plans to move this to some sort of a cable television format I don't think we're gonna lose much as long as we continue to do it exactly the same way you know I think it'll be a little bit more complicated because it'll be on a set instead of in my house but look at it sucks restored in my house too well yeah do you both yeah that can't stop me you get out one that's on TV and one and a censored we could do that we do it one day a week on on towers and then the other days a week do it here totally the keys to just keep doing it the key now seems to be when you you approach all the social networking stuff and you look at like how it's helped people in the past like Dane Cook and he's the master of it obviously and you look how it helped him it was a slow build and slowly built to the point where it's sort of you know took on the life of its own I think the model you should follow for you that was not Bangkok I think it's David Koresh it was a slow pose for him too but you're gonna have it terrible ATF fuckin studio why what are we doing wrong I don't know yet starts off with some ideas man dude I'm not looking over there I'm gonna get high and we'll go to movies I want to get high go to movies and overthrow the government work I don't imagine running the government I love I love this country I love to govern the United States of America I left police officers I love Authority and I don't want to do anything mean to you guys and I love you please don't kill me that's it that's the end of this video blog Shazaam bitches this three in one week I hope you liked it oh shit mix it up al Madrigal is just on the podcast ladies and gentlemen that's great I've known al for at least 10 years right yeah they do more 10 years right seven years yeah dude we smoke pot in your friend's apartment it was Mike we did like this eating sounds yeah this was the non-assertive Oh Pro didn't have control of her own destiny this was the Oprah that really was just like interviewing like KKK members and stuff and people would sit in folding chairs it was like old school Oprah were you a huge color purple fan or no and everyone just like Oprah shop that dude that gif of her taking the piss in color purple I would I would love to meet that Stedman character and hang out with him and find out what's going on was i insane what did she do for companionship she's got a beard a girlfriend yeah with her man that girlfriend that Gail chick her boyfriend her girlfriend yeah I think so a lot of people do I pick and then that other dude that Stedman guys like hanging around who knows who gives a fuck it would be sad well maybe that would be cool man what if she came out what if she retired her show and then came out that was kind of funny I think she's I think she's dead it doesn't matter she's not gonna ruin your career no no no I think she's fantastic I love Oprah but there is always information for Oprah I think Oprah is very positive man I listened to her herself that's a pretty positive look man like I said not everyone is out magical not everyone is you not everyone's me there's different people that have different tastes I like watching professional pool you know but most people think is probably the most boring fucking things in the world to watch I'll never say what's you know what anybody should shouldn't like but I recognize that for people like Oprah for women that are like of like age and you know and like interests and like she's fucking that fantastic guru yeah she's uh she's majestic and she those those women they found a voice they found someone who just really not just relates to them but elevates them and gives them something where they feel like they belong to there's gonna be a big void who's gonna fill it well magical watch put on a dress out there let's do it together don't have to put on dress wear dresses and we'll pretend with women and we won't even address it don't give up recipes I've even cut that out cuz it's not funny yeah minivan men.com al Madrigal Maz Jobrani who else is on crisp ensign crisp ents are beautiful you can't you can't miss it get that shit if right now it's on just minivan men calm eventually it'll go on iTunes and you could fall out on Twitter al magical a LM a dri gee al it's my buddy Oprah I'm out they gotta be quoting Joe [Laughter] come on kids I got European journalists to strangle the fuckin the Italian something race shit down you sit into the cinders like who's the show everybody your song here mr. huge name Weiner that busted yeah what does he do yes like father's on Twitter now what nice has anybody ever actually landed a girl by sitting reporter yes sure that's what they're doing I met her I think it's about yeah so you got the same question career but everyone goes no no and he goes it's all about swinging at a lot of pitches it doesn't matter if you you strike out your swing that I got a buddy of mine so I can even fuck anything yeah and for every disgusting girl he would land and he would - Super Mario because he was first in he's like what there's a long yeah I have a buddy who is not an attractive guy but he will hit on you never know [Music] if I did it today if I did it today it'd be different to because I'm a different person I'm a different person there was just four or five years ago you know I think I'd be better at it today like I'm I have more patience you know especially fear factor yeah if I start doing fear factor again I have more patience with people I think than I ever had back then which is ridiculous when you think about it yeah but I'm excited I think it'll be fun I don't know I don't know if it's gonna happen I think it'd be interesting but I'm so fucking busy right now between UFC and their comedy and writing and doing this podcast and all these different things that I love you know I love doing all of them so it's hard to think about doing something else I do think though if you do do it it would help all your other things though and so it would make all the other things better you know what also feels like it feels like it you know it was all of our babies you know that show was all of our babies but the you know but to me it was like I was there for every fucking one of them yeah I mean there was I there's 148 episode I was there the whole thing so I feel like for me it almost feels like yeah someone else is doing it's like someone is wearing my condom yeah it's not like someone's fucking my wife but it's like someone's wearing my condom like you doing it your way I guess but hey yeah we feel real weird but right now it makes me focus a douchebag for doing the man show you know because like for Jimmy and Adam that's really so if that came up again and someone said we should do the man show now and I've never in a million years write to it I was delusional well you're stepping into a machine with that show weren't you and you yeah you didn't really have room to take it over no they wouldn't they wanted it to fit like in their model of what it was and so glamour you compromise you know the two ideas together smash and it's just it's gonna suck it's gonna be mediocre and that's what it was but we should have done in the first place but I should have done is contact with them and see if they really had a problem with it the way we were led to believe it's like that they don't care they're done with it did you ever ask them yeah yeah yeah Jimmy Kimmel had some some strong words about the producers and how it all went down and he was very upset with how they went down and he sent me a little letter yeah that's the nature of things in general men they crumble the the systems fall apart the way they had it organized it was destined to change and well and things you can't have the two different hosts doing a comedy show and have it be the same show I wonder if they're ever gonna release it on DVD or happening now was I just fat greedy like the idea of being able to do two TV shows at the same time was like that's ridiculous to actually do that you know and then the idea of also being able to do something comedy wants because it then it was a little weird doing fear factor because I was like you know a huge for some of the people don't even know I'm a comedian yeah when I'd say I would be appearing somewhere they'd be like what's he doing here factor girl yeah my boy works the Joe Rogan experience [Music] [Applause] hold that shot in there hold that hold that got something and then please help me [Music] [Applause] [Music]
