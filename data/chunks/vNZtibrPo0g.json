boom and we're live how are you brother what's going on I'm cold it's good to see you pull this sucker up to you boom I'm so good I'm very excited about your fight man very excited no it's excited as I am not to be I'm sure what how often is it that two undefeated I mean you're not a heavyweight champ because they stripped you but you never lost two undefeated heavyweight champions go at it like this this is a huge fight very much so it's never ever happened before ever it's pretty exciting someone throws big easels I've never ever fought each other what do you think of mean for people who don't know you're fighting Deontay Wilder who's an American undefeated knockout artist and you are probably one of the more interesting guys in the heavyweight division not just because your personality but your skillset the way you move your long and tall but you've got a great footwork and you're fast you know it's a very very interesting fight as far as like boxing technique its power raw power versus boxing skill two guys one six four nine one six foot seven both charismatic both talkers one British one American it doesn't get any bigger than neccessity biggest flight that could be made at this time in the heavyweight division are in the world of boxing when you watch Deontay Wilder move around there's nobody that moves like that guys so odd like it reminds me of Bambi on ice it doesn't really find his legs underneath him sometimes he throws and he's got no legs underneath them he's just he's swinging in literally he's flying through the air as he's punching I've seen him fall over a few times as well listen the guy tries to on my big pumpkin yeah when you're trying to knock people out with every single punch then if you miss it becomes a problem and you go off balance I maybe fall over yeah well you impress with him and Luis Ortiz fine I was impressed with him because he came back yeah and he was losing all the rounds I only gave wilder the rounds like knocked Ortiz down in so he done well it was his acid test so to say come through Ortiz is 49 years old all be least at least OBE was pasties past like is prime age but still undefeated champion coming in so it was a great victory for Deonte world and he proved to me that he can get combat get her to come back and win a fight yan Ortiz comes from that Cuban system he's got great skills and he's looked fantastic in every single fight other than that fight up until that moment that he got hit yeah look you can't go swimming and not get wet yet he's had over 300 amateur fights 20 odd professional fights nearly not tomorrow but if I may be critical of Luis Ortiz at this minute he stood in front of Deonte while the right in punching range which is not a wise decision considering a guy's at 39 chaos yeah he's movement he was trying to move a little bit but he he was on old legs and I know a story what happened before that fight Luis Ortiz had very bad blood pressure and doctor was gonna pull him out and he had Charles Martin on standby but he said no I need the money so we went in a fort anyway and he still nearly beat Wilder yeah high blood pressure hmm that's interesting where were you hearing this from good sources good source yeah those are the best always the best inside info you're an interesting story man because not just because your personality but because you're you've come back from mental illness and you're very very open about it yeah you know I think that's it's that's a very unique thing where I remember when you when you beat Klitschko and won the title and then you kind of went off the rails and I thought you were just partying you know when I heard about it I thought well I made a shitload of money became the heavyweight champion all the pressure and the press and all the craziness but it was more than that it was more not it started off like I'd suffered with mental health problems my whole life but I didn't know what it was because I never had no education on the matter it wasn't till after the Klitschko fight a very massive high then I had two other even worse although lowest low that anyone could ever have I'd wake up and I think why did I wake up this morning this is coming from a man who had everything money fame glory titles a wife a family kids everything but I felt as if I had nothing I felt there was an empty gaping hole that was just filled with gloom and doom and it just was one bad thing happened to me after another within seven days the IDF stripped me of their title because I couldn't defend against koskoff he was a nobody because I very much close to flawed to me but the IBF wasn't expecting me to beat Vladimir so they took that clause in there anyway thinking flooding me is gonna when able to defend against glass cockpit because I warned they they stripped me of the belt we said none of my reason within seven days of the fight yeah that's insane yeah how can they require you to fight with in seven you know they didn't but they required me to go into negotiations so just not going into negotiations to sign they stripped it within seven days yeah well they knew I couldn't go into negotiations because there re much closed so I was stuck in between a rock and a hard place and that's what happened that was one belt gone and then my team and the Klitschkos team were carrying on about where the flight was gonna be was gonna be on a cruise ship in Dubai it was gonna be here was gonna be there Times was dragging on a cruise ship a cruise ship yeah there was some ma'am are a billionaire who wanted to make this fight an exclusive fight for him and his buddies no yeah come on seriously this flight was heading for a cruise ship that fucking oil money man there's some money focus and if they can afford it do it that's what I say that would have been the most hilarious scenario ever for a world heavyweight title fight a bunch of Arab billionaires on a cruise ship Wow so they strip you of the IBF belt you're going to negotiate with Klitschko for the rematch I'm the rematch never happened very much didn't happen initially because I went over on my uncle in training I was in Holland training for the rematch and I was running up on the heavy terrain and I went over from ankle sprain my uncle quite badly so we had to postpone the fight but but the timer was off like say three months getting his ankle right and all up I just I just didn't want to do any morphine army I didn't have the desire the fire wasn't burning no longer to fight and our suffering with depression the whole time even in training come before I sprained my ankle I was depressed as the press could be on a daily basis I think why am I feeling like this I don't have no reason to feel like it some people will say oh well II to attention-seeking or whatever but unless you've experienced what I'm saying it's sort of impossible to understand where have been aware I've come from and he just went from bad to worse I hit the drink heavily on a daily basis I hit the drugs I was out all night partying with women overnight and not coming home and you know I didn't care about boxing I didn't care about living I just wanted to die I was gonna have a good time doing it while I was doing it I used to drink and take drugs to get away from the depression because when I was drunk or high then I wouldn't I wouldn't think about being depressed or fall above in a boxing champion or imma feel great but as we know when the drink wears off it only leaves you with a bad hangover and feeling even more depressed for someone who suffers with mental health the worst thing we can do to escape is take drugs or alcohol but yeah that's the most common approach that's the common approach because people we don't know because it's not spoke about and this is why I want to spread the word on mental health so when other people are in this position in the future they know where to go and they know what to do because there's a blueprint well kudos to you for doing that because so so few people have the courage to talk about their struggles when they go through that because it seems like a weakness yeah you know it's it's very powerful that you're willing to do that and just be open and honest about it there's a few people out there that are doing that now you know our friend Mauro Ranallo he's gone through some some serious mental health issues and he's very open about it and talks about it quite a bit now when you were training for the first Klitschko fight for the fight rather did you have it then not really no but I was set focused on what I wanted to do and that was beat wladimir klitschko and I believe when you've got a goal in mind all from being a child all your life and you do that then I was like I was lost it was almost like I didn't have anything more to do me life although I could have carried on undefended the belts and whatever I wasn't really interested in doing that I'd beat the man I've always wanted to do because when I was an amateur boxer I used to watch wladimir klitschko on TV as a World Heavyweight Champion and I always aimed he was my target to beat I want to finally beat him it was like climbing me Everest I didn't have anything more to prove and the fire was dead there was no fire I was forcing myself to fight and I always said I didn't want to be one of those people who just fought for money because there's plenty of people with money in the world plenty of them but who knows him and the reasons for me fighting it's not for money or or for belts or glory a fight because I don't know anything else I've always been a fighter from being born to be in 30 years old now it's all I love to do don't have any of a passion I've looked the Lord knows I've looked and if I had anything else that was go to her I could do I'd be doing it I just I tried retirement I was 27 I retired under the second man in boxing heavyweight history to retire unbeaten as a world champion like Rocky Marciano before me but it wasn't enough I was like I am lost without this fight game I tried golfing I tried clay pigeon shooting I tried four by four in I tried going to strip clubs bars restaurants everything and it was just like I had this emptiness inside where I just wanted to fight well in comparison to what you've accomplished everything else has to seem pretty dull I mean into you step into the ring with Vladimir Klitschko who was widely considered to be one of the greatest heavyweights ever and you box his face off I mean that was a beautiful performance it was and shut him down it was weird it was weird to watch him it's like there was moments in that fight where he just he just looked like he didn't know what to do with you I'm gonna say again on December the 1st like I said to Vladimir I said the same thing to Deontay Wilder you fought the Americans you fought the Mexicans you fought the Europeans but you ain't never fought the gypsy king before I said it straight to Vladimir I said you're looking at King I said whoever for King before he said no I said we fight him on now and he said you're gonna lose 2-1 well he's lost before but he's lost because he got clipped and hurt and stopped and I was very impressed with him actually in the Anthony Joshua fight because he came back from getting badly hurt and almost put Joshua away but the fight with you is different because you just how boxed him and he was known as the guy who would box and hold jab and hold I mean he was one of the most boring heavyweights of all time fantastically successful but from a spectator point of view he watched some of his fights like Jesus Christ he would jab you grab you jab you grab you I mean that was his thing right hand grab you it worked at twenty five title defenses I mean it was very successful but that shit didn't work with you it didn't for the first time in his whole career he was fighting somebody who was not just bigger than him but more athletic who could move more yeah someone he wasn't just looking for one lucky punch I knew going into the flooding Mia flight there everybody all the rest of the opponents and twenty five men before me but all when in trying to do the same thing try to knock him out and he's got he's got something of a weird defense where he puts both arms out in front of him and it's almost very awkward to London that chin were big punchers so for I'm not gonna do that I'm not gonna make that mistake I'm gonna well box him I'm Romie team said this is not a good idea we're gonna go to Germany to try now box a super champion and try and win on the cards are you crazy I said yes I said but if I wasn't crazy I won't be great and I went over there now boxed him I'm nobody nobody apart from me brother or me father thought I could do it you know even people who were close to me and camp they were like they were very unsure of what was gonna happen and me being me I always had that little smile on my face cuz I believed it I believed I could always be flooding man Klitschko I even told Vandermeer years before when I was 22 I said I'll beat you one day Emanuel Steward told him to God rest his soul he said Tyson Fury is the heir to the throne he said when his time is ready he will beat you straight to him probably may hate you duck he hate any man you're talking about me like that but he done it evil way well I'm sure it was good fire under him during training as well now you you were focused for that fight you were you were prepared and afterwards was it just the realization that you'd accomplished incredible goal that said in the Depression was it you didn't know what to do next or was it just that your focus was now no longer on this unattainable you know like in almost insurmountable obstacle in front of you becoming the heavyweight champ of the world all sudden you did it then the depression kicks in yeah my conditioning trying to Christian he said to me before the Klitschko fight he said what will you do after you win I said probably be depressed for a long time he said what I said truthfully I was almost expecting it and I didn't think I'd ever box again even the day after the Klitschko fight Sky Sports interviewed me that the UK broadcaster he put it on and he said what's next for Tyson Fury I said I'll probably never box again I knew I said to me dad and me brothers before the fight a week before the fight I said win lose or draw I said this is probably gonna be my last fight because I knew the fire was going I didn't have that hunger anymore I had the hunger to beat Vladimir Klitschko but not to carry on and continue and I said I didn't want it to be about money or financial gain I wanted to be the best of my time beat the best man and that's what I did and I was a man of me word I didn't box again until two and a half year later I decided to make a comeback because I was sitting here 400 pounds drug addict an alcoholic by the way never took a drug in my life until I got to 27 really never not smoked weed not not nothing and what drugs what were the drugs of choice once you won the title cocaine was the usual one and that was it really cocaine and alcohol it's like roller coaster crazy drug drug and alcohol yeah but you know I look back on it now and I think what I changed that I wouldn't i'm not many people will think well this man's crazy for saying that on my radio show but i wouldn't change a thing because i know it was supposed to happen and i needed to be tested to see what type of character it was although I did all those mud things and I went for a wall that time and I tried to commit suicide and I how'd you try to commit suicide well I'll tell you what happened I like I said it was waking up when I didn't want to be alive I was making everybody's life a misery everybody was close to me was pushing away nobody could talk to me talk any sense into me at all and I'd go very very very low at times very low and I'd start thinking all these crazy thoughts and this thought the other and I was in me car I bought a bought a brand-new Ferrari convertible in the summer of 2016 and I was in the annals on the highway on this a strip of the highway where I am and I'm at the bottom of about a five mile strip there's a massive bridge that crosses a motorway and I knew that and I got the car up to 190 miles an hour I was heading towards a bridge and I didn't care what no one was thinking I didn't care about her to me family me me career people who friends anybody I didn't care I didn't care about nothing I just wanted to die so bad I give up on life and just as I was heading towards a bridge at 119 this Ferrari in a crushed like a coke come by the way fed of it it I heard a voice say no don't do this Tyson think about your kids think about your family and your boys and girls growing up and no father and everyone saying you're done was a weak man he left his he took the easy way out because he couldn't do anything about it enough before I turned into the bridge I I pulled on the moat when I was shaking I could feel myself shaking and I pulled over and I was all nervous and didn't ought to do one was frightened and I was so afraid and I thought that day I'll never ever ever try or think about taking me on life ever again and I didn't I wanted got help from her to lead in psychiatrist doctor in the UK I'm a dad were not with me and she said to me dad she said can I have a word alone with you John he said Jay me doc told me what she said when he came out she said he is not to be trusted alone he's an imminent death risk that's the highest level of suicide risk that she'd ever assisted and she said without his faith he would have been dead a long time ago but she said faith alone ain't gonna hold him because that's gonna break and once that goes he's done so that put me dad's life terror as well because he was checking up on me all the time he wanted to be with me 24/7 he was even sleeping in my house with me a married man before kids I was in the right state I just I just I I want it I just didn't want to live anymore and I had everything that man could want there wasn't nothing I didn't have but it meant nothing nothing meant and even I felt worthless I'm longer it went on the the more it it hurt inside no morals and everybody everybody gave up on me before family for I was definitely gonna die and I was gonna kill myself and after that I tried I was thinking to myself you know what I need to get better on each I need to do something but every time I tried to go to the gym I don't know the voice saying nah this ain't for alls anymore I'm not gonna do this I didn't want to do a drum I'd run 200 yards and pull up I won't even get am i laughing I can't be bothered I don't want to do this boxing is not for me I hated boxing at one stage in 2016 early 17 I wouldn't have done a boxing fight for this room full of diamonds no way I hated boxing I won't watch on the TV I won't read about it I hated boxing I've done it my whole life and I didn't want no part of it anymore um I was out drinking I didn't care give up taking drugs like I said and it come to a point was doing that for 18 months I mean life I was out 2017 Halloween I was a 400 pounds dressed up as a skeleton and I go to this fancy dress party in it I'm walking around then I'm thinking these are all young kids compared to me I'm 30 and I feel like I was the oldest guy in there like 29 I was like what am I doing here is this what you want for your life and I thought yourself this is not me and no matter how many people told me before this where I was going wrong walls doing you need to act to your life you can only change your life if you want to change it and I left and everyone said are you going over Lee said yeah I left at 9 o'clock I went home and I got back home I didn't say anything to the wyvern went straight upstairs into a dark room and I took bursts chief had skeleton suit off and I was sat there and I got me knees and I was praying and begging God to help me and at this point I'd never I've never begged or cried to God to help me before I prayed a lot all my life but I've never been in this physical state before I can feel tears running down my face my chest was wet with tears because I knew I couldn't do it on my own it was impossible for me because I tried and tried and tried and ended up back in the pub back drinking I almost accepted that that was gonna be my fate an alcoholic so I was on my knees in his bedroom after praying for about 10 minutes I got up and I felt the weight of the wall was lifted off my shoulders and for the first time in years I knew it was gonna make a comeback and I called my wife I said Paris parishes abort she fall I was drunk coming home from the pub I said Monday morning I start to regain mission to try and get the heavyweight championship of the world buck she said yeah yeah yeah because before this every time I'd offer beer I'd come back and I'm gonna be the heavyweight champion of the world again because it was it was the alcohol talking so I was like the man who called wolf a thousand times on this this stupid career that I was living on the past was thinking about years before glory days and after this prayer got off her said all right this is gonna be she didn't believe me one second or even when I speak to her now she says that night you told me that she said there a difference in your voice something happened next day I phoned up Ben Davison and I said I don't want to go back down the old route with the same trainer saying promote two same anything that's and everything's got to change as it's going to be a new Tyson Fury and we called it return of the Mack mission and also it went out that morning after phoning Bannen or arranging everything I went out for a room in my sweat suit out ad ambitions of running T miles I got about five minutes until man stopped and I walked and while I was walking if I can't run aunty farts 400 pounds before I'm gonna walk I'm gonna get out walk while I was walking I was flicking through on my phone on Instagram Anna sees this video of Deontay Wilder saying yep Tyson Fury's finally done that because the week before I've been a boxing show in Manchester or something and the press took a picture I mean it was like everywhere this big fat out of shape ugly bald and it bearded white as a sheet man I was like a state and they've done this video yep after seeing this evidence at Tyson Fury and finally know he's finished he could never come back and if he even if I water 40 min he's a day I don't knocked him out and before that he was talking about Mike Tyson now he'd not Mike Tyson now in the round and I thought myself that's very disrespectful to talk about someone who's not even from your era I'm gonna invite them and all that sort of stuff when there's no possible chance so for yourself at a fight you I'm gonna give it you for that reason and then when I saw this over video of him saying things about me and come back at nur he'd give me that much more motivation to return just so I can beat Deontay Wilder so I had all these court cases on as well I was being charged for have taking performance-enhancing drugs nandrolone swimming had never done I had I had none Jolanda me system it's produced naturally in the body but they say my levels were elevated the UK ad UK anti-doping said there was no case to answer but all of a sudden I on a big wad a case on me that took nearly three years to sort out and by and everyone said you're gaining Hotmail Donnie is on you getting a 12-year bum and I said you know well you twelve years not just for nandrolone I refused him as well I was in a bad mood one day and the drug testing people come in their gym and I've told them to fuck off this is when you were training for your comeback this was when I was out of training yeah when I was just all the time I was fat and out of shape I'm not training I was still being random drug tested by UK ad really that's why I tested positive twice for cocaine and everyone said no you never get in back the but the box and water control suspended my license in the UK for the cocaine use so I had a court case looking up banned banned forever basically spent ssin the doctor made me medically unfit to flight so that was after I forgot about that bit when I was rescheduling the Klitchko to fight this psychiatrist phoned up and she says look he is medically unfit he can't fight anybody don't want to live never mind fight someone was medically deemed unfit to box suspended by the boxing border control for the cocaine use and I had an underlying case on me I'm a refusal case and by the way it was racking up millions of dollars in lawyers face - but I was so confident that I was gonna everything was going to be ok because when I was down on my knees I just knew thought it was gonna be ok and everyone was like what's the point in training and doing anything with you when you're not you can't do anything you're not a musician to do it I said everything's gonna be alright don't worry court case comes along in December we go they say right this court case is drugged on insufficient evidence get rid of it we both agreed that we was gonna call quits on the case I go my way they got as they pay their legal fees I pay my legal face done that was the drugs case out the window finished the suspension I had a meeting with the Board of Control in the UK and they said look if you can get past medically fit by a doctor mentally then we'll reassess your case until then denied so I said right no problem phoned up the psychiatrist the same people who would who had spoke to all these doctors three or four different dr. Phil's doctor Jones whoever else said oh I need I need reassessing reassess me bang past flying colours I went back to the border control handed in my certificate by all these different doctors examinations physical and mental they said we have no choice but to give you a license reinstated bang so it was three the biggest obstacles in my life at once we're all done within a month or two straightaway then I just had the easy task of losing 160 pounds which if I could have got over all them other things losing weight as a fighter was something that I'd done natural anyway so then me and Ben set about losing this 160 pounds along the way back I'm spoke to Frank Warren he became me promoter Frank said right you've got a long time out the ring you've abused your body let's get you four or five comeback fights just so you're ready I said okay no problem healthy bomb comeback fight how'd the other combat fight I said the Frank I don't need any more combat fights make the world to fight now no no no no no he said let's have a couple more just in case I said I'm telling you make the wild to fight so this is where people don't understand I've picked the ante Wilder he didn't pick me I picked him well he needs a high-profile opponent right now because it looks like I mean I don't want to say that Joshua was ducking him but it looked like I'll say that yeah there's something going on he what who whether it's his management or his promoter they didn't seem to want that fight right away I know some quite close details on that Tara's the detail the details his wildest team offered Joshua's team eighty million dollars for a to fight deal fifty million dollars for the first fight and thirty million for the rematch if Joshua lost and they declined that and my lawyer Robert Davis he saw proof of forms from a layman so Eddie enemies Chum buddies can all say this suddenly over but I know the truth because proof of funds were seen do you think it's because of when Klitschko knocked him down and had him hurt they were worried about Deonte with his big power I don't think it's about Ava fighter it's bigger than that it's about money about keeping the money wrong keeping the golden goose laying them eggs looking after it don't take any risks Joshua's Olympic gold medalist and in the UK's a massive star he sells out stadiums seventy thousand ninety thousand huge star huge star so why would you want to get him beat by somebody who nobody's really heard of or even take a risk of it they took the risk in the Klitschko fight it almost didn't pay off right they scraped through skin of teeth but he don't hate fair play he got up off the canvas showed her champions heart to come back and knock out Klitschko fair play but since then the oven remotely stepped up at all they thought Joseph Parker and he didn't knock Joseph Parker it didn't even hurt Joseph Parker he fought Carlos tucum on a hard fight with him had a hard fight not fight so they're just keeping that money train going right and I don't blame him because this is the business at the end of the day mm-hmm and if I would cease management team I'd say stay away from fury stay away from Wilder and we'll just fight the rest of the people and keep making plenty of money why do we need to fight these guys who are very risky for this may be a little bit more than we're getting now two times more right but in the long run we could have five fights and not get beat by mediocre people who would know he's gonna be and get the same money or more so it doesn't make sense so this is why me and wild ever agreed to fight because at one time or another it's got to be more than about money we're fighters were worthy we're champions of the world of course we've made money in our careers now for 28 professional fight 27 professional fights I've made money it's most about more than money now surely if I spend the money I've already wasted and I'm stupid then 200 million would be no good to me because I'd spend anyway right my dad always has a fill and his money's very easily parted but that's another story for another day going back onto this fight we owe it to the funds to give him a proper fight of two so-called people who think they're the best let's proving it wasn't a hub negotiation thing or misty leaver were mean wild I hope you don't mind that Opie's team don't mind me saying that they were the most fairest most straight going people I've ever worked with there was no if buts or maybes where ever I asked for they agreed I'm wherever he asked for I've agreed to there wasn't no it was no hard negotiations it was very very simple I don't Wilder clearly seems to want to prove that he's the best I'm I've got her admiring fella I admire that as well I mean he's got a title he's undefeated he's smashing everybody they put in front of him yeah and he has a legacy on his mind he wants to leave a real legacy yes why looked to fight you yeah I believe that I've got to give Deontay Wilder a lot of credit and respect for that and admiration because he seems to be that he was the only man at the time before I was even come back who was willing to risk everything he's got to prove he's the best and isn't that what fighting is about where men wanna prove that the best of all the others no he's absolutely behaving like a true champion that's what I believe that's what fans want they want a guy like that and a guy like you aye aye aye I've gotta admire him because to pick me a six foot nine mover is slick and fast and can do awkward things that's awkward fight for him he could have picked much easier opponents and made similar money but he didn't he opted for the toughest one most Awkward test I respect him for that and I take me out off to him well I think this is gonna be a giant fight I really do because this is what everybody's been wanting for a long time it's so difficult to get people excited about the heavyweight division I mean Joshua's a giant fan in the UK but worldwide not so much not so much and Deontay Wilder even though he's had these spectacular results he needs that big thing to put him over the top the Ortiz fight helped but he needs something more to capture the real the the love of the American public the love of the world he says hasn't quite grabbed it yet he hasn't um I do feel sorry for him in a way because he has at 40 professional fights and knocked out nearly everybody he's holding he should be a huge superstar should be but he's not I go down the street wherever I am New York Los Angeles Big Bear and if I have 50 people who's Deonte Walden maybe one might even recognize a name and someone even said I recognized her name is he a ballplayer is he a hockey player I said no he's heavyweight champion about world it's crazy because he's a flashy dresser he's a great talker he knocks people into another fucking dimension he's a wild guy to watch fight he's very exciting it's just he's got all the he's just waiting for the big moment and maybe this fight is the big moment for one of you it is a do you think it's something to do with the heavyweight division has been in Europe for the last time 15 years yeah and been put to sleep I believe that to think the thing about Klitschko is even though he was very very successful and his style was amazing in terms of his success rate god damn those fights were boring to watch nobody gave a shit about those fights no outside Europe but in Germany it was a global phenomenon well they were just happy lived in Germany with speaking German he eats about 50,000 60,000 fighting yeah and nobody it was a wonderful investment for him I mean there no disrespect to him he's a great boxer for sure but boxing is its entertainment as well as sport especially for the casual person you know I mean if I watch a great boxer just just you know box well and play it safe I can be very impressed with that but the average person is not gonna be impressed you're not going to some pay-per-view dollars hundred percent no I can't sit here and pretend that most some of my fights have been the most exciting fights in the world because my biggest fight of my whole career was a 12-round snoozefest I'm man enough to say that I am a man of Nevada and I will tell you the truth I can't even watch that fight but it was not boring I didn't think it was it was two boxing people in no boxing they know how hard what I was doing is to do as a heavyweight and the skill and all up or let you say to the average Joe who knows nothing about box and he wants to see two big man punches shit out of each other it was a boring fight so that's why Joshua gets more credit for ease win over Klitschko even though he got put down and he knocked out than I did which God didn't love the glove on me because their fight was 50/50 and it was knocking lumps off each other but yeah my fight was like 8020 in my favor where I didn't get touched but that still was spectacular in weight while watching it as a fight fan first of all it was no disrespect to Klitschko but it was like finally finally somebody figured this dude out because there had been moments where people that you know tested him a little bit but it had been a long time before somebody had beaten him it all day I've been there 11 years yeah but that isn't always been my style boxing on the backfoot slip-and-slide Nala just two different opponents flooded me out dynamite in his right under regardless of his boring style or whatever if he made a mistake once in that fight you get knocked out Eddie chambers so many Samuel Peters everybody the list goes on and on and on everybody knocked out 65 knockouts and he would make you desperate because of that style cuz there grabbed jab and grabbed style people would get desperate and they would open themselves up and then get knocked OH and I didn't want to be on that list of knockouts but I've been I've been in fights where he's been total wolves for as long as the fight lasted I eat a Steve Cunningham fight 2013 I come over here or comfort it run straight onto an overrun right I'm down I was looking at Madison Square Garden roof the lights move off fuck me it's now back to the fire boy get up was Cunningham a difficult opponent because he was shorter than you Cunningham believe I'm not this gonna sound strange calling him was the hardest fight I ever did have him a whole career amateur or professional the reason being he was very slippery the way I explained Cunningham it was like a conga real all full of oil in front of me I couldn't pin him down he was light on his feet who's waiting 208 pounds of Sophie's away he was a he was a three-time cruiserweight champion of the world and he stepped up in two heavyweights he was a slick talented boxer and I tried to walk him down use me size and power but it's just out boxing me well I'm good at boxing moving slipping and sliding I couldn't do against Steve Cunningham because he was - he was quicker than me he was he was like it was a better boxer all round on me I couldn't do nothing with him I need knocked me over even though he was a light puncher supposedly what right onto it come from the back of the hall big overrun right right in the chin and the fall this is it US debut been knocked out I fought Tyson Fury get up and kick his ass so I go up and I just went straight forward at him and I thought no more boxing no I'm gonna hit him right on the body put them up through the middle of round the corners you might be a Don point for sooner or later I'm gonna get you and I did in Rome seven I felt him going weak cuz I was pushing him back pushing him back and he's hitting me gloves and hitting me face and hit me everywhere basically but I walked right through everything with me guard up after he got tired a.m. of a heavy body shot in round seven and he didn't recover and I pushed his head back an opt-in playing out with a right and that was the only time he was ever knocked out his career even to today it seemed like in that fight perhaps one of the more difficult things was adjusting to the fact that he was so much smaller than you six six foot three well sure yeah then you were just he took you a while to adjust to that like I say I'm not gonna make any excuses Steve Cunningham was about a box a very good fighter yeah in a small guy in for the heavyweight division but a very good fighter very good like I say the toughest money ever faced was telling him that's a high praise so when you decided that you were gonna make this comeback and you're dealing with all this these mental health struggles what did you do to overcome the mental health problems what did you do to overcome the depression like I say when I got up off that floor at a weight lifted off me and I had me mindset for the first time in two years that I wanted to do something again I think the way to beat mental health is setting goals giving yourself short-term and long-term goals and that's what I did that's very interesting I give myself a goal of losing the weight pound by pound basically I set myself a 10 pound target and I'd reach tightness that myself another 10 pound 15 pound whatever and I'd give meself little rewards and stuff I wasn't obviously eating junk food I was on a strict diet for six months but I was training twice a day six seven days a week but with the mental health I don't suffer mental health when I'm active when I've got a goal and I think most people will vote for this if you suffer mental problems you tend to suffer them when you're on your own when you've got a lot of time to think and when you're not doing much but when you're busy on a daily basis you don't have enough time to think about mental health and I figured out well if I exhaust myself in the gym I come on one I'm too tired to think about anything I just want to get some food and go to bed so that's why I do so you didn't use medication I didn't use medication know i was so i was prescribed with medication from the doctor but i refused to take it i took a couple of pills helped myself relax from the doctor but i never took him again i only ever talked a couple would they give you I think it was like I'd it was I have a diazepam I'll try as he pan or something like that semantide some antidepressant pill yeah but I've done research on him on I didn't like what I was seeing like and I knew my my grandfather me dance dad he was addicted to pills his whole life pills that didn't even do anything for him there was placebo pills without him econ function really so I didn't want to become one of them my granddaughter take pills and they didn't do anything to him but in his own mind he thought they were doing something calming him down hurt him didn't want to be one of them people there was a point in my life where I hand on heart thought I was gonna end up in a padded room that's how buddy was but it's fascinating that you're saying that setting goals and setting your mind on things and hard training his would set you back on track you know I don't know what you're like when there's no one in front of you but standing here in front of you right now I would say there's a healthy vibrant guy 100% I've never felt better mentally strong physically of training hard or fail fit as a fiddle you know I wouldn't be here if I was anything wrong with me but that's fascinating that most people think that to come back from a mental health issue like yours you need psychiatric care and you need medication and you're saying you did it with setting goals and hard work and the biggest thing we're missing here is I didn't I didn't do it with doctors and all them other things I don't it was way more powerful God so your faith in you believe me faith and belief that God will make me better made me better many faiths will think nonsense or whatever but I'm living proof well if you believe in something I mean just like you were talking about believing in pills that don't do anything belief is a powerful thing weather who knows what's behind that belief but what you're saying is so powerful that you just by virtue of changing the way you think about things setting goals working hard you lifted yourself out of the worst depression of your life to the point where you were suicidal 100% no never ever went back to that from this day to that and it's been been one of over 12 months that's pretty amazing I mean it's just to me it's a that's an amazing thing for people to hear because there's a lot of people that rely heavily on antidepressants and medication they think that is the only way for them to be happy and for them to be not suicidal not depressed they need that medication and for them to hear what you're saying I think is a very powerful thing it is well I'm no doctor I'm not gonna tell people to choke away your pills and right right but it doesn't do any harm what I'm saying give it a will give it a try can't hurt ya set yourself some goals think positive and crack on do a better training so from from accomplishing your ultimate goal Beatty Klitschko becoming the heavyweight champion and then falling into this deep funk do you think you had to go through all this to come back again I think so yeah I believe I was being tested to see what type of man I was him all to have a character I out and you know even before the depression I didn't appreciate things nothing nothing was value to me even something had worked hard for if I'd worked hard and saved up for a car just say for five minutes they'd be okay but then I won't want anymore was piece of shit so nothing mattered to me I didn't value anything anything that I had and I worked hard for and everyone knows like well I have his blood money because I pay for him him face my body gets punched two pieces for what I have so you think I'd appreciate things more than a next mumble I didn't appreciate nothing I didn't appreciate anything anything I adore achieved even World Championships anything I thought is that it your whole life yeah yes so I believe I was taught I was put down this to suffer all these things so I could understand while I add things good like today I'm up here that I'm breathing fresh air and I'm sat here in a mental mentally stable way of thinking I'm happy that I can go and enjoy a dinner and just be normal whatever that is mmm that's what I'm not before I'm one of the most probably the most unique people you'll ever meet I'm not I'm not orientated by material things and also it means nothing to me I don't even care about glory and honor I don't care about legacies I don't care about winning titles or or or medals doesn't matter but when I set my mind to doing something I'll do it and every single time I've ever set my mind to anything I've done it even the unthinkable things I've a set me mind to I've done it I don't care about one in what Deontay Wilder has in his position all over I only want to beat him in a fight that's it you all want to beat him because it's so difficult not just up because that's what I want to do I'll watch that's your fault set me goal beaten Deontay Wilder so do you think that that's the your future is just setting goals and constantly trying to achieve those goals I think I think I've got a bigger purpose now than boxing boxing to sport and swimming I've made a living out of for a long time but I think there's a bigger picture bigger than any win any titles bigger than winning any any fights any number of fights I think my calling card in life is to spread the word on this this disease a silent killer a killer that's so ferocious that you can't see it or feel it from the outside you could be suffering right now but I want me able to see it because I can't see into your mind it's just so unusual that someone has that solution that hard work dedication and setting goals is what lifted you out of the depression and made you appreciate life and made you appreciate all that all the aspects of it yeah I appreciate everything you know spending time with me family for granted before afar I expect I'm retama lit family anytime warm I couldn't put into words what I went through but let me just say I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy not I have any enemies but if I did I wouldn't wish on assault because I know how hard it is that I know a lesser person maybe not I've got four or maybe not a man without faith maybe would've took his own life now that you have gotten through do you feel like you have the solution now to navigate the rest of your life yeah I now know the secret for me and everybody's will be different but if I train every day and I'm staying shape then I'll be happy forever the time I stopped training the time I balloon back up again the time it all goes wrong again and I know that if you know something in your life and you don't do it and that's what I know it's like a diabetic if he goes makes a lot of sugar you know it's gonna make him out so we don't do it so as long as I always stay by them guidelines I know I'm gonna be all right that's how she wrote so as long as you love that's the other thing too right the alcohol in the drugs exacerbate any sort of bad state that you have because you're gonna feel like shit yeah I'm not teetotal right I've had a drink since I've been back I bet I've been out with a lot of drinks whatever and but your goals are still set and strong yeah but really what it is yeah so from now on you just have to continually set goals in your life set goals whatever them goals might be they don't have to be massive goals but they can be anything early anything that I want to do or I want to achieve or I want to go someplace or whatever and I work towards that and set myself a goal it's almost like a little treat or whatever it's fascinating because no one's ever really connected that I mean people people have made that connection in terms of like when they study happy people one of the things they find about happy people's their goal oriented people they set goals to accomplish those people but nobody's ever really set that as a remedy for depression and for mental health issues setting goals achieving those goals that's the key to keep it going I believe that's the case yeah after doing quite a lot of research on myself and experience in it and it works for me and I find it works for a lot of people I speak to he's got the same problems I get messages from all over the world from different types of sports people and different type of people ask him for information and help on how I I got free mind what I did and I'm happy I'm up here to help so if there's anybody out there who's struggling in silence which a lot of people are said I'm always here to help if I can what's such an impressive and inspiring message because you're doing it without medication you're doing it just through positive thinking through goal-setting and through healthy living that's right and I believe it's the best best way to live anyway best way to live is fit and healthy when you're out of shape and you feel unfit and you feel terrible and nothing's gonna go right for your book if you feel fit you feel good it's almost natural to feel depressed if your body is literally depressed if every time I go to the gym and do a little bit training whether it be a lot or little I always go out of a shower and I think I feel great now training sets off an endorphin in your blood it makes you happy contentment is a word we're looking for contentment doesn't come free materials tough jobs positions fame glory money anything contentment you'll never find contentment while you're chasing that's all stuff my message would be look around yourself and be thankful for what you do have today don't look for what you don't have you know you got to be happy happy with who you are and a wise man once said you got to know yourself before you can know anybody else sort of yourself try and understand yourself think what makes you happy and do that and what makes you sad don't do it it's pretty simple really if so it makes me sad no then I'm not gonna do any more tea that helped me life I don't want that and if you know some it's gonna lead you down the wrong way and wrong puffs in life don't do it simple very simple take self small time goals long time goals achievable and move on now how long did it take you for you lose the weight I started training in November 2017 400 pounds yeah I might run I got down to 275 pounds in my first fight back in June and by August and my second fight back I was 258 pounds I've maintained that weight - 62 58 that's your ideal weight yeah from there to now so what did you do differently with your diet like what did you I was eating oh I'm drinking a lot I just stopped all that sort of stuff like my weight wasn't put on through being a normal person eat normally my weight was put on through excessive drinking of lager hmm there's like 500 calories in one pint of beer and I'd wanna drink a minimum of 18 of those beers followed by whiskey vodka everything else then I'd stop off on the way oh man our pizzas kebabs chocolates it was excessive living if you put your body through torture you can't expect to feel great so what I did was a sari in Alfie not drinking and that was it really I just trained on a daily basis for a long period of time and at sensible and clean you have to cut everything out but if you want faster results and then you do it no you said you change your training as well what did you change up before I was doing a lot of em long running and long boxing works like 12 15 rounds on the bag pad work all that sort of stuff wherein while I was trying to lose the weight I was doing more short explosive stuff like I was doing short faster runs as fast as I could go basically I'll do more interval training and stuff like that mainly it was a focus and on diet though diets the most important thing for any anybody trying to lose weight you could train like a Trojan warrior but not eat correct and you go three steps forward and two and a half buck and you find yourself after six months a little bit less than you was but you stay in the same position because with the diet not that I'm a dietician but I know how I know it works with losing weight heavy because II all the way through me career upon a lot of weight loss just over a hundred pounds for Klitschko fight the first time round and I lost over on hundred and twenty five hundred and twenty something pound before that again so what I do to lose weight is they go on a no-carb diet so it'll be totally keto ketosis diet I put me body into keto shock and they say you should stay if you do nee keto diet you should only do it for eleven days I'd do it for six to eight weeks already somewhere my nutritionist yeah he said no he said you can only do this diet for eleven days has that have already been on it six weeks don't worry about ocean is done for years he goes it's a healthy way of living it it prevents diabetes and all these type of things as well there's definitely some benefits to it but there's concerns that for athletic performance that you should have higher carbohydrates true but at this time I was just focusing on losing weight the keto diet done correct it's okay but I was doing it dirty how are you doing it I was having four double parties with cheese and mayonnaise bad full of fat in Greece and it can't be good for your arteries coming I was having tons of meat fried fried or with cheese mayonnaise bacon eggs sausage whatever sounds good my ideal diet basically I think this can't be a die I'm not gonna lose like a mess and you lost weight I lost the weight I lost it all yeah you'd be stunned at what is actually healthy and what's not yeah I suppose you cannot go wrong if you're cooking meat what's in a meat well after they put in in the beef or whatever it is you're eating and processed foods are the ones that got all the other tips and all the stuff and processed foods and sugar and bread and carbohydrates especially refined carbohydrates what I figured out in my life is I don't avoid fats that's my friend basically if I look at a food someone's on a diet they look at the fat content in something I don't look in the sugar right because the fuck I can burn fat off but sugar will go into it stores in the body and he stays in long and it eventually turns to fat did you change anything in terms of your strength and conditioning work or boxing work look did you did you hire a new boxing trainer yes I've not got the same trainer as I did up before and why did why did you switch things up because I was stale in the gym I didn't have no motivation no more been I've done the same thing for years I didn't have any more motivation in the gym I don't have a new new team and I knew this going in to this comeback that I wanted a new team I wanted to start fresh give me self some goals give me self a new team more positivity so I'm doing the same stuff day-in day-out switch up the train I did choice of trainer was very very controversial as well who'd you go I went with an unknown trainer he was 24 years old who'd never trained anybody why'd you do that because I tell you the story he was helping out Billy Joe Saunders we was over in my base failing that guy like yeah I like that guy too and he was helping out Billy Joe he was how much he boxer before Ben he had about 12 fights and he ate Billy Joe he's helping Billy jolt for a few years and went over to Marbella I was out in a bar I was trading eyes time during the 17 I had two weeks training with Billy Joe over in Spain he said well you come on keep me company in Spain I said yeah course I will Marbella let's go I never had any intentions of training I went out over there for a good drink upon a party so gets out there and we're all in the coffee shop on the Fonda Porter burnoose and these two stoners were walking past in bikinis I mean 10 out of 10 each and I said to Ben Davison I said if you go and get me their numbers Ben I said you can be my boxing trainee when what I said you heard me correct the first time so off he went after these two two good walking girls 20 minutes goes by he comes back no number I said right I said clearly you're not the one for me I said because the trainer I need a stub minerals I said if you can't get a woman's number I said well you're not clearly count when fights can use simple he went wah I'll show ya offed off all in the mood to miss later comes by there's a number bang straight over I said excellent motivation yeah I did do you got you hired him because he got hot girls followers yeah hmm I hired him for that reason not just that the hot girls phone numbers that wasn't the case it was the case that he was willing to put himself on the line to prove to me that he could do something that takes minerals and if you don't have any confidence and you can't go over to somebody who's really good-looking and say oh I my name's Ben and there might make once your number is that possible like he wouldn't have got the number if he didn't have any confidence and he didn't have any gumption to him under God our number so I knew he was a good choice because he was young and fresh and at a point to prove and he wanted to do something with his life and I give him no opportunity and it was the best decision I ever made now what about what he knows about boxing obviously that played a factor if he's just some random Schmo who was good at getting girls numbers no it wouldn't be the train if it was just that way before this he was taking me on the pads and stuff in between Billy Jo sessions I'm we gelled straight away me and Ben think alike sometimes you meet people in your life and you're very similar in in personalities and we like the same things we like to do the same thing they've got the same type of personality we just gelled automatically our gel even before I said this about the number of the girls I already knew that I was gonna make Ben me trainer it's got a very keen eye for boxing what he does is is very it doesn't look like he knows a lot about boxing by looking he just looks like a young lad couldn't look in fella but when you sit down analyze the fighters he studies boxing day and night will be out watching movies after the training Ben's in his room watching Deonte while they're watching the flights watching this watch enough he studies the game and he's always coming up with different game plans on how to beat this person out to be that person very very up he's very knowledgeable young rather than I said before even made him my coach I said within five years you're going to be one of the lead in boxing trainers in the world and now he's got his chance and if I beat Yount a Wilder Ben Davis in a win ring magazine trainer of the year 2018 now how much different is your training with him than with your last track it's different Peter was a top trainer he got me to be World Heavyweight Champion well like I said we never had no more motivation in the gym it was stale there was no there was no vibe in the gym it was just like work again I didn't want to be there I'd start training camp a few times and walked out the gym every time because I didn't want to be in the gym I didn't have no motivation to be there so the most the main thing is boxing his boxer name rocket science you can only do a few things I think the most important things in boxing is road work pad work inspiring everything else not interested my favorite thing to do is spa and I think what better to do than practice what you do with another person fight another man and that's me that's me if everything and I've often sparred hundreds of rounds for fights to get fit and lose weight James Toney used to do that too used to spy on hundreds on good rounds to get yourself fit and that's what I've done as well that's my favorite thing but now we do a lot of spring conditioning work we do a lot of weights and stuff and I figured out over here being around like American fighters and stuff especially the boxers they don't have that like that that can that am program of weights and stuff it's more like maybe light weights loads of repetitions and stuff and B I've been a heavyweight I lift heavy weight very heavy weights and deadlift in very heavy weights and bench in heavy weights I'm using my body weight and a lot of stuff so I believe it's very very key factor in being a big strong man so he's responsible for that as well no I have another guy who does that you have another guy does strength conditioning yeah one of the things about a boxing trainer is knowing when to pull you back knowing when you're peaking yeah and that mostly comes from long-term success working with many many fighters that's got to be one of the biggest chances you take with a young guy it is bold I put him to the test many many times and he does he can see it sometimes being a successful trainer doing successful things and making champions and then you go work when I try anything you don't know nothing that's smart I've worked a few trainers on fault I'm not gonna go into any names because that'd be disrespectful but that knows when I'm feeling good my style is all about feel-good factor and if I fail good I'll fight excellent and if I'm not failing them on to the weather then I'll fail I'll I'll fight rubbish do you know when like when you show up at the gym and you're feeling like shit do you know when to back out of there you know often of went to the gym not wanting to be in the gym and felt like shit but then I'm the best training session of my life that's happened many many times until you're actually working out and get into them into the groove I don't think you can really know what you're gonna feel like until you start training because if he went on how he felt before the gym sometimes then you won't be in the gym at all right but I do believe what you said is very correct and it's the most important thing that anybody's ever talked about to me and I'm glad that you brought it up because not a lot of people have that ability to know when to pull your fighter back enough is enough a lot of people think because it's a bigger fight than your last one you got a trained double as heart trainer harder than you've ever trained before No are you running forever you left him heavier no because I already trained out so I don't need to train in the other where some people think right this is wild the fight we need to be fitter than ever we need to run up a mountain carrying a backpack on me back and pull three ball there wrestle two bears but it's not the case and Ben knows that's not the case he's very cautious I mentioned it to him many many times about overtraining overtraining overtraining how many times do you see fighters leave all in the gym but I don't want to leave this in the gym I want to leave it in the ring on the night I'd rather be a little bit unfit a lot on fit rather than a tiny bit overtrained I've been over trained and it's like being on the water you've got no snap you can't put things together you want to you can see it coming but you can't do nothing about it it's worse than unfit yeah because you're compromised I've been over trained before and I've been totally unfit fat as anything and I rather be unfit ten times a day than over train once can't do nothing when you're over train but at least when you don't fit you lose your breath will you recover when you have arrest and you get back on it again yeah but over train you just one pace you can't do nothing you never get out of the mud no now you have a strength and conditioning coach and how often you do that we do that five days a week you did quite a bit are you running yeah we're all we're all three times a week so you're running three times a week strength conditioning five times a week and on top of that all your boxing work yeah we're box six days a week wow that's a lot of work yeah now you're you're doing deadlifts and benchpress and I mean how is this a guy that's worked with other boxers before I've worked with this guy for three years when I first started working with him he worked with boxers before yeah a lot of local boxers and British boxers but he never worked with a heavyweight before and he didn't know what he was doing because everyone makes the same mistake they're only humans will train a heavyweight I will train a lightweight they're not boxing trainer system and conditioning trainers so he was trying to make in the beginning he was trying to make me do something a 10 stone 145 pound guy was doing it's not possible it's a different world but only through experience did he realize what what we need to do what we don't need to do and now he's like it's perfect I wouldn't change him for the world and I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have him because I'd love to go and go through all that same learning process again and it's not just heavy weights it's heavy weight boxing because I had this guy this mr. Olympia guy and he used to train some massive guys 350 pounds solid muscle but he didn't know anything about boxing and you boxing his performance sport no matter if you look like an Adonis but you you can't do five rounds it's pointless I'd rather look fat Emile to do 12 rounds on me head tomorrow I can have Donnison be fucked after five yeah no doubt I've knocked out plenty of six bucks in my day don't worry about that but I'm still waiting to be knocked out as a fat now training for Deontay Wilder what have you done different to be honest we haven't done anything different isn't that all as long as guy verified I think Amon Klitschko the same same size I think Klitschko might have had longer arms maybe or maybe not I don't know but he's up there anyway if he isn't he's a second tallest I've ever fought but every tall guy I've ever faced tall the better for me I don't know why but I seem to be able to move better than I'm the taller and heavier my ideal opponent would be like tall as anything and heavy because they don't move as quick in the can't turn got it all under the stiff well what's unusual about you is that you're a tall guy who's who moves like it guy was not tall yeah and that most tall guys have that advantage of long length and utilization of that length are very good at judging distance and they have that advantage but what you're doing is you're moving around a lot on top of being tall which you could see with Klitschko it was very off-putting like right away he didn't know how to fuck with your timing yeah it was you know that's that's a giant advantage it is all my life growing up I used to watch all the great American heavyweight champions of the world we may be in european-- there's a stigma about European fighters the stiff they can't move they're just strong I agree I agree ninety percent of European fighters are stiff robots just do a lot of conditioning work left a lot of heavyweights undergoing they're trying to do one thing one - left or right and take four or five shots back I didn't want to do that I wanted to run for European conditioning will American style the best of both worlds and I believe that's what I've got I've got the brashness and the movement and the speed of an American fighter but I've got the European conditioning and core strength best of all false now when you think about a guy like Deontay Wilder who's got this wild style and tries to knock you out with everything with every punch are you doing anything different without giving away your strategy coming into this fight are you doing anything different in terms of your preparation or in terms of the way you shadowbox or move or train not really know how can I explain this without sounding like a clown I'll try my best Deontay Wilder is a one-trick pony I don't need to do anything special to beat him I just need to be myself Deontay Wilder is looking for one right hand all night it's a good trick though it's a good trick but we all know what happens when that trick don't land yeah you've lost mm-hmm you need more than one punch to beat me you need to be able to set it up with footwork speed feints movement and he doesn't have any other if the great Klitschko and excellent footwork and ability to set that big punch or couldn't do it what chance has the big swing of guard doing it if I get hit by a swinging right and as a serve knock you know it's my fault I want it to knock me out if I let Wilder swing one of those wild punches from the back of the hall and it being knocked me out then I'll say thank you very much you put me out my misery god bless you Wilder because obviously I can't be a great fighter that I think I am if I'm getting knocked out by swinging punches it's just not possible I don't take big shots anymore years ago from before 3 2013 I used to take everything bang in the face try and walk through and use my sheer size and aggression I'd heart and determination to get through everything but as I stepped toppling levels and realized that wasn't going to get me anywhere but a good idea no good punching in the face so I changed me style to box in a move in slipping and sliding on you people have never seen me take any big shots because I'll just ride him be like Muhammad Ali used to do used to take the shots on the gloves go with it slim slide roll even the powerful as George Foreman was he was the heavy favorite going in knocked out Frazier and Frazier be early and had great fights over 15 rounds it didn't help him in that fight because he used his greatest asset against him and if I can use to yunkai wilds own power against him then I've warmed he's looking for one punch I'm not so there we go I don't believe if he can't learn that punch he's lost every round even he's promoter Luda Bela said recently he said if he doesn't knock Tyson down and knock him out I don't see how he can win now I don't want you looking past this but let's just say you beat Deontay Wilder how do you talk Joshua into a fight I don't because you can take a horse to water but you can't make it drink it so what do you do after this I don't do nothing I sit back retire go up to 450 pounds get back on the drink I don't want to become depressed again you don't want to what do you do I just got to keep training what like I say I only set one goal out of time and I don't care about anything else I'm gonna beat him wilder and after I beat the world but probably I'm gonna be depressed then yeah I hope to god um no no no no fuck that boy get that out of your head man but I don't know you never know you never know but you can stop yourself like you've already brought yourself back yeah I of but you never know what's around the corner fear and I don't want to look past the onte wall and think about what I'm gonna do after that right when I when I beat Deontay Wilder I want to lay in flight Joshua he keeps talking about this Joshua fight someone he keeps wanting so I'm gonna lamé go fight him go fight each other there you go there you go take what's yours go fight each other come back a little three years when you find someone who you think could beat me again well if he beats Joshua that would be spectacular for a rematch right yeah and if he doesn't beat Joshua then it's almost like Joshua kind of has to fight you if he doesn't beat Joshua we'll say yeah it was a bad wilder than theory for he didn't throw any punches you know you can't please everybody in boxing and the fight games have pretty fickle game everybody likes somebody and don't like the next person and you know the way I think I saw I John say something recently on all video it was he said if Jesus Christ himself wasn't liked what chance have I you know that is so true 100 percent very very great legendary box one of the greatest of all times in my opinion yeah I'm talking with his people to get him in here you need to get very knowledgeable on the boxing game yeah giant fan of that guy I was with him a couple of months ago plus about Russia he's a Russian citizen now yeah how good must that Russian pussy be excellent so far so good got a passport but listen man I'm a giant
