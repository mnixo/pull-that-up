people like it's not natural I say what the fuck is natural powerful Morgan Murphy we are live we are live we are live how are you folks going on is that a Spaceballs t-shirt you wearing uh no it's uh no no limit no limit soldier t-shirt oh shit laughs I see whatever happened that is Nicole he's got a weed storage and murder who's he murder isn't he in jail for murder how odd there's a lot of uh a lot of people in jail for murder right now it's very big yeah you don't have to do your entire life though I used to think that every time you murder someone that's it you go to jail for life people get out of jail for murder yeah that seems a little fucked up doesn't seem little fucked up a little fucked up to have to uh I always am at like I wondered if they go back to their hometown like where they murdered somebody like that's always the fucked up part to me it's like going back to the place where you're the town murderer yeah it's fucked up that in a moment of just to freak out mm-hmm you could change your whole life your life's fucked and the other end of the person's life just isn't around anymore just stop Stan yeah the finality of it all it's crazy it's a little uncomfortable I don't want you snapping I feel like you could snap I'm a sapper are you I'm super calm really yeah pretty much especially in like physical altercation time stuff I'm very aware of consequences what if you want like your tenth lift of something like an aggressive workout and you're in the middle you have all the you know all your energy is just moving forward and you're lifting your the kettle thing and it's number ten and someone just comes in and like tells you your mom's stupid I would be even less likely to do anything because I'm already exerted I get it I think of the body this is a shitty theory know biology attached to it at all but I think the body is like a battery and I think almost like maybe a battery if a battery was a bucket and it's thinking overflow and I think that's what you get when you get road rage that's what you get yet people that snap for no reason I think they're already coming at it like eight they're not like hi I'm Morgan hi I'm Joe and we meet each other at zero right I think some people are meeting yeah they're ready at six and they're just ready to snap there's nothing to do with you they should have let a little out at the Starbucks a little out in the car a little out you know at home with the kids and then they wouldn't murder anybody at the end of it and people will say well you know you just need to work on your breathing and well you need to work on your your being present and you need to be mindful and I think all those things are correct but I really think that your body has a certain amount of requirements and I think depending upon your stress level those physical requirements might be higher all right like if you have a job and your job is like some high-level accountant at some big firm and you're crunching numbers and it's fucking stressful shit I feel like your body thinks that there is some physical danger involved in this and I think your body amps up for that and then when the physical danger doesn't come your body is just fucking primed and ready to go okay nothing there's no action there's no fucking action this fucking gut got me off and then they start doing that shit fuck you fuck you they get in their car and they're just fuck you fuck you because in your car you ramped up even more because in your car you're aware that you have to be you have to be really acutely aware of everything that's around you you have to make sure that no one's making any mistakes because you're all going 65 miles an hour and a little error can happen really quickly so you're on edge already when you're in your car even if you're calm you're even if you're calm you're in your car your sensors are tuned in if you're fucking paying attention if you're a healthy human being you're looking left you're looking in the mirror you're looking right you're checking to make sure that you're okay you're making sure that no one's doing anything stupid and then you compound that with the stress of your daily life with no physical release right we don't have animals chasing us anymore anyway and we just have eating tribes that would be fun though they have a buffalo chase you all day and then you would have you would release the proper amount of energy given the threat it would be a realistic we'd have a more realistic population yeah - I like it that would be one thing we don't like that though we just whenever anything like gets like too close we just kill him off yeah just kill him off fuck that fuck having buffalos everywhere fuck kill him just fucking kill him stop stop there's consequences I got gonna work kill it kill it that's a bigger problem went round America do you know that they reintroduced wolves into America in the 1990s now this is giant debate whether or not wolf should be here really where'd they do that Yellowstone oh yeah I think they're badass but you got to keep an eye on the fuckers yeah I got a lot of coyotes in my in my neighborhood a lot of Chi have a lot of coyote neighbors yeah super calm him all the time I had a biologist on who tracks coyotes it's what he does he does track coyotes around Los Angeles and he's like - they're fucking everywhere yeah so they were living in middle of downtown LA in the most crowded area they had dead it's crazy yeah I call my neighbors when uh when there's a coyote if I see a coyote going up their driveway hey it's a coyote - I call them if somebody knocks on the door asking for money for some organization everyone gives each other an alert oh that's no coyote Zoar uh you know people for environmental LA or whatever you have those people just knocking on your door oh that's a bad feeling I gave him money for bees one time they got they got me all nervous about bees and saving the bees and I was I got shit I gotta take no I really went from like I'm having coffee and a cigarette to like oh I got to save the bees now it's my responsibility to solely do it does that also depend on like where your head's at right like if your head is in a really good place and some knocks in the door and you don't know who they are it's cool you're like hi you know like hi we're here to save chimpanzees you're like oh okay like what do you what do you guys do and then you start talking to them well if they can like within a minute make you understand something you didn't understand before you're like oh shit now I got to pay attention Riley they sucked me in because I wasn't aware of our bee situation also they immediately hit you with some fat hit me with some facts I was like oh boy now how are they gonna save these bees I don't know like with my with my $40 leg just hair take this paper and just go handle it yeah go handle it yeah if the bees die were dead we're all dead apparently yeah except in China they figured out a way to pollinate things with just a brush there was an issue where they were really low on bees and tried reintroducing bees and didn't take so last-ditch effort was they took people with paintbrush and they've dusted the pollen on all these different plants like one at a time yeah yeah they pollen they literally pollinated all these plants and apparently worked way better because bees are sort of nonspecific like bees are just going over there and they're doing a thing and they just get shit on their body and transfers over to the plants it's really kind of fascinating how it works but these people did it very specifically with a paintbrush it's hard to do a bee's job see if it's even you find the video of it it's kind of fucking weird because like you could make the argument like we don't really need bees once you want honey no he's I'm really good for you how about that that was going through my head and then they explained to me why we need bees which I forgot but it was enough I had a guy come to me at Whole Foods this is my most intrusive I think the most intrusive is when you're in the parking lot at Whole Foods because that's when they usually get you when you're walking out they try to get you right as you want it's fucking hot outside and you have like ice cream and shit you're like hey dude you also like 17 you know $17 ice creams they know you have a they know you have a few bucks that's right now because of Amazon we want to do that anymore Amazon just bought Whole Foods so just just be able to one-click your shit but I'm this guy he hits me up stops me in the middle like stops me stands in front of my cart puts his finger up do you have one minute for gay rights like what start again one minute is not gonna help shit man like what are you talking about I vote like what do you want me to do woman you donate so what's this one minute what are you gonna tell me what are you gonna tell me not gonna tell me shit I go no I do not I vote for gay rights though take it easy man like could you fucking that's an annoying activist what uh Whole Foods is this at Meghan Hills how are what right here right up street hmm I was trying to like politically what where that Whole Foods aligns I don't know what the deal is like where they're allowed to have people this was a couple years ago honestly I'd still complain about it cuz I'm kind of a whiny bitch but um I don't know what the deal is like are you allowed to just set up shop anywhere and put like one of those picnic stands and you know they have like those little plastic tables they send down and they show you a picture of a baby with a bloated belly yeah show you yeah you hope it's Girl Scout cookies and it turns out to be just a horror show yeah pending apocalypse I almost think like when I see someone like some kids selling lemonade or something like that I'm like oh this is like you guys are doing like a throwback thing you know yeah I almost feel like oh you guys are doing like an old time you're making your own butter look at your kids yeah I think this is not sustainable this is not a real thing anybody does anymore you get a lemonade stand okay did you did you how did you make you get a horse and ride your horse over here with this lemonade stand there's always parents now helping the lemonade you can't you can't do it alone you can't do anything alone anymore oh ways it's always parents there and so is those helicopter parents don't touch somebody Billy don't put the judge give me your mouth I would sell when I was a kid I would like take my books and stuff and sell them in my front yard like I would just put them out I thought it was fun to have my own garage sale but I didn't see my mom for like you know seven hours of the day and I come back inside she what you doing I made four dollars like she no I made four dollars I was selling all my shit in the front yard and she didn't see me or ask me anything Oh different times different times parents were just they just let you out they let you out but I was this was like in the 80s which was priming that was like that was kidnapping was was hot mmm you know your mom had faith in your avoidance yes maybe yeah yeah you think about like how people used to raise people like everybody I talked to they just let the kids out like when you were you know my age like I'm 49 when I was like seven 42 years ago they just let you out of the house I got I used to get kicked out of the house but I was given a time I had to be back it was a very like broken system of like get out but come back by 5:00 and don't walk under the overpass tunnel like I was given rules that's where the troll yeah I was given rules like what year did they stop doing that like just letting kids out like when did that stop cuz everyone my age says the same thing they said when we were kids did you get just let out of your house Jamie yeah Jamie's young how old you Jamie thirty-four he's younger a lot of 22 year old like the fuck dude old shit bro somebody call me at geriatric on Twitter the other day like how dare you how dare you but if you are if you're Jamie's age you got let out we would ride our bikes miles away from our house yeah but you lived in the woods no let her down like Columbus that's the woods man you might as well I grew up in LA and I would walk down I would walk down like Ventura Boulevard just like a practically a thoroughfare when you're a kid and I would walk past like they had these motels where the door opened opened directly to the sidewalk you know those much oh yeah those are the best and that was where I was sure I was gonna get kidnapped and arm was gonna come out and grab me and so I would walk and then I'd hop past the doors the motel doors those motels pay my beeper Bell those are weird places yeah your beeper but yeah I had a beeper at a pager I was like 12 and that was like what I saved up all my money for ex everyone had one and no one wanted me messages yeah I had I had all that shit and I would walk down to J&J beepers in Studio City and paying cash it's like a 12 year old my beeper bill you know a Jay Jay King of beepers is that it I think it's the same chanty the same la like this there was a lot of Jay and Jay I feel like people stole they stole the name I forgot about that dude the king of beepers yeah at turquoise clear get a clear be brothers regulars were slick got some Star Wars shit I'd be ID page myself that's what I had messages in there some people loved it I had no friends the king of beepers is this is Jay Jay beepers Las Vegas uh well he was in LA - I don't know if the same guy or maybe like it's one of those things where it's like Kleenex like all the other guys like that's right hey start calling ourselves Kleenex you know like it became do you think it's like a legend like this pink there's also pink elephant like I think people just kind of feel a little pink Pink's they probably started it the hot dog place yeah that's it is that's the biggest weird fucking event in LA there's a goddamn line of people to buy hot dogs nobody from LA well here's the thing put hot dogs on a regular fucking menu good luck better not buy a lot of hot dogs if you have a rest regular restaurant and you have hot dogs as one of the offerings how often the people is it even one of you get a hot tub of a hot dog if it's like one of two options like a Burbank Airport you can get you can get a hot dog or like a pack a prepackaged salad and occasionally I'm like you know I want something fresh like a hot dog or a turkey sandwich that's sort of moist in some weird way yeah the breads kind of wet like fuck is this yeah wet bread in lieu of mayo or condiments and of course it's sporting events the UFC there were hotdogs hotdogs at us 14 is good it's good food for a sporting event for you know it's recreational food right like picnics and barbecues you're always hot dogs right yeah it's a good move for a barbecue it's simple you can't really fuck it up if it looks brown on the outside it's done right it's already cooked you could eat it raw it doesn't need to be cooked yeah you can eat it right out of package so that's it's a good move for that but somehow know the pynx is convinced people just by cooking outside they just have a big open area with a cooking right in front of you and there's a whole lot more of those and there's a fucking line well that's it I think the line is why people go I think people people go for a line and the line is outside you can see the line yeah it's not like Astro burger like 2 a.m. where you can't see the line the line is exciting it's what draws tourists I think that's Jamie Masada strategy see Brian he's always got that crazy line outside the Laugh Factory and he makes a comics wait in line to really do you don't know though he'll have it in a little a little while but no no I don't know that they're open mike deals kind of nuts like you have to get there like 9:00 in the morning and you wait outside and if you leave you lose your spot so you have to like have some sort of a friendship with the other comics yeah yeah I would say the comedy store had it situate let me in the open mic when when I was startled it's like 15 years ago I would Bobbie Lee was the host of the open mic and he knew I had I was in college I was in school and I was in class so I couldn't go all day and wait so he would slide my name into the open mic and I will get to come after class that's we does real real real cute but the open mics were always weird right there always weird and in LA they're extra works is so much like I feel like if you can make it to be a professional comedian and you start out in LA you're a rare person well it's all it's it's it's 5050 comedians and then just like you know mentally ill transients there's also comedians but we're also community yes yeah it's all you just you just wait and you go alright it's gonna be my friend and then it's going to be that guy who has all of his belongings with him and then it's going to be my other friend and then it's going to be that crazy lady that'll be me you just wait wait and wait and wait and just wonder what kind of fucking diseases yeah festering on that microphone but also just what's the point of this what am i doing right especially in the beginning yeah to have vision and hope like what was your initial goal when you first started doing stand-up umm really simply like I think it was I I knew I liked writing a lot like even before I start doing stand-up and I think stand-up I've tried to figure it out the easiest way to explain it I think is that I just wanted to see if what I was writing was funny and so that's sort of why even when I start I mean I'm still deadpan obviously but when I started I was so dry because I was essentially just reading out loud these thoughts I had with no real performance background and I wasn't you know necessarily a performer at heart so it was just like reading one-liners and going is this funny is this funny is this funny get a laugh keep it don't get a laugh throw it away but if you if you throw it away like you never know sometimes is it is it me is it the way I'm delivering it is this joke is it a good idea but it's kind of it's done wrong yeah and then at that time too you don't have the you don't have the the ability to perform at a hundred from places so you're not going okay it works in the alternative room but doesn't work at the club or it's just like oh well it didn't work at the laundromat but it worked at the coffee house I don't wonder what that means about okay right it's like jokes it'll work at the UCB but they bomb on the store yeah like why what's going like why'd I get an applause break at the UCB and they just fuck it stared at me in the main room following Rick Ingram they stared at you sometimes that UCB is hot I mean that shit word that comes out of your mouth it's weird and then sometimes nope it's a weird place it's weird they don't pay to that's also super weird yeah I think if I was I'd be a little less I'm not even that upset about it but I feel like I'd be less upset if I was like involved in the school and realized that it's oh it's so kids can take classes at like a decent rate I think isn't that what it's for so that kids can take really cheap classes there isn't that what it sustains like the shows what kind of class is there there like comedy classes improvin shit oh can you teach well maybe you teach improv huh do you believe you can teach stand-up uh you can teach somebody I think you can help somebody encourage them to get on stage but I don't think you can teach the the ability to be funny no I don't know what you know it stand up in what capacity like I guess you could teach somebody to you can mould their thoughts into jokes and help them and shove them on stage but I don't know who what kind of comedian that makes yeah I feel like boy it's one of those things where I've learned a lot about it so is wonder like maybe you can teach something because I've definitely learned some shit well yeah I mean people you know I think there are if you find out your favorite comedian you know sits down and writes an hour a day at a Starbucks or whatever you go maybe I'll try that like little tricks and things like that but I don't know I don't know anyone who's uh you know who I deeply deeply admire who would credit all their success to their comedy classes no well there's not enough classes that'd be like a real poor focus group but I know Ari did an interesting thing a while back where he used to go to a town like when he was doing stand-up and like he was headlining for the weekend go town and you would do like a free seminar for the local comics tell them like this how you get a manager stop asking people to take you with them on the road when you're two months in the comedy stop asking you know managers to handle you like you just got to get good first and give them all this advice about like getting an agent and you know yeah I went I went to a pen you know you pen recently and I was talking to some students and I don't I don't like fancy myself like an instructor of any kind but they were asking me you know about comedy writing this is specifically and stuff and the advice I gave was very practical and had nothing to do with the craft which was just like don't be annoying in the room don't you know like in a TV so I get like in the writing for like a TV show and like jokes don't work don't go that didn't work that's not your job to say that like that kind of shit just like how to get through the first year without annoying everybody dies think that's not like taught right yet no one ever does that shut up like shut up is a great rule you can make big mistakes yeah they could be honest that nobody wants to work with you no matter how talented you are yeah that's a pope writers often times very awkward right they can be it depends like the rooms are very split and when I got into like sitcom stuff like it's just very split into very just internal uh kind of what you would typically think of as like a writer and then there's a couple comedians sprinkled in there who kind of bounce more jokes around it's just a women people who are just good at structure hmm yeah that's so interesting thing the people that are good at structure because sometimes they try to be funny sometimes but it's not you know once you fight the thing I like about like those rooms obviously it's so much fun to be in a room with comedians but once you realize how that person can do a thing I can't and I can do a thing they can't yeah you start to realize like oh we could go into a room and get a lot of words on together that is the thing right it's like lining up the pieces no matter how much you want a square and a circle to line up they just they just don't seem to it when you have like a writers room or anything like that I think a big part of it event depends on just a fortunate chemistry of all the people coming at ya and that first day where you show up if it's not your room and you haven't hired anybody and you don't know who's there is a terrifying you show up and you know you know within five minutes if this is going to be a fun X number of months or if you're just going to be trudging through what's the biggest shit show you ever had to work on um i-i've had really like tremendously good luck as far as like just working with friends and stuff on so many things but I worked on a award show once and the boss basically didn't let me write jokes like didn't they needed to hire a woman and I guess I was recommended and and he just he I was like I'll take a stab at these jokes and he was like no no no just write the banter where it says like coming up next is this person and I was like like anyone can do that I just literally wouldn't allow me to write jokes so you got hired as a joke writer and then once you got there he just wanted you to write narrative just banter just like you know like guest is you know okay from the hangover and please welcome him desert specific is that what they call it they call it banter like when you're writing things it's yeah well no I mean like that in my 20s I wrote a lot of award shows so there's like the jokes and monologue all that stuff and then there's just the going out to commercial and come back and all that stuff has to be written right and sometimes they try to make it funny and sometimes I don't but you can break it up you guys break it up in terms of like this is the these are the jokes this is the banter this is the negative this is the structure yeah the last I mean I was just writing on the the NBA Awards that are going to be on and I think that 26 of the month a Drake is hosting on TNT and it's just like it's you know I mean I've written on the ESPYs before so this is like that but for just NBA and we've been doing you know it's a combination of like I write a lot of monologue jokes as other guys who are better at sketches like like film sketches tape pieces there's live comedy stuff on stage then there's you know like I said like the kind of a little more boring like this next person is the you know two-time MVP so why this guy hire you you really think he hired just because he needed a woman yeah Wow yeah I know he did that's so crazy yeah I knew it all I knew it all when it was happening yeah who was will you let you try no that's full that's foolish yeah it was it was bizarre and it was it was the only case of like you know sexism that I think I've been confronted with which is I mean I guess lucky in 15 years I don't feel like I've you know super had that and I was on I mean for years and years and years I never worked with another woman I was the only girl and and everyone treated me great so it's a tougher road for comics to be a woman yeah I can't I mean it's so funny now I it's so hard to the landscape right now I think so many women are being given chances that didn't even exist ten years ago yeah so it's it's interesting to to see but I never had no I never had like those kind of sexist roadblocks if that makes sense well I think that like starting and developing as a female it's more difficult just from my personal observations because men a lot of times don't want to laugh at women they definitely don't want to laugh at women telling them things about like politics or world events like a woman that seems informed like for whatever reason they'll tolerate it guys especially if it's a guy like Ron White right distinguished-looking gentleman with silver hair absolutely one of my favorite boys if Ron's up there and he tells people something about some sort of fact like people will sit back and listen oh I know that if a woman gets on stage and tells a man or group of men about a fact that it's very rare they're gonna go wow I didn't know that that's amazing that was fuck this bitch now okay right so does that yes that's a that's a roadblock and then the other roadblock is um well there's a lot like you could do sex jokes now obviously Sarah Silverman kind of broke a lot of that down worse so so much of her act was just straight dirty and hilarious and then Amy Schumer of course a lot of the people but it's still when you're developing when you're coming with me starting out it's like more it seems like it's more of a difficult world to navigate than a guy talent sex jokes yeah it's it's a difficult world and it's also like socially it's a it's it's the I think the precarious I I'm it's interesting because what I realized when I was you know 1920 was you know you like that that aspect of people like dating in the scene and all that kind of stuff all that happens too and I found that if a woman who was newish around like my level of time was dating somebody else they were automatically looked at as like a comedy groupie and that was the thing that didn't apply to men that was the one part where I was like I don't I don't quite get that like I know I'm totally true because I've seen some guys that are dating like famous women they are sort of like underling sort of men she'll end up comics and everybody treats them like their comedy group you think I thought I saw that a lot when I was when I was younger that the opposite where just I didn't see men getting tagged with that yeah that label and that but I was so scared and paranoid of being I was I was so scared of being considered anything other than a comedian that I liked for years and years didn't date anybody in in comedy at all because are worried that if I showed up to a show with a guy who you know potentially was more successful than me then the first thought would be she's the girl who's with that guy not she's the girl who's going up next not just that but she's with that God because of this right yeah she's always gonna be the pack when in fact there's a lot of people with legitimate relationships of where that's not the passages you sure you're attracted somebody and you know eventually I yeah you know I made my way through a few people it's just another prejudiced it's just one of those things another prejudice that you have to sort of overcome like if you'll actually like someone and they have a comic though what the fuck do you do like you say if you like someone they happen to be some big-time comedian like what you supposed to not like him now they like you or not like him that's stupid - it is stupid but I was I was I was terrified of I don't know I just I think it was very eager to to impress - I was very eager to prove myself and maybe that is partly you know being a woman I as much as I didn't find it harder I did find myself wanting to prove any stereotype that anyone might have about me wrong right I don't I don't feel as much of that as like a mission anymore I doesn't but I think you have a lot wrapped in your head when you're oh yeah young and especially when you just you really aren't stable as far as like financially you're not you're really not a real professional anymore or yet yeah and then once you become one that's once you're established in the community after a while it's like what am i what am I wasting my time and thinking about this shit for so I think it's harder for chicks to develop but I think once they become good and once they get out there there's a lower bar III don't know I I think there's I think the bar is this I think the bar is the same height for most good people and then there's like another bar that's like higher for the great you know what I mean I just think like hung the bar is lower for women I think it's lower for people who are not as famous not as successful not as established not as good but I don't know if that like I just I don't know I think it's I think the bar is the same for men and women I just think it's a there's a there's a few different bars what I mean by that is that I think that it's it's easier to get a lot of attention early on if you're good--you're woman because there's not that many of them yeah sure I think it's yeah I mean I would I would apply that to any person who's something that is rare in comedy right this facility but then you have to prove yourself to prove yourself I mean and then I don't know I I see comedy too in these there's so many different factions me there's people who are so great at stand-up and then as a writer somebody who tries to make like you know projects and wrap them around people I also see so many people who I though that's not my favorite stand-up that's not a great standup in my opinion but that's somebody I would love to write for that somebody I'd love to put in a show like so I see all these like columns of comedians and I judge people accordingly and I think there are legitimately comedians who are not like they're never going to be you know Pryor Carlin or Lou or anybody that but you go oh I would I would put them in a hundred TV shows as a funny person oh yeah so I don't know I tend to like look at it from that perspective to where I see I see the potential almost in spite of the material sometimes well there's definitely that you know there's also like the difference between those guys and the guys that are in like funny movies like Adam Sandler type movies so I sure it's got a gang of those guys that are always in those movies and they might not necessarily be the best stand-up so the kind of guys you want to see but they're great in those movies yeah I mean and then it but it's it's I mean who's I don't know and that in that group like my favorite stand-up is probably norm who I mean I went to go see the they did a Netflix movie and then like a tour with all the actor you know the comedians from it and it couldn't have been a bit different group of comedians and you go okay well norms my favorite stand-up there I go is norm you know gonna be the lead of like a you know Adam Sandler maybe probably not but he's the person I would go to any theatre any room and he you know any any a coffeehouse whatever it is to go see yeah it's it's one of those things I guess when you're you look at you look at things in categories like you know that Kevin Hart does his own stand-up but you also know that he does movies whether people write the lines and I'm sure he helps make them funnier and all that stuff he's reading a script essentially yeah and then there's people that go on stage doing stand-up and you you know like you could be like I guess you could be like a really amazing performer and just have some wizards behind the scenes that right for you and you could make a fucking incredible stand-up act yeah it's it's that stuff so interesting great yeah I have a very specific like you know if I was to boil down the standup that I you know the stand-up comedy that I love and respect the most it has nothing to do with TV and has nothing to do with as it's just comedians and who they are onstage and that's you know that's how I judge who I love and don't love as a comedian but there's so many other factors in show business that you have to sort of take into consideration I mean we like a lot of people who are very famous who might not be the very best but we know them the most right well what I was going to say is that when you're when you're doing stand-up though for whatever weird reason the people that we all love the most are almost always people that like right for themselves yeah and it's very difficult to get like say you're not going to get bill burr to write for some CAA creation like say FCA a house I'm fucking comic he's got perfect cheekbones and he's got a great way of delivering jokes but he's not capable of writing they're the right level of material one of the problems is a guy like burr writes for his own mind writes for his own thing like I'm sure he could write for that guy but he's not gonna get the best stuff right it's not gonna be the same well that's I yeah i mean i i'm i i've never i i i think we've all taken like a tag or a segue or something where a friendless dude add this to your joke and you feel like you already wrote it i mean i like a three-year fight with somebody my 20s over who wrote a joke and I thought he did and he said I did in a car and I refused to do it until he convinced me that I came up with it because I was so paranoid about doing a joke that I thought somebody else wrote but yeah I mean that's the thing too is that there's some material that's so fucking great and I watch it and I go I don't know how to make that a show and maybe it doesn't even maybe it's not even supposed to be a show but like someone like Louie I think I mean I repeat he's my favorite but like I could have never written Louis show Louie had right Louis show right but there's a lot of comedians where I watch some and I go oh I know I know what I know what there's you know he had to figure that out though absolutely lucky Louie he did that show on HBO yeah I had a conversation with him after was canceled at The Improv and the first thing he said is I just I should have written it myself I would have fired everybody yeah and just written it he was like the problem a big part of it is just you're dealing with all these peoples visions and you're trying to get yours through and it's like yours might not necessarily be better but the problem is it's yours in an order for the thing to be the thing that you're happy with like just like your act it kind of has to come to you like say if you were going to do a Netflix special they said look Morgan we think you're hilarious we'd love to do a Netflix special with you but what we'd like to do is assign a team of executive producers yeah and writers and what they're going to do is they're going to and your luck okay we're gonna go with our goth theme they're gonna we're gonna put black lipstick on you and and we're gonna just you know they're gonna come up with some fucking nutty things they decide to do and then change the way you deliver material it would be like what are we doing here right and I think that's kind of how Lily felt when he was doing a show it's like all this there's all these other voices maybe not as retarded as yeah goth vampire black lipstick yeah that's I mean I I get so like I get so passionate about about making things like other people's things like I just get excited I see somebody on stage I'm like I want to you know like my job right now is just to develop TV stuff and does it ever fucking happen so do stand up to you I do like yeah yeah yeah we're going on tour for two weeks on a Tuesday and then he continues and I have to come back for some writing shit and but I get you know as passionate as I get about stand-up I get so fucking into the idea of like seeing somebody go up seeing the show that they could have and also wanting them to love it because I'm like no no I get you I'm not gonna write anything that you would say that you wouldn't do like you want to be as the writer on the other side of that as a person who is sometimes hired to take a comedian and like get a show out of them like I like to hope and think that I have a perspective that someone who's not in stand-up maybe wouldn't have because I'm like I've watched this person so long I know their voice I know what they're commenting on I know the way they're commenting on it and I hope that if I write a script for them and they read it they're not gonna go fuck this isn't me right you know I'm so I mean maybe it goes back to like wanting to impress or wanting you know to be seen as legitimate but I would never I would never hand somebody something if I thought that it was remotely embarrassing or against their you know right you lot people will write but I mean I I find it to be an interesting sort of responsibility and and and like when you're hired to sort of develop shows is all this shit they bring you like hey there's an article about this do you want to write a show about this thing and I'm like every time I say no I want it I want to write something for a comedian I that's so that's like your specialty what you want to do it's what I want to do is like seems watching someone from comedians perspective and going I could do something with that yeah and also like I smell in that I think that there's so many people you see where you go I they're not as successful as I think they should be and I think I know how to how to fix it fix it dude you're a cleaner I'm a cleaner you're a cleaner Hey you're the person they bring in that would be the like the uh you know the the wolf in a pulp fiction yeah the Harvey Keitel character was open the silver NSX and it takes notes some like baby showers like a woman's job is to clean and then it's like coming in the cleaner you have like waiters on this Royce but it's it's so it actually is like mildly embarrassing to passionately talk about a television and show business like it's it's it's there's a little part of it that's like who cares and why does it matter but I don't know like that is yet listen I think anything that's interesting to you talk about and people say well you know you're gonna bore the fuck out of people you are you're gonna bore the fuck out of some people but you're gonna bore the fuck out of some people with things that I think are really interesting well there are whatever physics nature things that I think are fascinating some people are gonna think it's stupid just you have to whatever is interesting stand-ups interesting to us so it's gonna be I'm into anything that is passionately and intricately discussed you know I mean shit if it's a if I'm a salmon room in an enthusiast enthusiast does I don't know a lot about one thing but I love anybody who does yeah I'm with you I'm 100% with you I like a lot of cool shit there's a lot of interesting shit out there there's so much this anybody tells me they're bored like whoa listen you see you're not bored you're inactive yeah you just need to find things that you enjoy doing and then you will never be bored yes keep doing things you like doing it's just hard for people to get that initial momentum just get moving and go forward sure it's not boring this is not boring this is crazy you're a finite life-form on a planet it's whole thing's crazy it's chaos I got scared as fuck there's another article on Yellowstone they're saying it's a 10% chance at inside this hundred years there's going to be a supervolcano eruption so inside this from two thousand to three you know 2000 to 2100 there's a 10% chance that everything dies the whole planet everything on this continent dead everything else all over the rest of the world is gonna be fucked because there's not gonna be any Sun I got a book some Glasgow dates that's the move so I think South Africa really yeah might be new push New Zealand is a is a big one for people escaping the apocalypse New Zealand's awesome money a lot of Americans a lot of uh you know tech people big big money buying land in New Zealand oh really yeah it's beautifully I want to go stone supervolcano hit by a swarm of more than 230 earthquakes in one week what in the fuck people how many wake-up calls do we need see we're not going to be even paying attention to this until the lava is shooting up into the atmosphere do you know they didn't even know that it was a supervolcano it's like 50 years ago or something they don't even know this is I like this pocket you just it's just talk about shit and learn how you'll die not always snaps weren't learn about beautiful things scared now though like Vibram FiveFingers toe shoes and boxing matches this is those things like that they're why I'm like why would I quit smoking when I can just hmm wait it out recycle wait it out see what you're saying but don't you feel like shit when you smoke a lot uh when I smoke a lot how often you smoke do you smoke a day half a pack that's not that bad I mean right now but it gets crazy when it when I would I have deadlines and stuff and I'm writing I tied it into writing which is a bad know I'd move how does that work does the I've smoked Tony's Hinchcliffe cigarettes yeah I smoked a cigarette with him before a show once also dude it's gives you like a buzz yeah he goes yeah I can't imagine writing or doing stand-up without it no really my dad's interesting yeah I've gone over to hinge Louie's AG I'll hang out with is a you know similar similar lifestyle I guess is the easy to like have a cigarette with him and talk about comedy okay so what you saying both we're presumed pursuing to be gay because they meant to be but not that's Larry's um but what is the thing about writing and cigarettes like what does it do and what does it do that like a cigar doesn't do I don't know it's uh it it there's it's highs into it's it feels good and then there's momentum sort of involved and then you get into a place where you're like oh shit I'm you know in one cigarette I wrote all those pages I don't I don't know I mean I really don't know chemically how the addiction part of it works but I know I am a victim yeah well the addiction parts pretty clearly documented in that movie with what the fuck's his name inside man guy from gladiator Russell what the fuck yeah The Insider yeah inside man's different movie right what the fuck's his name I was trying to grow up Russell Crowe gladiator dude that guy he was yeah I didn't see it I think I don't want to know I think I like train uh scientist in the movie yeah and they're try kill him because he's releasing all the information apparently that's like hundreds and hundreds of different chemicals the FDA has improved cigarette companies to add cigarettes just to get a more addictive yeah it's interesting too because I'll have like a I'll put out a cigarette in a glass of waters and then and then I get nervous if the water would tobacco and it touches my skin like I get like I have this like paranoid but I'm like I'll literally inhale every chemical deep into my lungs into my veins but I get nervous about like touching uh tobacco a water that's so weird man what is it about like maybe like bringing it into your lungs you're not saying it so it doesn't freak you out as much there's a I never thought I could be in as much sort of denial about something as I am about smoking but I enjoy it a lot right now and I also started late I started late how old were you I I smoked real real casually through my 20s and then I started a job at like twenty nine thirty I'm 35 and that's when I really started that's when I started smoking during the day and like writing and smoking OH before that you would smoke at night only smoke it like a party with a drink or something when did you notice that it had crossed over into a part of you um I think just a couple years into uh I was writing on not two Broke Girls and I was smoking at every possible break and it just started to pick up where any opportunity to go outside and smoke I took and then I couldn't stop yeah I hate to be that proselytizing health guy you ever tried dip that'd be good no I'm gonna I want to try some stuff I just you know I want to try it I can't even even allowed to like you know I'm on a lot of like antidepressants and stuff so they don't want me to take the medication that helps you stop or any of that gums and said it's all supposed to fuck up your brain chemicals oh really yeah have weird you're on a lot of antidepressants I mean I'm on a I'm on a like to talk about happy hour cocktail well I'm smoking weed come on I'm gonna I'm gonna a nice uh you know cocktail of of stuff stuff what is the stuff um right now what am i a like a effexor it's like kind of the main you know things are sort of dabbled in there just it depends on the Tommy you get on different things different entire uh summer in summer Bella England almost twenty years of being on stuff I've been switched around a few times to twenty years he started in high school yeah Henry Rollins got put on my life in high school I'm sure a hundred percent like not yeah I mean it was where the the turn I mean I I got a couple of instances of I don't want to do this anymore I want to be on it anymore tried to go off and realize I needed it but you know high school was the biggest turnaround John eighty the stress of I don't know I was I was just a mess and then some doctor you know after a year of being a mess was like try this and so you were suicidal uh yeah yeah sixteen you know moved around every year was just a you know a chaotic that always fucks people up but it always creates interesting people everybody I know that's interesting had some sort of a weird childhood with moved around a lot by the way how annoying is it when someone starts making a point while they're holding the joint is a very important point I'm gonna make right yeah you also know you're not getting that joint till the end of the point you have to sit there like fixated like a dog waiting for a treat you know but yeah I moved I lived with my mom till I was like fo 1415 and then I lived with her sister and I lived with my dad sister I lived with some family friends I live with my dad for the first time when I was like 17 and I just bounced around LA Connecticut Oregon Jesus and and I was uh just brutally depressed and couldn't you know it mean obviously there were big environmental factors but at the end of the day it just it was uh more than more than therapy and so your life was the plot of the movie Twilight never saw it should I see it oh for sure it's classic it is a classic now right Twilight Twilight is a movie that was fucking massive yeah massive yeah and now never discussed never discussed not discussed at all like people will talk about Star Wars to the end of fucking time no one's gonna talk about Twilight in a couple of year now they're just not going to there might be like a 20-year reunion where all the girls who watched when they were 13 go see it again yes sure but there's gonna be a bunch of people like what the fuck was wrong with what did we do like what happened as a culture what happened as a society when we decided that all sudden vampires allowed to go out in the day werewolves have abs they can change to a wolf whatever the fuck they want like what are you doing wasn't there a lot of vampire shows for a minute - or yeah Drogo out - yes everybody was crazy on vampires zamp zombies are dead to me they dig they're dead boring is fuck you try to put out a zombie movie now nobody gives a shit like oh I get it it's gonna walk slow and you're gonna get away and the people that you really like are gonna live Z boring like here's the here's the movies about it's they're not zombies are you excited now yes oh good yes and the old me no no the movie is it's about a guy and his daughter becomes a zombie he loves his daughter but she's home big Kevin there's an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie like that oh that was always as sad as the saddest part of a walking dead was when you realize like someone had like their daughter chained up in a room because he couldn't you know bring himself to you know put a spike through her head so they just he just kept the zombie daughter oof oof you know what's fucked up that is not entirely impossible it's entirely impossible that the bodies would stay active like long after their deteriorating that shows been going on for years these zombies been alive eating nothing from your no digestive tract somehow another flesh stays on their bones their tissue allows the body to keep moving it's ridiculous right that they even have anything in their brain at all that allows them to keep moving but as far as like a disease that changes the host and makes the host supervise its fuckin rabies rabies on steroids very possible very possible with all the horrible things that happen to like all these different animals in terms like parasites getting their system and forced them to commit suicide and all no you ever seen that aquatic worm one it gets it to a grasshopper and then talks the grasshopper into jumping into water and drowning so we could pop out of its body no develops in its body and then like the alien and the movie alien the universe out of the chest literally rips out of the things body in the water and then it that's how it gets born like it gets into the Grasshoppers body and then rewires the grasshoppers brain when it's time to hatch and convinces this fuck to jump into the water mm-hmm it's the beauty of childbirth so well you can live you can make a bunch of kids you look Duggars but they have like honey they're not a single time they've been drowned but if you stop and think about that being real like how weird is it the idea of a person becoming a zombie that's not that's not any weird at all are you becoming some super hyper aggressive thing like a rabid dog that's not we're not look at this thing come out of its body I don't like it there's I'm ready this is this is horrific it's shoot the grass I was just gutted and this thing now is swimming around in the water and there's a ton of those there's a ton of those there's something one that happens with ants and a wasp I forget who takes over who but there's there's God find that one is an ants I think I want to say that the ants take over the wasp like a lot of them something happens where they rewired sprays at a botfly um worm wolf or him coming out of rabbit oh Jesus that was one of the things in that movie rats did you ever see that movie rats is no but it looks like documentary that thing's huge holy shit that's a wolf worm whoo it looks like a grocer like Groundhog Day thing it looks like the first two digits of your pinkie like it's literally that big right he might of a rabbit um but the that documentary on Netflix rats was all about how many rats live in like New York City and urban areas fucking insane documentary I can't recommend it enough like I always kind of knew there was a lot of rats in New York and hear the numbers but when you see like guys for exterminators or people who work with rats and they go down in the basement it's like there is an underbelly to New York City and a lot of other cities to Los Angeles for sure where swarms of rodents are underneath the city swarms more than there are people probably there's no way for them to count they do rough estimates they really have no idea but you see them everywhere they've got cameras that are dipped into probes and their smartest shit but one of them on this botfly and they pulled this botfly out of its body it's like if you were carrying a football in one of your tits like literally just they'd pull this thing out of its body pulled it out of its neck actually it's fucking you it's like as big as its neck almost yeah I'm not into I'm not I'm not I'm a real I'm a real pussy when it comes to bugs and you should be they're terrifying they're the worst I saw a spider in Arizona last week that was I mean it was half my fist I was really gonna exos she'll like ask it like it like it was wearing armor horrific what kind was it I don't know dead stupid a no just whomp guys kill it for you strongly I couldn't I why I'm not gonna go to bed with a without their living with a bug somewhere in my house yeah there's a there's a lot of weird shit Doug's area and duh that's right that's where I shot over uh Bisbee area he's right next to Mexico he's like knocking on Mexico's door you can run to Mexico like literally ya know in John of those spiders had papers yes bail dad Paul Bill Pat whoa just let the Mexicans in everybody relax that's a terrifying when you leave his area and then you got to pull over and stop and they ask you if you're a meckley if you're another acting citizen yeah that's weird there you go yes I know a dude who has a ranch and it's in South Texas and they find dead people on their ranch sometimes where people try to cross paths now they just die of dehydration yeah out the desert fuck that's a hard way to go and then these ranchers just find them you know scary shit and you don't know who it I mean the other thing is like it for him and his his place like you don't know if this guy's going to be a nice guy just trying to come over here get a job or if this guy's a drug runner and a murderer like you really don't know you just know there's a person in your ranch that's not supposed to be there and they might not even speak English like whoo trying to think of something I would die to get to I don't it seems to me to be here a lot of people get mad at me when I say this one we say it anyway I think it's got something that's going to go away the idea of countries and you can only go one place like you're born on this patch of dirt you can only stay on this patch of dirt it's an impediment to progress and it's an impediment to quality and I think that we're going to come a day where people just gonna be able to travel anywhere they want and we're not going to look at it like cities and we're not gonna look at it in terms of like you know you're if you live in Boston you can move to Cleveland if you live in Cleveland you can move to my right you can move you move wherever you want but as soon as you have a country you can't move you have two papers you got to get proof well what kind of job do you have Morgan are you a you do have a specific skill that would benefit America and instead of the rest of our sloppy have them don't you jack shit are you better than the average person why she would let you in we only want to let quality people in that's it I would never be able to prove myself in that moment as being worthy of getting into any country they have a witness skill it's like exceptional skill yeah person of exceptional skill it just seems it seems fucked like I don't know just seems barbaric like it really does and I know people are good man she's fucking you gotta understand American sovereignty it's very important that we keep the rest of world's fucked up we've managed to figure we got lucky we got lucky we got shit out on the right patch of dirt yeah sure and we got we have resources and a lot of other countries don't have and I don't know III love to travel internationally I love you know putting myself in places that are you know that that don't have what we have if that makes sense like I and just your perspective I enjoy the provide enjoy making a vacation sort of a combination of pleasure and perspective as much as I can and going places that you know make you realize what you have at home or not if it holds do you think that it holds back both sides do you think it holds back Mexico that the United States is so difficult to get into and it's always a just despair of certain people trying to get into Mexico and trying to get an American can't what I was going to get out is I think that it's kind of similar in some way and I might be off what's similar in some way to making drugs illegal mm-hmm like you make drugs illegal then you create this artificial there this demand this increased demand and then it's outlawed so only people that are willing to break the law sell it and so you the this criminal enterprise attached to something that should be perfectly legal right if you really yeah coming you're already breaking the law bike bike bike coming here right so are you a person who's going to break the law right you're gonna be a person I think I also profit off of it but right like one of those carriers right yeah I don't know I I grew up in LA and I think I had a I didn't realize that it was illegal you know as a kid you don't know laws or rules or anything so I I just assumed that Mexico and California because I would you know most almost kids who went to school with for mexican't like I just assumed that it was like a place where people live in both places and you go back and forth a lot and you know the Mexican culture was so sort of the whole my whole backdrop of my childhood was painted with that so I just kind of assumed that you went where you wanted to yeah and like that la was mostly Mexican and that was fine yeah it should be fine right and people were looking to come out we were taking our jobs you're gonna come over and ruin our quality 11 or is it all gonna even out like maybe it just evens out it's in that possible like yeah I also you know I mean it's it's a beyond cliche to say but are they are people taking jobs that Americans are dying to do now yeah well see and also if they come over here and they just come over here then you have to pay them the same array it's like you have to pay them same rate that everybody gets pictures there's wage limits its minimum wage like if you have them illegal you pay them whatever the fuck you want mm-hmm and they do that's like the big house keeper dilemma how can that how the fucker housekeepers asking for a raise did I ask her for a raise I can't say shit every time the word housekeeper comes out of my mouth I like I get a little I get a little red a little embarrassed cuz I have a housekeeper now I never had you know I mean I should feel bad it doesn't make me feel bad I I absolutely I couldn't love her more and she's very much become kind of a pseudo mother figure of mine in LA I don't have family here really and but I also feel like that makes me sound like a pretentious white person who's taking care of a person of color hmm it like it really it really it's not it's not comfortable subject for me to talk about and yet I couldn't be more like earnestly grateful and thankful and I couldn't adore her more and and really she helps me function in life and yet the varies the subject is you know I mean I didn't grow up with that kind of stuff so it's it's interesting to person it's embarrassing well as long as you farewell and you're nicer it's just a job you know as long as she enjoys doing the job and she gets paid well yeah just a job is something wrong with being a garbage man yeah wrong with any job yeah I mean I you know she's known me through apartment and that you know so it's interesting when someone just a part of your life and and seems to care about you more than you even think they should that makes like she well you're her boss I'm her boss but you she's any person in my home and you know I trust her but she also seems to care about me in this way she wants me to have a kid like she's like it's all these things that you're you know I don't really talk to my Ma's like I have this housekeepers like you should have a baby and then I'll take care of she's like a plan for my whole life well I don't do it listen to her it sounds like you've got some sort of a partner yeah a life partner I do have a life partner Shiraz carries a life partner I don't know it's it's a it's always a touchy subject because there's historically been people that have come from other places and they've emigrated into places and then you know they create neighborhoods and they there are certain class of people initially then they move through society and I mean my people have experience at the Italians like when my grandfather came over here there was all these like negative stereotypes for Italians and there's all these slurs like these to call him a Guinea wop and all these different that were like hurtful like today if you call someone a Guinea no one like I would say I'm a guinea like nobody gives a shit yeah talk call Sebastian a Guinea like you up like it doesn't bother anybody you know it's like it became they became a class of people that normalized they just they fit they fit in with like regular white people yeah Tolly uns were not considered white people the same way a lot of people for the Middle East that I'd like the same skin tone are considered white people by some people today you know but if they if there was more if it became just a normal part like Irish people mm-hmm game your Irishman I'm worse woman an Irish woman if they could only become white people have to just figured out a way to get white to get whiter we should just just gotta be aware this moving to Oregon and while they evolved a lot of Sun they will evolve into being white people yeah I don't know I just think you know anytime you restrict things that should be normal like moving to a better smile so you can't move to a better spot like oh I can't what if I buy a house in that spot nope can't move to that spot well I mean it's it's sort of arbitrating like how do you there's some I'm very fascinated by like migration in general of like towns where are you're encouraged to stay like that so it's very interesting to me like don't leave don't leave don't leave don't leave like what if you were told you can't stay you have to leave and you have to go populate this other area like what's the difference you know just were we're choosing where people can live and we don't know what would be the best place for them we don't know if the best place for them is right next door to you even if you don't want it I was watching a guy on TV they were doing this interview with him he was a coffee farmer in Hawaii and he started out as a 15 year old in America so he's been in America from the time he's 15 he was in his 40s now he has a family he's been in America for us more than I think I think they were saying like 30 years okay so this guy wife family worked his way up from being a worker at this coffee farm to owning the fucking coffee farm I think he owned it sounds better if I say you owned a maybe the manager he was it a big job he's a big man at the coffee farm and they're kicking him out they're moving him to Mexico they're exporting Jesus and he just got some stay some you know where they allowed him to stay like a couple more months to appeal his case but when I like Jesus Christ the guy did it yeah came he came over here he was 15 he's a part of America now he's 30-something years old or 40 years old whatever the fuck he is he could have already served time from for murder he could have done a full like Genesis done it's his time positively he's actually doing well he's doing what you want he's being a productive member societies employing other people he's making coffee which I'm not gonna fucking grow coffee someone to grow that goddamn coffee that guys doing a great job he's that's a fucking American it is make a move it's crazy it's like make you move to where you you moved around a lot where the fuck were you and you're 15 I was in Connecticut yeah you're in Connecticut I'm in Massachusetts we have to move imagine thugs come knocking on our door with combat boots on holding guns and say listen Morgan you got to move you can't stay in California anymore it's too many people in California you got to go back back to the East Coast it's insane it's the same thing that they're doing it it's inside it's it's I don't I mean I don't know I don't I don't get it but I went on you were when we did the the end of the world podcast you guys did that one I remember coming out at the end hammered hammered hammered as I say hammered since I had been hammered since Florida results came inside everything was already done and I show up and it's a you know a murderer's row on stage and I get there and I have no I have only feelings I have no nothing in my brain is working to connect pieces or really be you know remotely sort of eloquent I just came out and I was like eyes is bad for people and everyone's gonna be races that we you know people should be able to do what they want like I had charity on I started making out did we you don't remember that I didn't make out just kidding yeah searching the same thing as anybody but but but burr just hammered me I mean he came back with with you know basically I felt there was like a lot of energy that I came in with the worst thing that's ever happened just happened that was my energy and I felt like there was a lot of you know don't they don't you know it might not be that bad well energy that night and I think what's really going on but this is what's really going on first of all you got a bunch of comics in front of an audience right that's the number one thing that's happening this fucking election is to us to me and burr and anybody else was there it's like this is an opportunity to talk shit okay and the fact that there's an election when I like will deal with the consequences of Donald Trump being president later but right now we're here to make people laugh and have fun and yeah burr is on fire he was on I was on fire he was he shines and those things like no one yeah he was just like one after the other smash there's a video online you can get on YouTube that's like the best of Bill burr at the end of the world podcast yeah he's just slaying oh no it was came in like and I like threw a cup of gasoline on the fire with my opinions I was like yeah but it's not really in a Pam units like you have to understand from the perspective of Forbes I'm not saying you have to understand but the people listening right like when any would do something like that there's a bunch of comics and there's an audience like we're not we're not always going to deal with what's going on we're not gonna be somber to really be considering the fact that okay well now we don't have a president anymore we've just elected a buffoon to the the biggest popularity contest in the world it's what we did right a popular person won now and now we're fucked and he's an egomaniac and now he's in charge of the nukes congratulate you fire the FBI guy look at that you just let a reality star just start firing the people that you need for critical intelligence people that have been involved the intelligence industry and the intelligence community for decade after decade after decade you let this reality star to start firing people it's nuts but it was also the best place I could ended up that night like I can't imagine having spent I mean III I think I went to bed it like she got together with Jen Kirkman 7:00 a.m. one time I looked into her Twitter and I was like I just gotta stay away you guys are freaking me the fuck out like Jesus this is a bad system it's been a bad system since people figured out how to make phone calls you know as soon as people figured out how to make phone calls you didn't have to get a guy on a fucking horse that carries your vote and your your request for sovereignty in your personal state by a messenger that has to take it to some fucking representative US and take it to Congress on this fucking boat like you don't have to do that anymore so since we don't have to do this anymore this idea of one person running the whole shebang through a representative of each individual state it's archaic its communication is too good now the bottleneck is the system the system needs to be redesigned it needs to be redesigned it's not impossible no one's saying we shouldn't have government I'm not an anti-government purple purple purple person it's like I'm not an anti-military person or an anti-police person I just think it almost imagine an engineer the right way like you can't have just complete anarchy in this country but we have to have the will of the people and right now it's definitely not the will of the people this is just some weird system that someone's figured out a way to win and then once they're in the system we're realizing all the flaws of the system people are waiting and getting firing like well this is not the most efficient way to run this thing right but there's no there's no it within the system there is no here's how you change the system like that has not established then you have to do that in a way that doesn't you know make everybody implode the system the design of the system and this is more than I've paid attention more to the political system in the last two years and I think I have my entire life but there's all these checks and balances that are in place to sort of prevent someone who's a reputable person getting into a position of power and then changing everything there's enough checks and balances to keep that in place and I think that's important and that's a beautiful thing and having all these representatives that represent both conservative and liberal attitudes kind of keeps things in balance a certain extent but it's not the best way to do it now the best way to do it would be to get a guy like Elon Musk and say hey man the way you figured out how to put fucking tunnels under the earth where the cars go on sleds and that eliminates all the traffic in LA and the way to figured out how to make like a solar box that sits in a garage on the wall and it powers your whole house from the roof and way to figured out how to make roof shingles that are actually solar power ready to figured out how to make an electric car then go 350 miles how about tell us our friend this thing right you're definitely smarter than me yeah I mean with people so it does he make the decisions it like cuz I always think about like when they change rules and major league sports I always find it like interesting like that group of people got together and like that what is it over time football overtime shortened now and they like like I know now it's ten minutes now it's five minutes yeah we all just go okay like who's who's the board who's the person who gets to say okay now this is the way that the government works I mean that's its own process well footballs very good obviously but it's a game and you're trying to make the game better and more exciting if they were just trying to fuck with people and make politics more exciting maybe that would be more that maybe that would work I just make it how do we make them better how do we make this better how do we make people like this more how do we make people feel like they're involved how do we do this but again using like changing the rules it seems like that I just don't I don't know how long something like that takes is it is it over generations is it tomorrow the rules are this I mean how do you do that I think you make people Park at the bottom of a hill and you put the voting booth at the very top of the hill and only the people that can actually like unless you're physically handicapped then you get a pass then we'll figure out another test for you but only to fit people to figure out to get their fucking lazy ass to the top of that hill mm-hmm those the only ones get to vote huh fine by me but that's the thing is that you got to tell somebody whether or that hope they say all right I'll probably say all right Mountain hikers are just gonna run the world Alex Honnold is gonna be our president that rock climber dude he's going to be number one I just think that if we just come up with an alternative system that so many designs and we slowly implement it like in stages you know every time someone doesn't like something it that's it everyone is so aggressively angry now and everyone is kind of a you know on the on the and the precipice of snapping and I feel like any kind of suggested change to a lot of people is is terrifying it is terrifying and it should be because if somebody fucks it up and Putin's this whole thing you know that could be a big goddamn disaster too that's always possible like this is as close as that's come with this is as close as it's come to something where he's got a 33 percent approval rate or something like that because except the poll that he found say 50 percent yeah what is that hilarious that you can put up a picture that says 50 percent of the people like me and they'd be like whoa he's really doing a great job like you're never gonna see a president with a hundred percent approval rate it does not exist so tragic them he is he is I can't think of a time my brain has been this consumed by by a president like uh you know positive or negative I mean I you know I I liked Obama but I never thought about him as much as I think about Trump even if you have like things like vitamins vitamins would not have a 100% proved or a right there's people that would like fuck vitamins I don't even need them they suck and you did give it a well like actual Western medicine doesn't have a hundred percent approval there are people who go like no I don't want any treatment for my cancer I'm gonna well that's because there is alternatives and there are there are some people that believe that you can do more work like to cure or to halt cancer in its tracks by altering your diet proving your immune system I believe that more than like a you know know the Lord will or will provide my medicine but I think more and more doctors are acutely aware of the factor that nutrition plays I think the change they make changes to people not just like give them drugs and give them you know anti-cancer medication but there's doctors now more increasingly more and more that want you to hey oh you drink too much stop drinking I smoking cigarettes we definitely gotta smoke stop smoking cigarettes we got to eat to eat healthy look here's what's important I feel like you're directly talking right now until I hmm I just think that uh you have to pay attention to doctors too like these motherfuckers might have figured out a way to cure your cancer you got to listen and I can't listen to the holistic healer lady that has incense burning in her fucking house listen to smells a bit chilly maybe low from column a got to be careful those patchouli smelling motherfuckers I just did some weird I did a colonic at some you know the hippie ranch type place dude you gotta pipe up your eyes and add a pipe up my ass wasn't like it was uh it was oddly oddly positive experience and I didn't think it would be I know Sugoi I was in Bisbee around Doug's place and I you know took off for the day and got a colonic Wow have you done that before is it on a whim Semyon a went now it was like yeah yeah I called the pilot I was looking for healthy things to do in the desert and that was one of them what percentage of people take colonics on a whim like what percentage is it even ten where people would just walk just cheat look you know it'd be fun we should really yeah I don't think there's a lot of colonics ways are like advertised for foot traffic so come on and we'll stick a pipe up your ass but I try you know it's that thing where I'm not like you I don't have a I don't have a healthy lifestyle so I find myself hitting walls and then reaching kind of grasping for activities that seem healthy and enjoyable which is why I've like you know I took all those is a boxing surfing I'll go play basketball you know it's but I don't do it as consistently as I ought to that's why it's always impressive to see you you know peak form constantly do things you like doing it's I do that's at you know I like to like sport I love sports that's a great way to stay yeah stay healthy for me I found out somewhere along the line though it fit for me to be better at certain sports hmm I have to do shit I don't want to do yeah like lift weights run hills like stuff like that like if you don't do those things you don't have like if you want it you want to make an analogy to machines like you have a weird opportunity with your body where say if you're in a race you can turn your body into a sports car like you can literally turn your body into something that does something a regular car can't do move faster could pick up more it can explode you can make corners better like you can do that to your body you can give your body balance like you take a yoga class two days a week for four months don't tell me your body's not better it's going to move better absolutely more balanced you're going to be able to change the suspension on your car literally by putting in the work but the work and suck a fat one Sarge oh dude so hard anything but you got to get excited about doing hard shit icon I get excited about I get excited about the the prospect of getting in better shape after the age I am now than I was before I get excited about being that person that I've seen happen like I've seen people do that get in better shape after 35 I guess I can do it but I'd be doing it I'm thrilling but I can't you know it's getting there we don't want it bad enough rocky I know I know I know there's no tomorrow it's my favorite yeah you know what you got to do what is the big one for everybody for everybody listening write down shit you have to do I do it I write down things I need to work on things I'm gonna do yeah like I wrote down my schedule for the week I wrote down like this week I'm going to lift weights three days a week I'm going to run two days a week and I'm gonna do yoga two days a week and period like there's no no negotiation so I have to do those things so that I'll do that for the week and then I'll make sure I make those checks off there's a lot of times where I want to fuck off but I know I have to make my schedule I have to get it in if I don't get it in then I fucked up like I gave myself like a schedule and but then I get things done and it doesn't seem any more stressful in fact it seems less stressful because I don't have to like hem and haw over whether I'm gonna do something like I have it written down I have to do it and then I just go do it sounds I'll do that then you gotta just write it down stick the script because as a comic one of the best things about us is that we're impulsive and that we like to blow things off and we like to question the validity of certain actions like why am i doing that fuck that how about I just jerk off and take a nap or whatever you do you know I mean that's what we do right people are impulsive and that's why the reasons why you're funny because you come up with a thought that maybe other people wouldn't entertain yeah I mean I I you know it's it's just a mat once I'm once I'm in once I have once I got some downhill motion I'm you know why keep going yeah that's it's the moment yeah it's the initial start I used to go boxing like every day for years few years you know down in New York right no I was out here as a go to the wild card like every day for like right and then uh Morgan Murphy's a big fucking boxing fan you know have conversations about BA you know a lot shit uh yeah I used to come and no more I mean I had embarrassed with the sports stuff because I'm such a fan but I'm not a by any means a statistician I'm not a good remember of even names I just obsessively watch sports there's not colors and hours now hurts it a but it's not funny though like if you're talking about like a television show mm-hmm like yeah yeah I saw that show well it made me that's good show you know who's who was the main character and lost what was his name again and what was that you know it's no shame in that right but a basketball game from the same time like who was in the finals yeah well I can think of like fights I've been to and then I can't even think of I'm like I know who won the fight I don't I don't remember they finally Kovalev Andre Ward this weekend I watched a little I listened to a lot about it but I missed it that's the other thing too is I've watched I stay home and watch so much shit I mean you know I love spars I find it to be the most soothing like I hate i if I'm if I'm at a job you know writing something all day I look at my sport schedule that night and I get excited that oh I have a thing to do at 8:00 you know after my work is done like I just I wrap my days around it so I'm trying to go out and do more shit as opposed to being locked in locked into a schedule that's determined by what's boxing matches on and I used to stay home to watch everything and I didn't for that one yeah I hear you you get you know it comes in waves right but I listen to allow mean I you know I have opinions about it having not seen it it just seems you still have opinions like uneducated one well I from what not just from watching what I'm seeing what I did see I feel like I was like like I get mad about deserts or damages oh really okay did you see the Kovalev ward yeah and I joined as an early stop it was definitely nervous dog which I don't think he thought I should someone's on his way down and here's the question though did he have a standing eight-count rule like I don't know if there's a standing 8-count role in that fight like see if there was find out there was feel like there was I feel like that's what should have happened if it happened but in some fights I believe they don't have to have a standing eight count that correct me if I'm wrong I don't think that's the case in all fights and I think in some championship fights they don't have a standing eight count and I think that's a speculate or a specification right put that I don't know I just seems like an obvious stipulation yeah I mean the last fight I'm trying to think of a lie maybe we'll find out yeah I made uh I made uh I was in Arizona during the Canelo the Shabbos fight and I made everybody watch it that wasn't a good one it was a bad one and it was the worst part about it was that everyone knew I was the reason the fight was on Oh No so everyone it was a it was like I couldn't every round I wanted to be exciting because I wanted people to not get mad at me for ruining their night but instead I was responsible for a boring night well I was like I enjoyed it even though I was boring I just wanted to see who's gonna fight love ken and that was my that was my sort of you know my horse in the race was whoever was going to win was gonna fry my favorite fighter but most people thought Canelo was gonna win pretty shortly but the problem was that like Chavez didn't really want to put himself out there he's but if Chavez has never been a great he's never been I don't think his trainings ever been right as disciplined as some the Canelo is about that life yeah right I mean he's trying to be the best ever yeah it's trying to be the best it's hard to be I can't even demeanor vina being a rich kid boxer just feels like is he born a rich kid well I mean Chavez Jr me he's oh I thought you saw him eikenella oh no no no I was just saying that that you know just that just seems like a hard place to come from oh yeah and he's you know his dad is the fucking greatest of all time Julio Cesar Chavez it's arguably the greatest Mexican fighter of all time means he's up there I saw I saw Chavez Jr fightin um at the Staples Center and they brought his dad out for sounds like it's like always like just the poor shadow you got to be in that your daddy gets honored before your fight it's rough but you know what there's this guy Kron Gracie and his dad is Hicks and Gracie who's like the greatest jujitsu guy a long time and the son is a world champion yeah fuckin beast he's one of the best guys on the planet Earth like legitimately 100% self-motivated not like you know does need to it's not like the same sort of Shabbos situation right so it doesn't always happen that way but it seems like fighting and Jeff hunger for fighting tends to come from a place of poverty I mean it tends to yeah but again it doesn't have to no no but I mean even like even you didn't marry like you know uh what was his name it's like Rust Belt dude Rust Belt no yeah the guy is American dude who uh I was freaking I can't remember his name he's from Kelly Pavlik was it Kelly yeah yeah yeah right with my wrong my gosh a white guy shaved head yeah I had a moment bad motherfucker bad motherfucker he just ran into Bernard Hopkins Bernard Hopkins had him figured out well just tuned him up ya know I like what brought a blog article about that yeah about that fight because was just a masterful performance by Hopkins if the Hopkins I was actually coming home from a UFC fight overseas I was in Europe when I watched that fight I was like that motherfucker so good I gotta say I've been watching I've been watching but I don't know who I'm rooting for oh you're root for people I just like I I don't know who I don't know who's who I feel I have like I think why I just started even watching hockey it's like I played so many sports as a kid like I can get into the sports I know about but when I don't know anything about it it's like it's like we're gonna I was like doing anything else I'm uncomfortable getting into something that I come from such a such a huge blind spot about right I'm just like how am I gonna learn everything immediately I try to get Ian Edwards to school me on soccer I didn't last a few weeks we even talked about doing a soccer companion he took me to a bar once we're sitting there watching some games like some big-time soccer game it was pretty good it's fun it's fun being next to Ian cuz he knows every yeah he knows as much about soccers I know about MMA yeah he just rattling off who this guy is and what this team's about and what their scores and he has a soccer podcast too that he does I forget who he does it with you remember who he does it with I love that dude I love him he's the best huh such a nice guy he's the most underrated comic alive he's so funny I you know I quoted a joke of his and in the writers room at 2 Broke Girls and my boss was like whose joke is that and I was like Ian Edwards and he hired him screamo yeah it was like it was uh it was it was but it was just like oh yeah Ian's got this joke and everyone was fucking dying I selfishly don't want anybody to ever hire him as a writer again I want him to just do stand-up I think that's what he's doing I mean I think he just was a little short gig but ya know he does him every now and then but I I just feel like people don't know how fucking good he is he's so good he's any such a good guy yeah just one of the best guys ever true what do you think about this Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather fight I mean it's a spectacle I guess I'm excited I'm excited about it but I feel like it's going to be another big notch and Mayweather's belt and I don't think he needs another one like I just I get a little bit uh I get it I I respectfully Mayweather's a boxer but it's not the kind of boxing I get excited about watching even though I know it's technically you know it's good amazing it's gonna be a boxing match yeah for sure it's going to be an actual 12 round boxing match so we're gonna get to see some sort of an athletic competition um but I just don't see ya sorry I just don't I don't see how McGregor can be better than the best boxers in the world who have tried yeah he won't be he won't be better than the best boxers in the world but what he might do first of all he's definitely gonna make it exciting yes gonna love the trash talk is gonna be amazing it's gonna be epic yeah it's gonna be a fun spectacle and he has legitimate scary one-punch power and he's way bigger so it's all about whether or not he can hit mayweather when are they fighting at 150 something I don't know that's a good question - how much weight does he have to lose how much is fuller gonna make him dehydrate himself and even give a fuck does he even respect his skills enough to make him dehydrate himself like he did with Canelo because he made Canelo cut a shitload of weight sure I think you mean a fight at 150 si correct fly out what Floyd Mayweather made Canelo Alvarez fight because Canelo is a big fella yeah I've seen him in person him getting on the 150s or rough rough suck I think that um it's always scary when you look at these days and they just look emaciated before the fear of like Chavez I mean you know he's a tall guy so he's one of the worst I ever saw was when Conor mated to 140 five we fought all those like Jesus Christ like he looks so gone and dried up at the weigh-ins and then the next day looks like a guerrilla Canelo came in at 152 it says okay and this fight is at 154 it is at 154 that's what they're making it interesting okay well Connors not gonna have a hard time making 154 now this is Canelo weighed in at 168 no that was his last fight with Chavez Jr Chavez Jr he fought above his weight class actually Chavez Jr I think it was fighting 175 wasn't he he came down maybe they maybe there was a normal wait for Chavez Jr oh this was for the 30-day way and when he fought me with her Oh 33 days out yeah month out you say was 160 6.8 yeah well they had stipulations in the contract like how big he could be at certain points you know just dirty they just wanted to dry him out I mean I'm except what's the what it were that what's the whole Cardinal I mean is it are they gonna have all boxing under brushes it's good question I think I feel fun to do a little only way this fight is going to be interesting skill wise yeah is if Connor figures out a way to maul him he's almost got to like close the distance quick get him up against the ropes and just hit him with like shots while he's holding him he's almost got to clip him in some sort of weird awkward like Maidana like exchange you ever seen a fight with my Donald Floyd hat but Floyd got clipped by a big overhand right I think it was at the end of one of the rounds like very end of the round his legs dipped like wow little jig a little little wobbly got a little dead and it's just because he got mauled it wasn't because skill-wise he was commensurate and then when Floyd came back in the rematch he just boxed his face off just fucked him up because he just wanted to let him know like look dude I barely took you serious in that first fight it got close but it only got close cuz like this slop he brought he just put a skill clinic on him in the second fight sacrified wasn't even close I think that that's the only cut but that's not how Conor normally fight sound like a swarming face-first brawler type dude he's a guy is like cautious about getting hit yeah and I'm thrilled about it but I'm also I I wish I wish I I wish I knew more about your side of the tracks well we don't know enough about Connor because Connor has never had a professional boxing right you know and the thing is you see his striking but you only see striking when he's working on kicks and wrestling and all the other shit too what if he just kicked him like with that I mean just just to do it just to let him know just to do it it would be fucked up he fucked up but it would be hilarious laughing you'd probably is probably some stipulations the contracts say can't get him in an armbar or choke him I think just kicking him in the head and knocking him out would be worth losing all the money and then getting more money out could you imagine he would be a goddamn folk hero if they got in close if they got a nose and Floyd was like sucking and Jukka on the outside and he threw a jab to cover up a left high kick and that left high kick next I'm just dying yeah can you see Floyd go limp and he would go limp he never been high kicked like that Jesus that would be crazy because if he didn't know it was coming yeah he could clip him with it like if you had no idea if you hid a kick behind a punch like fighters a lot of fighters do they like throw a punch literally to cover your face so the kick is behind it already and in boom the kick comes like why your vision is already you're thinking about the next punch bang the kick lands and you get Kayode happens all the time if he did that I'll be insane what have you worth it he would but it would fuck up everything up because no one would ever trust another fighter from MMA to ever fight a boxer in a boxing match again because we've only had the opposite happen really good day after this could they do an MMA fight with the two of them no no oh my god it was last 30 seconds maximum let's if Connor wanted to give them an ear beating for 28 minutes seconds look Connor is so much better as a wrestler as a submission artist as a kicker there's just no way he'll he'll hit them with spinning elbows and shit like these things you can't do in a boxing match that you're not expecting and if someone just kicks your legs once you're going to be like oh my god what the fuck now I'm not saying away to more money out of out of what's going on I mean you know the only what's going to come in hundreds and hundreds and millions of dollars yes fire is the only way this is the only way but this is a giant big difference though Floyd would have to learn how to fight MMA style he would have to learn how to stop takedowns uh-huh he'd have to learn how to check leg kicks and you have to learn how to defend submissions and that will take years and he's not gonna do that forty years old I don't know what he knows now as far as wrestling defense and what he knows about kickboxing or jujitsu or anything else I don't know what he knows but if he knows nothing he's a hundred percent fucked 100 percent bet the house on it fucked like Conor might win a boxing match I mean maybe there's like a small percentage chance that he just runs in there and clips Floyd with a big shot and rocks them and then takes him out I don't know what that percentage is but you ask a boxing expert there's like four percent five percent right that's what a boxing expert would say which I'm not but I'm an MMA expert and if they fought in an MMA fight it's 100 percent the Conor would fuck him up 100 percent no ifs no ands no buts no chance no chance Conor is going to be farther away from Mayweather than anyone has ever hit him and he's going to be kicking him in the stomach in the legs you know soften him up in the rounds of five minutes long and eventually he gets a clinch and when he gets a clinch Mayweather is fucked he's going to the ground he's not going to be able to stop it he's gonna get mounted he's gonna get elbows force-fed into his eye socket his nose his mouth his jaw the sides of his head his ears he's gonna get elbowed in the ear he's going to get punches dropped down on him when he's totally pinned down and defenseless he's gonna have a knee on one of his mind SEPs while those guys literally on top of him pounding him in the face and he won't be able to get up he won't be able to stop the crucifix he won't be able to stop anything he'll be tied up and smashed on the ground until he decides to choke him so he's be completely defenseless so in that sense the the odds would be insane if Mayweather decided in the next two months because the fights gonna take place in August if he decided in the next two months which by the way I feel like it's soon am i right I feel like it's very quick it's very quick it's not maybe it's on two so maybe they've been negotiating for a long time but at least Conner knows something about boxing or this could be a thing but if they just took it from now and said too much from now you're gonna have an MMA fight holy shit the odds would be a hundred thousand to one like if you asked like any real MMA expert they'd be like what how fucked is it 100% fucked 100% fucked and boxing experts think that Mayweather is a hundred percent fucked but they'll give them affords my slight chance you never know it's crazy people with thrown punches you never know because Mayweather can throw a punch for sure and Conor can throw a punch for sure right who knows what happens who knows most likely though me whether out boxes them but you could see Khan and landing something crazy it's he's just the hardest person to lie it's not just that he's the great so he said he's the hardest person to land a punch against that's why it does it yeah just he's the best defensive boxer ever yeah that's why it's boring it's not I mean it is it is but anyway I don't find it boring on a technical level I find it boring unlike a social like I like the social element around a fight and the excitement and yes very good way to put it is it's not a good he's not like the best you know you can't look at your pizza while you're eating it cuz you got to keep your eye on the screen like it's like a Tyson fight yeah yeah Tyson was the best example of in a lot of ways what was wrong with people liking boxing cuz I just want to see someone get slaughtered sure you know and then Arturo Gatti and Micky Ward is like the other side of it it's like neither guy can slaughter the other guy and they keep slaughtering each other and coming back like that's that to me is always been my favorite kind of fight in torn personally because I know how dangerous it is for them right it's such a horrible yeah horrible experience for their body just exchanging punch after punch after punch um a guy named Tim Hague just died this past weekend and he was a former UFC fighter who lost in the UFC and then went over and was fighting a bunch of other organizations and he sustained a series of pretty brutal knockouts like a boxing thing that wasn't it a boxing ax I think he's so he fought a bunch of MMA fights had got knocked out and many times and then went in just two months after a-level a big knockout that he just had in April fought a boxing match so he had been knocked out in April I believe it was April I'm sorry from wrong um that's what I read and then he's fighting again in his boxing match and he's outmatched he takes his fight on short notice against a really good boxer I think he has like a 1 in 3 boxing record or something it's not a good buy record and this guy just fucked him up and bad and the KO was brutal he apparently got knocked down several times in the first round and and he got hit with some big bombs and dropped and his head bounced off the ground and he died and it is a very rare thing to for someone to die in boxing in the heavyweight division it's usually the guys who dehydrate themselves and then come into a fight like really light those are the ones that usually die so this is pretty rare it was like a serious beating in a fight between um that really badass Cuban guy southpaw big something Luiz see if you can fit he's a top contender right now boxing in the heavyweight division but he beat up this Russian cat and fucked him up and the guy wound up being in the hospital for quite a long time and is I believe his career is over it's some swelling and bleeding bleeding on the brain but he survived but Tim is unfortunately passed away scary shit you know so those fights they come with you know there's a great consequence that we don't feel as spectators although I think people feel it now more than ever for sure I mean football - I mean I'd say I can't I can't get over like when you hear like a just a crack of a helmet there it is um why was a brain-damaged fighter allowed to leave Madison Square Garden on his own yeah what is a homeboys name they're mad mago Med of Abdul Salam off Muhammad Abdul Salam off and he was fighting Mike Perez I think that's the fight so I got the guy wrong - that's not the big Cuban heavyweight I think I fucked it up it's a different Cuban heavyweight by the way have you been to the theater the garden there cease it's a great place lunch oh yeah it's amazing I love it the theater is amazing yeah I'm doing stand-up there hello I'm excited excited there's a big UFC fight at mass square garden what is that guy's Luis no Luis Gomez comedian this there said there's a top cuban heavyweight something god damn it what a name overlapping boxing - this guy was in a coma after this loss yeah seems like it was I think I got the wrong guy though like that was the right fight but I'm trying to figure out who the other guy is that I thought was this guy that's another guy god damn it he's one of the top guys are really big dudes Ortiz yes Luis Ortiz thank you I thought I was going crazy I never remember anything that's what people I have talked to people really good you should do a sports thing and I'm like I'm not again like I reiterate I'm a fan I'm a I'm a such a fan but I just don't have the knowledge to pull out of my little knowledge satchel if you did would you be interested in doing alternative boxing commentary say if like I feel like this is going to be the future of interactive television not gonna have just one commentator tell you how a you want yeah yeah well I would be the one who would be like this is fun everybody oh this you know the I'd be the one who'd be like that I like I think he's cuter but I think the other guy is better so look how about this how about maybe a guy sitting down with his girlfriend uh-huh and she's like I don't want to watch this fight unless we watch Morgan's commentary and the guys like deal deal we got it Permian I get to watch the fight you get to listen to Morgan my dad being that's a fucking good idea and that's not a hard set up yeah I talk a lot about it cut man I love a cut I love a cut man I love a close-up of a of a wound over the eye but ends well Oh softening down it's fascinating it was tissue there's something to soothing about it now when you were boxing we were sparring like a couple times a little bit like a friend like not but I just top each other just have each other but like knows I go of my friend Amy and we would we would you know we would work out it was my workout I used it as like a workout and then I became buddies with with Freddie Roach and that like at times I was working at Kimmel at the time and and a 12 years ago or something like that not and I would just work out and then occasionally do a little like Freddie what has - a little Spartan but it was very you know very a couple couple points here and then done like I was there I was nervous I was nervous I spot when I was a kid I did a lot of karate as I sparred as a kid I kicked some kid in the head like a testing and I remember the instructor saying good job to me whoa I just nailed some kid in the head but uh but no I mean I went to it the coolest thing about the wild card was I feel like I Pacquiao was was training there every day pretty much and Freddie would let me stay when they closed the gym for Pacquiao let me stay and like watch him train which was that was awesome like 12 years ago to do that did you ever see Bryan Callen at the gym uh yeah I feel like I feel if we took I didn't see him there we talked about it definitely Bryan Callen boxes yeah time spars yeah yeah as always at talking to me about his sparring I'm like dude stop sparring your brain is already soft like what are you doing I get excited about I fought a um it was a more of a bit but uh for Vice magazine it was just a magazine we did a I fought a heavyweight a female heavyweight we did it in prom dresses right um very she wasn't allowed to really - yeah she like could get her belts taken away and stuff but I brought this dude from the from the wild-card is like my my corner man and we both were prom dresses so she was a real fighter real fighter heavyweight fighter and then at one point I think I just jumped on her back oh Jesus and tried to like knock her down so she didn't try to hit she you know the plan was for her to try and I was my plan was for me to allow her to try and then her manager was like now she's not allowed to it's like he legally she wasn't allowed they want that I know but I thought it'd be you know good see you get knocked out yeah that'd be my fun little you know I should see you instead always don't you want like I I get embarrassed when I haven't done something that sounds great like I would like to be able to say I got knocked out once really yeah hmm don't say that someone come and knock you out it's not good for you here you are oh there's me she's picking you up yeah well she seems friendly yeah heavy wait [Laughter] so how come you stopped doing it how come you stopped boxing yeah good technique there look how you're uh thank you shit off the back foot uh Freddie Roach used to call my right the cannon and I felt a real honored about that you and Brian Collins you get together narrate your own um I uh known as the cannon yeah I think I like I can't write you know honestly I got like a little I got like depressed and stopped boxing and sorry going to this coffee place instead it's just it's that's that shit sorry I got like I'll give the depressed stop going to the gym so the gym didn't help you with depression like exercise this one was like a big dip so the few months away from that kind of stuff and I just stopped going and then I didn't go back as it was so by that time I I wanted to but it was also that gym became it was like it's like Jeremy pivens everyday it just became such a scene that it became not what I had started going there for if that makes sense it does you know and I love it and I should absolutely go back and and and frankly I think Freddie Roach bean is nice to me as he has been in my life is one of the stranger you know kind of oh I had no reason to sort of take me in and he did I almost moved in next door to the wall caught with fret like it was like you know as a dear friend for a long time well I got away with him we were going to live I was going to live next to the gym almost for a second and the apartment attached the gym but Wow um I was just in the middle of how via cars used to live and a bells going off to me me me me yeah that he was great just me to like Boxing Writers Awards dinners and stuff I got to meet a lot of like great Pete me was it was it was a cool time of my life but I just sort of you know and then I moved to New York and I think that was a big part of it too is did you find out of Kovalev Ward if they had a standing eight count I found someone trying to describe the analysis facts that said that it was a Unified Rules no standing eight-count was in that but I'll soon does it the initial source well if a guy quits and there's no standing 8-count you got to think of it as a knockout it's like a MMA but if there's a standing eight count it would have given it to him there or what he should have done is probably taken knee Kovalev probably should have taken a knee and if he took a knee then he would get a ten count that is considered a knockdown low blows yeah big low blows yeah he definitely yeah he definitely got hit low and then there was a couple of them that are questionable like on the belt line apparently they were saying Koval abs belt was pretty high it's it's it's funny because there tends to somehow in boxing something happens be it a you know horrific judgment which I think happens a lot like to allow there to be another fight like it just seems to be like something always fucking how that's why when I have a lot of people over to watch boxing like I hate I hate the parts of the sport that seem like it's fixed because I can appreciate the fight as a whole even without an outcome I think Denise is fixed no not this but I just mean in boxing there always seems to be something something happens that would make a rematch more attractive right but that's just the nature of competition on a big scale like that with crazy consequences like the come the Klitschko Anthony Joshua fight like that's the consequence of the FI just fucking chaos just guys getting knocked down get back up and knocking the other guy down holy shit in a kind of a controversial ending stop it look that he was defending himself but do you think there's more controversial endings in boxing than there are in MMA I think people make split-second decisions on the referees in the heat of the moment and when you're going to have that you're going to have mistakes it happens all the time and it's as nothing feels like there's a lot of a lot of mistakes I do not think it's fixed not by any stretch of the imagination I think especially like with respected fighters I think people do have biases for certain styles and there's certain there's certain referees that will let a fire defend himself further than some will some won't especially in MMA when you know judges already sitting a some were not but I always I always find it hard to explain a friend to come over who never watch that stuff and I'm like I love having people over and having liked it like I said the social aspect of like sports to me it's really fun but when friends come over and they constantly see results that they to understand they're done with the sport you know whereas if you liked it more you can be like is that happens the problem is you're people pleaser and trying to get these pieces I like something that you like yeah you just let them let them think it's fixed I've had so many conversations with guys like MMA's fix man just admit it oh I don't want to talk to you this is a silly way of approaching this issue you don't know anything yeah and you're trying to pretend like you know something so that we're right from the beginning we're fucked like this we can't have this conversation you're pretending that you've seen enough fights you understand fighting enough you've competed enough you've been hit enough you've seen people get hit you know enough to know when something's real and something's not you know you know everybody else can't figure it out but you figured out that a lot of the fights are fixed there's fixed fights that's why I like I mean I write I mean obviously last five years been obsessed with the golovkin cuz he's just a knockout artist you can't you know that's not there's some proof to it I mean maybe with MMA too it's like you can I I would say that early stoppages and boxing are probably more no they're very calm and dominant both sports it's just people making mistakes but my point is there are going to be fixed fights there's going to be people that do things just like there's referees in NBA apparently they get busted trying to stretch games out and try to call fouls on certain teams and they work for people that bet money and they try to shave points that shit's always going to exist there's always going to be someone who tries to talk to referee and says listen Billy it's I'm not saying that you should fix the fight I'm saying if you see somebody get hurt stop that motherfucker stop that fight pull that trigger a little quick normally manager and there's that you know there's definitely that but how often does it happen I bet it happens pretty rarely I bet it's much more people making mistakes much more people in the heat of the moment much more just the nature of the chaos of combat sport competition just wacky shit happens and people make big mistakes as referees just like you know people like you and I make big mistakes hang on a podcast you're just talking off the top of your head right sure make mistakes then but with a referee you're making a mistake like this other guy's career like for Kovalev like to not recognize the low blows to stop the fight like the way did Koval that fucked up you should have taken a knee yeah I mean but that's the thing is that a lot of these a lot of these things can lead to another fight like that Santa says that without the controversy there's less attraction yeah no one's going to agree to it look Andre Ward is not going to agree to some sort of a predetermined outcome killer Lev is not going to Gris to a predetermined outcome so those two principles the most important parts of this equation would never fucking ever agree to let the other person win there's not a chance in hell Kovalev is just going down from a nut shot oh no I don't know I just I just think it's like no no I don't think it's fixed I just think the controversy itself makes a rematch more tractors but the idea that somehow because it's fine yeah but a lot of people do good boxing so it works that guy at the party everybody in my class everybody at my like ever I also seem to invite people over for the wrong fights you know I mean where you're like all the last one was fucking great and then you and then you have people over and it's like oh yeah exactly barest it's always how it is there's so many people that just they just don't they've never competed and so like they just and there's also people that want to call bullshit there wouldn't be the first person called bullshit so they like they're a little itchy on the trigger call bullshit on things those give me that right contrarians a lot of contrarian a lot of them a lot of smart people are contrarian Oh some of my smartest friends it's disappointing sometimes some of my smartest friends are always wrong well it's like what led them to be smart and curious it's like this distrust of things mm-hmm but contrary it's also fun right see the tide going one way like from that tile sparring I'm sorry verbal sparring keep it flowing little uh yeah that's a big thing of comics right I always I find that the the guys I tend to be attracted to or attracted to our uh our contrarians are just are just it's it's a fight from you know from the get-go really that's what you like little bit he's like a little bit I like a little bit of a verbal sparring it let's see if they can hang yeah and I you know I it's you know I'm I I'm I'm totally driven entirely by being like you know mentally stimulated so it's just then then I'm then I'm in like sexually but if it's not fun the banter is not fun then I'm then I you know no interest in fucking someone I hear ya that's not how I feel at all that's a difference between guys and girls it is very much especially with comics I've heard that any times like girl comics say they would never date a guy that wasn't funny but you never hear that from a dude no no that's that is that is a it's funny that's a it's it's one of the things I talk about the most with a lot of my like female comedian friends but it's just there's not there's no part of me that would be sexually interested in somebody who wasn't if not funny I mean if not funny they'd have to be you know brutally smart on a you know on a level that I don't even understand why Stephen Hawking shit yeah like I'd have to just I don't know I'd like to this is this is gonna sound wrong but there's something fun and attractive about you know intellectually being put in your place wow that's weird like you would like to be intellectually choked yeah a little bit ah a little bit I don't you know I don't I don't I I don't know maybe it's not the popular opinion but you kiss a fuck it's your opinion doesn't have to be popular if you enjoy it it's also like if somebody's it doesn't have to be my thing even if someone's great at their thing right and I have no understanding of it I find that to be a try like it so it doesn't necessarily always have to be a comedian and someone who is you know brilliantly hilarious like I've been attracted to guys who were just brilliant at a thing that I have zero comprehension I how you even get good at it let alone graded it and something fun about it yeah I'm always fascinated by those people for sure but I don't find them attractive no like for I wit believe me there are things I wish I wish I was more attracted to like I wish I could just I wish I was attracted to money and looks and all the things that do you know yeah I wish it really those ideas on original um it seems like there'd be more options and then it would be easier as opposed to waiting three years to find someone who just like hits the right button and you're like oh god I'm in yeah yeah Wow the be able to be like tuned in someone in in a a mental way like your minds are tuned into each other where you can speak on the same terms or you can you can both recognize the humor and things you both have opinions on things you you both enhance the conversations that you have like you throw in something that makes me know that I throw in something makes you laugh and it but it's always so much more fun right it just is it's just that's how it is with friends that's how it is with everybody that's like what I said about burr like having that podcast with burr like me just when mean bar alone and we're talking shit or our text messages we have back and forth to each other they're hilarious it's like that like to have a friend like that as a cherished thing right like to have someone that you could sit and then if you could fuck them to oh shit yeah it'd be fun but rarely happens christina pazsitzky and Tom Segura it is one of the rare ones one of the rare to two funny comedians they get together and they both have a great time together Bonnie McFarlane and rich Voss another one those are two running contenders have the throne good more those are the two contenders for the throne those for the 20 is married couple hundred percent I don't see anybody else that's like at that level Bonnie and Rich and Tom and Christina I don't see anybody else at that level trying to think it's rare but they're outliers think about it Natasha Leggero oh that's ocean I'm sorry guys I'm sorry I was Moshe and I fucked up my Tasha sorry there's they're both hilarious you're right I fucked up that's number three how did I not remember that that's that's number three those those three people other than that who I don't know I I mean that's three out of 300 million there 100 million most of the smart funny guys I know don't need that in a woman and and and that's you know it's not my place to judge like I wish there's part of me that like goes like uh you know how could you date her she's a fucking idiot whatever it is it's not my job to judge who stimulates you but you know it's it's it would be easier if I had more options I think do you think it would be cheesy if motion Tasha went on tea and went on stage with t-shirts that say one out of 100 million yeah cuz though maybe that could be like their tour name yeah cuz they really are like if they're a really legitimately hilarious couple their bones hilarious that's maybe one out of 100 million yeah is that that's pretty legit right I mean I'm trying maybe there's somebody else that I forgot have you dated comedians but I was like 21 yeah and I was like oh they're crazy too can't have this canto crazy people feeding off each other touches doesn't seem like a wise move no and also it's too complicated I've seen what happens when guys date a comic and then they break up with each other and then she comes around with some new dude and the guys all bummed out and like that happened with Ari and Natasha oh yeah I know yeah it's disastrous it's like hey yeah don't do that no no just be friends unless unless you got to do what you got to do you know it could work the problem is is that you're in the same scene to someone so you got to work through all of your shit around the person that hurt you and that's you know that's the hardest but you might come out of it a better person might come out of it more open-minded more easygoing more forgiving just deal just overcome positive try me try to be more I to my best yeah I don't always succeed but I do my best but again it all is all you know it'll work out it's all gonna work out except for this fucking yellow stone thing god damn it we're done so a lot of earthquakes do you know I'd like a guy who does that like measures earthquakes sighs mom yeah well you know but like knows more about like a like a real cynical seismology who's like we're done what if you really like the guy but then you found out he was into jazz um it's happened what's happened I really like oh no and you come home to your parma didn't it didn't better people better than I had yeah yeah yeah every time he called me there was jazz on in the back no every time no pop up a bum bum up a bar but he was a you know very serious actor see you know like so serious just wanted he just wanted it on in the background I put it on the background right before he called yeah so I called someone's call me yeah why maybe see more sophisticated Bryan Callen used to leave books out on his table that he wasn't really reading I called him out on it I came over to his house one time and he had the Catcher in the Rye or something like that sitting right on his coffee table like bitch you are not reading that he started laughing so I'm not and I go what the fuck do you have that here for him and he goes to impress girls like oh I knew it I knew it just it's so obvious to impress girls who don't ask any questions yeah well like no like you'd ever have to defend it or get into it or go what's your opinion of it why would you date a girl ask questions that's just Jesus Christ it seems like a disaster waiting to happen if you date a girl and right away they come to questions so what books have you read recently like oh Jesus was not gonna work yeah we just hit a lull stop talking yeah what do we do now just kind of rebuild momentum talk about I wish I was like a you know a big exciting lady yes a lot of with a lot of movement I think one of the best things you've ever done is that Carlos Mencia thing we did his material yeah yeah you said that you did it in 92 what would you say 19 like 1912 I've tried to make it obvious so that I was fucking with people but it's not every like every couple months I check I see what's going on over there and every comment is like I don't care he does it better like I'm just like it was fucking with you yeah you dummy it says 1912 what a fuck it's pretty obvious to the way you're doing it that it's a parody that was reading off a cue card I made in five minutes I think you're certain people that are doomed they're just doomed you're never gonna get to him you know it's like this certain there's certain fish that can breathe with their gills and they also can breathe air they can suck air yeah not everybody has that ability not everybody has the ability to recognize humor or satire or just to see it there's certain people that are there I think they have a dull battery for a brain it's a it's in its it's more obvious and pronounced you know now more than ever because of uh you know everyone's got a little bit of a little bit of a voice yeah yeah old computer well more of them well we get to now we get to see not only how they make their own jokes but how they respond to yours and every the combination of both is startling frightening that and also like these people are illuminated now or they might have been just in the shadows before some weird neighborhoods and the good thing about it is that people that live in those weird neighborhoods like kids they get exposed to way more shit like there is such a difference between when you travel and you go on the road now and you go to a town like in the middle of nowhere versus going to a town in the middle of nowhere in the 90s you go to town in the middle of nowhere in the 90s you were in an outlier post like you were in like some Mad Max type situation you're doing some Minnesota gig in the middle of nowhere like these people aren't going to know shit about the real world I mean they're gonna be trapped out here the town's only got five thousand people in or something you don't leave college up there good luck luck but now they might as well be living in San Francisco yeah they all have the Internet yeah people just know things now but I know it's funny Doug he and I and he's right like but he'll he'll shit on me a little bit about like we'll go somewhere and I'll go I was funny goes that's not the road like he has her real it obviouly guys who I mean like you do like who have really fucking done put in the road work across the country across the fucking world like I am admittedly not that person and the places that I think are sort of you know out there middle of nowhere like he'll put me in my place so fast like this is nothing what's the darkest place you've been like it's in terms of like exposure to the light of enlightenment um the one gig I did with Henry Phillips once was in my 20s a Chris Fairbanks Henry Phillips and I went like III don't have any crazy so like I don't do I don't do the drugs that would lead to better stories and the ones I have but I you know just like where you're just sleeping on a twin bed with another comedian in a kid's room because it's parents on the pizza play so you drove up to perform at and there's like a fourteen-year-old vomiting drunk outside the way like all just that kind of shit where you're just and you're grown up technically you're in 20s and just going what am i what am I here for for $50 a six-hour car ride and free pizza and a kids twin bed and like people are having contests to see who can piss the highest outside like just that kind of shit where I'm just you know I and I at one point sort of hate it now I just you know I think I think the friends that I have who go out and occasionally you know take me or go with them like I have so much fun now doing stuff that I used to you know that I got tired of I think in my 20s so it's interesting it's like I'm a little bit reinvigorated well you realize that those things can be fun once you become a real professional first of all in the beginning you're so looking forward to working at the Comedy Store or The Improv or right headlining seen your name on the Billboard look yeah but once you've done that then you realize like there's actually fun these places yeah problem is me freaking out about this two hours I have to spend in this shithole bar I should be enjoying the fuck out of it and coming in here with a relaxed attitude having a good time and experiencing this for what it is instead of experiencing like oh my god I'm so frustrated because I really want to climb my way being a professional gradian but I'm stuck in this shit bar but then once you kind of are then you guys are good no no those are actually fun oh yeah now I am but it's like my only thing with uh with my booking guys like I just say I'll go anywhere that haven't been to yet right you know I mean name the place if I like it I'll go and if I haven't been there I'll go I love the unknown of it but but I'm definitely not a you know a veteran of the road which is a real issue is non direct flights oh yeah any place where you go doesn't have a direct flight yeah you might get fuck yeah yeah you could get fucked I mean for this this tour the Dougs doing it's he's his tour managers driving car out from Arizona the East Coast so see they're just driving around and then I'll meet him out there oh just a bunch of dates out there that's a good way to do it yeah I know um my manager brought up getting a boss like doing a boss term I hey doesn't Ron White have a bus uh oh yeah he's got a number one tequila bus yes yeah but that's Ron you know I have young kids like I can I'm not doing that again gets a bus when he has his kids out on the road good for him hey also um I like doing too much other shit yeah I don't like being like if I'm just on the road for a month that's not a healthy month yeah I'm not into that I don't want any weird fucking momentum taking over my life well that's I feel that way per like I can't do it alone I don't want to I don't found no interest in doing it alone and frankly like I can't I can't afford to headline and bring people with me I'm not I'm not that kind of a draw so I would much rather go out with friends who can bring me do a little less time and have a good time with a bunch of friends yeah that's you know it's not the it's not the you know frontlines brave way to go how'd stand-up comedy but it's like I've no no interest in in suffering yeah rad why should you why do you have to have that interest like that's one no I mean I think there are certain people who are like well you're you know you're taking the easy way out you're not headlining this week you're going out you're doing a you know a nice thirty thirty thirty-five max and it's like yeah well that's what I'm doing this week so what Oh look is a fuck why is that a bad thing I know a lot of guys do that they do the whole time the headline sometimes I go on the road in the middle yeah he's a shit the things that people worry about pick apart just like so goddamn pointless plus you get the opportunity to go out with stand-up like why why would you not want to do that and I figured out a long time ago like the road there's two types of road there's Road by yourself which can get real lone it's depressing it can get very lonely or there's a road with friends yeah where's the party it's amazing it's fucking great I remember looking at a window at like Springfield Illinois I was like 19 or 20 and I just I just looked out the parking lot window and I was like this this is I love stand-up and I love comedy but I said this is not for me this'll this'll destroy me I did all of my gigs on the road by myself until I could afford to not do it anymore and then right around the end of the 90s I started taking Chris McGuire on the road with me a lot yeah yeah yeah and there's a long time once I could afford like any cost money like I'd have to pay for the flight and pain from the hotel room but I'm like I would rather be out a few hundred bucks here and there and have a good time it made the in the experience infinitely better I went to do Phoenix recently just for a night and to get like some some time in that I couldn't get in LA and so went out there for the night to do a long set and I said I'm bringing my friend and there was like who your friend ago her name's Chris and they're like oh you know she's where she performed whenever I go she's my best friend from college he's really funny and she doesn't stand up and I was like I'm taking her with me like I like I was like I get like it wasn't and she's a more of a comedic actress who does some live performance stuff and she did fucking great she had to do ten fifteen minutes she was perfect I'm like I could have brought someone who's been doing comedy 12 years was like I wanted to go with my best friend right yes what I wanted to do I wanted to have fun land of fun yeah yeah it makes it way better you're in Minnesota but you're home yeah you know you're in Cleveland but you're home yeah we it's the best it's the best and the camaraderie between comedians it's like such an unusual camaraderie it's very unusual well it's it's also I kinda remember being on the the the Trant like we were you know Doug's a cranky traveler and uh oh yeah I mean he'll tell you firsthand and we were we landed LAX and it was like it is take a different Airlines way to get on like a shuttle to go somewhere like a shuttle after the plane is like you know when someone doesn't like surprises like something's a shuttle but it's just like constant like jokes about like like we're going to Auschwitz but like loud ouch which joke so I'm like the you know American Airlines shuttle with like people around you and like I'm a little more sensitive to like I'll look around and go like oh we're not liked here but there's it's it's there's there's nothing better than being around other people who like speak your language and you don't have to explain anything ever oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's one of the things that Doug said to me once I'm Solaris he goes he goes I think I could quit comedy but I could never quit comedians oh that's like a sensitive shit it is deep I was telling him like if everything goes wrong he could clearly organize some sort of a village and Bisbing all the comics move to him I I'm I'm considering what I got I got I got a I have a Bisbee realtor what yeah I do you think singing my bottom line I'm not gonna I'm not I have to be in LA my work is in LA doesn't have to be in LA but I I haven't found a place that offers me the way that place says I haven't found a place that offers me everything I don't realize I miss when I'm in LA like what what are the second I get there it's it's a sense of calm it's a sense of reprioritizing your day around things that have nothing to with show business and you know being around people who aren't in the business I mean most of my friends weirdly are not comedians like that I hang out every day but I don't know I mean the other day like I was there and we had a little like pickup basketball game plan for like 9 a.m. and like 8 people showed up to watch me play this dude can't like it's just small-town kind of shit but with people who seem to have figured out why they're there too and I just really dig it I dig the whole vibe I dig I dig the city the town or whatever I like to drive there even and I belong as a drive from LA no I haven't driven from my lifeline to Tucson Drive like an hour and a half but I always was obsessed with like getting to place in like Costa Rica and Nicaragua like any time I go to another country and I'm like oh this is it this is my spot really there's a lot yeah you think that's because you travel a lot when you're kid I think so I think there's a part of me that has a little bit of a problem staying still because I never knew a you know that kind of consistency but the thing I realized about Bisbee which which again is so like Doug's thing that it's almost funny but it's I I it's all those feelings that I had in even in other countries where I was like it's getting away but it's close enough right you know it's just but you still feel like you're on the outskirts and you feel like you go back in time a little bit there mmm you know and there's something refreshing about waking up and going I'm gonna go get my coffee at the one coffee place I'm gonna go get my this kind of food at the one place that has this kind of food you know I'm gonna go get my fresh eggs from the lady who has fresh eggs and come from her chick it like it's just shit that I don't do here and I didn't even think I wanted to do until I got there right I get it I like those places I loved Boulder which is much bigger than Bisbee but still for the same reasons I think what we do specifically also like you're in front of crowds all the time I think there's a real benefit to being away from crowds yeah and just smaller groups of people it's more relaxed yeah and it's also you know I think you go somewhere a certain number of times you meet kind of the people that are there I mean obviously I've met a lot of Doug's friends and stuff and you know once you're not bothered you go from a place of like I wonder if anyone's going to annoy me know what annoys you think I really like it here then you're like I really love it here then you're like I think I could have a place here so you're thinking about legitimately picking up shop and moving to Bisbee and then keeping an apartment here and then when you're not working like in Hollywood shit you live in Bisbee and you go on the road from there yeah not quite but I'm but I am thinking about having something consistent that like I will probably have to be here the majority of the time for the foreseeable future but I'm curious about what it'd be like to have my own little spot that I could go to when I want to and I you know and in doing it enough not realize like you can go for a weekend and it feels like a good it decompress fuck yeah you know there's a cave for sale oh yeah I know he's trying to get did you see he's trying to get so far I feel like I don't know if you were interested I know me Kreischer Roseanne norm and Doug like the people who have expressed interest in his cave of going in and getting it I was like oh I would live in that fucking insane asylum in a heartbeat dope yeah it's amazing it's super dope you should get it thought about it I'm somebody honest with you you should yeah I mean I'm looking at like a you know a little craftsman

accidentally I know I feel like you're also got a trigger finger it got itchy trigger fingers think so yeah but you I think you have the wrong impression of me huh thank you thinking more volatile than I am um how many people live in Bisbee oh no what is it thousands five-fifths ten I don't 5,000 I don't know I've no fucking idea the elevations really high that playing basketball was hard look what's the elevation it's like a mile high is crazy it's like yeah it's it's uh I was I was I was uh I was deep yeah I would say two baskets in why I felt if I was lean and was leaning over real hard could barely play city was wow populations five thousand two elevations five thousand populations five thousand five five on both it's perfect I got a little this last time I was there I got a two-bedroom Airbnb little house hot tub bullshit 85 bucks a night two-bedroom house that's a good deal what is there a gym there uh yeah you know what you gotta ask Doug because uh his buddy who says this housing he he just joined a gym that's like a minute away like that's right there then they talk about that in two songs you said an hour and a half drive hour and a half drive does something bad do something it's like going to Santa Barbara that's what I said to like like everyone I work with I was like I'm gonna leave I can be back in three hour basically I just said let me know if I need to come back for any kind of emergency shit and I'll be back but easy to go in the mountains get colder at all I think it gets cold at night sometimes but you gotta say is the weather's amazing in that like I've talked to I talked my dad called me as I got here it's real hot there and I'm like it's so breezy constantly in Bisbee it feels against it gets really hot but not as hot as it does in other areas cuz the elevation yeah 5500 feet is fucking high I would imagine interesting you gonna do it's okay the economy they're like what do people do nothing what why they there I don't know just piled out like I don't know why anybody else is there I mean I know why I go how many people have moved there because it does I think hundred I think more than people would think yeah seems like it seems like there's quite a few folks hundreds no I don't think I know III dad I don't think so i mean it's it's almost like I remember talking to Doug about liking it and I almost felt like I'd to ask him like hey I think I'm gonna come out like like is that okay I know it's your fucking town like it's it's you want the one who finds it I mean I've been hella Ford I brought my friend I bought my buddy bill from is just a good friend of mine out here like we hit the road like it's I would it's a kind of place that I want to bring people to and show them did Doug get excited when you thought about moving there I think you know what I can't tell it's you you can't tell that seems happy but then also there is a part of when a place is somebody's thing you don't want to intrude intrude right I do that so I don't know I mean I also don't think I mean I would just love a little a little second little rustic place where I do nothing do I do all my nothing I like it I'll live in your cave would you want to watch the cave I'll watch the cave would you know weird stuffed alright now whenever you let a comic watch your house and then like art I mean I might have some processed sugar in the cave if that's like gonna be a big problem for you gonna be an issue yeah that's super bad for you Morgan keep it out of your body keep it out of my cave I just take a picture of like Doritos in front of your favorite places in a cave mmm it's fun if they can't get invited by that cave I would feel like that would be something people be trying to buy up mm-hmm the problem is try selling it all right trying to sell a cave yeah someone who could afford a three million dollar cave like there's not a lot of those dudes out there or women this cave house is in France oh oh you're balling you're balling so strong you're on the side of a mountain hope it doesn't go all Pompeii on your ass though but you know what you could do a lot of this shit with the cave and Bisbee you could do a lot of that low seating I see it happening I'm with now I really want you to get that fucking I wanna have a theater outside amphitheater have folk singers come by there's a small little amphitheater in um in the park at this in Bisbee yeah a little one you could do a show there Oh what is this a different one oh I just got typed in the cave house in Bisbee but a lot of like cave houses are just coming up too and I saw um yeah I saw a special on one of them television shows about houses where they're just just all cave houses people build houses in caves carving art into the wall now we're going back back to the caves well just people are bored just want something interesting look at this fucking place Jesus Christ hmm where he lives so goddamn important every place has a different feel to it that's why the idea of countries is so fucked up stopping people from living somewhere awesome well yeah I mean that's if you told me like I can't go to Bisbee anymore I can't go to resign you're like a perfect example I'd get pissed Sonne drew a line around business no this is biz Bay Nia now you can't come in unless you have papers while you do you have any exceptional talents that we would want to let you in to Bisbee Nia yeah all right me shit just 300 years ago wasn't even real right 300 years ago there was no American hmm it's not too hard to believe that one day Bisbee Nia could be a real thing maybe Doug takes over maybe they invent some stem cells that let Doug live for a long time like way longer than he's supposed to like five more years five hundred five hundred years and
