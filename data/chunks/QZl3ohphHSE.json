the Joe Rogan experience right with live we can't hear ourselves cuz Brian Cox even though he's a musician he goes no headphone but we can still hear ourselves I can hear you you're right we just can't hear whether or not but we wouldn't know anyway what would we do he knows he's got headphones on you're right this is revolutionary from now on no more headphones it's ridiculous what would you use them for well it's like watching television while you're on television it's like if you were on TV and you were watching a video monitor it seems weird yeah I think we should cast them aside yeah just a revolutionary act push them push them away like not just put them down push them away we reject you Oh headphones we reject you amazing technology infinite monkey cage yeah what's going on man what is this first of all I'm a huge fan of your work I said that when you came in but I have to tell people online this is a huge treat for me I'm very excited space has been my all-time adult freakout pleasure I love watching space documentaries i watching television shows on space so having you in here is a huge treat thank you what's infinite monkey cage it's a long-running now BBC radio show so the idea initially was to get scientists to talk about their science whatever it may be she said cosmology or archeology human origins mathematics everything and then I do it with a stand-up comedian called Robin intz it's very good friend of mine and we always also invite another guest who will be a comedian sometimes or an actor or someone who will kind of ask those questions that come in from left field and but it always goes off into some as your podcast do it just you don't you never know where it's going to go so we record it front of a live audience usually in London and we record for about two hours usually in broadcast if about thirty minutes and there's a podcast as well which is a bit longer but we decided to bring it to the States because there are lots of scientists in the States lots of comedians and like yourself or that you're gonna do it with us in three weeks it's Thursday the 12th in LA yes and and so we just want it so we're gonna record them before the BBC and they're gonna be on the podcast and broadcast in the UK but also in front of a live audience so it said someone asked me this morning actually and I said it's kind of like a variety show behind and said Jeff those in the States if they do used to have them we used to happen Dean Martin used to do one so I said well it's kind of like Dean Martin other PhD it would have been that black and white they're singing dancing bit of quantum mechanics basically that's one of the things that's so important about what you do what Neil deGrasse Tyson does is that you guys you you you are entertaining as well as having a genuine passion and a deep knowledge of science so it's it's not just like here's the cold hard facts which are amazing and fascinating on their own but you guys both have this way of sort of germinating these ideas into people's minds that might not ordinarily accept them because they there's a lot of people in America especially that associate learning with boring well I think the important point the serious point is science is too important not to be part of popular culture so if we popular culture is the thing that people discuss so if we cede that to you know talent shows or or sports or whatever it is then we're removing the most important area of human endeavor out of general conversation so I think there's a very there's a responsibility on scientists to say well I accept that of course I can't talk you know the level that I lecture at as an undergraduate lecture course at university or even a post-grad lecture course at the level of my thesis of my research I can't do that but it's extremely important that we don't just seed all the ground we don't want people in in in bars tonight or wherever in restaurants to only talk to be talking about the Grammys that's right we would like them to be talking about the fact that the universe may be infinite an extent the asking questions such as how many civilizations are there in the Milky Way galaxy the question the answer might be not very many if that's true then what does that mean for the way that we behave these are important questions but they will never be debated unless we take the time and and make the effort to make this AIIMS and the ideas in the debate around them part of popular culture the Internet has also opened up a lot of people's ideas about what science can be and also it opened up a lot of people's ideas about the actual popularity of science because there's until you know maybe 10 20 years ago with the notable exception like maybe Carl Sagan and a few other famous people that became famous for you know either cosmologists or mathematicians it's very very rare but now you're seeing guys like yourself guys like Neil deGrasse Tyson it's like more and more Richard Dawkins Christopher Hitchens while he's alive these interesting intellectuals become much more mainstream they become because people realize it wasn't that folks weren't interested in these subjects before is this they really weren't being presented them if you don't get enough ratings if you put your show on Thursday night at 8:00 p.m. and you don't get X amount of number of people watching the the studio loses interest the the people that produce it start looking at other jobs and wow this wasn't gonna work and they start moving on and that's just the reality of television and I think that with the internet people are able to look at some of these subjects and and you know someone will send out a tweet or a Facebook link or something like that and you'll say well this got a million people to look at it over the last 12 weeks and the this has sort of instead of having this immediate time frame where everybody has to pay attention or the show dies now ideas are allowed to sort of grow yeah I think you're absolutely right about that I I I think we as a culture underestimate people I think and this is what you found with your podcast I think there are millions of people out there who are interested in ideas interested in the latest things we found out about the universe and nature and the way that it works and that they'll they'll come to it you can you build an audience I suppose yes it's very important for the reasons that I outlined our civilization Carl Sagan always used to say this our civilization is based on science and technology so in democracies if your democracy is gonna function properly then people need to know about the cutting edge discoveries and the things that we found out which form the basis of our civilization otherwise how can your democracy function properly so that's partly the responsibility of the education system of course but I see actually the media on the internet and actually on television and radio as part of the education system now I know that the media doesn't see itself as that often it's easy self as a a corporate effort to generate money for shareholders I criticize that quite strongly actually and we're fortunate in Britain that we've got the BBC whose job it is to be part of the education system and part it is a national institution it's having a strong public service broadcaster I think is it's one of the best things you can do as a country I mean imagine America I know it would be anathema to the big corporations who run the TV channels but imagine you had a channel which which really had a lot of money the BBC is well funded that everybody contributed to in the state's the whose job it was to act in the interests of the nation whose job it was to say well we're going to put these we're gonna make these big science documentaries and put them on and yet will make entertainment shows and drama shows as well we're going to make them because we think people need to know this stuff we want to enthuse the next generation of scientists and engineers that's that's important actually it's important not to expose people continually to too you know drivel basically populist dribble because people yeah I think you're right people want to think I really believe that people are interested I rarely go into you know a bar or a restaurant or a party and people say what do you do and I say well I I work at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva we recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the Big Bang it's very rare that someone just says [Laughter] they're interested sure so yeah I think the and maybe you're right the optimistic view as you say is that the Internet will remove this corporate layer of middle management in a way this kind of the television executive maybe if you can remove that filter she's like I said a malfunctioning kidney in the flow of information maybe it's a it's a good thing in a way it is it's it's really kind of an archaic idea the idea that you know at you know Thursday night at 8 o'clock that's when the show airs it airs for an hour well now you could of course DVR things and you can of course there's a lot of television shows of things on demand so you can download them you know later but I think that that's the model the model is the distribution through the internet and this idea of sending things through the satellites and all the way they're doing it now with television networks it's like it's it's not gonna work it's not gonna last as soon as companies like Netflix and now Amazon is creating their own television shows as well there those are internet-based companies and they truly understand what the internet is all about and when Amazon or brother when Netflix releases a series they released the entire series who can download like all 10 episodes you can binge watch them which is a great way to get people hooked on shows as well yeah it's like this idea that you know the only way you're gonna watch something is if it's on NBC or CBS or ABC and then those people that run those networks they're in a panic because they got to get people to watch so they'll throw on some reality show but housewives that are fighting to the death and people tune in I mean this look I hosted fear factor you know I understand what they're doing I was a part of the problem or part of the solution if that's what you wanted to watch on television yeah you know they're just trying to get by like they're just trying to figure out what's the next American Idol what's the next you know whatever show the voice like what do I have to do to get 18 million people who sit in front and watch a ball being passed from one man to the other and then try to get across the line everybody goes crazy this this idea that that's the only way we can get our information the only way you're gonna get entertainment or any anything that's coming at you that's being produced and created that's that's dead the what I find interesting about this debate there is it the media is obviously tremendously powerful it's obviously the the interface between most people and ideas and as I worry about the the increase of choice in a sense so it's a very good thing in some respects but in other respects the what what happens you can get Oh eyes audiences our audiences will become catalyzed so let's say that for example I I'm interested in playing computer games so as a 17 year old or something of you if that's what you're into you can just watch that 24/7 you just did so you're not exposed to new ideas so I would say is that choice really the choice is really what you mean is informed choice so you mean well here here's the spread of ideas that our culture is generated over you know more than 3000 years of civilization and you you will stumble across things you didn't know about maybe you become interested in ancient Egypt maybe it could become interested in the the the evolution of Homo sapiens in the Rift Valley two hundred thousand years ago maybe you find that fascinating but if you're not exposed to those ideas at all and culture has no way of exposing you to those ideas beyond the education system then we we're in a we have a problem so I don't know what the solution is to this but I think that there's there's a there's something to be said it will never come back now but the old fashioned model that we had in Britain for many years where the BBC was really quite dominant was that you could almost you could say what we're going to put X Factor on let's say or Dancing with the Stars or whatever that thing is and then after it we're going to put a documentary on about astronomy and the idea is that some of that the people they were watching the talent show it will drift into the documentary guy I didn't know I was interested in the moon of Jupiter called Europa as a ocean surrounding it there may have life on the I didn't know that I didn't know I was interested and that that model works so it you're right though it's gone probably so the great challenge is how do you how do you expose people to new ideas in our culture how do you get debates going how do you stimulate that kind of excitement about knowledge in this new media world maybe you know you're sort of an evangelist in that sense then you're I don't mean in a religious way I mean you're you're someone who evangelizes about the ideas of science and of space like you think it's very important to spread these ideas and that's seventeen year old kid who watches video games all day which easily could have been me that kid will never break out of that mold I think that the I think the seventeen-year-old kid if he watches if he really is completely obsessed and he wants to watch video games all day the only thing is gonna fix that is he's gonna eventually get bored and he's gonna want to try something new and having the infinite options that are available today someone could send him a text dude three words infinite monkey cage google it and the guy all right shit I'm bored of video games and then he'll have access to all kinds of shit that like if he was just waiting for the BBC to spoon-feed him he's never gonna do yeah like also I think that having the stupid shows that we have here in America like if you watch reality shows one of the things you'll notice is the anger that people have about these shows the anger that they're being force-fed this fucking stupid shit but they're still watching it that anger sometimes that that that the rejection of it almost in your soul forces people to go explore other ideas or its inspires people to go explore other ideas the interesting model isn't it frustrate them to the point yeah soul-crushing dullness yeah of culture that you go seek out knowledge may be that I think there's something to it man because one time I was in my hotel room and I was watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians and you know look it was in between shows like you know just flipping through the channels and it was on and it was like I'm shopping and I can't find what I want to get this is so frustrating and my sister won't stop bothering and they're like texting each other but it's so fucking mind-numbing and somehow another I'm sucked into it like it's a tornado and it's carrying my way up into the sky and then I changed the next channel and it's some some biology thing on crocodiles and it's instantly fascinating and it's these people that live on the Nile and this scientist who's down there and he's studying these crocodiles and you know there's the villagers who are worried about these things eating them and then I'm thinking wow this is so fuckin fascinating these people are living next to dinosaurs I mean they have a real you with dinosaurs eating their family like or you could watch these just simple Apes talk about shiny things and they'll talk about shiny things for whole and millions of fucking people do but is that the hang gyrl can't take this anymore and then you switch the channel or go online I really think that does there's a yin and a yang to the world the strongest case for the Kardashian that it compresses you your very soul and existence this into such a small space that you burst out into a world of ideas so that's yeah what's analogous to California because in California we have too much Sun we have so much Sun that it doesn't rain we need 11 trillion gallons of water just to make up for the water that didn't rain in the last three years it's a fucking disaster but if you lived in a place like Alaska in the winter where there's no fucking Sun at all and just looking for little peaks in the clouds or those those days in Portland where it's just 39 days in a row there's no fucking Sun you just get crazy you can't take it anymore and then one day that Sun is there like ah it's so beautiful some me whereas in LA we're like fucking Sun we're so tired of the Sun we just people get used to shit I'm gonna call it the Rogen model which is it which is just depress every they get it not everyone there's gonna be some people that are always going to be they're gonna always gravitate towards nonsense there's nothing you can do about that it's just where we were so varied we're so the spectrum of human beings from the smartest to the dumbest is so wide there's no getting around that life experiences genetics whatever causes it I don't know but there's just certain people that do not give a fuck and they're gonna always be there but concentrating on them you know and and and and like it's profitable like that you can seldom shit it's it's a really good model if you're if you're in the business it is I still you said earlier I'm perhaps optimistic but I think you could I think we can sell them it sounds almost them grew some of them yeah you could sell I'd I still think you can sell ideas to people I'm gonna those people maybe not but there's a lot of fucking people there's 350 million people in this country alone we underestimate people I I've rarely met someone who wasn't interested oh let me take you around bring around some dummies listen dude there's some fucking dummies out there a lot of smart folks like yourself you're hanging out at CERN a bunch of other physicists you're talking about black hole and anyone interested trust me man I hosted fear factor for six years and I'm a cage fighting commentator there's dummies out there there's unfixable dummies and it's probably not their fault but it's probably one of the greatest pieces of evidence to the points towards natural selection and points towards the variability of life and that human beings we very so strongly that in comparison to other like wild animals if you see wolves I mean you see wolves that are slightly larger and slightly more dominant and wolves that are slightly smaller and slightly more timid and they get pushed out of the pack but they're all fucking wolves you see people and you see Brian Cox and then you see Kim Kardashian I mean you guys are both on the same timeline you're you're both alive in this point in history and one of you is talking about fucking shoes and the other one is trying to figure out what happened right after the Big Bang and one of them has a fuckload more people paying attention Brian Cox it ate you buddy it's getting all the eyeballs Carl Sagan's great book the demon haunted world I love that I mean he makes the point that the thing is these peep one has a vote and rightly so we live in a democracy right now you might say well could we have some kind of IQ test threshold for the vote but every therefore the direction of our is in principle in the hands of everyone so we can't just accept the fact that you know well alright well 1% of the world's population is going to pay attention to reality and the rest of them are going to pay attention to reality TV and they're gonna be we're gonna be okay we're not gonna be okay because the 99% will be unaware what they're voting for that they have control and rightly so we live in it over over the direction of our countries so education is extremely important it is important for people so for us to try and make available that the great swathe of knowledge that we've accumulated over the last we were absolutely in agreement about that I just think that the open nature of the Internet enhances that more than stifles it I think the there's only good I only see good I think I'm a big fan of old shit I love to go watch old television shows and old old movies and old especially old stand-up comedy performances because there's not just because it's sort of like a time machine you're you're you're looking back at this moment that's been captured which is absolutely fascinating to me but also the stark differences the obvious differences between culture then and culture now between the awareness of the people like there's some movies that were really good movies but if you try to watch them today you go oh who's that fucking dumb today like no one is that dumb today it's hard like the education level of the people that are communicating in these movies the way they're there they view life is very obviously different in the way we view life today like you could not put father knows best on television today because people wouldn't fucking they're not not enough nope you got it it's got to go to a higher frequency because human beings are very different today than they were in 1950 I think our culture is one of the clearest influences there's some amazing stuff from 1950 it's amazing books are were written there's amazing films that were made but the reality is the culture has shifted dramatically in the last 64 years there's no getting around that it's it's changing and I think having something like the internet just but pushes that in a direction and a guy like you who gets upset a guy like you who gets upset all these reality shows it's really just proof that that is what you're designed to do you're like designed to edge that are annoying you and these programs that are stupid that's actually just fuel it's just giving you more it's giving you an adversary it's giving you motivation to stop it from happening I mean it's if everybody was going to college and everybody was super educated and really aware of the problems with plastic and fossil fuels and boy what a weird world we live in probably nothing would ever get done like the battle between the dummies and the people like yourself is essential it's essential the yin-yang idea that the thesis that they're defining the motor of civilization and human advancement is irritation with dumb people I think I don't appreciate naps unless I work out hard I don't appreciate vacations unless I'm just exhausted I have to be exhausted with work to appreciate vacations I must say it's one of the threads I mean we started talking about infinite monkey cages one of the threads through the whole series is is a slight annoyance that we turn into into something that's interesting generates ideas for us I mean want a bit with a letter about the title the Infinite Monkey cage complaining and shouldn't cage monkeys it was cruel so it said no an infinite it's an infinite cage its Bernie its bristle of room it's arguably the universe is an infinite cage and then another letter came in I think might be the response so we'd send that back and they said it's also supporting this kind of Darwinian myth the Darwinian myth that we're somehow share a common ancestor with a monkey so is how so well there was an experiment done that disproved all your nonsense evidence this is really interesting what's the evidence so we read down and they said there's an experiment done in a zoo in Alabama or somewhere where they got 10 monkeys and they gave them typewriters and after a week or they done was shit on them so the idea that an infinite number of monkeys could write and others isn't it it's like well there's a difference between ten monkeys and an infinite number of monkeys it's not you know ten is not very close to infinity and hence yes these complaints about their and we remember my friend Robin in CI co-presented with he said he said it's not an incremental process this kind of infinite monkey thing it's not like if you have a hundred monkeys then eventually they'll produce a leaflet and then if you have a thousand they'll do maybe a book and then if you had ten thousand they'll do Shakespeare and it's not you know really we mean it it's an infinite number of monkeys you need to type out the word association but yeah we get a lot of we enjoyed the complaints we got a lot from yeah get a lot of complaints from Deepak Chopra actually these days it is not one of those things that that that's like one of those expressions that people always use it if you take an infinite number of monkeys and given the typewriters they'll type out Shakespeare the works of Shakespeare is that true it's an infinite number of monkeys yeah but even an infinite number I think they're gonna fail they're gonna fuck it up your monkeys you don't think you were talking to me earlier about infinity yeah I know but if you get an infinite number of monkeys aren't there if there's the same animal they're the same exact animal they're gonna type the exact works of Shakespeare well they will because there's an infinite number there's every possible combination if less oppresses must have to no Dan is true would it happen what is the odds of it happening in the exact same order of the works of Shakespeare isn't even calculus than zero less than zero you've got an infinite number of them and you've then then you will get everything that can possibly happen will happen could you imagine if one monkey just randomly they gave it a keep you know like look we're talking about the entire universe right so we're talking about an infinite number but what if they just get lucky as fuck and give one monkey a typewriter and this little dude just starts banging out the entire works of Shakespeare but he's still a monkey he's still like playing with his butt and you know swinging around and having a good time he's not doing anything else other than when they put him in front of this keyboard he types out all the works of Shakespeare in exactly the right order the exact punctuation the exact spaces in between letters well if the universe is infinite which it may well be in fact there are many ways the universe can be infinite then that would happen because everything if it's if it's in accord with the laws of physics then it can happen and everything that can happen in an infinite universe will happen because the universe is formally infinite so I contend and I'll probably get emails about that I'm trying to think whether there's any counter-argument I don't think there is I contend that in an infinite universe even the most unlikely possibility must happen in fact formally an infinite number of times so maybe Shakespeare maybe was someone's pet monkey imagine we could calculate it someone can do it online now it's because there are how many letters out there in Shakespeare the complete works of Shakespeare so you can google that someone will tell you and we know you've got 26 possibilities and so off we go and so so how what's the probability what are the odds have randomly typing on typewriter let's say at one letter per second how long will it take and what are the odds that you're type out the complete works of Shakespeare that's a known number I don't know it i stuff in my head but it can be calculated so that's my challenge to your viewers and listeners send in that email someone will do it there's someone working at MIT or something you can do it in five minutes nice and easy some and then you would have to calculate how many monkeys start out with Romeo and Juliet and then just start shitting on their cock typewriter first chapter perfect and then just shit all over the place well I bet every keystroke along the way and there's a monkey shitting on their typewriter like you get like the first paragraph shit all over the place this guy got to the second paragraph shit all over the place yeah and to go back to having fitted monkey cage complaint letter that proves that Darwin is wrong that's the logic yeah can I just say that if someone doesn't remember I just came into the podcast at that point oh Brian Cox does not think Darwin's wrong there's a great website a Twitter handle called take that Darwin where where people that are educationally challenged will question Darwin's theories like that my favorite one is you know if people came from monkeys how come monkeys are still around like they retweet that all day because someone says that fundamental misunderstanding of evolution maybe with the book the only way to truly test is to I think we'll really need to do is take monkeys and give them psychedelic drugs we need to do this someone needs to do this they need to take an island where the monkeys can't escape and give them psychedelic drugs and leave them puzzles and see what they figure out why does that there is a guy named Terence Mckenna who I'm a huge fan of who had a theory called the stoned ape theory and he backed it up allegedly remember who this is coming from with climatological data on that time of the the world that he believes that the evolution of human beings was a big part of it the development of the human brain might have come from them experimenting with psychedelic mushrooms that as the rainforests receded into grasslands animals were forced to try new foods out because their habitat was changing and they would climb down for these trees and flip over these cow patties to get bugs and worms and things along those lines and that this time of the world it was very common to have these psilocybin mushrooms growing all over the place and that the monkeys that would eat them he had a bunch of theories like apparently it's been proven that in low doses psilocybin increases visual acuity which would make you able to see things better which would make you a better hunter also makes you horny so it would make people more likely to breed and that would favor the people or the monkeys rather the the subhuman primates whatever you call them that that went along that line what is it is one of them are they accepted theories about hominin evolution as they got it is that climate change played a key role and actually there's in my latest series human universe we we focused on a theory which links the climate change particularly in the Rift Valley because we know that the big jumps in brain size all occurred in the Rift Valley of Africa and it's quite remarkable actually not that broadly speaking accepted I think although I added a lot of argument with anthropology's because the data is sparse you know but it's broadly accepted that and it seems that the big jumps in brain size occurred at times when the Earth's orbit was most elliptical so the Earth's orbit oscillates it becomes more elliptical and more circular and there are many different oscillations driven by gravitational interaction with the planets like Jupiter in particular and it seems like when the earth saw bits most elliptical that the rate of climate change in the Rift Valley is higher and more extreme and it seems to be the case that there's relatively strong evidence for the case that when you get these really rapid times of climate change as you mentioned then you get increases in hominid brain size and therefore increases in intelligence there's a big wigwams 1.8 1.8 million years ago which was a very big increase in the number of species in the Rift Valley of which Homo erectus was one of them which eventually led to us and big a big jump in brain size as well and this was at a time when there was there's a strong evidence for rapid climate change in that in that region so that makes sense like the adaptability of these animals experimenting with new food sources trying out new hunting methods they a lot of them changed from herbivore to omnivore a lot of the primates that were observed early ok that's where it gets controversial when you look at the academic research because they're what so you the Darwinian idea that so you get this pressure from climate change but then what's the selection effect because climate change happens over many generations it doesn't happen over one generation so the question is well what what actually is doing the selecting what are we selecting for why is this group more likely to breed and be more successful if it's more intelligent so some people say well it's because we they were forced into groups so it's group dynamics it's the fact that you end up with bigger tribes you know hundreds of individuals cooperating together and that's what's been selected for and you need to be intelligent for that some people say as you said that it's more its adaptability so maybe they have to learn to go fishing now they have to learn to eat the particular different crops and then so that's a big area of debate about what might have been the the the selection pressure there's precise selection pressure but it does seem pretty nailed down that climate change certainly in that region of Africa in Ethiopia and Tanzania and through the Rift Valley had played a role in driving us towards intelligence scales very small by the way I mean so you go back four million years and you'll things like Australopithecus are around which are basically outright chimpanzees the brain is not much bigger than a modern-day chimp but then you go to 200,000 years ago and that's when Homo sapiens first emerged just over two hundred thousand years which is not very long ago and it's quite remarkable actually and there the modern theories they get they spread out of africa about 60,000 years ago and they made it into you're off about 43,000 years ago also into the North America and South America only fifteen thousand years ago so it's a very quite a rapid spread and the fact that we've only been around as a species for at most a quarter of a million years a quarter of 1 million years is quite remarkable I think well when you think about what we've accomplished I was flying into Los Angeles last night and I was thinking if you could take the Pioneers that came from Europe in the 17 and 1800's the guys who were on those wagons with the wooden wheels and they're pulling them with horses across the country trying to see what's over there if you could show them like hey man this is what's gonna go down in 2015 hop on this plane look out this fucking window whoa look at that grid they would freak the fuck out they saw all the electricity it's like the sky of Los Angeles in my opinion Los Angeles is more beautiful at night than any other city because it's so spread out it's all lights as you're flying in it looks so science-fiction you know I recently interviewed the astronaut Charlie Jake he landed on the moon with the Apollo astronauts and he said to me is his father couldn't believe it because he he was alive when the Wright brothers flew so he his father spanned the time from the Wright brothers to and he was alive and then his son walked on the moon in in one lifetime sixty years farewell 70 years you know the real mindfuck is what the creation of the plane to the time someone dropped an atomic bomb from the plane is less than 50 years yeah and nuclear physics we didn't know we didn't know there was an atomic Brotherhood discovered the atomic nucleus in Manchester in a house in 1912 ah so I should know but did any I something like 1912 1913 so he discovers the nucleus and within 30 years you have an atomic bomb didn't even know and Rutherford wheel actually asked at the time he said it's the usual question we get as physicists they say what's the use of this and and and Rutherford said that there's no use to it he said anyone who thinks that you could use this as an energy source is talking moonshine and within 30 or 40 years you have nuclear reactors producing power and you have atomic bombs well that's one thing that's been constant about people and predicting the future we've always got it wrong oh we miss some of the rapid advances you know we talk about you know there's a computer down and that phone here the fact that the modern electronics is is a single lifetime the transistor is what 1940s I think they'll let me yes it's not long ago you know that you go from that to this I mean we talk about the Apollo I mean this is significantly more powerful than anything that was available in the world when Apollo was there you know the room rooms filled computers at NASA which were nowhere near as powerful as now it's amazing I mean that's those Google glasses that people are wearing is the sign of things to come in my opinion they they stopped making them but they're there's a new company that has like a goggle that looks like a skiing goggle and it allows you to move things in front of you like a virtual desktop you can spin squares hold things in place throw things to the side and disappear I mean we're gonna get really really really weird within the next couple decades yeah I've actually seen some of that technologies a company called mighty leap and yes I've been there in Miami so you saw it in person yeah what does it looks really it does indeed and you can put 3d objects into your field of vision so how is that working so you've you've actually seen it we yeah we played it we played some videos of it and we couldn't figure out whether we were watching a simulation we're watching what the future holds or we're watching an actual demonstration of that technology yeah oh it's gonna be impressive I think and essentially what you said because it brings the the the web this unlimited information into your field of vision so you can manipulate it and then there are questions about what's real and what isn't and who who cares anyway yeah you know really and it's interesting do you dabble at all in the theory of some sort of an artificial world that we live in you know these ideas of simulation do you dabble in that or is it just too much in actually I mean the a colleague of mine at Mantua there is some physicists who think that it's a possibility as strong possibility that we're living in a simulation I mean it's you know it's speculative out there stuff but it's an attempt to explain some properties of the universe that are that are interesting and unusual so one of my favorite I think at the moment piece of cutting-edge physics in cosmology cosmology I should say the the the study of the universe the origin and evolution of the universe is going through a revolution at the moment and it's coming from data so it's coming from measurements of things like the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the oldest light in the universe we're making it so just about rewind and say what that is and 380,000 years after the Big Bang the universe became transparent for the first time to light and that's because it was cooling down as it was expanding and cooling then atoms formed it became cool enough for atoms to form and at that moment very very quickly the universe becomes transparent and so photons of light can travel on through the universe and they've been doing so ever since and we can take a photograph of that and we have them with a series of satellites the most recent which is called Planck which is European satellite this of their so this is a picture baby picture of the universe as it was 380,000 years after the Big Bang there's very beautiful picture but in explaining that that's given support that theory is called inflationary cosmology theories so inflationary cosmology theories say that before the universe was hot and dense which we tend to call the Big Bang before that the universe was still there and he was doing something else which was an exponential expansion so it was expanding exponentially fast way faster than the speed of light then it stops and all the energy that was there is causing that expansion gets dumped into space heats it up and that's what we see is the particles of energy today so those theories are kind of interested but they also suggest there that there's called eternal inflation theories that say well how long did that period of expansion go on for and does it all stop at once so does it stop in patches and if it stops in patches you get if it stops in a little patch you'd get a big bang and in the universe ourselves another tax you get another big bang another universe you know so it said these theories suggest perhaps through an infinite number possibly of big bangs and inverted commas which would mean they're an infinite number of universes like ours and and they're being created now all the time and they will continue to be created forever so you get this fractal multiverse ever growing exponentially fast and really bizarrely that those theories have some supports from the from the Cosmic Microwave Background they're theories that explain the structures we see I should just underline the fact that this is speculative in a sense but it but it's M but it's relatively mainstream at but it well one of my colleagues noticed and some physicists have noticed is if you were some kind of omnipotent deity programmer and you wanted to run what's called a Monte Carlo simulation to say well I'll vary the strength of gravity in one universe and vary the mass of the electron in another one and vary these physical constants and see what happens then this is probably the kind of thing you'd do this is what it would kind of look like so that you can make an argument that the universe is in some sense looks like one of these kind of so-called Monte Carlo simulations because it gives you the possibility of generates in every possible number of different ratios of the strengths of the forces of nature and all these so I just have to emphasize this is way out there we're on the edge but it's fun then what what is fun an interesting note is that the why no the way back the inflationary cosmology bit his is probably the most widely accepted theory at the moment for how the universe got to be the way it is and it does lend itself to this idea that there may be a multiverse and it may be that in each different pocket universe if you like you can have different physical constants so most of them wouldn't allow life to exist but some of them would most our universe that's very fine tuned in if you look at it in a sense it looks like that the laws of nature were very slightly different you wouldn't get carbon for example produced in stars in in large quantities which you need in order to and when the stars die the carbon and the oxygen come out and they rican lapse into another generation of stars and solar systems and that's how you get the heavy elements that make up our bodies and so all those things look you need you you either try and find an explanation for why the laws of nature of the way they are or you go to one of these multiverse theories and say well actually goes back to what we talked about earlier about the infinite monkeys I mean actually every possibility occurs in nature and then we shouldn't be surprised that we live in the universe that seems fine-tuned for life seems perfect for us to exist in because every possible combination of the laws of nature exist somewhere and this is where cosmology is at the moment it so this is genuine you could go onto the web and google it you'll find a thousand review papers on what's called inflationary cosmology and it is cool and interesting actually yeah it's beyond that it's it's very the the idea of something being infinite and not just in fact but infinite numbers of these infinite things infinite numbers of infinite universe is these these theories exist so this idea of computer simulation the idea that the world we live in the universe we live in is a simulation that was the question yes that's what you went on as beautiful don't change the thing you stay you the idea being that [Applause] one day if human beings continue to increase our technological abilities one day we're like we're talking about this magic leap and we're talking about the the goggles that allow you to see a virtual world we're going to if we don't blow ourselves up or get hit by an asteroid we're going to come up with something that is indistinguishable from the reality that we we see right now and when people start examining the nature of the universe and they start looking at the fractal nature of things and looking at like what you were saying that if you were going to be some omnipotent deity that creates the universe you'd probably do something like this like every single combination and throw methods so when we discover like there's James gates that was the guy's name Sylvester Gates Sylvester Gates it was a guy who spoke to Neil deGrasse Tyson about string theory and that they found in string theory the this computer code that was created by humans and like the 1930s they figured this out and that this actually exists in these codes in string theory and his idea was that that's somehow another proves that there is some evidence support that life the reality that we see right now is a simulation or it could be that which way more likely that you're just discovering some sort of code that the entire universe is based on that when you look at things being fractal and you look at the idea of there being not just infinite expansion but infinite contraction and that there is no smallest point there's just smaller than we can measure but when we talk about subatomic particles and we talk about things being like atoms being mostly air and then you go deeper and deeper and you don't know what the fuck is going on and particles are blinking in and out of existence and existing at the same time both moving and still ah could it be that you just gotta keep getting we just can't see it well I mean the answer is I mean we saw do you know what the fuck's going on it's simple you know if you look to the LHC which is the Large Hadron Collider which is the place where we generate the highest energy so it's the biggest microscope in the world in us and we have an extremely good understanding of the laws of physics at that level and up to and including the discovery of the Higgs particle just as that's been proven is that we made at all the higgs because I remember there was some people that were debating whether or not thanks nerdy say bolson do you say Boston yeah and boson there's a new there is a particle there that we've discovered and it has all the right properties to be the the predicted Standard Model Higgs particle it please explain what that means so the Higgs particle he was predicted back in the 60s my Peter Higgs in others meant its name and it's a the idea is basically that early on in the expansion history of the universe so let's say less than a billionth of a second after the Big Bang as the universe cooled it went through something condensed out into empty space so people call it a phase transition away but it's analogous to a windowpane on a cold winter's day to have cold winters days in LA to get ice on a window it's analogous to water vapor condensing out into ice as you drop the temperature it changes into something else too into ice so in the same way that the theory is that as the universe cooled something condensed out so empty space isn't empty it's full of Higgs particles if you like or a Higgs field so every bit so this means this space now just face between the galaxies in this room that every square metre over this room is full of the Higgs field and our fundamental particles the electrons that say in our bodies interact with that Higgs field and in that process they acquire mass so it's the mass generation mechanism it's why some particles are massive like electrons and quarks and some things like photons are not massive they're massless and they travel through the universe at the speed of light so that's the theory now that was suggested and built mathematically essentially there was very little evidence for it at the time back in 60s but over the years it the theory called the standard model of particle physics passed all experimental tests so we got to the point where we thought right okay we will build a machine that will either disprove or prove that theory and the LHC is such a machine if that theory is correct which it now seems to be it the prediction is you must find the Higgs particle the LHC or some kind of Higgs particle and indeed we found it we as as far as we can so that means that we found a new particle it has the right mass as predicted in the window that was predicted by the theory it behaves in every way like the theory predicts so now what we have to do is be experimental physicists so the LHC turns back on again in about a month actually so it's been upgraded it's been fixed and it's done its maintenance so we're going to make more Higgs particles now and that means we can make more precision measurements and find out whether it is the particle predicted by Peter Higgs or maybe it's one of a number of Higgs particles just possibly likely not now it but it might be so there might be five of them for example which would suggest that theories call supersymmetric theories all right so so we need to know exactly which precisely had the thing behaves which is why we have more work to do but it looks like very sure but very sure that it is a Higgs particle that you can justyou can mess around and build esoteric theories that get you around it but there is a new particle there there's no doubt about that it looks like one of these things but that's the remarkable thing to think about it because it was its Vigna when a great physicist wrote an essay back in the sixties I think all the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and the physical sciences and by the unreasonable effectiveness is demonstrated by this discovery because it really is a mathematical prediction it's like we think there's a new fundamental particle that does the job of giving math to the other particles and this is how it does it and this is how it behaves and this is what it will look like and this is what it will do and then 50 years later you build the biggest machine ever built 60 miles in circumference most of it's in France a bit of it's in Switzerland scientists hundred fifty countries you accelerate protons the nuclei of hydrogen around this thing 99.999999% the speed of light they go around the 60 miles at 11,000 times a second we could collide 600 million of them together every second to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began photographic in the biggest digital cameras ever built the one I work on called Atlas is 40 40 meters in diameter did you vast vast thing 7,000 tons of digital camera in a cavern beside of Simpson that simples Cathedral underneath the ground in Switzerland and you find it you find this link this guy Peter Higgs works with many other people predicted to exist 50 years ago because he did some sums and so it's a real such real so the universe does behave like that there is a condensate in the vacuum it is a Higgs condensate it does give mass to do the particles it so it's a tremendous testament to the power of human reasoning I think and it means that we understand physics it means that we that's one of the important things about it it means that our our understanding of fundamental physics is not horribly wrong at the moment it's it's it's good enough to predict something like that which is a remarkable achievement that is mind-blowing that is truly truly mind-blowing you know and you know Peter Higgs actually so the day that the discovery was announced at CERN packed auditorium Peter was there and a journalist went up to him afterwards and just what I've said this is what happened this machine did a fan this thing and said how do you feel professor Higgs and he said it's very nice to be right sometimes American would show up with a fur coat on glasses price to Beyonce he was it was it was Kenya West wasn't it you keep jumping on stage yeah once right yeah didn't do it again last night did it I can't be bothered so I just keep things see the problem discussions I call the guy J Zed because you called Z Z that's a British thing J people don't know like the zo6 like is a type of Corvette they call it zo6 the Large Hadron Collider also figured out or proved proved quark gluon plasma yes I explained that in the universe in the history of the universe so way after the Higgs mechanism kicks in you get a you have a period when it's still too hot for protons and neutrons to form so the building blocks of atomic nuclei or protons and neutrons daym so a proton is made of two up quarks are quarks and a down quark and a neutron is made of two downs in and up and then some of the stuff in there gluons and things like that but what the universe was went to a phage and it was too hot for that to happen so you get this plasma DC of the free quarks and the gluons and all these things just before it gets cold enough to condense into protons and neutrons and we investigate that by colliding heavier things than protons together at the LHC so we can do silver atoms i silver nuclei are led nuclei and things like that at the other so you can do that and it produces this about a millionth of a second after the Big Bang so quite a long time we can do that as well and see how that phase of the universe behaved and what that stuff is supposed to be just immeasurably heavy right oh the atomic nuclei yeah yeah I mean if you look at so an Astrophysical example would be a neutron star which is basically a big nucleus nuclear dense material the endpoint of a at a collapsed star when it's ran out of fuel it's not too big if it's too big it'll turn into a black hole so a neutron star would be the one and a half times the mass of the Sun let's say something like that but it would be a radius of ten miles so it would easily fit in the LA metropolitan area right but it would have the mass of the Sun or greater so that's an atomic nucleus density that's how you can imagine it something as massive as the Sun compressed into something 10 miles across and we see these things all over the the years neutron stars are fascinating things someone online was explaining it some physicists was explaining that if you had this quark gluon plasma and it was the size of a sugar cube it was it would there's some ungodly amount of weight yeah like you couldn't even imagine it you know Mount Everest you know that kind of it would be like Mount Everest all the mass our mass is in the nuclei and if you got all our atomic nuclei mining your nuclei and stuff them together into that density the you know it would be a grain of sand or something less I mean you think about the universe I mean the modern theories of the Big Bang has taught earlier these inflationary cosmology theories they suggest that the entire observable universe which has now got three hundred and fifty billion galaxies in it was at some point the size of a baseball or less so so we imagine or we speak of in in modern physics we have theories to address the time when the entire observable universe was something that you could hold so you've got enough energy in there to make 350 billion galaxies each with 200 billion stars and it's remarkable that we're not quite there with the laws of physics but we're not far oh those are the the kind of duster physics we're doing at LHC basically we try to explore the laws of nature and seat find the laws of nature will describe the universe when it was that hot and that dense and we are quite close I say we we're good from about a billionth of a second after the Big Bang then that's where we have our theories that talk about the Higgs boson and things until we understand that very well and so the challenge now is to get back beyond that and that's where you that's where string theory attempts to live which you mentioned earlier string theory we don't know if it's right we have no evidence that that is an approach to trying to describe the universe before those times when our current laws work the idea of a birth and a death of the universe trouble some people the idea that we have sort of artificially subscribed the idea that this had to start somewhere yeah and that it may very well be an infinite expansion and contraction like waves going in and waves going out the idea of being the entire universe may one day get to a point where it pulls down into itself and becomes one event horizon one infinite piece of mass and then starts all over again is that possible the current if you look at the how the universe is expanding at the moment then it is accelerating in its expansion so that the measurements tell us that the expansion rate itself is getting faster and we have a name for that we call it dark energy and so be and of order sixty five seventy percent of the energy in the universe appears to be taken up in in driving this increasingly fast expansion and so that looks like if nothing happens then that becomes dominant so so it continues to accelerate in excess Panchen and in the end you get something that looks like this inflationary period that I said may may have had existed before the universe was hot and dense so it looks like so that looks like what's happening at the moment so whether that can stop whether there's something that can stop it in the same way as it seems to have stopped very early in the history by the way and whether that's true nobody knows we don't know the mechanism but the the measurements tell us of distant particularly looking at supernovae in distant galaxies and also actually from this cosmic microwave background radiation I mentioned earlier the detailed modeling and measurements are they're all consistent and suggested the universe is accelerating in its expansion so that would suggest that it's not going to rebound because it's everything's it's like a big rip scenario almost where everything's accelerated space-time is stretching at a faster and faster rate at the moment that seems to be what's happening so you feel that it's much more likely that there are infinite numbers of these things happening that there's not just one Big Bang that creates this universe and we're watching this universe expand but that there's infinite numbers of these things that are happening at the exact same time that said that's most speculative so the way that the inflation is is probably textbook now you get some physicists that will argue with it but broadly speaking I think many astrophysicists think the inflation's the best theory we have because it pretty makes predictions that are agree with observation so it's the best theory in terms of making the best predictions at the moment in this is that it's very very fast superluminal faster than light expansion that stops and the end point of that is what we used to call the Big Bang and so that's broadly speaking textbook still that's what you teach in undergraduate cosmology courses that then some physicists argue that the natural extensions of those theories are theories called eternal inflation which are what you said where you this this exponential expansion of space-time is always going on and it stops just in little patches and that little patch is where you generate a new pocket universe if you like of which ours is one example and you can have an infinite number of those and they were being that they would be being produced now and you can ask the question how long does that mean going on and the answer is nobody knows and there's a debate even amongst the people who believe in those theories about whether it could have gone on forever or whether it would have started in what a colleague of mine Dereham Carlos Frank Oz the mother of all Big Bang's so was there a mother of all Big Bang's that set this process in motion and in that thing that got that big the answer is this is cutting-edge stuff is it's very exciting and but I'd say just to be very precise the inflationary bit the simple bits which was first put forward in the 80s actually by Alan Guth and people like that in the US and Ray Linda another one that looks right in the sense that it matches data very well and the consequences of it over argued about and interactive areas of research at the moment one of the things that people were terrified of about the Large Hadron Collider is that in trying to find the Higgs that you might accidentally create black holes little tiny ones it would just go eaten through the earth like a little ping-pong ball that shot through the entire planet that that's idiots like me holy shit however is it possible to create a big bang or excuse me a black hole is that is it possible theoretically to have enough power like if you don't have it right now with the Large Hadron Collider is it possible that a larger machine will be created and human beings can recreate a black hole yes it's possible and it's possible if you have extra dimensions in the universe right so the thing is that so we need gravity is a very weak force is by far the weakest of the four fundamental forces of nature bit billions and billions of times weaker than the other ones which you can tell because you can pick up you know phone even though the planet planet Earth is trying to stop me doing that and I can just resist the pull of planet so gravity is very weak so that gives you a clue that you can say well what energy how far do I have to go back in time if you like in towards the Big Bang before it's so hot that gravity is as strong as the other forces the strength of the forces varies I should say with with with energy so they change so that and we've seen this behavior so so two of the forces so-called the electromagnetism which is the most familiar one electricity that one and the weak nuclear force which is one of the forces that operates in the atomic nucleus they are the same force their manifestations of the same force and we've seen this experimentally and in fact the Higgs boson is part of that process and so we've seen the energies that they become the same force so the idea is the other force the strong nuclear force because higher energies and temperatures converges and they'd have some things called grand unified theories and then gravity makes its lethargic way back and unifies with them it's something called the Planck energy which is demesne the short timescales after the origin of the universe if you want so very very hard so it's a way in excess of anything yes so if you just want to just create black holes in a lab then the naive thing is you'd have to go to those energies and there's nowhere in the universe you'd never do it so you'd have a path to accelerate at the side of the observable universe and it wouldn't be big enough but if you allow extra dimensions in space so you might imagine that so we would live in a three-dimensional space and then there's time as well as we've got four dimensions if you allow this to be five or six or thirteen I think the string theory the key changing their mind you know 13 now and then what you can do is you can arrange for that energy scale which gravity becomes important to come up to the temperatures to drop so you can arrange you can arrange in some contrived way to get to the point where you could possibly access gravity see gravity in action as it were in particle accelerators things as big as the LHC and in that case you would produce we little black holes which would then evaporate away very quickly we think through a process called Hawking radiation and they'd be they'd be gone so you can conceive of a way that you could if given a big of a leap that there are extra dimensions in the universe and given that they're configured in the right way that you can imagine that you could do it the the the interesting point though is that so LHC is is it's a tremendous technological achievement but it collides particles together there are energies that are just insignificant compared to the energies that are available in the universe to nature so cosmic rays for example hit the earth with energies far in excess of those that we generated LHC so whatever physics you can conceivably access of these passive accelerators is already being access now in the upper atmosphere of the planet because the cosmic ray collisions are immensely higher energy so so if you can make little black holes because they're extra dimensions in the universe then they are raining down on those now they're here that they get made because the the energies of the LHC is I said Astrophysical processes all over the universe way in excess where you exceed those energies we're not very good at doing high energy collisions compared to nature threats of supernova explosions and compared to all the and cosmic rays because a cosmic ray actually that was detected I think the highest energy one was the had the energy of a professional tennis player serve so hundred mile an hour tennis ball right and it's a single particle so you imagine getting hit by a hundred mile an hour professional tennis player serve on the back of the head there a cosmic rays with that energy but there did you know one particle 1 particle equal the enemy's assertive miles-an-hour tennis ball so these are incredible energies way beyond then how many particles would be in a tennis ball oh it's a good question that so let's do some let's ever think so it's a began to rose number is what is it six thousand to the twenty three isn't it that's right so that that's the number of particles in the number of atoms let's say in 12 grams of carbon so it's it solved the old of so 10 to the 23 is it well 10 to the 24 is a million million million million right so that's so a million million million million particles would be what you'd have in essence a carbon you'd have you know you put me on the spot your honor that's what you'd have in about what 60 60 grams of carbon or something like so so you guys to guess I'd say something like that and that's chemistry see I don't do chemistry but that's out there just floating around having out during the galaxy like when a hypernova you're still trying to do the math yeah people do that all the time this shows all about wrong answers you're just talking it's not your field of study I understand well he should be really really chemistry particle physics the bigger blobs I watched a documentary once on hyper Nova's that when they were first discovering the gamma bursts in the galaxy they thought it was aliens having wars with each other that that was one of the one of the ideas that were being bandied about great I mean people do legitimately look for signatures from alien civilizations like that sort of yeah but it's kind of smell is mad feely do but they actually you can do there are papers written about because you might say what would the signature of an interstellar starship look like presumably be a matter antimatter drive or something like that so you get these very clear signatures of matter-antimatter annihilation that we know about because we do that the particular photons gamma rays with particular energies and so you can you can actually say well shall we have a look what would it look like if we saw an interstellar civilization and into spacefaring civilization could we detect the signatures so there's a bit of work done on that and we don't see any we don't see any evidence for anything well when you see someone like the people that run SETI search for extraterrestrial intelligence and they're always like asking for funding like you know we need more funding we have to figure this out and one day what if we shut down and the signal comes like that seems to me to be like one of the biggest like Hail Mary wishes like hoping that you're gonna find a radio signal from a galaxy far far away that has intelligent life I mean our galaxy well it's interesting though if you ask astronomers so you say what's the probability of other civilizations been out there then they were point for example to the new data from the Kepler space telescope which tells us that there are probably around 20 billion earth-like planets in the Milky Way galaxy in the sense that there's small rocky planets in what's called the habitable zone around stars the Goldilocks around main-sequence stars like the earth like the Sun so 20 billion so maybe one in 10 stars in the sky has an earth-like planets around it potentially so that's a lot so you think 20 billion well surely life must have arisen on on some of those the answer is probably yes I suspect I suspect well we may find life on Mars in the next 10 years but it'll be microbes so the question then becomes well how likely is it for simple life if it arises to make its way into a civilization and that's where the biologists comment and can't can the astronomers down and say well you might think there are lots of places for life we would agree but on earth it took 3.8 billion years to go from the origin of life to a civilization which is about a third of the age of the universe give or take so you had to have an unbroken stable line of life that evolves in the in the right way as it were to so it first of all it gets complex and it took there's a thing called a Cambrian explosion in the history of life on Earth which it was about 550 million years ago or so which sounds like a long time but for three billion years before that there was nothing that we would call complex single-celled organisms doing some clever stuff like photosynthesis but not much and then in meat suddenly you get a big jump in the oxygen content of the atmosphere on earth which was to do with photosynthesis and some geology in play with it that's how the oxygen gets into the atmosphere and then you get a big jump and you get complex life emerging and then pretty quickly you know half a billion years or so you go from complex things to a civilization but even then you think about Homo sapiens we mentioned earlier they only arose two hundred thousand years ago so for that for the vast majority of the history of life on Earth there's been nothing that could do anything clever in a sense of thinking and building spacecraft and radio telescopes so so there's a legitimate debate about whether the undoubted increase in we know now that there are homes for life out there in the Milky Way they're very common and we know that but what we don't know is the probability that life will emerge in the first place and secondly the probability that we'll be turning to a civilization and I think that's very low so I think like I think the probability if I guessed I would say the probability that life will emerge given the right conditions is very high and what one piece of evidence you could put forward to that is that it did appear to emerge on earth as soon as it could after the formation of the earth and the oceans so you get life but then it took a long time on earth so you might say well the you know the probability of it doing anything intelligent and interesting in a quite low maybe less than one in 20 billion in which case you we end up being the only civilization in the Milky Way at the moment if it's possible you can make the argument and my experiences academic biologists tend to be on the cautious side and an astronomers tend to be on the optimistic side it's all relative though isn't it because even if we are only one out of this entire Milky Way galaxy you still believe that it's possible for an infinite number of monkeys to create the works of Shakespeare so we did that but if you look at the entire universe then the idea of there being not just a life form like human beings but the exact same life form is not just once but an infinite number of times in the universe in the universe well I'm sure I mean to 50 billion galaxies in the observable universe it would be surely there are civilizations out there and more advanced as well yeah I'm sure I'm sure that's for sure and it has to be the case in an infinite universe you say but if you can find ourselves to the Milky Way which is really the only place we have any hope of exploring or contacting anyone will never contact anyone even in the Andromeda galaxy its 2.2 million light years away but we won't we won't but but the Milky Way if there's someone there we could at least aspire to contact them so it's worth that effort to listen we don't spend much money on it it's we spend too little on it I think it would be a tremendous discovery if we made it as far as something like that it's worth listening because and you know when SETI started back with Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and others back in the sixties then they had no planets have been discovered beyond the beyond the solar system none so you the only planets we knew were our planets now as I said that we've discovered thousands of planets confirmed discoveries and the the statistics tell you there are billions of them out there so virtually every star probably has a planetary system so the statistics have gone in the favor of SETI from the astronomical perspective but as I say you've also got to have the time to make things like us you know and that that's a tortuous process there's no inevitability to evolution I think it's not it's not a that it's not to be seen as some March to complexity evolution is its it it does what it does single-celled organisms were very very good at just surviving and getting on with it for over it for most of the history of life on Earth so it may be the complex multicellular life is kind of a just a an aberration really it's just a bit of a lucky accident so it's all really just perspective when you think about it because there's even though there's an enormous galaxy relatively speaking it's one tiny little thing in comparison to the rest of the universe yeah so even if we could find something out there the likelihood of it being as advanced as us are very small well no it's just amount of how far we can reach or how far we can to see I I wouldn't go that I nobody knows it we did what what people do know I think is that the Milky Way is probably the boundary of our aspirations its and put this generation or I think so what if we live a hundred thousand years and well keep evolving that the galaxy is 100,000 light years across there are two hundred billion star systems in it and it's it's big it's too buddy but that that's not so so you could just about perhaps conceive in the far future of beginning to spread out into the Milky Way you could conceive of that it given hundreds of thousands of years right but any of you then you go well where's the next galaxy Andromeda it's two over two million light years away so the idea that you would get across a distance of two million light years with any conceivable technology is to me probably I mean it takes the light a light beam to two million years so if you want to talk to someone in Andromeda you it will take two hundred two million years to get a message out there and two million years to get it back so it's a four million round-trip that's the nearest galaxy so it's big right but so so you can imagine possibly the Milky Way it's some chance if there are other civilizations there talking to them but I think beyond that I just cannot conceive of how it would be done is this relative though in perspective to the single-celled organisms that existed billions of years ago in comparison to us do we really think that we're the end-all be-all this is the last stop on the road to evolution isn't it possible that we get so advanced if we live to be another billion years that we can all these ideas that we have in our head about the laws of space and time and the the what particle physicists are trying to figure out and what string theorists are prescribing as far as you know fifteen different dimensions that what you said that one I want to get into that because I don't understand string theory know I don't know but I understand what you're saying but but you're right but my idea is if we continue to go we are on the same path I mean isn't it possible that we will achieve some unfathomable level of technological proficiency or of control over matter or of or of an understanding of the universe it's such a deep level that we can violate all these things that we now consider laws like the laws of yeah so the laws would have to be approximation is to some deeper laws the so Einstein's theories of relativity the best theories we have at the moment of space and time of space-time thank God for Einstein so that is its birth amazing and so the speed of light as a as a fundamental part of the structure of space and time actually is central to that theory it's actually the thing that protects cause and effect so it protects if you like the past from the present and the future so it's built in a very fundamental way to that theory so you are right it's in principle that and it's a speed limit in that theory by the way and by the way there's strange things happen as you approach the speed of light for example the theory says that time slows down right thing that's traveling relative to us so if someone the number I know is the number for the protons in the LHC so the protons go 99.999999% the speed of light let's so imagine one of those flying pastors now and you imagine how to watch Frode son with a watch and you'd see its watch past seven thousand times more slowly our watch see it would live seven thousand times more slowly than us so conversely if it was watching us it would see the same effect so you can so you can move through time at different rates essentially United Stein's theory that the faster you go relative to somebody else the slower your watch ticks I got an idea we combine your world and the Kardashians and we shoot them in a space of the speed of light and they don't age well that's exactly right so exactly the cool thing about that that's what I was going to so the visit by trellis it is if you go at the speed of light you don't age no time passes the the it's kind of pointed that you can't go at the speed of light unless you're massless but that's kind of tell but if you mess that you have to move your ass good luck making that thing massless well exactly so she would be limited to travel below the speed of light even if she only if she lives only 1 gram in mass Plus that's not a very aerodynamic object either launching that sucker oh that's right wouldn't matter in space because it's a vacuum right so it's a fundamental thing so it's so if you if you're going at that fundamental speed there's no time there's no distance actually there all the distance is shrink to zero so it's it's a web tracee's it's a fundamental part of the structure of space and time so it's been possible so you would need a different theory so it's literally impossible in Einstein's theory to go at the speed of light unless your mess less could you go just under the speed of light and then time would just slow down yes so it wouldn't you wouldn't it wouldn't stop but it would slow drastically yeah yeah so as I said 99.999999% gives you a factor of 7,000 now here's the question if you somehow or another were able to go 99.999% of speed of light what would happen in your perspective as far as time would with time normal rates at a normal rate yeah so you would age at a normal rate in your perspective but back home like if you came back around he went out into space and you went 10 years at the speed of light and you know you came back everything it would change but you'd be exactly the same yes what would change for you though something has to change so it's the distances so if you travel so the other thing is from the put let's talk about the protons in the LHC again so they're times passing 7,000 times more slowly from the perspective if someone stood on the ground watching them go round but from their perspective times gone at the same rate but something must change so what is it it's a distance so the LHC no longer 16 miles in circumference it's about now I know the number in metric so it's 4 meters so that's sir what is that in 3 feet wealth in the meter it's like 3.5 feet 12 feet yes so it's 12 feet so it's it's squashes and so distance is shrink from the perspective of the protons so time passes at the same rate that the normal rate for them for non their watch but the distances seems to seem to shrink or do shrink not seem to they do the are you concerned at all about artificial life are you concerned at all about the creation the inevitable creation of something that in some way replicates independent thought and acts on its own accord I always wonder if human beings are in some sort of a sense a technological Caterpillar that's becoming a butterfly and we just don't realize and all of our work if you look at one of the things that human beings are absolutely fascinated with whether or not it benefits us or not we're fascinated with technological innovation what we want faster computers even if we don't even have applications for them we want cars that go zero to 60 in two seconds we want everything to go quicker and better and we don't get satisfied like nobody ever looks at computers and goes we're good we're good we don't we don't need a bigger laptop we don't need a stronger harddrive everything seems fine let's stop innovating on computers and move towards cancer research or no we will never we're never gonna stop and I always wonder if what whatever drives us what it would if it is what if it's similar in some way to a caterpillar building a cocoon get about to give birth this new thing totally unaware and that artificial life that our work with whether it's code or whether it's electronics or whether it's 3d printing a combination of all those technologies coming together to create some new form of life and we don't think of life being possible in an electronic sense because we think of life as being cells and blood and all the things that we are but is it possible that we might just be building the neck thing that we know we look at well we've only been alive for 200,000 years yeah well we might be shitting out the new version of life yeah with our constant fascination with materialism I mean what is materialism ultimately if not a push for innovation and technology a big part of what materialism is is keeping up with the Joneses getting the latest and greatest look at this this guy's got a new TV it sees your fucking brain you know looks through your soul you could play back your history you know it gets a fingerprint it you read it it takes your DNA and it shows you what your ancestors are doing two billion years ago I mean well there's another aspect to our and a besides consumerism isn't that there's increased life expectancy decreased child mortality all those great things to it but I agree I agree with you I don't see any reason why a AI is is in principle not possible III because I think that although you know the research we don't understand the brain but I think it must must be an object that operates in accord with the laws of physics yeah I strongly suspect that our conscious experience is emergent so it emerges so there's a there's an algorithm they're very complex algorithm but I don't see why it can't be simulated in a sufficiently powerful computer in principle so I don't see why you can't have a conscious computer I I don't personally see why you can't therefore if that's true then you can given and as you say the rate of increase in computing power is is rapid we're not there yet there is a project in Europe a very big project to build a brain simulator it's a long way off and you're talking about billions of dollars but and at the moment you know as you say that 40 years ago a billion dollars wouldn't you bought you an iPhone come right but so so yeah I I agree with you and actually and as you said 3d printers essentially seemed to be the first step on the road to a self-replicating machine so you've got the computing power that can be intelligent and you've got a means of it being a replicator then I don't see why you can't build a eyes that replicate and actually going back to the cosmology for a minute one of the arguments against the distance of civilizations more advanced civilizations the nose in the Milky Way is that they would have done that and this is an argument from a mathematician called von Neumann and also a physicist called Fermi it's called the Fermi paradox that let's assume that let's let's fast forward as you said let's fast forward our civilization ten thousand years less a blink of an eye let's see we've only been around but we've been around for less than that as a civilization let's double it ten thousand what are we going to look like will we have built self-replicating ai's yeah unless there's some reason in principle why you can't so what do you do you send those out there replicators they can go to asteroids mine print 3d print of version themselves go off again they exponentiate they can crawl over the galaxy exploring for free you send them out we've seen no evidence of those things they call von Neumann machines so it's it one of the great you can either say that there's something in principle that stops you doing it so actually there is something special about intelligence and you just can't with some reason why you can't build a computer that's that artificially intelligent I don't see why that would be the case oh you could argue you can't build a self-replicate but you can because we are we're replicators and we operate in accord with the laws of physics so there so there's a replicator or the reason we don't see them is because there aren't any civilizations that ever got to that level in the Milky Way so well that's beer no one what we can't we couldn't be the third it's very difficult to see how we could be the first someone has to be the first what can it be us but because because the Milky Way has been around for the age of the universe so you say don't you know the earth is 6,000 years old do you not go on beside the timescales we're talking billions of years really into planets billions of years but it has to happen dinner one time was somewhere and then sudden and if you get one wave of these a eyes away in space then you can show using computer models with realistic assumptions about rocket power and things like that you can cover the galaxy in on timescales of much less than a billion years actually million years less than that so you can show that you can cover the galaxy in your von Neumann probe your replicators in you know hundreds of thousands of years let's say a million two million three million ten million doesn't matter because we've got billions of years and yet we see no evidence of them so so what are we to make of that you were either there's something wrong with our arguments that we're putting forward that actually you can't build self-replication intelligent robots I don't see why not but maybe there's something wrong with that or really civilizations are so rare that as you say we are the the first to get to that level but that's interesting isn't it that that would be an interesting I always think in a most Sagan esque sensor this so imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy what a tremendous responsibility there is on us imagine why that knowledge should do to our political processes the way that we think about ourselves the way that we get on together imagine how ridiculous it is to divide our little world up into countries and another little war every now and again important you can we miss how's it each other if in fact there's nowhere else in the Milky Way galaxy where anybody thinks where anybody can look at the Stars and think about and have these conversations what a ridiculous way to behave so I think the cosmology is gives a perspective which is not it doesn't necessarily need to be humbling it is humbling that's perhaps a good thing but it doesn't it you don't need to be depressed about it it could be quite elating you say well with what we are according to the evidence and the data at the moment is almost indescribable especial our our tiny 'no sir potential uniqueness our insignificance in a cosmic scale actually makes us special because we're the only place and so these these ideas are worth pursuing i think because they make you think about these issues what doesn't it also point to our ego that we think that our biological process is any more important than the exploding Suns that are required to create carbon life in the first place or or any of the processes of the universe dance that I think is that you're right in a in a signal in a completely logical sense we're no more important or less important than the stars themselves you're right we're natural objects but I would counter by saying that people look for meaning in the universe people like to look for meaning it's this one thing that we've done since we began to look at the Stars the universe means something to me doesn't it it does meaning exists because it means something to us so we know that it would be ridiculous to say the universe is meaningless it means something in mind well we have families we have one that said so the fact that that meaning might be emergent it might appear from the laws of nature and it is almost certainly transient unless we build these self-replicating machines we're not going to last forever as a civilization probably so that to me that doesn't in any way water down the significance of it so I think again cosmology can be can be a powerful aid to philosophical thoughts in this sense because we have to accept that there's meaning in the universe because it means something to us I don't see why it has to be eternal I don't see why their meaning doesn't imply purpose I don't think any purpose to the universe that means any point to our existence but the fact that we exist at all is worth celebrating you don't need to add anything else in fact you almost deep it's familiar devalue it so why would you this is remarkable we emerged single-celled organisms probably before that we emerge some chemical reactions in in hydrothermal vents probably down in the deep primordial oceans of ancient earth and over 3.8 billion years we've come to the point where we can sit and think about the Stars and have conversations like this is that not enough why does it have to be a point there isn't a point I don't need to point to that but it's worth celebrating well it certainly is to us to us it's amazing but you know in a lot of ways isn't looking throughout the incredible cosmos for signs of life like looking in a sea of parked mercedes-benz for dust likes one of these cars must be fucking dusty he just cleaned them I'm gonna find it and you're ignoring the the incredible mechanisms that are in front of you this is an amazing technology anti-lock brakes fucking 12-inch computer screens they didn't have gauges anymore the cars drive you they steer for you they break for you more like one of these motherfuckers has dust on it just like us these planets we talked about our planet being 4.6 billion years the universe is 13.8 we're looking for things that live a hundred years well like just gotta be one out there that sing-songs yeah somewhere there's a better rapper than jay-z and he's out there in the universe we find him we're gonna find him this is a search and we're ignoring gamma rays and we should rewrite masses and reason you know again though it doesn't take anything away from the fascination of just you know one of the beautiful things about being a human being is that we think about these things and that we can communicate and that you and getting on this podcast can you're planning all these seeds in people's minds that are making them consider these thoughts and now it spreads and that's that's one of the most fascinating things about the idea of intelligence is that the intelligence baguettes intelligence intelligence sort of stimulates other intelligent it's not simply I mean I think one of the reasons why you love educating is like you know how important this is for you and you want you've seen the spark and people's eyes when you explain these things to them and you realize that that person might spread that spark somewhere else and this is really what this process is about in the first place it has meaning to us but in the grand scheme of things no we're just exporting Cardassians through the universe the resistance of exploring the Cardassians makes people you know the new version of cosmos with neil degrasse tyson back that gets out there too that makes me optimistic actually because i wouldn't i think it's all together he done again you know I'd you know I have to because Carl Sagan great hero of mine I mean the fact that it would be done and put on Fox on a network you know in 13 episodes of it yeah it is there are people out there who want to do it yeah it's very sparing most certainly and more so now than I think ever before and more so in the future I think even though there is evidence that people are dumbest shit there's still more evidence that people are super curious there's I think it's just it's a numbers thing and if you spoon feed people the same thing over and over again like you know there's the argument for a limited network especially american-style you know you get or you could just sort of do it the BBC way but the BBC way is beautiful and that it sort of sandwiches these brilliant shows in which we know their shows like but not enough it's not enough room there's too many things out there now there's you only have 24 hours in a day there's no fucking way you're gonna have enough programming you just unless you have an infinite number of BBC's like you can't there's just too much shit going on the world is too vast and that's not discounting anything that the BBC has ever done is one of my favorite networks I'm like I have this Congo series that I probably watch a dozen times about the BBC which is one of the most fascinating document documentaries not just on a particular area of the world but on life itself adapting which is like the primary sort of theme to the to that documentary where they're talking about these these parts of the world that were changed really rapidly over a period of a couple thousand years where it used to be planes and then it became these dense rainforests and there's all these animals that are sort of trapped in this world like rhinos and plains animals and they were there was a piece on these um these type of antelope called a duiker that swims underwater a hundred yards they can fucking swim they eat fish I mean it's craziness if swimming endless swimming and it swells like related to an antelope but the idea is that you're talking about a very short period of time a couple thousand years that's had this rapid amount of change these animals have had to adapt this very strange new environment this is I think that the the the inability of some people to understand the evolution and then react and therefore react against it not only it's all actually just just religiously-motivated most of it is but some of it isn't I think there's also a lack of understanding of the time scales involved and how fast animals can adapt and change and what what a powerful SIV have you like evolution is you can see it Richard Dawkins often right when he's writing beautifully about these things writes about and look at domestic dogs and look how quickly the wolf got turned into these sort lady from poodles to German shouts or whatever it is all this thing that's that now that's selection by humans right so we're selecting particular traits but the environment and the interaction with other species is as powerful as that it's as efficient as that it's the environment is a very powerful selector over traits and so you can see that evolution happens quickly speciation happens quickly that not quite with the dogs they're still the same species we can see how given a bit of time you're going to get the poodles and keep going on that line and get the the wolves and keep going on that line and eventually you're gonna get things that look so different that if you separate them and don't let them into breed that you're going to end up with something that can't breed with that anymore and that's kind of the definition of a new species if one of the definitions of a new species so you can see how it can happen it's obvious but I think one of the problems is the timescales they're not understood we talked about thousands of years that's quite a long time ten thousand years is a long term 200 thousand years you go back that long and we didn't exist as a species we weren't there so so you know hundreds of thousand years is a hell of a long time yeah - too long - I think in our mind to process like we can kind of process a lifetime you know we can process birth to a hundred years while he lived to be a hundred Wow a lot of what a lot of things that guy must have seen yeah but to process a hundred of those yeah a hundred hundreds how about a thousand how about a hundred thousand uh it's it's just too much going on there's too much change a long time do you subscribe to the idea and I've heard this debated about that human intelligence may be in some form exponential and that all the knowledge that people have acquired I mean obviously not like in a physical sense like you know you're not born with an understanding of math and language and all these things are learned but that intelligence may somehow another be not just passed on from generation to generation but enhanced by life's experiences and that the genes that are transmitted from you to your children may be in fact more powerful than the genes you were given and that as you've lived your life and acquired information and knowledge and understanding and whatever whatever intelligence means you know whatever sort of intangible idea intelligence truly is but that this mind power this this this accumulation over the two hundred thousand years that human beings have existed and people breeding and getting to this point that this might exponentially be growing and expanding is that is that in any way possible that we're I I'm not an expert on genetics I don't think so I don't think there's any evidence as far as I know that our IQ average IQ is to change much right over the last few hundred years certainly so as far as I know that's not the way that it works there's the you need I think some kind of selector that would say you'd have to take them the most intelligent of us by some measure let's say and and have them be more successful at producing offspring than the people who are less intelligent you'd have to do something you need some mechanism proven like haven't they done like those do those sperm banks are really super intelligent people and the kids that come out of it or smartest shit oh well that I could imagine that might be true I don't think we know I think the correct answer scientifically you don't know the link between oh enough about the genetics and the genome the human genome to say which bits are producing brain power if the research there what is it that you know which genes is an intelligent gene or a set of genes and I think that's not known I think is the right thing to say but as I emphasize it's not my field I died ponder when you think about evolution you think about genetic knowledge and then the I like certain well that that I would perhaps argue with the idea that I know there's some interest in this but I think that the standard answer is that the the knowledge let's say so I become educated that I think the standard answer is that that would not have any impact on the genes that I pass to my offspring I don't think there's any known mechanism to to have knowledge imprinted so now back into your genetic code such that it can be sent on to you but yeah I you know you may have seen otherwise I'm not aware of any research it's hard to look look into a kid's head and find out exactly where all the information is coming from right yeah but I don't think there's a known well there isn't a known um [Music] ain't no we had a TriCaster just freeze up on us people at home right now are freaking the fuck out we were just about to get to the bottom of this um instincts like humans have certain instincts right like there's people have fears like genetically sort of predisposed fears to like scary dogs animals I mean we know we don't have to have a dog bite you to know that dog is fucking terrifying like what is that like when a dogs like her are growling like kids are afraid of teeth they're afraid of big teeth and monsters like even children that grow up in cities they're afraid of monsters and the idea behind that that I've heard I think it was Rupert Sheldrake that was talking about this he was saying that it may very well be that these memories of being preyed upon by like cats like that these genetic memories that are from our ancient ancient ancient ancestors when we didn't have homes and we were living in trees and we were you know things were running after us trying to eat us these ideas are passed down from animal to animal and eventually human to human I don't think as I say as far as I know there's no solid evidence that suggests that things you experience as a as an adult or as a child that the experiences themselves can be can be passed on the other than verbally to them when they're listening to your stories that I'm not aware of any mechanism that's known that would allow that haven't they've proven that genetics like epigenetics and then some some memes like even useless ones like racism can be transmitted from parent to child know that I'm aware of but I don't know my field study they're just I'm just fascinated by the idea that we don't totally understand all of the all the ingredients of the mind and that's the certainly true yes certainly true but I'm not where I don't know I doubt it because I can't see a mechanism Bryant I don't know are we back up Jamie what's going on the TriCaster froze oh what a piece of shit that we paid $15,000 for how dare you try caster people meanwhile we should probably excited that someone figured that fucking thing out do you think it might have to do with the box and it gets heated up no just shit out us yeah most likely right how dare they um one of the things that was proposed that I read recently was that black holes aren't real is that nonsense is that like one person's controversial idea yeah yeah there's not necessarily nonsense just because it's one person's idea but it's likely to be nonsense i I haven't seen that particular theory so I don't know I mean the we have a lot of good evidence for the existence of black holes not least their predicted their a prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity they're unsullied theoretical ground and we've seen the signatures of them so for example the objects at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and we know what the masses of that object because we've measured the orbits of stars very close to it we know what the maximum size of the object can be because it can be bigger than the orbits and the styles that go around it and so we measure its mass I think it's about four million times the mass of the Sun and the only way that our current laws of physics allow such an object to exist and be so small is for it to be a black hole so there's good evidence that black holes are around but you can always say well you know we've never we haven't been to one they're very hard to photograph because they're black but you can but you can photograph the stuff that falls into them you can see the signature of stuff falling into the which we do and they've they've what was it like it was the the somewhere in mm they figured out that at the center of every galaxy is a supermassive black hole that is like what 1/2 of 1% of the mass the galaxy so we think so as I said I think socks off my head I think is about 4 million times the mass of the Sun so the larger galaxies would have a larger black hole I'm not sure if it's that it's not well understood actually cuz it's not well understood how galaxies form in the first place and and what role these supermassive black holes have in the formation of the galaxies so that's a real active area of research actually the thing that I was reading was they were debating the possibility that inside each one of these supermassive black hole so like there being hundreds of billions of galaxies each one of them with a black hole in the center of it a supermassive black hole in through that black hole is a whole nother universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies each with black holes go through that a whole hundred billion more galaxies each with black holes go through that one hundred billion more I mean that that each galaxy itself literally is a portal to a completely different universe we I mean the point we don't have it right the problem with black holes is that they're they're they're prediction of Einstein's theory one of the earliest predictions are the thing called the swatch child metry which describes black holes it was done I think in 1915 us right as soon as relatives he was published is what they're shown that these things could exist but we don't the the the theory itself breaks down and then the theory of black holes that the general relativity which is the theory that they explain Einstein's theory says so predicts their existence but it doesn't that the characteristics of black holes the physics inside black holes is not understood we don't know our theories don't work we need what's called a quantum theory of gravity to make progress there so that's the unification of quantum theory and relativity and general relativity which is what string theory is an attempt to do but we don't know whether that's the right theory so we with it this is the edge of knowledge so we don't know we don't know what we don't know how to describe like probably we have a theory that's capable of describing we can describe the edge so this thing about an event horizon and all that stuff that works that that's not a problem in Einstein's theory so the idea that if you have a sufficiently dense object then that there's a region around it out of which light can't escape because space and time are too curved for light to get out that's that's fine the theory describes that properly but when you go when you start asking questions about what happens at the center of a black hole the singularity the very idea which called the singularity tells you they're infinities in the theory the theory is doing things infinitely dense it's infinitely small it well no it won't be that we don't have infinities in general in nature other than perhaps the size of the universe you say it's so so I'm so there's something going on there but we don't have the physical theory we don't have the tools just to describe it it's an active area of research so I don't know he's a good answer in science right and so speculations fun but but ultimately you know we're talking about we're talking about a regime of nature which which which our current theories are not capable of describing with any authority and that's that's the inside of a black hole we were talking about this before the podcast the difference between the way you present your shows and the BBC and the way you're sort of forced to present your shows on like the Science Channel and this was one of the very issues a little bit I'm not strong with unknowns dealing with what when you're describing things like black holes or like the event horizon of a black hole that there are points in time where you have to say we don't know yet yeah that we were talking earlier and I said because at the moment we're a cyber series in the UK called human universe which has been on in the UK five episodes one hour long so we also make them with Science Channel and besides channels one hour is 43 minutes because they have adverts right commercials so fine that's the so we've got to take 17 minutes out but also we have some interaction about well how do we new ones things for the you know that because you'll do things for a British market there will be different in America and one of my favorites recently was that so one of the programs is about this multiverse that we just talked about earlier the fact there may be an infinite number of universes the universe may been around forever there may be no beginning to the universe all speculative right there may be so what does that mean it means that our existence is inevitable we have to exist in an infinite universe and we are because we have to be so there's no purpose to our existence there's no Universal meaning to our existence we are because we have to be and in the in the British version I say so to the camera how does that make you feel and the wonderful thing is nobody knows this is new physics it's right at the edge it's speculative but we're beginning to address it with the data and the theories so we need theologians and philosophers and artists and novelists we need to discuss these things what does it mean for us if we're our existence is inevitable and we're not special but yet we may still be valuable what does it mean I don't know so the last thing I say in the British version is so what do you think say to the audience and I think it's beautiful and it's it's filmed over Tokyo of a Tokyo skyline ex-beatle but I did get a note from the Science Channel saying well the thing is that this is not the style on the so we tend to try and leave the viewer with some concrete thing so so can you tell them what it means so what the meaning of life the meaning the great existential question of what does it mean to exist you want me to answer that yes that'd be better fit for our audience it's like well you know what can you tell me what to say perhaps I'd love it if look if Science Channel right if you know the meaning of life then which tell me and I'll gladly say it I'm afraid I don't know right so it's kind of interesting that there's that difference in style but I loved it that they said can we just we really do want you to broadcast the meaning of life on Discovery not because I can see it'd be great cell you know on discovery tonight after sharks you know whatever they put on do the meaning of life with Professor Brian Cox Brian Cox will tell you what it means to exist for your existence to be inevitable in a possibly infinite cosmos find out at nine I either say it would be good it would be completely subjective what well it like means to you doesn't you know me this is what we did it I do do in the series I did is what it's about it said it's a love letter to the human race human universe it's a you see that certainly if you buy the the one-hour versions I don't know how it's going to pan out in 43 if you get the one out which you can buy from good retailers on the internet you need a it's not an iTunes at the moment but you need it you need a 1080i blu-ray player I will say do you do a fantasy in that not all us DVD players play 1080i content it plates an ATP content well I'm just got interlaced in one of them's called progressive scan there's virtually no difference except that in Europe we tend to you so some of your blu-ray players in America will play it and some of them won't it turns out I just found out Oh play it at all under blu-ray you can buy it but and and I encourage you to because it's wonderful but but but so there's something so but it'll be unsightly online anyway in a few months but it'll have cut down a bit but the central message is this the we talked about earlier there it leads you I think to value the human race so there's not we filmed in Ethiopia which I love I always love filming in Ethiopia because we're in the Rift Valley filming this story about the the emergence of humans from the Rift Valley and then we filmed in some I call the Danakil depression which is one of the other than death valley advised with death valley often for those whose place on earth but it's far more Behrend and death valley itself in northern ethiopia on the Eritrean border there are volcanoes and it's bleak and but there's a tribe of people called the afar that lived there and they're fascinating I stayed within a few years ago and they don't have a concept for example of possessions because they don't have anything they just live on these volcanoes in this wasteland so they have you put something down like a something then they will legitimately pick it up and they'll end of say wait it's kind of I'm gonna use it for a while so in your film crew you kind of there's no cultural idea they're not stealing they're not taking so they don't have that idea because they don't have anything so that if you leave a camera they might get your camera and we had some guards with us from the afar it's a bit dangerous there and the add an ak-47 this guy and he said there was a k47 and then we woke up one day and I met we had a mountaineer with us and he got one of his mountaineering ropes attached to his ak-47 and he sat there now with this guy's rope so the guy said to me shall I ask for it back like no number one it's attached to an ak-47 right which gives him the advantage for humanely we get into an argument and number two it's fascinating they have no idea of them possession but the reason I stayed saying that was because we were filming without a meaning in life and we said to this man he was called a Denali a guy if our tribe small man three four-foot tall right old and we said we're talking to him about this through a translator and he said to us on camera he said he said your your your eyes have your age but your ears have your father's age your ears hear the past and your eyes see the present and this is the way you should live and I just thought amazing beautiful thing that came out of this man and so we put that in the series just in subtitled it and left it there because so it's full of little they just people celebrating those people it's something you'd never see you don't think there are people who live on volcanoes in northern Ethiopia that said wonderful things about your ears having your father's age you know your eye in your the past being used through your ears to manipulate and inform the way you behave in the present beautiful deep thoughts so we tried to fill the series with those things as well so it's a mixture of cosmology and the celebration of the wonder of human existence the diversity of human thought so there's beautiful stuff in there a love letter to the human race yeah and why not because we deserve it well we're so adaptable the idea that people can live like that with no possessions at the same time what people live in a world that the one one of our biggest issues is that people live to accumulate possessions and the idea of materialism is it's it's like very much like you were talking about the 17 year old boy that only pays attention to video games that becoming obsessed with anything whether it's becoming obsessed with objects becoming obsessed with ideas yeah human beings we we we are so flexible we're so flexible and how we can exist as a culture or as a community our ideas are so rigid that people have to be this way and you know you can't run around on the internet saying that there's no meaning to life when Jesus's name is being broadcast right now on Christian ministries all throughout the world they understand what the meaning of life is all about Brian Cox you are the one who is ignorant to the ways of the Lord and I do think that what I found is that travel where life because I filmed in I just fill it in am actually frame for the monkey cage free monkey cage yeah because because we're doing the shows and they're live you have to have a different kind of US visa right so and the visa you have to put where where you've beaten in the last five years how many countries have you visited with in the last five years and it's kind of it's 38 I had been to to film in these things 38 countries well I thought well I didn't know that that's a lot you know and what's interesting it really honestly is that when you go to do PR India or Japan out into the wilds in these places people tend to be relatively well everyone I've met as first of all been interested in stuff so through the translates so with the afar tribe we talk about the stars and I say I saw about stars and they're interested so they they're never been to school they have their own education they're up there learning about how to live in a volcanic wasteland but yet they're interested and the things they're interested in a common I find and I've met a genuine mmm anyone that I found uncomfortable oh it's uncomfortable with I haven't met any of the the maniacs that we consider we think of as populating the world you know we think well it's okay here you know in North America or in Europe or something we're okay but there's all these wild people out there you know some I know I just haven't seen any evidence of that and so that's part of human universe it's just trying to put these impressions yeah they believe different stuff so you might think you know like you said there's the people they say well Jesus is the way but then you'll go to India and you'll find that there are people Hindus who strange beliefs towards you know the Ganesh the blue elephant garden thief you know the part of their fabric of understanding the universe and I find it wonderful actually they it tells you something that you there are some things that are cultural and some things that are not religions cultural you go different places you have different religions that's not to say although I don't have any interest I don't have any interest in religion I always said people ask me quite a lot you know do you believe in God this I know no but I don't really even think about it until I get asked I would have never dastan bawled across that concept to myself I yeah I get asked a lot now because I do science on television I know I said the same thing which is I don't really I'm not really interested I don't think about it so does that upset anybody well kind of because I don't wanna be dismissed I'm not trying B's Missy I'm just talking about your own personal interests does that does that upset no I mean I'm what I'm saying is I'm just reaffirming what you're saying you're just talking about your own personal interests yeah like why why does your personal lack of an interest in something upset people yeah it seems - right well it can do because I think it's a central part of the framework they used to explain the world and meaning and all these questions that we're discussing which are difficult questions and I think don't have answers right I don't have complicated question what does it mean to be alive as we said it obviously means something personally but my turn these are complicated questions so it's but I think what's interesting is you go around the world and you see that these questions are common and people think about them in wherever they are whatever that level of education they have some framework for understanding that but they're also the commonalities are large that the fact the curiosity about the stars is something that you see everywhere you see you know curiosity about the the origins of the universe and there are stories which are different all over the world all in my view in in the human universe view that equally valid right that they're all worth I don't rely on them I think they're interesting they're interesting responses to nature I think so these people that live around this volcano how do they survive what are they eating like they have goats that they manage to feed on the limited tiny amounts of limited vegetation that's there the very little water so they're very careful with the water but they they've developed this this way of living the very remarkable tough really tough bunch of people how many people live up there I don't know actually how big the earth on his but it's one of the Ethiopian and it goes into Eritrea as well so it's in this this area top of the Rift Valley it's called the triple fr junction which is a tectonic plate tectonics it's where all the volcanism at the top of the rift is so it's the generator of the Rift Valley if you like which is beautiful actually is an idea because this is the cradle of humanity so you've got this is I find it a magical place actually Ethiopia for that reason and it's it I recommend it actually had a December there's a beautiful city it's a high-altitude city and so Ethiopia tend to think of especially Vera kind of my generation you think of Live Aid and the big famine in Ethiopia think of this dusty place and it is in some areas but actually the capital is a very green country is high altitude quite a pleasant city as because some African cities when they're very hot and there can be very unusual for people like those from places are not dusty and hot and but Addis is not like that actually and I would and I find there's an idea when I go there I like the there's an idea that because you kind of almost know that we came from there some oh you come and with this knowledge that this is that we were all related to someone who lived here in in and around Addis Ababa in the Rift two hundred thousand years ago we're all related to someone who live there and we we wandered out from there I find that a powerful thought actually any any dismisses you know the great deal of talk of differences amongst us in but but actually if you go to Ethiopia you you realize very soon that we're it's not far back because you said you trace your generated parents father grandfather back back back you don't go far back before you get to an Ethiopian which is quite wonderful I think so it's so perspective enhancing to to see people in this day and age I was watching a documentary on people that live in the Amazon that are barely contacted by the Western world they sort of like they may have like American underwear or something that someone gives them but other than that like you know these people have been living essentially very similar to the way they've been living thousands of years ago and they're getting by they're fine and it just makes you realize like how how this world that we live in right now that we think everybody has to have an email address everybody has to at least have some form of public transportation no they don't you don't you don't have to have anything these people all walk around they walk around in the jungle and they live and they've been living and they know what to eat they know what not to eat and they know what to avoid and they they have babies and their culture continues and they don't even write things down and they've been living like that for a long time and they're people just like you and just like me yeah but the same you know I find the same level of curiosity and interest it means it's kind of sometime more so well yeah exactly though yes we exactly so it's very interested in that that perspective the people that you contacted in Ethiopia how many are in their group the ones that you were in contact with they were maybe a big guest in a hundred or so in this kind of do they have a written history English no no oral history oh yeah so these are stories passed down from generations so they're great storytellers Wow the results in these isolated tribes I mean obviously ethiop is a fascinating country because it's one of the few countries in Africa that in is it an ancient country I mean they're there they're in biblical times you know they've got these myths about when you got to Addis they say we've got the the Ark of the Covenant all that's wrong and Beedrill in Addis then you say can I see it and they go no but it's there but it were like the mythology the mythology is that the Queen of Sheba was up there and stole it I think and came back and brought it back so yeah awesome of King Solomon every Solomon wouldn't so so yes it so you've got this it's all intertwined it's so that the fact that they're there written history that the central Ethiopian written history is is it's in the biblical in its in its span it's a bit ancient Egypt they were part of that thing that Egypt and and and an Ethiopia and then into Jerusalem in those areas Palestine and then out to do that that that that thousand year old two thousand year old history is part of that country very centrally part of it whereas it usually in Africa you know you get countries they've been divided off they came after the Second World War and they post Imperial things but he Theo P is a that's a real a more grounded place in history so it's a fascinating place what is the area that's supposed to contain the Ark of the Covenant a Cathedral allegedly I wasn't allowed to see it so I'm very exists so many people are supposed to be looking at it I mean nobody is it like Al Capone's vault but like it took Geraldo Rivera to break down the wall before we realize there was nothing in it I mean is there like a room that no one goes into I think other than the priests the cathedral and and obviously the queen of sheba stole it in the first place oh so it's not there anymore it is just a leap from Jerusalem oh and brought it to you yes right and took it down to Ethiopia man if it is something some technological object from a forgotten time do you remember there was there was some work that was done on ancient batteries where they've they believe that some some of the artifacts they found like Egyptian pyramids perhaps might have function in a very similar way to a modern battery I saw that yeah I mean it's it's possible I suppose and right we again we talk about time scales it's three and a half thousand four thousand my thousand years the other the earliest pyramids I think right so M yeah we don't know we know quite a lot about the the Egyptians again I think you talk like human universally my monkey cage Annabelle talked about given universe as well because I we found my wife actually started learning Egyptians were just interested in hieroglyphics she just got interested so here's some classes and that there the literature from ancient Egypt is fascinating you're talking about three you have 2000 BC these things that have been written down and the earliest I looked in I wanted in the book of human universe which you can get in the US I should say I went to look I want the earliest literature what is it and it's basically the one of the earliest things I could find was basically Monty Python's parrot sketch right because it's a complaint and he's like I wish to register a complaint as a piece of papyrus and it's a complaint about I think was the the the the coffin it was a claim is a coffin manufacturer who'd supplied this coffin there was the wrong size and it was kind of a bit of a ripoff and this person complaining about this I want to send it back this is terrible I want my money back and they so you can have two coffins instead and I don't want a voucher I want my money and it's so you see this what's wonderful is it's a modern voice that echoes down the ages from ancient Egypt that most of them are either ABS men things about my garden was you mix a bit of my garden you move the fence in the night or something like that or complaining about some piece of commerce like this is I've been ripped off by you this shopkeeper and it's terrible and it's wonderful but then there are also poems fantastic poems as there's one but about it so it's a it's a woman talking to her husband and under the awareness the husband's talking to a woman and so you go through in the Indies saying why did you leave me why didn't you love me all this it's quite touching and meaning and then you realize towards the end that this this this woman had died she's dead but he's still talking to it like that because the Egyptians thought that you know she moved on conscious conscious decision to go into the afterlife and so there's this kind of bitterness being expressed in this removing piece of poetry and then you realize that it's 4,000 years old us you know it's wonderful actually so you felt you haven't changed at the point you find from this old literature well the one of the oldest pieces of human language was the cuneiform right from Sumer yeah I read this one thing that was there was a passage they were talking about that was about divorce yeah it was about marriage and divorce it was something along like I forget but it was like a sort of a very short poem about divorce about marriage and you know for your relief or for your pleasure divorce was very bizarre like the concept of two people uniting by ritual existed six whatever five six thousand years ago and they wrote about it you see in these little scratches you know the cuneiform which looks like ancient nails you know with a flat top and a line that points down and in a certain pattern they've been able to figure out that it means some form some language that you can kind of attempt to translate to our modern languages in a weird clunky you know if you read like Russia like the Russian translations from Russian to English it's so bizarre because their language is so alien to us it's so different yeah that the way they use pronouns and the subtext and all the different aspects that we sort of take for granted about language don't translate correctly yeah yeah so familiar mm-hmm the Library of Alexandria man doubt the the burning of the Library of Alexandria if they'd never taken place and we could somehow another go back and read all the shit that they knew about construction methods and how they built those things and what was the purpose behind them and what was the the the significance of the astronaut astrological alignment like what what were they doing why would they and what they were doing was so insane in comparison to the the greater some of humanity like if you look at humans in 2500 BC and then you look at Egypt you like Jesus Christ what the fuck happened here how did you guys figure this shit out that no one else anywhere near it was anywhere close to this level of sophistication you know construction there's something you can take from this because if you look at ancient Egypt of course if you go to some of the the temples down there on the Nile and look saw in particular it's just astonishing achievement any you say you look at Greece you look at the Greek literature and then you look at the library is Andrea which the knowledge was lost because the barbarians came and burnt the thing down and you realize that civilizations rise and fall and knowledge can be lost and the the the the the Romans I suspect thought they were eternal there's a civilization they would continue to progress the Greeks before them thought that the Egyptians thought that they didn't we think that now and it's interesting to reflect I think on the fact that you don't have to make progress the progress is in your own hands so you can choose to make progress they didn't choose to make progress for various reasons they stopped making progress and they vanished and a knowledge vanish with them but of its own and I think it's a lesson for us we could do that you know we just maybe we've got into this position now with our technology where we'll just you just won't go I know but only when you take for granted we should I think go that's right back to start the conversation about how do we how do we say to people you know this is a remarkable thing that we've done but it's don't take the grants it's not just gonna tick along while you guys sit there and watch sports all the time right that's not the way that you make progress somebody's got to do something then we've all got to support the people even if you don't want to do it then support the people that want to do it so you look at the you know I was I was filming with them on Friday for a thing I'm doing in Britain with a rusty Schweickart who's a Apollo 9 so he test flew the lunar module on Apollo 9 in 1968 first test flight of it in Earth orbit before they went to the moon in July of that year and and so he we landed on the moon actually in India we were in a simulator is terrific and he showed me how to do it and it's fantastic but you look at NASA you know the investment in NASA at that time it was never more than 4% of federal expenditure and actually was often less than that so it was a particularly expensive on average maybe about three percent of federal expenditure but it laid the foundation I could argue for American technological dominance in the last quarter of the 20th century because for example that the the average age of the engineers in the NASA mission control when Apollo 11 landed on the moon was below 30 below 30 years old those engineers so what happened to them after the Apollo program they went out to work for Boeing and you know Microsoft Bell Wow Bell Labs or Lockheed Martin over here it is all these people so that's and you get this explosion in in 10 logical achievement in economic growth America is a terrific place to be because in many ways because of the growth that happened in those 30 or 40 years since Apollo and but that was because of a conscious investment led by you know Kennedy's great speech and also inspired by the Cold War etc there's many reasons why I did it but ultimately that investment paid vast dividend you look at NASA today and the investment is way down so the ambition that America had to go to the moon because it's there and to beat the Russians yet but to do it and then that ambition seems to be missing to me and then I looked I look to this country actually because I think it is the country no other country could have done that no other country could have gone moon will go I think before this decade is out you know we'll go in they haven't flown anyone in space when Kennedy made that speech you haven't flown any one interface and you say within 10 years I'm gonna walk on the moon that's an American thing to do I think it's this is part of what was great about this country and I regret the fact that that doesn't seem to be there at the moment and going back to why I started saying that the the idea that progress is is come progresses comes to the bold right I would say so it's the idea that it will just come they will just make progress and it is not necessarily right in fact history tells us it's wrong so you've got to have I believe bold visions and visionary leaders and leaders that just say well this is not a great deflection of resources it was as I say it was always less than 3/4 percent of federal expenditure but it's a great deflection of national will and it's a great generator of FSC of engineers and scientists who were inspired by those things and trained in that process that go into the economy make the economy better there's a study that suggested it was a 14 to 1 return on every dollar invested in Apollo by 1980 and people can argue about the M the it was a 10 to 1 was it 14 to 1 was it 20 to 1 is the return to the private sector a return to the GDP into in just into wealth and handed so each one made Tang hey each one of those dollars generates right at least 10 and maybe 20 in a decade and it's obvious how it did it because look at those young engineers and look at the technologies that we developed for Apollo someone said to me at NASA Ames up in San Francisco virtually every technology in commercial aviation today got invented there in NASA Ames actually most of it so you can point to one place and go that that's where everything I take the ground even again an aircraft came from that almost directly do you think it's because of the the ending of the Cold War or the lack of competition with Russia there's we were on top so we just got soft there's no need to keep pushing and pressing there wasn't an adversary there wasn't this technological adversary that's out there that gives people the motivation to continue to invest four percent of the gross domestic product or whatever you know whatever the the yeah I don't know it seems I have to never look at Britain so I talk about my country which did the big thing around the world and then decline the world anymore handed it over to you guys you guys had a little island ooh you've ran it out of an island great dope yeah we have a big-ass continent yeah just about a Rhode Island well not bad but it seems to me that what we lack is these things are not expensive in fact they're vital that they generate money so it seems to me it's leadership it's vyas visionary leadership by inspiration yeah and it doesn't take it well it doesn't take much clearer it took a Kennedy I think I mean that speech is a remarkable speech and rallies a nation beyond something but it's not a particularly large diversion of resources that's the point and certainly given the what you get back it seems to me the investment in R&D in science and technology and education these are the things that form the foundation of our future absolutely and everybody agrees with that and I get very involved in politics in Britain but not party politics but this lobbying for this spend money on the young spend money on education system spend money on inspiration make sure that there's a generation of these great engineers and scientists that America is currently well leading in absolutely and make sure that they're still there make sure and how do you get them how do you inspire them I don't want kids to want and be singers actually particularly on x-factor I don't want them to be famed when there's a survey done recently I think where they said to the load school kids what you want to be when you grow up and and a lot of them said famous famous what do you mean famous you want to walk on the moon don't you you want to do you want to invent the world's fastest computer don't you do you want what do you mean famous you've got to be famous for something not famous because you want a talent show we go back to the pork add a sneeze I've never seen the Kardashians probably way I don't know who the hell they are and thank God I don't because I don't know we don't I don't think we have them in Britain they don't think maybe we do how do they get over that we don't but I don't a pic on that lot I mean they're doing what they do right Brad point is you don't want to be one of those I mean without being disrespect and saw people and their kind of make them make their way you know and do well criminals do not evil people what do you want to aspire to be as a kid what do you want to aspire to be and it's true that in the 60s they wanted to be Neil Armstrong or one of the engineers in Mission Control and that's a government government has I know it's kind of unfashionable in some circles say that but government sets that sets the direction in the it has to in the is you know companies can do it as well so you have the big companies like Apple and Google a week early so people do aspire to work for those companies but I think the grand direction of civilization is set by set by governments and visionaries and and and it's not expensive but it's terrifically expensive not to do it well governments the the idea of government has really been hijacked in this country and I know to come about money I don't know you know it depends what you mean by government and big government small got special interest groups just too much money involved complex being there's legal like absolutely legal corruption in this country like where giant corporations are allowed to invest enormous sums of money into candidates that will once they get into office you do the bidding of these corporations manipulate laws move things around make things easier for these corporations to manipulate our society that's a reality and that's very unfortunate but I think that's a reality that's also being a roading or is eroding rather by technology I think people understanding the mechanisms involved in government is making them want to change those mechanisms people pushing for ideas like being able to vote online this is like people are really frustrated by this like how come I can Bank online how come you can deal with the entire world's economy through computers in the internet but you can't vote how come is it because you don't want it to be that easy for people to give their opinion and people to vote because the world of the Internet and the world of actual voting there's a big gap between them there's a big gap that would instantly shift right over if you were allowed to vote online and there's people there's oh there's problems with that all corruption oh this oh you're the one who's always worried about hacking well guess what that's gonna be the case no matter what you do there's gonna there's all sorts of problems with voting the conventional way I mean America we've had Jayant scandals and Diebold voting machines that contained third party access the ability to manipulate the data it's all been proven there was a documentary called hacking democracy that showed how ludicrous it is to think that our system that's in place right now is infallible not not only that it's massively flawed the technology that exists because the internet because of the ability to exchange information instantaneously with each other is unprecedented and I think that is going to shift the idea of government that's gonna shit it's gonna scatter all these crazy people that are running things right now that's not gonna be viable anymore just like Kings aren't viable anymore you can't be Henry the eighth in 2015 unless you're the guy in North Korea he's like the last one but most most governments can't be run the way they were run thousands of years ago there's too much access to information we know you're not a god we know you're just a person you know we we have this ability to exchange these ideas so quickly that the word gets out too fast listen to Tim berners-lee when he talks about there world wide web and invented by the way certain of course that the web bit of it yes and then then he talks in those terms actually you feel it's quite idealistic Tim berners-lee I am sure Freedom of Information free exchange of information and I think you're right I mean it goes right back to the beginning of the conversation doesn't is internet a good thing or a bad thing I the web I'm saying a good thing or a bad thing and you must be right in this sense that it as long as people you know you need a certain we're having this conversation at quite a high level of do you know we're talking about great movements and great shifts in civilization and and so I suppose you need a you need the perspective first don't you you need the eat you need your appetite stimulated for knowledge and information and and and to use not to use the internet or the web to ghettoize yourself you need to have some instinct that I'm not going to just go find the little sliver of information that interest me and perhaps information that's nonsense Kahn is also that you know how you you can go and be a conspiracy theorist and find plenty of information to support your conspiracy okay that toolkit Sagan I write a lot about this in the Demonoid world again by giving people toolkits bullshit detectors I think he called it you know the education science the scientific method that that's a bullshit detector kit basically so if you can get that in you can get that in maybe this is the priority really in schools to say well get I want you to know how to think how to look information assess where the information came from understand if it's likely to be tainted or biased or good or bad or how do I assess this vast quantity information out there how do I not get arise myself how do I not decide that I'm only gonna read I'm only going to exist on forums that say that we didn't land on the moon and there's a big conspiracy and everyone covered it up how can I broaden my reach to say is that really true shall I check some other stuff like the telescopes that way you can look at the spacecraft on the moon you know that kind of bits of evidence you know said I think that's very important is it ironic that in this day and age we accumulate more data I think there was some statistic about in every two days we accumulate more data more like numbers a lot of its are probably Instagram pictures and Twitter and shit that's useless but that more hard data gets accumulated or processed or produced by humans today than the entire time of human history up to that point which is fucking staggering yeah but it also most of it takes place on computers most of it is ones and zeros most of it takes place in a language that you and I can't even read if it was written on a piece of paper know what I'm and it's a big suggestion and how do you say there's and how would we use it there's there's an example the program I do in the UK called stargazing life wish a live astronomy show on the BBC a lots of people watch it it's kind of people like it one of the things that we do as citizen science and projects so for example last year that we use the European Space Agency's database of photographs of the surface of Mars nobody's ever looked at them right there's too many of them so we've got too many pictures of Mars no one no human eyes have ever looks at these pictures so we ran a project where we wanted to answer a question about some features that were seen moving across the surface of Mars the weather features that we thought may be seasonal so maybe in the Martian winter they move down to the equation and move back up again of this summer didn't know then we proved that they were indeed seasonal by getting millions of people who watched the program to go look at the pictures for the first time so you can go online now and look at pictures of Mars let's say that nobody's ever seen because there's too much data even if another planet to imagine the amount of dates are generated on this planet there no one's ever done that no one's ever looked at this date there'll be data about what increases the likelihood of certain cancers for example there'll be the lifestyle that does that and doesn't invent it that'll all be there in the data but no one's quite got their head around there to go and mind that data and and try to use it just using the data is extremely difficult and challenging but you're right is there no one ever looks at it well not only that the idea of somehow or another preserving this if there was some event supervolcano eruption like they're constantly worried about Yellowstone and one in Indonesia I believe it is that they believe is connected to a mass extinction event that killed off a giant swath of the population oh that nasty that there's volcanoes terrible and if one of those hits and somehow another the power goes out all around the world and the only people that survive for those folks that live by the volcano fuck man we're starting up from scratch like I mean relatively in terms of the universe that's nothing so you big baby you got to wait another ten thousand years for civilization to reimburse and someone to reinvent the internet you know and the Ark of the Covenant and still locked up in Ethiopia because they already did this and they already figured out how to make a little nuclear bomb or something like that who knows what the fuck it is but the the the for our immediate life it's so critical to not just acquire this information but to nurture it and to spread it I mean that's your whole idea right your you're just talking about expanding science and education and getting people excited and involved but that all that doesn't mean jack shit if the fucking earth spits out a giant ball of lava that ain't engulfs half of North America kills 90% of the planet like we're starting from scratch and there's not none of this is gonna be any good no computers no hard drives no flash drives no fucking database it's all bullshit the cloud go fuck your cloud it's not really in the cloud I Got News for You it's down on earth oh it's in the cloud no it's not there's no cloud okay it doesn't exist you go up and look around for your fucking data it's not there it's in someone's goddamn building okay it's in a fucking building stop saying it's in the cloud because that's not that's a dirty stinky lie that's reality unless you're launching that fucking shit up with taking all the hard drives of all the world and launching it into space and you know on a ten thousand year loop so it comes back around and lands you know we do it 99.9 percent of the speed of light so that the data it comes back could you imagine if that's what happens like one day you know it just they do they pick a strategic location that they believe will be a large population of life and it real and ten thousand years later and we go oh fuck look at look at all this shit they know and is it's all in dass or whatever something something that we could read like fairly easily they run it through some computers and they realize like wow fuckin people been around Jeremy my first my first operating system on a PC was dust five I was the first computer that I ever had had windows 95 and Windows 95 was the big deal my friend Chris made computers with Windows 3.2 he was yeah three receded she ran on dust so I yeah I know windows wow that's crazy and if you think about how recent someone sends you a picture it's way bigger than that yeah every fucking pictures a hundred bug right yeah and if you think that that was 1995 it was only twenty years ago yeah and in 20 years I took a blink of an eye you know yeah a blink of an eye I think I should go back to dos you think yeah why cuz you have to know how to computer worked you had said you had to these little autoexec.bat files that just isn't that like more work than you need is indeed it's a big deal in the sense because we we have a problem with getting kids to write code because they all what's a lot of work to write code right yeah I have friends that make video games and one of the most shocking things was the the sheer amount of hours that go into coding video games yeah you know the the folks at ed software they let me in behind the scenes and epic games to cliffy be our friend cliffy B who's been on the podcast before I would watch those guys work they would do 16-hour days and they would just be coding and drinking fucking caffeine and they're just staring in front of these monitors and just running over thousands of lines of code and you like oh that's how you make a fucking video game million dollar things well they're they're bigger than movies the average huge game like a Grand Theft Auto when those games get released they're there not of money that they generate is rival to like avatar some huge spectacular hit like not an average movie but a just gigantic monumental epic huge successful movie that's like an average video game you know Grand Theft Auto and Madden when those Madden games come out the fucking world changes like I mean people generate there's so much income that gets poured into those video games and you realize that it's a lot of just people just coding just standing in front of computers and just pounding on the keyboards it's madness you know maybe that's the way that Western civilization folds the coders people stop fucking them that's what's gonna happen they're gonna stop breeding that's gonna happen fucking end all their accumulated knowledge we were talking about before like the coders making children that are better coders nope just ends yeah one day maybe you can write full trend yeah one day we wake up and we realize that no one's making video games anymore so we go to these places where they made video games like hello everybody's dead cobwebs everywhere they just died and no one fucked up well imagine if computer coders cease to exist and all of us were forced to back engineer computer code if today like for somehow another I don't know how many people in this world have a deep understanding of computer operating systems or computer code but I couldn't imagine it's more than 1% and if we lost 1% of the population just disappeared from the earth and then the rest of us dopes we're left to observe our cellphone crashing or our fucking TriCaster over here that shit the bet on us mid broadcast I mean well just that's a critical part of our society of civilization itself and it totally overlooked so you coders out there what god bless keep breathing yeah keep breathing and maybe breathing breathing and breathing it's that tie them with yeah praise Odin for the coders it's amazing it's amazing if you really think of how much our if in our civilization revolves around electronics and around computer code we should a monkey cage and they sensually yes yeah I mean it's stunning if you really stop and think about it every single thing that used to be mechanical and and an analog is now computer like cars that's the main for car enthusiasts it's one of the main complaints is that you don't feel what a car is doing anymore one of the thrills of driving an older car like especially an old sports car they're not as fast they don't handle as well but you feel everything you feel the road because it's a mechanical steering there's no assisting like if you go to like a 1973 Porsche 911 there's no there's no hydraulic assist in the steering it's all mechanical you feel every pebble you literally feel the mechanism turning the tire you feel the tires losing their grip it's all transmitted through your seat and through your hands and people live for this it's like exciting stuff but if you drive a modern Porsche it's like there's a million operations that are going on behind the scenes and every second to avoid collisions and slow your tires down and braking on the right side because you're turning left all this shit that's going on that you don't even know you don't even feel it there's a magnetic ride control system that's adjusting there's like there's certain cars now like I believe mercedes-benz has a camera that looks at the road in front of you engages whether or not the suspension should be compliant or rigid it adjusts and you can go I think up to like 30 miles an hour you just take your hand off the wheel and put it in cruise control if fuckin turns based on the lines on the road do you think that so that the first sentient being is going to be a 911 I hope it's an American car I hope it's Corvette or maybe perhaps a truck maybe an f-150 takes out godless heathens just drives around eats assholes I wonder you know III think for sure if we can live you and I'm 47 how old are you 47 so we could live another if we get really lucky we live another 50 years based on modern interpretation of science and medicine we six by the way how thought it's happening much just because I'll get letters least you added the right way you know if you like I'm 40 ish I have a friend won't tell me his age Ian Edwards he won't tell me how old he is motherfucker I think he's my age but he won't say it I should said 47 because I'm Wikipedia will change yeah Wikipedia is long run about a lot of shit it still thinks Brian Collins my brother it still thinks I'm 5 feet tall if you if you consider this idea that we if we everything goes correct and we live to be 95 years old let's go let's go there for sure there's gonna be something you know there's gonna be some they've already got these little Japanese talking head ones that look eerie very strange sort of artificial faces that talk to you there's gonna come a point in time well as the exponential increase in technology whether it's 20 30 years where they're gonna make fake fucking people man let me let me let me plug something else nothing to do with me this friend of mine Alex Garland who just made a film called ex machina and which is a great science fiction film we shouldn't come into the States it's just been released in the UK excellent can I get it online somewhere well legally not legally illegally can I get it that's a problem you fucker get legal so I can get it yeah you know I you'll see the trailer on you can get the trailer on YouTube but it's being released in the States came and went but it's great and it's about it's about an AI a female AI and it's a it's about a guy kind of like one of these Elon Musk type the guy is he lives out in the woods and he's built one of these things and he gets one of his employees to come and do a Turing test on it wishes to see heavy thinks - this thing is sent to this AI but she's beautiful and it kind of goes off from there but Alex wrote the beach and you wrote 28 days later really brilliant science fiction film but it but it's flow some of these issues that we've been talking about about what it is to be human are the AI is better than I was they better than I was morally physically strained what is it that what why is this girl so beautiful why why did he make this beautiful woman it's a great film so I recommend that everyone is listening that sounds amazing when is it gonna be released here it must be very soon because it's been it's just been on the UK it did very well they've that is he gonna be released in theatres or a digital release April 10 in America so you the right wow that sounds that's a great concept I mean that I I've said for a long time that I believe the first artificial intelligence be sex slaves people are gonna make artificial sex people people you can have sex with like you know is it cheating to use a device is it cheating to masturbate some people say yes I was reading a forum article which people arguing this guy's arguing his wife she's saying if he doesn't stop masturbating she's gonna divorce him specifically to porn you know with his hand just beat his hand up but then you know it goes from masturbation to masturbation using technology meaning the internet to watch pornography to masturbation using a device like they have these you know what oculus rift is I'm sure that's good it's amazing to go that well the new version of it my friend Duncan called me up I was at the improv and when you know when he called me I was about to go onstage was like five minutes for I go onstage and he had just got back from some 3d virtual reality conference and he's just screaming at my phone it's a fucking game changer man this is a crazy shit I said that it was the the HD quality was stunning I did I go Sony let me have a look at the one that there's an oculus or something else they're using for the ps4 which is not gonna it's not out yet would have been out in twelve months I think something like that it's amazing they showed me this demo and it's it's HD real it's like very very good I didn't know he's gonna be a game changer well they decided to do first-person pornography with these things that's supposed to just be like there was a real issue that people gonna have with being addicted to this stuff because I don't believe that our minds I think one of the one of the reasons why people have such a deep like what we're talking about earlier that people get angry at dumb programming and people get angry at you know dumb songs and dumb television shows one of the reasons I think we have this instinct to get upset at it as we I think we inherently understand that we're not designed to process the media that we've created we're designed to imitate the successful behaviors of other tribal members we were designed to listen to people like you talk and be inspired but you're right here I'm looking right at you evolved right well I don't mean it in that sense I mean in the sense of this is that like how we evolved I'm sorry I don't mean design but if you if you take that into consideration what what about a screen that's 60 feet tall and Brad Pitt comes on and his bone structure is fucking perfect and if it's not they manipulate it make it perfect with 3G CGI and every time he talks musics playing and every word out of his mouth is carefully considered although it looks spontaneous it's not they've carefully considered this for weeks and weeks for maximum impact on your psyche and you're sitting there and the music's playing and he kisses Angelina Jolie and oh like we're not designed for that so our very existence the world that we live in our model of it is based like ninety percent on bullshit ten percent on real-life experiences ninety percent on movies and but I have a friend who got in a fight with a guy and the guy said to him while they're about to fight some drunken thing prepare to dine in Hell tonight we dine in Hell he yelled out a fucking quote from a stupid movie when they're about to fistfight they were fist fighting like which could potentially leave it lead to death I mean when you're involved in like actively trying to hurt another human being all fucking bets are out the window this is chaos right and the guys yelling at a movie quote tonight we dine in Hell please come in the beginning of a beautiful friendship you are my brother we're crazy I don't think the inspiration that I get from songs like there's songs I listen to you know like there's certain like like weightlifting target I swear when you lift listen those songs you can lift more weights you can workout harder like you're tired you're on the elliptical machine queen comes on like dragon attack and you fucking you like you your body reacts to it you have a physiological response to media to something that's been created it doesn't exist in nature with all of nature's Majesty with fucking waterfalls and flowers it never figured out how to make sound come out of a headset that's just incredible and just make sure your your your your fucking goosebumps raise up we've created some weird shit and in creating that weird shit we're altering our very version of the reality that we observe with our are real senses our eyes and our ears and our fingers and we're changing it and this oculus rift shit it's gonna take it to a whole new place I mean it's gonna it's gonna be as addictive as reality TV is with its stupidity it's gonna be way more addictive if you could like look at any part of those people while they're talking you know I mean you could do whatever you want you could move around in their world while they're well they're existing you don't have to have a real life you seen wall-e I haven't wall-e yeah was it good yeah it's great it's a great film but everyone just ends up every human is basically a fat useless slob that floats around can't even walk and he's just on a big space liner floating around in space useless just gone watching TV what that source bad pessimistic version of reality then what do you think what's your version of reality because we're out we're running out at three hours and we turn into a pumpkin so we're right about there like what what is he what do you think is going to happen with us are you pessimistic are you optimistic do you enjoy the way the wind direction we're moving ultimately the our scientific and engineering achievements are astonishing and going beautifully well I think it needs I don't think it needs I'm optimistic I think but I think it just needs a little I'm slightly pessimistic at the moment I think it just needs this little nudge I think just a we've got the we in countries like ours right we've got these these education systems and these universities that have broadly speaking very good they need a bit more money but they're pretty good and we've got a culture that allows us to be open-minded and we have democracies and all these things are very difficult to get so I think we have to miss the great things that we have in place in places like the US and Europe definitely really very good and so it so it just takes a recognition of that I think and that's what I always started again isn't it how do you just remind people what wonderful opportunities they have and what wonderful things there are to do and if you just turn the reality TV off for a bit and go and read a book or something Kindle book if you want doesn't have to be a real book then you know what wonderful things could we achieve so I'm kind of optimistic there I think beautiful I I think so I mean obviously there's some real issues with culture and society but I often wonder as we talked about before if those issues just inspire us to improve and change if you you can't have a yen without a yang I mean you have a bunch of shit going on that is it's like a constant ebb and flow and I always I always ponder whether or not that is almost a mechanism for progress or a mechanism for advancement and that without it you don't get that I don't know it's possible it is possible so we can be optimistic at the end of the podcast yes I think we wrapped it up nice I think we brought it home in a beautiful way and can I say just because because my promote is set over there and I know he's been setting there for three hours he would like me to remind the viewers that the infant monkey cage his tickets are available online monkey cage dot-com so you're on the yes you're on the the LA one which is the the 12th of Feb 12th of March yes at the ricardo montalban theatre how ironic that Fantasy Island the guy from Fantasy Island that's who Ricardo Montalban was that we're gonna be at the record month Obon theatre one of the dumbest fucking shows ever Fantasy Island that have a little midget boss deplane yin-yang yes I never in San Francisco that I after New York and Chicago all the dates are available at infinite monkey cage calm Thursday March 5th there in NYU at the Skirball Center in New York City yes Neil deGrasse Tyson astrophysicist John 11 that I say right John Jay in it and then March 7th at the Anthony Anthony Anthony MV etre in Chicago with Paul Serrano paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne and then of course the 12th with me and blossom the girl from blossom she's on the Big Bang and even Cohen Emmy award-winning writer a secret secret as well it might be it there might be a Python oh and you got one March 13th about UFOs alien probes and other Close Encounters oh I want to be on that one yeah go to San Francisco I'm busy that day listen you're fucking awesome man thank you very much thank you thanks for doing what you do because it's so important it's it's so exciting to me to be able to watch your shows and to be able to just sort of sponge that information from you and thanks for just keep on keeping see in three weeks and yeah I'll bring the human universe stuff for you I'll bring you our bringing some yes to whatever you go do folks get by alright we love you thank you see you soon thank you enjoyed that [Music]
