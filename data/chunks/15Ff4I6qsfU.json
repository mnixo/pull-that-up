doot-doot-doot yeah that is a guy named Ross Baines he painted that he's also painted this there's a picture in the green room of me and Daniel Cormier and there's another one he's another thing he sent me the one of Maas Vidale he did an amazing one of Jorge Mons but all when he landed this neon Ben Askren he's a great artist but that's Richard Pryor he'd be painting that for me clearly my screensaver used to be a collection of mug shots like really more saying more scratching the green room so okay so the thing is I'm not a criminal right there's fire severe criminal like these mug shots are so iconic yeah what does it mean to you to see like your heroes essentially charged with crimes and maybe one of the worst nights are a lot well it didn't start off that way this is what happened I was in Hawaii and they I'm a giant Jimi Hendrix fan that's why I named the podcast Joe Rogan experience I ripped off the Jimi Hendrix Experience and I was in Hawaii and I went to this art gallery and they had all of this rock and roll art and they had this really dope collaboration of Hendrix his mugshot was like six nine nine images nine square images of Hendrix as much oh that looks cool as fuck and so I bought it and I also bought the Rosa Parks one and I also bought the Elvis one they had three different collect just nine squares on one piece of artwork right and I thought it looked cool so I said I thought to be a good backdrop for the podcast so the old podcast studio I had those behind me and then I started picking up other ones like I got Janis Joplin in the bathroom I got Johnny Cash I got Jim James Brown I got Pryor on the wall here I got Jim Morrison I got Steven Tyler on the wall over there I just started collecting them and this there's no real rhyme or reason to it I just I got Lenny Bruce I got everybody but I just found mug shots and I just started collecting him I had like I said my screen said was that for like a year and I even had Sinatra in my room big yeah one on the wall whatnot and I'm like you know what is this shit about it occurred to me like everybody that became an I kind of became legend like you have to break the rules there's no way as I followed every rule and that's what they're famous for hey this guy never stepped out of line did everything that everyone said he was supposed to do did it all the way there within the rules and that's the fucking legend that you love no it's almost like it's you it's illegal to be exceptional you have to fucking break the law to make the to make the imprint on the society that you want to make well particularly in the time with these guys were doing their art I mean we're talking about Morrison and Hendrix this is the 70s 60s he was wild times there's a transitionary period between the 50s where everything was like mom-and-pop and diners and fucking drive-through movies and shit and then all our drive-in movies and then all of a sudden you have drugs and wild rock and roll and James Brown and and chaos and the thing you should be doing everyone didn't reason we're not talking about like harming other people whatnot but the society is like restrictions yeah that's the boundary to keep you as a normal person as a like I wish I had a better answer but if if I had to really put my finger on it I would say that those images represent these moments where society tried to contain these wild people exactly these people that were breaking the rules these people that are trying to change culture these people that were just doing their thing and it wasn't like they weren't popular I mean when I think Jim Marrs had pulled his dick out right didn't pull his dick out I mean he was insanely popular when he pulled his dick out and like eat enough you didn't say we probably would he got arrested finally pulled his dick out but when you get arrested for pull your dick out it's never the first time no he's pulled a deck out I know a lot of people who pulled the deck out it's uh yeah it's it's a weird thing like that moment where you you know where the society that's trying to contain these artists like lashes out and captures them briefly and then but they don't even realize they're just making them bigger yeah you know and they're making them more accessible Hey mug shot it turned out the one from Hendrix was a bullshit mugshot it wasn't a real mugshot you never got arrested he did get arrested but the image that I had some fucking artist took liberties and they decided well this is a cooler picture let's put his mugshot logo under that so was the actual words from Toronto we got arrested for heroin underneath his image but the image was incorrect so then I went out and got the real image so now that big and I used to have them in the squares but then I changed the squares to these big metal ones see the one I have is the upper right inside that's the wrong one that's not the real is it cool or what the real mugshot but don't do the one with the words behind it the the one right next to it Jamie didn't know next to it yet right above above right above right there that's that's the actual one see that one on the right-hand side that's the actual image of Hendricks oh I didn't know there's a Mick Jagger oh yeah well the Yonkers one is Steven Tyler I have that one on the wall that's the side shot but I didn't know Steven did you know that uh Mick Jagger got arrested Jamie ordered that shit hold on to those and start ordering I'm gonna get some new ones Oh David Bowie we got the Jazz Joplin in the bathroom fuck I didn't know David Bowie got arrested that's actual Rosie actual was a little cutie pie when he was younger earlier them the David Bowie was pretty dope that actually looks like it could be the cover of an album go back down again to that please yeah look at that Jeff Morrison looks like Chris Stapleton look how odd he looks here 1976 he's guilty whatever whatever you gotta rise before that night that's definitely the rest of her being beautiful so dude this is get into this man we had this conversation at The Comedy Store I'm like you got to come on the podcast we got to talk about this because you are a part of probably the most iconic boxing interview of our day you with Deontay Wilder when Deontay Wilder freaked out on you it became this huge huge fuckin thing to this day to this day to this day he puts it on his Instagram he puts it in hashtags till this day he he sells sweatshirts with till this day on them there's a store that's adjacent to the Barclays center it's connected to the Barclays center and it's full of shit that says to this day on it he had a grand opening there I was invited to it so this is an iconic name this is now a major part of my identity two people associate you with it though do they like automatically or did they just so cuz it's your you see the side of your face but you see him angriest before arguably the scariest heavyweight of all time I mean Mike Tyson's right up there Mike touch see off stay off ring outside the ring Deonte is a sweetheart he's a really nice guy so to see him angry outside the ring is kind of Wiggins I had him on the podcast he couldn't be a nicer guy that's true he's a really nice guy but and so to see him angry at you to this day and giving you crazy eyes that was like and when you explained it it's like yeah that's what you do in an interview you you you want someone to expand and say what do you mean by that yeah and listen man this is not like the first day we met so that has happened upon this heavyweight champion of the world screaming and decided to piss him off we've had multiple conversations sat down for hours at a time in fact in Belfast in Germany he or Island I'm sorry we sat down for an hour an hour on this so I'm gonna give you a colleague in the context of what I was sitting in the moment okay all right who's on stage tell it because some people might not be aware of exactly what happened so just try it all right so there it is right there in a couple of weeks we're gonna see it again [Applause] Deontay Wilder is facing Tyson Fury Tyson Fury is a British gipsy okay he's a boisterous very animated showman in boxing heavyweights mind you these guys are Giants first time they met this is December 18 so I travel the world covering boxing we were like I said I said the homeless guy in Ireland I've covered Tyson Fury in England I've covered him in America covers boxing literally everywhere so I'm familiar with what you also note that fighting even combat sports boxing MMA there's a regional aspect to it like everybody's culture brings something to it the Irish fighter feels like he's got a certain style he's got a certain history he's got a claim to the warrior legacy same for the British fighter of course the American fighter but both of these guys come from what's like an underclass of their society travelers gypsies in England or look down upon these people are cultural fighters and I don't mean necessarily just the oppression of being an underclass but fighting is part of their tradition almost like it is to Mexicans in Mexico it's something that they do that Bond's the Klan is maybe they believe in a history of it obviously Johnson waters from Alabama you know he's his darkest midnight he is a descendant of slaves for sure okay he's got a history coming to any fight bringing what he experiences in this country to this element of the faceoff one man one man where's one man so when types of theories on stage during the press conference and something possessed him to say you know I'm coming from a fighting people my people have been fighting for 200 years well in context he means that the culture of travelers of gypsies is one of where fighting men I'm a fighting man that's something that they say about themselves and each other so that's what he's bringing to this argument that's how he's challenging Wilder while there takes that says 200 years fight my people have been fighting for 400 years of course he's talking about the black experience in America slavery all all alike but mind you he's talking to a British fighter he's talking to a world audience it's not like he's fighting Dominic Brazil you know saying well it's to Americans probably not gonna get that much international attention the world's watching particularly communities that don't necessarily know when a black man says 400 years you know I know you know cuz we grew up in a mother you know what we're talking about the world doesn't know that I travel the world they're not just they're not steeped in black American history I've had conversations with him he loves to talk about the plight of the black man in America and how it relates to his career how he feels you know disadvantaged in certain ways and he carries the mantle in other ways he's a champion of black America in certain ways and he's a victim of white America in other ways so when I see this argument happening oh my god okay well this is definitely a moment but I'm not a pool reporter right so in this particular instance it's unusual for me to be part of the scrums whether they call it collection of reporters everybody's kind of shouting questions out just trying to evoke responses usually I'm a one-on-one guy I'll wait my turn right but on this particular day no you're the way oh yeah I didn't have a haircut I wasn't really I just got back from Dubai Land Dubai with like you know Dave Chappelle on hanging out it's after Thanksgiving I was like you know I'm gonna kind of mail this one in to be honest I'm thinking let me throw something out because I know what he's talking about and I also know that the audience around us in the world especially may not have caught that reference but he is he's a there's a high watermark right now it's Thursday and the fights Saturday so he's amped up yeah that's the other thing fight week fighters are not them so it's not the guy you were sitting across from doing the experience you know I mean that guy was having a good day this guy's been waiting to fight for at least three months if not you know ten weeks ramped up ramped right he comes off stage he answers a couple of other questions and then just to be sure because I've been doing this a long time not an idiot I know he's an and I want him to get the question clearly Deonte radio raheem i say my name so he knows who it's coming from not if he doesn't know me but because he does so radio raheem you just said your people have been fighting for 400 years okay first of all I'm in the mid to my question I don't do these things haphazardly were my questions very carefully yes but in the ears of black America later and this later in the story you'll find out that your people that part of the question became incredibly important and people were very sensitive about that because you said your pension Sowerby or people said of our people right but I'm fuckin quoting the guy okay I'm not speaking for him I'm getting what he said he said my people have been fighting for years so if he had said our people I would have said our people but right I can't take possession of your quote it's not me saying it right you saying it right your people have been five for four hundred years what did you mean by that so uh we laser focus turns to me he's already at ten like there's no ramp up at this time and he started you know shouting my face like your people too now you know what I'm talking about he says don't try to bait you know what I'm talking about when I say these things when I'm like oh yeah I do can you tell them weren't you talking to trying to get him to expand trying to get him to explain to the world what he said to me on numerous occasions in different interviews and off-camera I know exactly what he's talking about and I know that this is the moment that he finally gets to talk about it right to people who have never been listening to him before right but we heard your it was a trigger for him - hmm I'm so oblivious and I even looking back I'm like man how did you miss that I did I swear to God I didn't know what the fuck was the problem he starts seeing shouting your people and I'm like whoa what it took me him he couldn't he needed to keep saying it didn't know why he was saying that you have my people - my people - oh there's a moment I'm like oh [Laughter] [Laughter] you know our people have been fighting for 400 years to this day to this day and so what I wanted what I wanted what I thought was happening was that okay this moment now has become about him like attacking me because he thinks I'm attacking him he thinks because I do know what he's talking about he knows we've spoken about it with numerous times he thinks I'm pretending not to know like some you know air quotes Uncle Tom you know the numerous names I've been called on the internet since as though I'm trying to return like okay okay okay fine so when he's screaming at you hmm what is going through your mind when he's hitting you with is it to this day or till this day because there is a debate on that first of all let's see it let's play it play don't sit up and try to bait it's not know what I'm talking about y'all know the fuck I talk about when I say these things your people to explain it Radio Raheem I don't have to explain what's understood man you know what I mean by that you know what I say about it I didn't got to go further and if nobody if everybody don't understand that then God be with him go look up your history go look up the history you see it ain't don't everybody believe in Google don't Google that shit see what I'm talking about you know what I'm talking about man you know what I dare you to sit up there and say it's plain you know what I'm talking about man he's firing people you know we've been fighting polling and still fighting to this day to this day to this day you just sit here you don't know what I'm talking about no matter you see you have to keep playing it but just so you know there's more to this video in fact less cos it's all we know we know what he's talking about that's what I just said at the end but that clip everyone in the world has seen it's very neatly on Instagram into the new age of clips and things being taken out of context so listen this is not the first time I've had an interview that has you know gotten a major attention not the first time the fire has been pissed off at me I knew that this was going to be a big thing I knew people were going to talk about it bro I had no fucking concept of what was about to happen to my night like I'm like basically when you're a reporter like this you're like okay well that was dramatic I've got a hot one Ellen might get me a you know a few hundred thousand if not a million views maybe like this is yeah the other champ but also I'm thinking you know it's something of a success like okay we got him to Express at least it is in that moment something that we don't usually see it's fight week we talked to this guy a million times everyone's had their interviews he's been on every show and that was like the realest moment in the whole build-up so for me that in and of itself is something of a victory like you you've created a moment here where you got to see inside the champs heart you got to see like his passion when I get home though I got taken that way it's a little long that's good so as as these stories tend to go I'm woken up by chimes on my phone cheating cheating to take what's going on in the interim he's posted on Instagram just a minute of what is really like a two and a half minute interview where it looks so bad it's written like a paragraph essentially about having to like you know teach people like basically not to be our time to how you get it like straighten it out like there's a whole like civil rights diatribe and I'm the pincushion straw man I'm the guy I start to of course read the comments my wallet maybe is any possible way this is good bro everybody's like fuck that guy I'm also not like a stranger to criticism not a stranger a YouTube comes I live on YouTube it's one of the most vicious places on earth if you ever want to like just get humbled you ever feeling too big myself post a youtube video let it sit there for about an hour and then start reading the Kazoku yeah it'll bring you down but this is another element bro Rihanna was like upset like oh I don't wanna madavan Orianna like why I don't want to start our relationship this way we all now know can be incredibly vicious when he's upset at somebody over something yeah nobody yo teach that so like yeah you know in where his place like bro what are you feeling when this is going on how many knots are in your stomach panicking panicking with him shouting in my face and having no idea whether or not like this can go any kind of way but at least I understand the moment lately something control and a half of it right this is a this is a train on fire off the rails oh you don't I mean and though of course the more people respond to it celebrities and you know other fighters and alike the more emboldened he is to double down on it like hell this is a moment the fights not selling well you know what I mean they've been given him stick overseas for not being no anywhere they're saying you can walk down the street and you know Eddie her into this video or he's asking people in New York like do they know Deontay Wilder isn't he made a whole video of him saying no so at this moment also have to give context of what's happening in his career at this moment he's knocking everybody out WBC heavyweight champion he can't get the fight to unify like with Joshua bears saying he's a nobody essentially can't he's not worth the money because nobody knows who he is he's fighting arguably the toughest fight he could have possibly picked Tyson Fury is an incredibly technical fighter no one thinks of Deion's a while there's a technical technician like they're thinking this guy's gonna get out class he could lose his boats this way and not be making and it's not only made a shit ton of money for that fight so now that all this attention is on him and like I said it's it's not the subject he loves to talk about he's a hero he's like a champion of black America in this moment the only collateral damage boost the fuck out of that fight though take it sails through the roof the moments viral it's everywhere people didn't even know the fight was happening until this meme just is in their inboxes people people are to this day meme is taking over the Internet and it'll speak to your soul yeah oh my goodness this became like the flagship moment for black walk people to tell like you know the black is me to class it's Kermit with a riff difficult the fucking oxygen masks on and it says you still in your parents phone me oh my god this point is kicking my ass oh damn dude yeah so as this thing gets bigger bigger I start to realize that it's it's well out of my control and then I have to start to think about what my role really is it's not about out me it's not what I do isn't so that people can feel one way or another about me it's really again taking myself back to that initial moment of showing them something about the fighter that they haven't seen let's get a look inside this guy and get him to share something usually yeah just verbally that they didn't know or that he there wasn't he didn't come to the room expecting to share right and I support people understanding the culture from which he we come as black Americans I wanted to give him the stage to do exactly that I didn't turn out like I expected like civil rights I guess type of moment it became one of those things that people identify with black power black information being like yo this is this is what we're experiencing yeah and this is how deep it still runs at that time in 2018 did you think about it like in retrospect how could I have phrase that better I mean I'm sure you did right what could you have said because you wanted to get that out of there you wanted to get him to expand on it I think that it was exactly the right thing at the right time I couldn't have predicted in a million years it would have went that way but that's the way it was supposed to go if I had phrased it so-called better and he had given a more reasoned thoughtful answer we wouldn't be sitting here he's made less money to the fight when I saw those tickets let pay per views know that Whitnall you wouldn't he gave a shit about my side of the story the moment doesn't exist right right and that's the beauty of law you were telling me in the back of the comic storm like oh shit that's you right oh my god so the blessing and the angle on the camerawork in in some regard is some people don't know it's me the ones who do there's enough who do Tom telling you Joe every day since then it's been over a year now someone somewhere every time I've left my home and sometimes while I'm still in it has shouted in my face oh my god oh my god yeah oh my god but you know hey man it's a godsend really it's something that captured everybody's attention in a moment I've been anything else I can't imagine how it would have done that right it wouldn't have no it had to be that crazy in his eyes because he's so ramped up getting ready for that fight he's so angry he takes the glasses off I'm like I remember watched I was nervous I was nowhere near him yeah you must have been shitting your pants okay well you know him right so you probably weren't shitting your pants but you probably look very uncomfortable I absolutely was not shitting my pants I wasn't in fact in them in the exchange and quite calm Bryan just trying on the one hand I'm trying to figure out what's happening in the beginning because I didn't understand like the rage being directed at me for I'm telling it for admit I thought he's just talking white America oh my goodness once he walks off and disgust I been fight him 20 minutes later and I interview him again this time and much more call in recent fashion I let him lay out what it was about what I expect to happen the first time a lot of people have seen it not a fraction of the people have seen it yeah I do know the guy but as you know these people are warriors man and their Bloods running high and they in and he saw red like at that time then we weren't friends we weren't homies he didn't remember Belfast he didn't he thought I was coming for him so even though I know him I don't know him no I mean I don't know what's really gonna happen in the moment right I'm just doing my job like I can't be afraid to do that so whatever happens there's no way this is what's gonna be you've got a great perspective on it though you're so right that without that moment blowing up like that the fight doesn't become as big as it is the meme doesn't exist you don't become more popular right and he even did like a segment but uh before fight on Showtime where he like you know went through black healing a black history segment because of this like it actually created a moment that put him in position to be the kind of representative of that issue that he wanted to be and it gave me an opportunity to be seen even though it in a lot of quarters initially negatively I was also seen as a journalist who pulled that out like I'm the other guy I'm the guy on the other side of that camera that yes created that moment and I've been doing this long enough to where my fan base people who know my work who understand me they know that I think they know I'm not an idiot and then I I like to think they know I'm not a sellout but they don't really know me because I don't ever make it about me I don't like this interview were having is a is a unicorn maybe done three or four or five these in my entire life where I'm talking about my perspective on anything I'm entirely showing up at every press conference every fight every way in every media workout trying to get something out of the fighter to be consumed by the audience in a way that maybe they hadn't seen it before not just for the audience's sake but I want the fighter to get in touch with something like there's so many of these platitude questions in the same old shit and nobody's really like digging deep these aren't one-dimensional characters these aren't actual bulls these aren't just gladiators their fathers their sons they're like they have civil rights issues they have cultural things are bringing to this thing they have all like depression we know all the things that fighters go through but they only want to show you one side because they don't want to show any vulnerability and their fans aren't interested in like anything other than who's up and who's down if that's all you're feeding them yeah so I try to get out of the way I don't want to get in front of the work so when people see me in this light a lot of people just like oh this guy must be a fucking Uncle Tom man Rihanna and Snoop Dogg think so clearly that's who this guy is have you talked to snoop since no but I have talked to Wilder many times since then and to this guy's credit never even even though even the 20 minutes after your right we did know each other we do have a history and he is now knowing the moment they created and knowing what he did to me in that moment has always been especially gracious he's always been especially helpful I can always get access to him we have a bond now but you share this thing that's extra Keable no matter what happens oh my goodness that's amazing so he said I don't think there's another boxing interview like that ever ever there's nothing like it there's nothing like it this one we're like remember when Larry Merchant was talking to Floyd Mayweather it's like if you were 20 years younger or if I was 20 years younger I'd kick your ass right all due respect Larry Merchant a legend and an icon on that microphone shouldn't said that of course not yeah that's ridiculous it's not always a ridiculous you talking to the best boxer ever you woulda kicked his ass and you're younger oh really he's probably still an embryo at that time you probably could have kicked disaster yeah when he was four anything after ten I'm worried about him like he get out I mean yeah we did a lot you know right which is yeah well it if not made it about him he insulted fighters a lot there was there was a lot of that yeah I feel like what merchants did that people objected to was he had his own standard by which you had to win the fight and by what you had to get his respect even if you won that everybody doesn't share and it's like there's no so existed in a vacuum this is before the internet and one of the things I think about internet commentary in the age of the Internet is you're accountable you're accountable in a different way back then if you were Howard Cosell or if you or anyone who was commenting on sports you really could kind of get away with it other than what radio guys would say about you or journalists would say alright but the regular person didn't ever say then now it's now the regular person is a fuckload to say trust me as a commentator you know I mean I know when I've made mistakes you know I don't have to read the comments I know if I fuck something up and but don't let me know I don't mind if in fact I incur a regular person that's I'm gonna say it's these strange motherfuckers that are like really should probably pipe down like if you and you do because you're on YouTube and you're on the Internet the the amount of comments that are useful or thoughtful or like okay interesting ninety percent maybe 92 but there's like eight percent that eight percent of really just like vitriolic racist sexist like violent trolls yeah shit posters it's a good way to put it yeah that's the expression shitposting but it's wildly accurate it's like a reddit thing right 4chan reddit yeah it's they call it shit posting guys do it on purpose all they're trying to just get a rise out of you they're trying to say the most fucked up thing to you to make other people laugh and to get a rise out of you and if you met them in real life you'd be like I'm sorry I'm just bored at work a lot for their twelve you know Deonte went and like beat a guy up that was oh well that guy that he beat up that guy is fucking crazy that guy would fight every you know Floyd Mayweather senior beat his ass did you ever see that I didn't see that yeah what is what the fuck's his name Charlie's Szell Szell not doesn't rings a bell yeah when I was watching him box Tiant I'm lucky it's this guy out of his fucking mind and then Deonte was beating his ass outside the ring he wouldn't let him go I support that if I support that - that guy's a troll any sucker punches people like he tried to sucker punch Floyd see what senior he was beating Floyd senior was beatin his ass and he got tired and he quit Boyd senior moved away and he jumped through the ropes and took a wild haymaker swing on him but I think he's legitimately mentally deranged like there's something wrong with them hmm I did see that yeah yeah Deonte beat the fuck out of him those are the people that are like the loudest in the room yeah a normal person will post a comment for against criticism or congratulations and kind of leave it at that maybe like a couple other posts but that kind of guy a shit poster yeah it's gonna be every couple of hours he's gonna be engaging people he's gonna be all over your threat right you didn't mean hey look at this imagine you hate that left hook and his sat down I mean he's a he's fortunate he's still alive but then he still went after him like that was his thing he would like go no no no I'm done I'm done I'm done then he were like right after he basically fights like he comments well he's just a crazy person and there's something wrong with them but what do you think I think that the internet now is to a place where you can drag people you can change their lives you can like actually put them in harm's way by chris turing up a fervor around being violent towards them that everybody should have to be identified on the internet I don't believe in this like anonymous posting shit posters all there's a problem with that is there's a lot of people that have things to say that are important they don't want to suffer consequences at work or their job they want to be able to whistle blow and say hey there's like some safety problems here or there's some sexual harassment here or there's this or that there's benefits to being anonymous and then there's negative aspects of it I said I see both things well I mean that person is that in a comment section though this is what I feel like I feel like if someone is saying some horrible shit then yes but if someone is just explaining something that's going down like there's people that have talked about like unfair labor practices or things that are going down at work and they they literally have to be anonymous in order to leak this information particularly if they're talking about someone from another country and they're doing it through a VPN like they have to do it this way they have to do it anonymously otherwise their life is in danger and they need to get the word out like there's like real crimes taking places issue I see I see your perspective that there's a lot of cunts online and they they think it's cute and those those fuckers should be outed yeah and I think I know I'm not sure that you should be I there are times in which people are unjustly punished for having reasonable opinions or going against the grain or something like that but generally if you say something publicly for public consumption you should be willing to accept the consequences of that there's no again if it's not something where you are putting yourself in danger to expose a crime right because doing that well here's the thing you shouldn't be reading that shit anyway I don't read it I don't really I don't read a goddamn thing when you pocket when the show goes up your ever show it is the next experience yes for the first hour - no fucking chance no chance no I've disappear on I mean I had in the past like way long ago but within the last couple years hmm I don't it's it's a waste of time it's not good for you and you would even learn you're awesome we're gonna learn we want you to love you if people love me by now like some people don't love me right now what am I doing wrong I've been doing this fucking show for 10 years I'm assuming people some people enjoy it yeah yes I enjoy talking to regular folks like if you say hey man I got a lot out of that episode with that doctor talked about this or some okay cool that's awesome I like that those are fun conversations but just throwing yourself into the Wolves of the comments covering yourself up with fucking blood just leaping into the pan of wolves I am willing to throw myself on the fire just to pick out the few little pieces of charcoal that I can use to like warm my next interview sometimes people I mean like my I don't consider myself one of these people who come to an interview with an agenda and I've got a point of view and ran that fight has to answer to me more so I'm gleaning from the audience what it is that they want to know or perspectives that they've I mean disagree with personally but I want to present their perspective to people they can't get at or talk to hmm so I have to like be listening to what they're saying and understand how their simulation what they're saying about you say if you're talking about you know you're gonna interview Canelo or something through an interpreter you would you know you use plenty of people with perspectives on Canelo you don't have to listen to anything they have to say about you yeah this this this wrestling match that you're doing inside your head everybody does everybody does this the solution is don't read the comments where people saying mean horrible things about you just don't read it don't read it look if people are talking about you right now in a barber shop somewhere you don't know yes should you go there so you feel bad that's basically what you're doing if you get it into the comments like it's at a certain point in time it becomes untenable and in my life it's untenable this is just the volume is insane it's not possible and it's not healthy and most of its positive right if I if I go on my Instagram like if I looked at comments I'm sure most of its positive but I just posted go posting go do people stop you on the streets to give you their opinion because you you call fights and everybody's got it appear dead cow you know what political comments more than anything man I had a fucking guy where I was playing pool and you want to talk to me about an Abby Martin interview that I had yeah you let her off the hook and I go dude I'm here to play pool I'm not here to talk fucking Venezuela with you I don't know jack shit about Palestine like just leave me alone I'm here to play pool bro this is work I don't come to your job right and then if I can talk to you about some shit like don't come on or come to you in the street and talk to you about your job this is uh you know it's I'm happy to talk to people but I'm not gonna debate whether or not they're right or I'm wrong you put so much more yourself out there right I'm out there plenty I don't need you out there anymore yeah so yeah they don't know don't put yeah will you put it out now well people get that you know the way you explained it backstage when we were at The Comedy Store I was laughing so hard because it was so funny like you you like the emotions of it all like you explaining what it was like like of course I fucking know what he's saying I was trying to get him to explain it to people who might not understand his personal perspective yeah and it's it was it's still such a big part now of my identity yes yeah it can't be understated how big one minute yeah the thing is one minute on Instagram and it's the way that a lot of people identify me like I say the more they say just a more than they say my name yeah and it's also his most famous clip on about that but no but you have to look at it this way I think I mean you don't have to but this is my perspective this thing that can abuse us the internet with comments and 15 year-old assholes saying mean shit to you what it also is is an avenue for you to put your stuff out there they would not have existed before before you would have had to been hired by CBS or ABC or whoever named it you don't have to be hired by anybody anymore but the other side of that is the comment section now you could be one of those guys that turns the comment section off but man I don't think that's a good idea yeah I think that's a good idea either we accidentally had the comment section turned off back when we used to stream because we were streaming live and it wasn't that we turned it off but we had it off we had the chat off on the streaming because people would just like say a bunch of rude shit just so that other people had to read it while the podcast was going on like look at these people are just taking advantage of so but something happened when we flipped it over to live there was a bug and for how long was it that it did that Jamie where the comments were turned off it wasn't that long but it was long enough for people to freak the fuck out and I'm like hey hey hey not turning any comments off like you fucking say whatever you want to say I'm not reading it but you say whatever the fuck you want to say go have fun then so this this medium this Avenue for putting out content never existed before it exists now but also people's ability to comment exists and I think most people are rational most people the vast majority are just commenting on it they might disagree with you they might think you suck they might tell you why you suck but they're pretty rational they're like man he just talks about himself or he does this or he has to bring it back to that or he blah blah blah you know there's there's gonna be people having their perspectives and then they debate those perspectives with other people in the thread there's nothing wrong with that but there's gonna be a certain percentage that are out of their fucking mind or they're 15 and they're angry and you know like I was just talking about this in the last podcast with my friend Justin Martindale's like when I was fifteen man thank God Twitter wasn't a thing I would have said the dumbest shit I would have found celebrities had mean shit to them I mean I would I would I was a fucking idiot digging those tweets up today well they're doing that to kids now that get gigs and then they find in their tweets when there were 17 18 years old and now they're 24 like hey it's a different fucking human being man like we need a path to redemption for people and Twitter and Facebook and all these Conte's these comments that are permanently on the record they make it really difficult for kids I would not want to be in high school today with a Twitter account saying the dumbest fucking shit in the world and then having that come back to haunt me when I want a job someday right you don't know what the world's gonna be like in 15 years and when hopefully you're not the same as you were 15 years ago or anything of course commend the person that doesn't look anything like they'd look when they were 15 but we don't want that they know what he wants that you know there's a thing with comedy right where you have to leave your town because they won't appreciate you they only remember you when you sucked like when I lived in Boston when I started out as an open mic fucking terrible everybody's terrible when they start I was terrible and so they thought I was terrible and then I had to leave I had to leave even though I gotten better they still thought I was terrible I had a leave and I had to get TV shows and then come back and then they're like oh yeah you got better he's okay yeah but the people that you would go to Pittsburgh they never saw it before they like you're hilarious Mike thank you well tell the people in Boston would you but what about the internet for comedians like the kind of thing that you do developing bits and having to have an opportunity to put them on stage before everybody sees them and like you say they see the joke at all different stages how can you create a bit on the road with as much internet as many people like posting her jugs as most people don't believe it or not most people cool about it sometimes big sets get leaked like louis c.k set like that was a big deal that was he hadn't done stand-up in ten months and then they put her most comedy fans don't want to ruin it for everybody else most most if you're a real comedy fan like if you go see Dave and he's working some shit out of the store you're not gonna film it and put it online most people are not gonna do that yeah I mean there's no better example for me and Dave Chappelle oh and like how to do it I mean that's how he's met at the comic store you and I you know I mean obviously Dave's my best friend and I've watched him like like walk through these minefields of all this shit and the main thing he likes saying is like you know live right now like live in the moment yeah put your phones away and just like present yeah and all that I've never seen a guy other than him be able to convince an entire room of people I don't think I mean that his own show like he'll pop up somewhere where everybody's already got their phones out there like filming mayor or the roots or whatever it is if they came to see Dave we'll come on like put those damn phones away yeah let's have a minute let's make a memory and put an entire room with people can stuff those phones in a pot and even Dave like when we do when Dave and I do gigs on the road we use those Vairo bags wouldn't know it's what it's a condo yonder yonder bags yeah but he even started that yonder bags know we've been doing I've been doing yonder bags for years and they the first time I ever used them the Denver Comedy Works actually started using them independently and the first time I had heard about them let's let it's been a few years but comics like Ali Wong she used them in all her shows I used him a lot up until my last Netflix special then I got tired of using them it's just like I'm like I don't want to tell people to put their fucking phone away you know the most hilarious thing was Miami because Miami is it's such a party town right and half the audience probably coked up and is the only audience when they have the Yonder bags where they just kept getting up and going outside because they wanted to use their phone they didn't just sit down and enjoy the show most places that 99.99999% everybody just sits down and they go alright my phone's in the bag now let me just enjoy the show and it makes the show better in Miami the whole audience is people getting up and going out and coming back getting up going out to go to give the bathroom to either do coke or to fucking get their phone out of their bag they're trying to get pussy or whatever the fuck they're trying to do they're just wild people if they're coming back you're doing a job yeah well they definitely keep coming back but it was just like it's hilarious how what the culture of Miami is so different than anywhere else there's such wild people that that is like you you you should have to have a passport to go to Miami and I don't mean because like people there are from other countries and some of them are but it's because the culture is different the white people there the the the Latinos everyone's different there Miami is like visiting another country it really is it's a wild ask place I was in Miami for the suit like the first time over Super Bowl it's like the first time place man South Beach I went to South Beach I went downtown it's a wild fucking place man but it's so cool I feel like everybody I didn't do like the party party scene even though it was Super Bowl I liked what the other way with it I was so like kind of drained already I was like you know what I'm just gonna relax in Miami while everybody else is Turk to like 12 as well close voices I've ever been like rape food man the most fantastic Cuban food you'll ever find a lot of Caribbean food and just like the women are so beautiful - it's like it's a crazy place it's a crazy place what really does feel like another country I do love about this phone thing and like people so much it's like when I talk about the different cultures in combat sports like that gives me access to everybody beat on their phones and the one thing that's everywhere is YouTube so I don't know if you know this but like you said there was a time when the only way you could have a voice or certainly comment on boxing or MMA or sports is if you got hired by a major Network they had a reach where people could see somebody has to die forget that job right Larry March has to retire exactly but I came up in an age and the at the very beginning of YouTube I was training at wild card Boxing Gym I'm a teenager training there the gym is fairly Eton fairly new and I had it was still like mini DV days and I had a camera that I would use to shoot sparring sessions and because Freddie has a gym where there are World Championship fighters preparing for title fights on television the class of fighter that's in there on any given day sparring or like main event ticket selling marquee guys and I'm in there shooting there sparring session any you know any name anybody vers anybody and I'm using the money I'm making selling the sparring footage back to the fighters to pay my gym dues Wow that's how I started and it's like in journalism yeah okay it's an interesting story because I was doing broadcasting since 10th grade I was like at a performing arts high school we had a radio station in the basement he's like a coming over he's like 80s movie or something just off the equipment I got a faculty can I do a show and so I'm covering like headline news and whatever fucking 10th grader thinks is important and who won the football game and you know this kind of shit but I always thought that you know I'm gonna be a talk radio guy never sports so I've been training boxing since fifth grade but never did I like did I think the two shall meet except that I'm now I've moved to LA right after high school I'm in Freddie Roach is boxing gym I'm training can't barely afford do so I gotta come the way to do that I start shooting sparring sessions and this this is like James Toney is still fighting we're on the sunset of his career but he's still the maid and there's a guy named Danny Green who is a Australian fighter wildly famous there but doesn't have like global audience he wants to fight James snow real money in it for James but if you know James Toney this is no shrinking violet this man is like insane he was like Wilder turnt up till I took this day was every day that was James Toney at wild card Boxing Gym right so this guy flies from Australia walks into the gym and you know what a sacred place those are like if the main fighter at any gym the guy who like is the the representation of the toughest dude in hot dogs yeah the top dog you don't just walk into that guy's gym start talking shit especially with James Toney especially with Jay no one talked more shit than James Toney right the talk shit in the middle of a round right exactly all throughout rounds this guy comes to the James Jim starts talking shit James like get in the ring right now you last 10 rounds I'll fight you anywhere didn't get the fight he takes takes the challenge gets in there gets the shit beat out for like eight rounds just ah its pummeled I'm shooting the thing I like right here first of all I'm wildly impressed that you came up with Jamie's account even know where to find it look how good he looks to James looks good I'm shooting this oh my goodness and this is James in his prime he looked like he was a fucking heavyweight look at the size of him yeah was James heavyweight at this point cruiserweight his cruiserweight he was still cruiserweight god damn is huge right he's on all the Mexican supplements lose the size of man that's so funny I have I probably seen this footage in I don't know how many years dude James just fucking him up okay but the point being that at this time there really wasn't any boxing price to speak of you know like this is great ESPN might give you a highlight of De La Hoya you might get a Mike Tyson knockout clip but there's nobody sitting around talking boxing there's no place to see fighters training there's no web sites for fights and after this thing got done I'm like yeah you know Danny Green doesn't want it he just got the shit beat of him James Toney doesn't care about it at all so I'm just gonna go home and record over it yeah because this is my side hustle I need listen man I very young man this time I need every VHS tape I can use I you need every mini DV I can use to keep the money in my pocket I can't just be stockpiling footage nobody wants but before I get a chance to tape over it I get a call from a site called max boxing and at that time they're like brings the only monster website huh what yours is I want to say this is probably closer mm yeah mm and they say hey we heard Danny Green came down a wild card they had like this brutal sparring session like you know how much bigger James yeah he's so much bigger I didn't even look like they're nearly in the same weight class James looks like he's 20 pounds heavier than them doesn't he yeah well of course this but you know every by weigh-in day he'll get down but this is how this is how James like rocked every day like he'd be just banging guys Tom and shit beating them up talking shit and so this even though now looking back of course it's like amazing footage but at the time this could be any given Wednesday right you know I mean yeah it happened there all the time you know he used to spar with Mickey Rourke yeah and that's one of the reasons why make your side how'd he get his face worked on apparently yeah Mickey work used to cover a wild card and he's disbarred James which is like somewhere I need to talk to him look at me look at me oh there's no Foley jeez man so what was really not happening was I got a little bidding war going for this video this is such like a hot piece and I got it up to like it's like Danny's in pretty fucking good shape and James getting tired was there moments in this where James looked really tired the thing about James Tony at this time he always looked really tired he always seemed like he was being lazy he's always leaning on fighters but what you can't hear is the thud of those shots like he's just hurting so I'm Jamie it's 12 da come on paper champ you hear Freddie in the background talking to him [Music] so they went eight rounds like this yeah and then what happened at the end of it still he's Danny Green still seems like he's kind of in it no I mean fucking him up yeah I mean it's like Danny had spots where he's connecting but at no point during the in mind you've his face is getting bloodier like the shots that James are throwing are consistently heavier and James is just having an easy time with him it's not like anything that Danny's doing is making an impression so how did they end it I was just over like Danny had enough oh you don't mean yeah and this became Jim Moore's what I did with this footage ultimately was I took it and went to an editor named Brian Hart he was an editor for max boxing at the time and he got Doug Fisher who's now the editor-in-chief of Ring Magazine and I to commentate that footage as though you're watching it on HBO oh right so does doing the color I'm calling the fight like I'm the Lampley and he's the Kellerman and we showed the whole thing I talked about the context of what had happened like I told you and we're calling the quiet and this show Jim wars blew up it was like the first big boxing like thing on the internet at all and so I would go to around the different gyms and get fighters and they all started a wild card and then I would branch out get fighters to agree let me shoot the sessions and turn it into a show called Jim wars and so this foot like the way these guys now get their like phones and their cameras and they go interview fighters and all this shit I started that that wasn't a thing before I started doing it I'm the one who created this light medium by which you now receive boxing news Wow so my entire career and trajectory in life was changed at a boxing gym and never to look back and what a fighter one point I'll never know never all use just a train always train since since fifth grade always trained and taking it credibly seriously I've heard you talk about this too and it's it couldn't be more true this was a way for me to release like all of those young man angst and all that frustration it's really my therapy I could brilliant for gym dude you know I can't afford therapy right boxing was that it was an integral part of my life I spent hours in the gym to where I had to figure out a way to make some money there so I could continue to eat and pay for it and that was my way of doing it and so be interviewing fighters is now like my claim of frame because everybody thinks they're reinventing the wheel now he can't shoot anybody sparring or anything like that so that show had to go away but the way that I relate to and understand fighters and what it is like that's inside them that's that they're experiencing that's driving them I think is unique because although I would never ever classify myself as a fighter that's such a unique and cherished like battery that you can really hold if that's really what you do I'm a warrior too yeah I mean like I am my own way I forged a career I created something that didn't exist and I had to fight every step along the way to make it a thing so this is something while you were doing it you were realizing like I'm making a career out of talking about boxing were you doing that or do you thinking well I'm doing this for now and I'm gonna do something else I I kept doing what was working you know I mean and I at times I thought about doing something else but never did I spent as much time thinking about or applying myself to anything else so yeah other things would come up but everything but it all would bring it would all come back to this I would always go back to the gym cuz Dave is a crazy boxing fan - and I remember Dave talked to me at one point time about the three of us doing something this is a while back right trap season Dave and I have a show called Stroud season and the best way I could describe it is it's like hey the anthony bourdain of boxing if you will as i've said i go all over the world covering fights mmm every community of combat sports has its own culture every fighters got his own story every fights got its own narrative that's connected to another fight that's connected to another fight that's got a historical point of view and that's how I see the world of combat sports like that's how I see boxing it's through that lens that this show exists and you're right Dave's a phenomenal boxing fan he knows his shit he goes to the fights he takes his whole crew to the fights buys everybody ringside tickets like we talked for hours on the phone about any and every fight that's upcoming and we met in Macau at Pacquiao Rios Wow Brandon Rios yeah the first okay that's yeah that was in Macau is Rios and then Algeria fought Algeria as well that was a mismatch yeah the Brandon Rios just like he was a good fighter like a tough guy but man that's a fight where you really saw how great pack yeah seven knockdowns dude that's when they let him out of the cage he's just just live him up let him up that was crazy hey you know Pacquiao has been doing just did it recently to Keith Thurman he can't want to run this guy off years of gotta be it step in right hook over the shoulder and drop Thurman I was like holy shit bro and mind you that guy is why wild card Boxing June with a course including Freddie Roach is the most famous gym I would say in the world yeah even I would say be more famous in this day than even gleet Gleason's I think you're right but the first time I interviewed Manny Pacquiao was at the Vagabond Hotel which is now torn down it was condemned next door to the gym on a radio a an air conditioner while those protruding air conditioners from the wall with seven other guys in his hotel room all living in the hotel room it's me and Manny Pacquiao like on an air conditioner doing a one-on-one he doesn't he have that thing we're like if he does he has a house out here he'll have like 20 dudes living with him you yeah yeah and this is the most generous like guy I've ever known in my life like Manny Pacquiao does things just defy reason like you as nice as it is you want to like shake him I yell not at the hundred people on the private plane like you know by them normal tickets like he has to keep fighting probably just to keep up that payroll yeah I guess he's got to keep fighting he's gotta be a senator yeah he's gotta you know indoors can't pistachio nuts you gotta do everything yeah because he ki it's like water like he wants to feed the people he wants to be that guy and it's genius he really is an outlet I heat the money will flow through him if he keeps going that's right that's right so yous got to imagine me meeting of all people Dave Chappelle of all places in China in Macau cuz he's there for a fight so Dave flew in for the fight fluid whose family in like she's you know the Chappelle's were there Wow for the fight and Matt and now that I've known well that's not unusual at all like he does that for BA he loves boxing to that degree so we spent like I said hours just talking about boxing on the phone and we get together we have these dinners for on Fight Night and we're like you know what this is something that could be something and we ended up shooting for like two years followed me around the the dinners we had countless people at these dinners of Michael buffer we wanted you we still want you like these things that you know and I know about combat sports about this community of fighters is something I don't think anybody else could do like you have to be a part of that conversation because you're really the only one who can talk about it for the perspective that you do I know a lot of people okay I know a lot of people that comment on MMA as I'm sure you do I know a lot of you like comment on boxing I know people who dedicate themselves to the community to the sport to the spirit of it like you do like I do and that's what makes it unique there's a there's a there's a lens through which you can see this shit that really a very very few people can show you you're that guy well those people like particularly the MMA people they demand it you can't you can't be a casual observer of MMA you can't mmm they won't allow it if you don't know what the fuck you tell you so what happens even a Smith recently I did yeah that's that's what happens man you know and part of it is like you know Luke Thomas has an interesting he's a really good and then they journalist he had a really interesting take on it where he's saying that part of it is that there's a thing in this sport where they don't want Outsiders like people that cover other sports like dunno you don't know this sport but if you do jump in god damn you got to know what the fuck you're talking yeah you got to really know what the fuck you're talking about and Stevens thing is being entertaining and being dismissive of people and you know kind of in an arrogant way in and you know insulting you know that's his thing I mean he creates controversy that controversy creates a lot of people watching and paying attention that shit does not fly in MMA these guys are literally fighting for their life I mean they literally are moments from death at several times in certain fights there's moments where guys are out cold and you see a guy dropping an elbow on their face and smashing their orbital bone before the referee can get to him you can't make fun of those guys in that way you can't you can't talk shit about them they're not gonna allow it that's correct nor should they there's five fighters that we know about that is to come to injuries in the ring and died and died just last year yeah and you can't drink your stick to this shit right and I don't think it's saved that for sports with balls yeah countdown shows well sports where people hit each other a different man they're just different you know right they just it's a different thing like boxing like the reason why Deonte was so amped up and wild before that fight you're not gonna see a basketball player like that four days before the NBA Finals they'll be tuned up and ready to go but they'll be calm they're not ready to go to war right literally putting their fucking health on the line it's a different thing yeah you know of course we respect all sports but yes for sure his kind of risk that you're taking huh and the individuality of it even though you've got a guy in the ring got a cut man yeah that's right your corner it really is just you out there when that bell rings and you're not just fighting the guy you're looking at right you're fighting the guy inside you that wants to quit you're fighting the guy inside you that thinks that last punch really hurt yeah you're writing the guy inside you there's like you know I probably made enough of my own of all I need to do the shit anymore like your own demons you know everything that goes into not just being a successful fighter but being a respected fighter a fighter at all everyone seen that clip with a guy climbed through the ropes the bell rang he climbed out of the ropes and walk back there's a little bit of that and everybody and you're fighting him - yeah you know what I'm saying what was that about wasn't that like some contract dispute or something though ah they felt like they were fucking him over how I did from what I understand he went back there and asked for his money like I thought that because he got in the ring the bell to get his money yeah that's what I heard oh my god that's hilarious but that guy could never fight again no no you know I mean right nobody ever trust him again go through a full camp preparing for that guy no I mean imagine being his opponent what seemed to walk out you like what right what's happening here you don't even get paid now you can't criticize somebody as though they are just doing what you're doing because I'm talking I got a job I'm an important guy with this level of shit so no yeah we're doing the same thing essentially yeah we're both on TV so the kind of love that you have a comment or the kind of love that you have for what it is that you comment on it comes through I should do it but I've been doing it almost half my life now in terms of commenting on it I've been doing martial arts it's always a fucking baby basically and that's it but when you see combat sports today and you see like the landscape of boxing I feel personally that this is an amazing time I mean I feel like the heavyweight division has never been more exciting and more turbulent because there's so many great fighters now to have and Ruiz jump out of nowhere and knock out Anthony Joshua I think was a godsend for the sport because all of a sudden you saved like look at this chubby Mexican just fucked up this dude looks like a god like this is crazy like and this is for the Mexican community it's huge having their first Mexican heavyweight champion but it's also like wow this is a crazy division look you got the Deonte just knocks the fuck out of Luis Ortiz with that one punch the 4head you're like what the fuck you got the rematch with Tyson Fury's coming up in two weeks right not even right less than 20 seconds oh my goodness now what you're talking about earlier is exemplified and what happened after the Ruiz fight where you see like you said chubby guy that's fair yeah but he's a fucking fighter oh my god he's a heavyweight hands be real his hand speeds tremendous and if you think just because he's chubby you can take a knock of the guy especially after he won the title as though he won the lottery or he won a scratch off and this shit just happens it doesn't it reminded people of what the heavyweight division is one punch can change the fight is a real thing it is a real thing he fucked up doing that rematch that rematch was a disaster so it was so clearly unprepared when you wait 280 I was like oh my god and what was the rumors like and I fell into like everybody's talked about how he's getting thinner and one Instagram picture I did what chubby girls do held that camera well you know he lost he wasn't training with his trainer and he was partying a lot you know and I knew he was partying a lot heard from people that knew him they like man no I heard with him that didn't believe it I believed it you know why I believed it cuz it's so hard not to all the sudden you're the fucking man now nowhere and maybe he was convinced that he could do it again you know he's hitting the pads and pretty good hitting the bag look pretty good as I fucked that guy up again but Anthony Joshua had a totally different game plan this time and to see Anthony Joshua stick and move like that was interesting I was like wow yeah that's interesting it's a cliche but it again losing might have been the best thing that ever happened to him I don't know about that I don't know about that you know I mean I think it's great that he got his title back but I felt like one thing that happened in that fight that disturbed me was even though Ruiz came in out of shape and clearly didn't look like he was prepared correctly Joshua didn't did never really enforce his will on him he never really had a moment was beating the fuck out of him was like you know I trained hard for this fight I'm gonna dominate you now now I'm gonna take you out the way you took me out there was none of that it was boxing just stick and move make sure you get the decision make sure you get the decision that is in stark contrast to where Deonte finishes fights which is why that matchup is so intriguing which is why no matter what happens between the two of them hopefully they remain undefeated for their own sakes and can they make that unification fight I saw his commitment to discipline Joshua I'm talking as a good thing oh it's definitely a good thing because he won the title back but when you make the argument who's the best heavyweight in the world if you have to look at it on paper I don't think it's him right now I think it's Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder depending on what happens on the 22nd I lean towards Deonte because he can close the show at any moment that 12th round I was I was in bed and I was watching the fight and I went oh shit I popped up oh shit he knocked him out he knocked and then if you were rising like what the fuck he rises he gets through the barrage and then he wins the remainder of the round like this is insane and even Rock Deonte at one point I'm like this is an insane fight and then it was a draw and I don't think on paper it's really a draw I think that's horseshit I think on paper Tyson Fury won more rounds but I'm not upset with the draw because the way Deonte knocked him down and then knocked him down on the way he knocked him down the third or the twelfth round and should almost count for like three points I mean it's so crazy just about any and there's not a criticism of Jack Reese like the guy did get up see I can't say you know did something wrong but most referees of that what is his weight or not most there's no arms were flat he was laying on his back it looked like he was in another dimension and you think of any other fight and the countless fights that you've covered where the the main highlight of the fight is just a guy getting up crazy this is crazy yeah hey crazy well that punch to the right hand and the left hook behind it and then him walking off like this he thought he had him raised yeah Tyson Fury is something special man but so is Deonte it's so Joshua like yes three of those guys they're so uniquely different that I can't say I mean I don't know who's best can rage for days but I don't know that for sure this guy beats that guy that guy beats the other guy this guy's backup and that guy you know you you won't know until they face each other and what I'm saying is even if Deonte were to lose to Tyson Fury I still want to see Joshua Wilder that is the fight I want to see that is the fight I want to well I definitely the rematch is the first fight I want to see the next fight I want to see regardless of the outcome is I want to see well unless Tyson Fury caio's Wilder if Tyson Fury kales Wilder is like an - a Joshua Anthony Joshua you daughter if he gets a mic and starts talking that kind of shit then I want to see that fight but if my dream matchup right now is the rematch that's the dream matchup the dream matchup is the 22nd yeah I am so fucking pumped for that rematch who I'm not doing jack shit I'm gonna I'm taking the night off I'm sitting right in front of the fucking TV sweaty palms now see for you to say that about a boxing match that's a huge thing I love boxing though I do I mean I call combat sports you know I call M&A but I do love boxing you know I love the Canelo Kovalev fight I thought that was fascinating to watch Canelo ko Kovalev vitals yeah damn what'd he have six minutes so he says I thought Kovalev was winning that fight he was funny he was if he could have stayed on his feet for six more minutes he beats Canelo Canelo it looked like he had a plan to do that like it looks like he planned for kovalev to fade you know because Kovalev he's not the same guy used to be you know he's slow after Andre Ward knocked him out in the second fight he just seems like a different guy it just seems like he doesn't and he's also had a lot of legal troubles outside the ring his rumors of booze and abuse and all kinds of shit you know sometimes fighters they they hit this point in their career where they don't have the same level of commitment that they did when they first started fighting and when kovalev in the early days man when he was the crusher you know he was fucking everybody up man he was a terrifying force fantastic amateur record you know amazing technical boxing skills vicious right hand and he was something special but you know but to your point like it's those kind of experience getting stopped by Ward I think was more of a mental thing for him I think that it's a hurdle he couldn't get over mentally in the physical followed suit which is why I say you know it would have been easy for Joshua to get bogged down in the disappointment of that moment right and not ever really recover from the lack of invincibility that he found himself in on a fight like everybody thought he was gonna win going away a year deep in boxing circles had you heard the rumor that Joshua had been knocked out in training I've heard all the rules yeah but that was entirely from enough people that I was taking and taking it seriously the two weeks before the fight he had got ko'd really bad in training yeah I heard it I did I chose idli Kyoto I have no idea nor do I know that it's true I don't alter either and even though that kind of thing is salacious and I would love to know for sure I feel like if you turn up on the night and you get to that first bell ringing we're in a fight everybody's struggling with something you know my hand hurts and pulled over the hamstring I'm not telling you about everything they say and this is even more widely reported that Joshua had a bit of a panic attack in the in the dressing room before the fight dad I find hard to believe the sparring thing I think could happen anybody and then it's a question like do we go on but here's the thing if you suffering from the residual effects of not going and then he's like I really shouldn't be fighting right now fuck I can't believe I have to fight right now and then he's starting to freak out because I know that's happened in MMA and MMA that's definitely happened where guys have been Kayode badly in the training before the fight and then they get to the fight and they really shouldn't be fighting and they know it and then they kind of freak out what do you do though like I mean what are you wait let's say that let's say that all that's true and this is just hypothetical let's say that these are true stories then it comes down to like the date set you have an opponent that should be easy to beat everybody thinks this guy is like I don't think so an easy replacement this is don't forget this was his American debut this wasn't just some Friday another one at the o2 sits the garden his first fight in America that Wilder fights still like looming Josh was supposed to take over the world Oh soon big big baby more tested positive when well what we had they were like three weekly weeks out three weeks three weeks out and then was like officially okay yeah it's like two weeks but Ruiz had so he tested positive for steroids and then Ruiz comes in somewhere two and a half three we and yeah yeah it's a slight crazy can of worms what do you do but here's the thing I mean I bet he wished he cancelled it after it was over bet he wished he canceled it sure if that was the case but we don't even know if that was the case so we're just talking shit yeah to that point what does that what does that experience with Joshua do for him against Wilder the biggest knockout puncher in heavyweight boxing history sure it's not history history certainly okay 40 wins by knockout one decision one draw what the fuck who the hell does that and you nobody's ever nobody ever he avenged the guy he got throughout yeah it's tavern yeah but that that record is unchallenged there's no one like that I don't think in any fucking division even you go back to the kale punches like Julian Jackson right the old school one punch destroyers he he beat people by decision Deonte knocks everybody out it's crazy and he knocks him out with like four head punches that four head punched her wheeze just black yeah he just walks away he's released is laying on the ropes like what in the fuck just hit me he's flouting convention like it's like crazy you're not supposed to be able to do that everybody talks so much shit about his skills right that's what the science is built on yeah but it's nonsense because the way he's built first of all six foot nine 209 pounds that's what he weighed me fought Tyson Fury 209 right I mean he's probably like 218 when he fought Ruiz gained nine pounds or so like it's not that much right now very light anyway but also because of that doesn't get tired like those bigger guys he doesn't have as much body mass where his blood is flowing through but he also has fucking ridiculous power and he keeps that power later than any of them into your point now I think he'll keep that power longer any I've seen he does get tired he chases the knockout yes I even get he didn't get but he recovered women but his patients like everyone all he he'll tell me skills don't pay the bills I got my own style I you guys stop saying that shit but what we saw him the Ruiz for the Luis Ortiz fight was that he started to use the discipline of patience he wasn't chasing a knockout anymore he was relying on it yeah which is a taboo but he knew when in that moment came he'd be in position to fire and he believed when he fired he'd win yeah get it and the patients are not chasing the knockout yeah that's science - it is technique - because he knows that he has this preposterous power and mean he knows he's a hunter and he's okay and he's right he's been right 40 fucking times get right one more yeah he's right he's right but the thing is man the Tyson Fury fight showed that some people can survive and that was that was what was so fascinating about that fight because Tyson was the only guy that could survive and he survived it twice he got dropped earlier in the fight wasn't like the fifth round or something like that wasn't the run to the night and got dropped so we've got dropped earlier in the fight and then the big one in the 12th and still survived I mean just crazy I don't think Wilder thinks he survived I think Wilder thinks he got job well we talked about it he said look if you look at the clock it's like the fucking dude was down for 10 seconds the fucking guy was like if you count to 10 and that is that always always drive me crazy about boxing why don't they have a goddamn digital clock why they were lying on this guy to go 1-2 that shit is crazy because they're just counting they're just counting what are we in the dark ages throw a fucking digital clock up when the guy goes down at 10 seconds the fight is over if that's the case that fight is over Tyson Fury is down for like 12 seconds I don't know why so many things that sports aren't automated at this point I don't have this like nostalgic like a human error bullshit I don't believe in any of it including the the judging yeah I'm amazed the worst what's the solution to that I don't know man will look boxing his experience of fucking significant levels of bribery and corruption and you know there's been people that have actually been forced out of boxing right they don't they don't judge fights anymore like man he backing off Manny Pacquiao Tim Bradley remember that one course that one was like what in the fuck did you people watch like what is this right no triple G Canelo the first fight word what in the she's a nice lady yeah she doesn't MMA to and you know and DC Daniel Cormier one of the fights you looked Orioles Oh wonderful lady but but to be fair most of the fights i watch are ringside yes and I'll be on my phone texting my friends hey you know this fight yeah I got it this way people watching it at home will have it an entirely different way I'll go home and see what they're talking about faint sitting ringside from one angle all night gives you a perspective enough to judge the fight properly agreed and then like comparing it to the other guy was like dude watching guys have monitors because UFC people have monitors now the judges don't they should they didn't have it for a long time we asked for it we eventually got it we complained forever and in most Commission's the judges have ringside monitors but they should have more judges two three judges is ridiculous why we will probably leave well there's eight sides of the Octagon right and by the way there's a fucking million people that would love to judge yeah it doesn't make any sense it's not like we're short of people that understand it and in MMA we have an additional problem is that we go to places like we were in Texas this past weekend and we had terrible judging and those people weren't even some of them weren't even MMA judges the they had backgrounds in boxing and they transitioned over to MMA and some of them really didn't understand what was going on and there was really really bad decisions and that's the other thing like people you know the raging debate boxing verse UFC and all the shit it is a silliest debate I've ever heard as far as combat sports goes it's just not the same thing no it's nice that you can judge boxing anyway and think that well you know there everybody's hitting everybody yeah I've got the same skill set here as I do in the other one doesn't make any sense there's a lot of legit MMA judges now it's much less of a problem that it used to be but when we travel to places like Texas where were this past weekend then and you run into problems where they just don't get World title fights very often yeah you know and then the main event it was a very controversial decision but close enough that it wasn't I don't think was a robbery close enough close enough and you know I think he'd give it to the champion he dominated the last two rounds clearly in my eyes and could have won the third you know I watched it again today actually but some of the earlier fights were fucking possible I just I don't even need judges race I just watch the shit on TV like give me it give me an extra two three minutes if you have to wait for the decision right to figure it out properly right let's wait better than like two or three decades of arguing about the shit well I really think they need more people choosing I think there should be a large group of people you know maybe even ten people maybe even people at home and there in person and then you ask you tally up the score card it's like people that are respected respected world-class trainers respected fighters respected experts in martial arts that watch these fights or boxing matches and then tally it up then you'd never have a triple G versus Canelo first fight because 90% of the people thought that triple G won that first fight which is interesting the Canelo won the second fight because Canelo fought very differently in the second fight yeah that a fighter he was a better fighter in the second fight yeah and I think the criticism he took in the first fight i enraged him yeah you played it cool yeah I think that really pissed him off he's like okay yeah better he came back better fact that he went all the way up to fucking light-heavyweight and knocked out Sergey Kovalev amazing is insane I mean what does he do now does he stay at light-heavyweight does he go back to super I don't know that he makes middleweight again I mean he's not we could if he gave enough time you know but then he might be drained right right might but he's too small for light heavyweight yeah I mean obviously the 68 is probably the sweet spot for him but however he's not a kid anymore there's not like he's 22 like my fluctuating weight like that but did he fight Floyd at 52 yeah that's nuts yeah that's nuts yeah 75 now it's crazy yeah so much fucking 23 goddamn pounds that's crazy and then probably weighed a lot more than that before he cut weight to make the weights given give it a guy 24 hours between the lanes sometimes more than 24 hours in fact most times more than 24 hours they're like they blow up what kind of what kind of testing are they doing that dudes gone through so many weight classes and he's just jacked as fuck yeah vicious as fuck I'm not a doctor I don't you're not a dog I'm not a dog I know what a doctor either at this point it probably seems like I am why I'm suspicious there are so many things about both of our supports that could be easily corrected if the motivation was there to like even the playing field well you sod a program then the UFC is even the playing field considerably a lot of people fell off a lot of physiques changed a lot of people just lost all one entity has to make a decision in a essentially like for UFC it's like particularly yeah right the decision comes down and everybody's got to do it yeah boxing does not enjoy that kind of like you know dictatorship right and there's also been instances in boxing where guys have said no I don't want Vata testing I don't want it they got to pay for it themselves right right why should they why should they and then imagine if you're the guy who like this is his big fighters first time even making any money right now I got to spend all this dough on Votto and whatnot know what is the status of Adonis Stevenson is did he recover yeah he's recovers he okay now I mean he's not his former self but he's certainly like I think living a good life he's because I know that was like that was one of the more recent like superstar guys bright wounded I forget brain injury survivor come to those injuries but it's life changing like this guy will never be the Adonis Stevenson he was before the fight he's always going to know the rest of his life deal with those injuries and have challenges in a way that result of thought of each season is there videos of him I've seen about it or anything yeah I mean I haven't seen him talk about it in depth but we've seen him like his motor skills are coming back he's smile and he's able to like speak so it's not like Jeremy : no you know that the gentleman clown fight it's interesting it's kind of in many ways changed Roy Jones Jr's thoughts on the sport you know and that he'd ever wanted to turn out like that but then Roy gets older and he's still fighting fighting fighting people like deep into his forties right and you're like this is crazy like this is the same guy that after jail McClellan got hurt said he would never want to go out like that and he's fighting like young badasses in Russia and shit wait you still think you can do it yeah it's hard to stop doing it like it's easy for me to say hey man that was your last fight like let's let's take it easy a look at Bernard right he's the best example right into his fifties right but he had a style that was crafty enough to have some longevity in it without taking that kind of damage like Roy embarrass you and but he's still there in front of you which is what's the embarrassing part so if your motor skills slow down if your reflexes slow down you're gonna get hit yeah yeah not dying fucked up yeah but what he told me in an interview and might be one of them one of those moments when I was talking to a guy he said something that was like I thought I should have known until I heard it and then I was at home I can't believe I didn't realize that he said it's not the fights that destroy you it's the gym that destroys you it's the sparring oh yeah those are the rounds that destroy fighters oh yeah and it's like the hundreds and hundreds of rounds to thousands of rounds that you're fighting that nobody sees that you're not getting paid for you're taking that punishment headgear or not that's what you're seeing at the end of a fighter's career do you remember it was it Danny Jacobs jr. who was it that someone know something that wasn't him no it wasn't Danny Jacobs it was someone else someone that said that they stopped sparring oh yeah well he's fighting covilhã and that was Anthony yard that's right that's right right and that's it he stops by he's a never spot yeah yeah and no one believes it but yeah and then anyone who does is like we prize YouTube it's my yeah he looked great in moments in that fight like it was like the eighth round where he had Kovalev and deep shit yeah man that was a crazy thing like his philosophy if I remember correctly was yards philosophy was if you don't get hit at all in training you will be so much fresher when you get to the ring so he was doing just you ridiculous MIT work and bag work and drills and he already knew how to box so his idea was that he will have some sort of advance and he was a really fairly green guy right in terms of like world-class compost really big fuck yeah but really physically talented and just built like a brick shithouse and still is all those things yes but I think the rub is that ya do have to spar right you know yeah you have to feel shots that no trainer that I've ever had this discussion with and right after the fight plenty of people wanted to talk about it anybody be like yeah that made sense no it's just part of it you find that a little bit in MMA no Donald Cerrone was doing that for a while he wasn't sparring at all I was just doing pad work and just doing wrestling drills and stuff like that kickboxing drills yeah listen if pad work and like a really good workout could make your world champion I'd be like three-time world champion by now it's not sparring is a reality check yeah you know you need to need it otherwise you're just like doing aerobics yeah you need to be tuned in to movement to people and also to danger to be able to exist and to be able to fire under pressure you have to hit you have to take shots you have to absorb those try keep your eyes open like this like all of these things you can't you can't download them yeah you can't simulate them but you can only do that so many times that's the other thing it's like there's only so many times you can survive it you know and gym wars are real they take a toll on people yeah yeah yeah I wish that we could shoot that show still because you wouldn't let you they won't know everybody the hard things now yeah everybody thinks that they guys Dory's right a secret yeah like there's a story that uh Klitschko knocked out Deonte and training like someone Dylan why always talk about that recently you know and I don't make much of that because I think it's unfair I am one of these guys like yeah what happens in the gym stays here I'm in there with a camera and it's a setup thing well then okay we know what's going on right but the point of spawn is that you're working on shit right you're trying things you're like you know you have weaknesses you're gonna like lean on try news you know you're opening up your game you're opening up and you're trusting the guy that you're sparring with to help you work on those things and can like catch you if you're slipping yeah so then if the guy catches you when you're slipping then a month later a year I caught that motherfucker slipper so yeah trust paying you to do mainly we talked about I flew you in I try not to make much of that you know what's the craziest story in boxing the years Eros Prinze jr. surviving that fucking Ferrari crash that's the craziest story of the year when you see that car flip like that and the fact that he got out I was like a chipped tooth I mean that's bonkers thank God he didn't have a seatbelt on I never say that thank God he didn't have a fucking seat belt on because if he did there's no way he would be dead probably or fucking severely injured you know yeah yeah and you know I was in Chicago and was the Lucic fight that that week wouldn't that happen and it was one of those things where it reminded me when I first heard the news of Paul Williams yes and you realize like yo yeah these guys are warriors they put their life on the line like people died in the ring and all that shit but there's also real life too like there's a whole other life with all its dangers and all the other ways that people can meet tragedy and the hurdles you have to overcome and that's the point to put to you almost want to keep them sheltered in a box between fights so that nothing happens nothing can taint what's going to happen in the ring but these guys are just like everybody else to that degree Lake Shore you know I mean he's rich he's you know in this town where he grew up and one night you make a bad decision changes everything yeah and so now until we see him in the ring again we don't know how that affects him you just can't you can't know if we'll ever see the arrow spins that we saw before hopefully we do and better how badly was he injured from what I understood and I follow this very closely not badly at all like you're not wrong like he from what I understand he had issues like teeth being knocked out lacerations on his face no broken bones no concussion no can come here I don't know no Kelly had no concussion we had no serious brain injury he had no permanent injury whatsoever that's crazy but the mental side of it is that to each individual to handle to be faced with death like that right at that age like it's whatever the moment was when you were flying through the air not knowing if you're going to live right you don't know how people you don't know how people adjust to that it's so bad because him and Crawford god damn what a fight that would be yeah god damn that is the fight it's almost like our wish loma chenko was taller you know what she was a bigger fighter you know like cuz lomachenko versus Crawford was really the fight that I would want to see cuz those I mean I believe arrow Spence jr. is right there with them he's phenomenal fighter particularly what he did with Garcia but Loma chenko and turns Crawford to two masters when I look at them in terms of what they do to their opponents they're the two no match anchor with that crazy movement in footwork it's but Terence Crawford just figures people out he finds a way he switches stances he'll start out southpaw or started out Orthodox and they'll switch up on you start box and you know he puts all the data into that computer and then starts finding your weaknesses and then he gets nasty with you and I love the I mean one things I like about him is how fucking Meany is you know there's another guy who's like a sweetheart a nice really I'm in here right I mean he was great he was a great podcast guest but once he starts putting it on dudes man there's like a meanness to him you know it's like you see he relishes in it when the dudes go down he gets a kick out of it yeah yeah yeah there's that killer instinct oh but these rights there's no replacement for them you can see Terrance in a great fight you can see Aloma drink on a great fight space a great fight but if they're not fighting each other right we just won't know because once you get to an elite level everybody's so good you can't say you know how this is gonna turn on it right right it's so low mashenka was too small I mean I don't think he's ever gonna fight Terrance I mean there was a time when the Mikey Garcia fight could have happened with Loma chenko I I don't think he should ever fight a 40 or a but I mean he'd say that same well when you see what Mikey Garcia would happen to him when he went up again arrow Spence go go Errol's is way bigger and stronger and better yeah he's just 247 pound of vision yeah and he's jacked arrow Spence is just jacked at 47 like ripped and shredded and at the weigh-in when I looked at two miles like wow that's a does a difference right little difference there again by the time Fight Night is fight nights are right away Errol's yeah arrows even bigger I think him and hopefully he's okay hopefully he's okay and he said he's getting back to the gym and getting back after it him and Terrence is still fight that is the fighters gotta happen it's got out and no neither one of them fighting anybody else will tell us more about what's gonna happen when they fight each other arrow Spence is back in training right he's training yes yeah and has been for a while that's what the reports say so are they trying to make something happen soon to does they're an idea of like I believe I think he's thinking like may like really that's again you know talk and he's the kind of guy that's gonna want to jump right back into the deep water I don't think he's a tune-up fight type of dude no not after Garcia fight I'd like to see that one live that's when I might I might go to see that one live yeah or something or MGM I might fly in to see that one that was that's a very very very interesting fight to me oh oh okay so this morning oh I went and floated uh-huh I have a tank here yeah okay first of all I only did it because you suggested it I was like okay well you're so adamant about how dope it is yeah that I was like see if this guy's on to something a phenomenal experience it's amazing right it's amazing it's therapeutic I'm I felt like I was meditating and then somehow like having a muscle relaxant and relaxing massage at the same time yeah I couldn't tell at some point whether like my eyes were open or closed I try to keep my eyes open instead of like closing with falling asleep but I couldn't tell between daydreaming and like sleep dreaming yeah it's such a crazy experience yeah just be like the pitch black like just like floating mm-hmm bro yeah I love it every why should do this like cuz I'm I'm a guy's guy like you know even with sizes sometimes [Applause] you're in such a macho business right yeah exactly exactly and this is perfect for guys like you know meditating seems a little too late yeah it's great for your muscles to man all that epson salts really good it loosens everything uh Bo's got ya so kudos to you for finding that that's awesome I'm glad I'm really excited I try to tell more people about it you know there's did you go to the float lab which place did you go - I went to just float where's that a Pasadena that's the biggest place in the world apparently is it yes people were talking about how they get claustrophobic and it's like a constricted - but this place it's like a spa yeah it's a big room like the tubs big you're not close at all you got your own share your own room and use lab stuff they use all the float lab stuff I'm pretty sure don't think pretty sure float lab my friend crash who runs a foot started and runs the float lab he built my tank and I met him actually when I had an old tank a different tank and the guy there was a friend of mine who was a tank repair guy he was doing repair on my tank and I said you know these tanks are good but there's a guy in Venice that makes the best tanks ever he's like a mad scientist he's you should talk to him like you know you have some money get a better tank really it's like yeah get a better tank here so I contacted this dude I went to see his shit and I was like I mean he makes them they look like built-in they like walk-in freezers like - seven feet tall it's nine feet long it's huge they're giant I mean it's gonna pick fucking heavy door and shits fully insulated yeah he's got like commercial water filtration system filters so like you use that like for a towns water supply it's a ridiculous they see the equipment back there it's fucking bomb often do you do it I have been slacking I haven't been in it lately I haven't been in over a month but that's just because the last month I've been so fucking busy but I'm actually planning on getting in there and tomorrow I'm excited see alright so it lands you are a man of many hats right obviously you do so many things but is there an overriding passion like I only have like the one thing like you ask me like I do other stuff whatever yeah on the margins but this boxing this world is my world right everything else is just should I do in between hmm is it what is one of the things you do like really who you are if you had to get rid of everything else what's the one thing you gotta keep I don't think I'd get rid of stand-up if I had to choose one thing I would keep doing stand-up because probably the most challenging podcasts are probably the easiest but they're challenging too depending upon the guest especially if it's like a really intricate subject or this you know it's about physics or history or something where I have to do some reading and really try to keep up with it but podcasts are fun because I like talking to people so it's to me it's like the easiest job because I've always loved conversations I've always loved like tell me how you do that what are you thinking when you're doing that like what's going on like I'm always trying to figure out my own mind like what are my own motivations and how do I get better at things how do I get better at being a person and one of the best ways is to talk to people that are exceptional and try to figure out like how are you doing that like what what is your approach how do you prepare what's your thought process you know what are you eating how you sleep and that kind of stuff so to me it comes I've always been curious so it almost comes natural and then I've been doing it so long it's even though it doesn't seem like it should be conversation does become a skill it's something you get better at not being annoying you get better at not talking over people you get better at you know formulating sentences and being inquisitive the UFC is just a massive passion of mine from you know the time I've been a martial artist for as long as I can remember so for me and like dedicated from the time I was fifteen on-like dedicated like my whole life I didn't do any partying in high school all I did was fight all I did was compete travel all over the country and compete and Taekwondo tournaments that was my whole life so my mum my life has been deeply enriched by martial arts so then when the UFC came around and I realized like oh this is the future this is what martial arts really should be they should this is the stuff that really works so we didn't really know before that for the UFC came along there's all speculation what's better is judo better he's boxing better is wrestling better and then when you see them go after you like oh it's a combination of things and everybody has their own unique way of implementing this combination of things you know and then you get to the highest levels of the game and you find some constant variables but something I mean things change and the sports ever-evolving and shifting and the the new guys now in 2020 are so much better than the guys in 2010 and way better than the guys in 2000 and way better than the guys in 1993 when the first UFC was held so for me that is like a hobby I would I would have to say or just a thing that is a constant part of my life but that's one of the easiest jobs because all I have to do is be interested in it and I'm already interested in it so I'm already watching fights and then before the fights I'll rewatch like certain important championship fights and I'll rewatch fights where fighters had difficulty and stuff like that but I do that because I love it you know I might do that anyway even if it wasn't my job so by the time I get to like a John Jones Dominic grey is fight like this past weekend I've watched hours of footage of those guys just that week just because I'm interested I'll just keep watching stuff and I cheat keep watching difficult fights and easy fights and dominant fights and I watch training footage but that's like I probably do that anyway if I have the time like if I'm sitting in my computer and yeah you know I don't have shit to do i watch the training footage I watch a countdown show I'll watch I want to see what's going on I'm excited for the fight so I'll get pumped I'll do that for this Wilder fury fight I'm gonna I'm gonna watch all kinds of shit I want to hear them talk I want to see the training I want to see them running and hitting the bag I'm gonna see all that stuff yeah see I'm the same in that everything I do somehow informs that single passion I have like talking to fighters looking into a fight and figuring out what the narrative really is how many things hang in the balance not just a championship belt or somebody's bragging rights but all the things that they bring to it personally and the thing there were communities that they represent and all the things that are on the line down the line I get like caught up in that shit but when I'm working out in my mind I'm in the gym like when I'm hitting the bag when I'm sparring other guys even conversations can be spying sessions I gotta be prepared for that kind of back and forth and I use that information I collect about myself and how to react and respond to other people in a boxing gym yeah so I asked this because my other thing as a as a hobby or like a fascination something I would never do is I'm a huge stand-up fan I'm a huge Santa fan I will watch like stand-up comedy I like guys I've never heard of I go to the club's all this stuff how much does the judo the martial arts the discipline inform the crafts on the stage for you I think all three things work together in some strange way they all work together like they all like doing live stand-up makes doing podcasts easier because live stand-up is you're you you need a reaction there's so much preparation involved is writing there's thinking about subjects there's listening to recordings just going over them there's multiple reps you have to do like I'm doing two sets tonight I'll do two sets tomorrow I got one on Thursday to Friday to Saturday and that this is a normal week that's normal you have to do those reps if you don't do those reps you won't be sharp you have to be sharp if you want to do shows especially now I'm doing arenas like a lot of these arenas it's a lot of fucking people man you have to you got to be ready you can't be um I'm pretty ready you've got to be ready right so that is like there's a lot of discipline involved in that and then the podcast expands my my perspective I talk just being able to talk to people and see the way people think just talking to you about your experience with Deontay Wilder the way that you framed that in an incredibly positive way that it helped you and helped everybody there's a lot of people that would have been tortured by that moment and it would have fucked them up but you became empowered by it and you looked at it as a growing learning opportunity but also an opportunity for the growth of like you as a broadcaster for the fight for everything and then it becomes it's quite crazy meme it was ultimately only positive although in the moment you know you're tied up and nots reading the comments like fucking mad at me these people are battery snoops mad at me this this whole thing that they'd all work together you know and then the UFC being able to have the honor of calling these fights live with the greatest fighters in the world and being able to put words to their performance and and and and give a description of the of the heart and the courage and the skill that these guys exhibit and the discipline involved in getting to this state as a mixed martial artist like how what an epic commitment you have to have to excellence to become Jon Jones right to become you know Henry cejudo or fill in the blank you have to use us it's a special type of human so I think when you're around those special types of humans you have a higher appreciation for excellence you have a higher appreciation for discipline and I think just seeing what they do and watching it manifest itself in real life a conor mcgregor or you know or a max Holloway or Alex Vulcan off ski all these different killers that I've had this opportunity to call their fights it makes me appreciate excellence and that's why to get pissed off when someone dismisses that of excellence with a stick yes yes yes oh well I also think you know it has to be your thing you know you can't you can't bullshit you can't just go buy some stats that you read online or that a producer gives you you you have to understand the complexities because if you don't people will know it's like you try to talk shit to someone in French and you only know 20 words you can see those 20 words good but then someone goes oh oui oui and then they start busting out other words you don't know oh no got myself in a quagmire that's it that's what it's like if you're talking shit about MMA if you don't really understand the sport you know I've been involved in the sport in one way or another professionally since 1997 you know that's when I first started working for the UFC so it's been it's a long fucking time man you know that's a long fucking time I keep hearing rumors that Dana White is going to become a boxing promoter I've heard for like five years he has yeah they are yeah they're working on some shit I can't really tell you much but they're definitely working on some shit yeah they they put together the Conor McGregor and Floyd made with a junior fight of course with tme with Floyd's company today ope rather what is it called emotions yeah TMT team the money that's what his promotion team is called right TMT Mayweather promotions crew yeah so he and they did this sort of Co promotion for that big fight and then they're working on some other thing with Floyd where Floyd wants to get involved with them to promote something else it might involved MMA fighters might involve boxers and they've actively talked to a bunch of other boxers and they're trying to put some stuff together but yeah they Zuffa boxing is a real thing they want to the UFC wants to put together some boxing matches and maybe even some crossover fight I just wonder how that works because the the UFC model just won't exists in the boxing world like you can't you won't have enough control you don't have to you just have to schedule a couple big fights I mean they're not going to do it like they do the UFC they do a fight like the UFC literally is a fight every week yeah right now like for the next five weeks there's a fight every weekend and people are hitting pay-per-view dollars well it's the SPM Plus or ESPN and sometimes paper I thought the ESP because I have ESPN plus I was like oh great should I get to watch these UFC fights for like $5.99 a month no yeah no no still it's totally 65 bucks yeah it on my TV this morning I watched again when I was lifting this morning and I had to pay 65 bucks you know but it's um it's a weird thing right like you can't really do it where it's just $5.99 don't have pay-per-view because then the big fights won't be big fights you know they want how does a design have it do you have to pay oh no you don't that's their whole thing Oh Tyson Fury and Deonte that's gonna be on the zone no no Tyson Fury and Deonte I think is a simulcast between Fox if simulcast is the right word and ESP in other words gonna have their own separate paper views you can watch whichever production you like which is gonna be something like yeah you know nice the commentators see then it becomes the commentators it depends and where you tuned in if you go to ears being you'll hear they're people they got their own everybody of their own broadcast I don't they use Max Kellerman I am so confused I loved his boxing commentary and he doesn't comment on live fights anymore I think that's got to be his own choice I mean I can't imagine that they don't want coffee fuck why he not want to do that he was so good at it i Dre ward is also one of my favorite guys he's yeah I love Andre Ward for a bunch of reasons but one for the fact that that guy undefeated gold medalist two-division world champion guys you know what walked away yes walked away and I sense that he will stay away oh yeah he's gonna stay away you know they talked him about the Canelo after Canelo knocked out kovalev and he made a dislodgement about that he's better off for boxing even for boxing outside of fighting you know he knows like he's so smart man he's so smart and so disciplined he's just so disciplined he knows like there's no reason there's no reason to come back this is the right way to do it this there's big money in coming back but there's also big brain damage their ego mm-hmm after you retire is the biggest fight of your life like you're exactly right these guys are defeated I'm sure if you're a talked to off-camera like be Canelo you know of course he must think that just because of who he is you've got to think that so to stop yourself from the money the glory one more time the possibility could you imagine coming out of retirement and beating like to know I've never s to be able to like you know what it's better for me and it's better for boxing if I stay retired and keep sitting ringside and talk about these fights the way I do at the kind of character he's a special person but also he also has this issue with his right shoulder you know his right shoulder was basically broken most of his career and he got it fixed before the second covilhã fight and he actually wound up hurting kovalev real bad with a right hand which he if you watch his career he was like a left-handed fighter from the majority of us his supraspinatus was like ripped off like it was really fucked up and he tried to rehab it with bands instead of going through surgery when he was young and so most of his career he beat the best fighters in the world called Froch all those guys one-handed which is even more insane even more insane and then you know had the surgery rehab did but he said still not hundred percent it's never gonna be on our side right which is why people are afraid of surgeries like you know I'd rather do the band's everything then take the chance that it's better than it was before I think before you have like 40% use of his shoulder which is crazy yeah beating the bay he said it he never felt like he could throw a good punch II always felt he was gonna blow out on him she's nuts yeah fucked everybody up with one hand pelagic oh yeah he's definitely a legend but I mean maybe an underappreciated underappreciated legend you know in the terms of mainstream boxing viewpoint I don't think the mainstream public really appreciates how great he was no and the way it is time or after it will take like people reflecting on history I think unfortunately for him his kids and their kids might get the benefit of who their dad or grandfather was more so than he's getting it now yeah well there's certain great fighters that for whatever reason they never really captured the public's imagination even though they were great you know like Marlin Starling who's a fantastic welterweight knocked out mark Breeland who is actually now Deontay Wilder strainer yeah but I remember when Mark Brillion was coming from the Olympics and you know he was this really long tall welterweight and he fought Starling and Starling wasn't really wasn't appreciated enough and Starling you know strongly put it on them and you realize that there's there's guys out there that for whatever reason people don't appreciate them as much as they should yeah it timings everything and also you got a catch it's unfortunate but you as much as we hate just guys putting on an act or like hyping themselves up or these characters they create yeah that is bankable I mean yes all no guys who don't deserve the shots that they continue to get but because they bring an audience with their shit-talking or let their antics and all the the show that they put on it's better than the fight ya know who's the most confusing to me is Julio Cesar Chavez Jr no he's confusing to me like that last fight I'm like what are you doing like you saying like I think I head-butted me my nose is broken I'm quitting right I was like what are you doing do you not understand you're Mexican like those are the hardest motherfuckers on earth when it comes to boxing you're not just Mexican you are the sharpness of the man like he he won something like 31 world title fights some insane number he's has the record of world title wins which is also like an unattainable goal right now if you decide to go into boxing in your there is Julio Cesar Chavez dude one of the goats what do you hope far can you hope to get in legacy like I almost feel bad for the guy like because there's got to be so much going on in his head right to put him towards that but yet he's talented he's fucking he's a good fighter he like his skills his ability to put hands on people are very good but I think also there's something about growing up wealthy it's just almost impossible like you kind of have to have some part of your life that was fucked up and you didn't think it was gonna work out where well you didn't think it was there was a future and there's a burn that never goes out there's like a little fire that never goes out ease is a greater challenge than adversity yes it is man there's something about comfort that just makes bitches out of people it just does it's so hard to overcome that you can't you can't even forcibly remove yourself from that comfort it's very few human beings are able to really achieve greatness when they grow up with with great wealth and privilege is something about that that life of leisure and and and knowing that everything's gonna be okay you know like your dad made 50 million dollars you're gonna be fine you know there's something about that that's just for whatever reason it just haunts the haunts people yeah I mean he would almost have to have there be something burning brightly inside him almost like a resentment for his father unfortunately I don't think love could propel you right like even come anywhere near his legacy but you definitely have to hate the guy just to be like fire burning bright enough to attain anything close to what he did and I feel bad for his dad too you know dad watching him quit but you know you gotta use a loving father man it's not the first time he's been embarrassed like he keeps coming back like alright this is the one this is the time one more the Canelo fight was a rough one too okay now outclassed him you know Cannell was just just a better fighter it sure is not a quitter like at least like this last time yeah he may have had a point like maybe was like head but maybe the elbows but quitting and boxing obviously is the cardinal Saint mustn't have fucked up it wasn't his nose was pouring blood and he couldn't breathe out of it anymore and it was from a blatant foul like he looked okay right yeah maybe there's something going on that we couldn't see but he looked okay and then he was you know took videos from the hospital the next day with tape on his nose and like what is it what else is exciting for you on the horizon boxing wise what are you looking at I'm anticipating and eagerly awaiting the return of Manny Pacquiao hmm listen we can't not talk about Pacquiao when we talk about the Walter White division because I mean because he's 40 and he's not in the news all the time he's not at press converse and we don't only always talk about him when he's got a site fight a fight sign that sometimes in these conversations we forget yo he's a world title holder he just dominated a guy that there's no way at his age he should have been able to dominate considering who Keith Thurman was two years prior before his surgery Pacquiao could ruin everybody shit like but what do you think about do you think that he would ever step up and fight Terence Crawford at this stage of his career I don't think that fight happens for multiple reasons I wouldn't suggest it if I was in his camp also I don't think that any more than they want to make the spins Crawford fight do they want to put Pacquiao in that kind of harm's weight and give top ranking is being an opportunity to dethrone him like you know he's whipped be Haman camp now it's the same with Spence so that is going to protect him that he's not gonna have to say whether or not he really wants a fight but you can get it Manny Pacquiao inks deal with paradigm Sports Management who represent Conor McGregor oh Jesus that's probably what they're gonna do Manny Pacquiao yeah no thanks that's probably what the UFC wants to try to do is well that the fake you talking arounds like well just got posted a half hour ago oh shit while we're talking oh shit I gotta tell you I am if that's the thing all that anticipation and eagerly awaiting shit just flew out the way well here it is an opportunity for Manny Pacquiao to make a fuckload of money I mean that's how I look at it I look at it for many to make a hundred million bucks but you'd have to sell the public I mean they already watch mayweather box circles around them hey they're gonna sell it of course is gonna that's why it's gonna be a hundred be imitated by every single every single brown penny that's spent on that foot is going to be my nemesis you know what you're really gonna be irritated by the people to think that Conner has a chance what if what if they give him six months what if what if he has some what if he fights Paulie Malignaggi first what I would pay for Manny Pacquiao vs. either arrow Spence or Crawford I would pay for either one of those fights I would like that we're like that's what I would like to see I think wow man he's 40 I mean after the Keith Thurman fight he has shown that he's still like a legit world beater you know and Terence Crawford is the cream of the crop in my opinion I want to see that you know would be more exciting exciting than both of those fights Shawn Porter oh that's good fight ooh Manny Pacquiao vs. on Porter would be a hell of a night of box very good fight - very good fight - yeah yeah I don't believe listen I believe in world champions all there's way too many of them in every weight division this fucking like o night undefeated fighters are the only ones that are worth talking about I bet so if there's one thing I love about the UFC and MMA culture period is that losing a fight doesn't mean losing your whole fucking brand like right if you go out there comport yourself well leave it all in the Octagon you live to fight another day and people still respect the effort you put for it like they recognize that if you're fighting guys at your level you'll win some and you lose some and hopefully you win more than you lose and that's how you yeah become the man but not but losing some doesn't make you a bitch does it make you like a bum well I think Manny's kind of proven that I mean remember when Juan Manuel Marquez put him in a orbit yeah just put it in an orbit around Jupiter took him four times to do it but I'll tell you what I said it on the night too by the way that is the most electric boxing atmosphere I've ever been a part of it never clarifies my entire adult life they knew when they were singing that anthem the Mexicans were singing they're like the Mexican anthem before the fight and I was sitting there with a friend of mine also a fellow journalist Sean's Attell and we were sitting up in the rafters where he was sitting in the press row we were sitting like we I didn't want to be bothered with all the the yammering that goes on in the press row so I found seats like up above the ring and when they were singing that anthem we look at each other like Oh something is about to happen here we knew it was a special night and bro when he knocked out Manny Pacquiao he should a crowd surfed right yeah and he never fought him again that's what's really interesting I thought had another one you should never fought anybody again it's never gonna get ever better than that night in that moment yeah but he still always have that forever and there's something about especially Latino fighters it's like they almost kind of have to keep going like all the greats kept going all the greats Chavez kept going way past he should have you know and then you know I mean so so many of them just keep going they did Roberto Duran you know kept going forever you know it's I mean it's an addiction it's a lifestyle and if you still believe you can do it like I'm still better than most of those guys why not keep doing one more W who doesn't want one more w hmm yeah hmm yeah so I decided to pick a career in a little bit more longevity no no physical downside exactly right everybody right another grave that's the thing about what you're doing you you get to see the real consequences that some of these guys face yeah it is not it's it is a dark thing to see a fight where you see a guy get beaten down and the referee stops the fight and they see him slump into the corner and collapse you know and I've seen that only on television I haven't seen that live when the stretcher comes out yeah you not I mean it's because sometimes the knockout doesn't look that vicious like if it's a knockout but you're not Souza guy goes down you're not gasping yeah the guy's not moving right that's not responding well you remember the Gerald McClellan fight he took a knee and then people weren't questioning him you know and then he slumped and collapsed in his corner yeah it's uh I mean it's the most combat sports are the most brutal of all contests I mean these footballs probably next you know but out of the the difference is with combat sports is a guy doing it to you and you're trying to do it to him I mean it's the only thing that's happening there there's not a ball going across a line right there's only a guy trying to fuck you up and you're trying to fuck him up right and the lack of protective equipment yeah it's part of yeah right you're in your underwear yeah basically in your underwear with shoes on in an MMA you don't even have shoes on correct yeah and your fingertips are showing me it's fucking you're about as naked as you can get legally and compete in something I mean thank God obviously but I am surprised that there hasn't been more serious injury in MMA I don't know if that's just because of how long we've been paying attention or I don't know how you know I think it's good refereeing you know mmm a has some pretty exceptional referees that are very aware of the dangers of guys taking extra shots there's also a thing where they don't get a chance to recover like they do in boxing where a guy gets knocked down and then they give them an eight count there's none of that shit when you get knocked down in MMA if the referee thinks it's over they just wave it off because there's too many weapons right your elbow on people in the face you're kicking them just like if they think you're done you're done you know they don't give you that chance the standing eight counts the you know they don't they don't that 10 count there's something about that 10 count it's great because it makes for moments like Tyson Fury rising off the deck to win the rest around with Deontay Wilder in that 12th but it also it gives you a brain a false sense of recovery like you're fucked man you really probably shouldn't be going on and MMA you really don't get a chance to go on when they stop it they stop it if the referees in front of you the fights over when I first started watching MMA there was no UFC right I had like the bootleg box in my room and we get the fuzzy Channel and you won't get their fucking arms broken and shit and butted between you and I just okay once when did you like better if you like like the first iteration of no and no much everything no I like skills better now the guys are way more skillful and that's what's interesting to me what's what's interesting to me more than anything is the growth of the understanding of what works and what doesn't work like of skill of technique that's the most important thing to me guys like Mighty Mouse he was one of my favorite fighters to watch because he would fuck people up and not even get hit he'd be moving on people in ways they didn't didn't even know what was happening until he was doing it it was too late he'd already hit you he was moving these different angles he catches people with arm bars he'd fuck you up with knees in the clinch he was like in my opinion the greatest expression of mixed martial arts talent and because he was like so next level in terms of like his ability to implement his strategy on you and you couldn't do shit to him but he didn't get a chance to fight the level of talent as a guy like John Jones John Jones is fascinating to me because he's been able to stay on top for almost a fucking decade only fighting world-class top of the food chain world championship caliber fighters which is just amazing like no one's been able to do that John's undefeated he has one loss by disqualification it's a bullshit loss that was from a bullshit rule where you're not supposed to elbow like this elbow from 12 to 6 it's supposed to come down in an angle which makes no sense and I've described it too many times to go into details why it's an ignorant rule it shouldn't exist but he beats the fuck out of Matt Hamill winning that fight there was no way Matt Hamill was winning that fight John dominated him so John's undefeated and he's been undefeated youngest ever world champion 23 years old won the World Championship in the UFC and is dominated ever since I mean that's that's insane that to me is one of the most impressive things in all of sports watching that guy achieve a record that might never be achieved again if the the thing about boxing that has my imagination and my fascination continually sparked is the the finite nature of the tools and the weapons that you have to use yeah right hmm I respect and appreciate MMA but it's almost like the antithesis of that and that they have so many things they can use and whatnot it's it's an entirely different discipline yeah but you're coming from a martial arts background so I grew up on comfortable movies right and so when I started watching this shit these guys were in G's they were like you know I say like it's the Gracie's breaking arms well not that made sense to me and I understood why a boxer wouldn't fight a karate man or a judo guy whatever because that's what the science is for me like what you can do with these two hands and I'm there two feet of the only way you can evade and all of that but why can't the karate man why is it there like a Bruce Lee of MMA as a martial art where some martial artists can you still believe in like one discipline after all this MMA is proven it doesn't work there's no real one discipline that will work best in MMA you have to know everything but if I was gonna say what disciplines the most important I would say wrestling because if you can't keep a guy from taking you down he's gonna be on top of you he's gonna hold you down he's gonna punch you in the face it's a giant advantage to be able to hold a guy down and be able to punch his face in and you can't really do much when guys on top of you that said from there you have to understand jujitsu because if you don't you could hold a guy down then all sudden he wraps his legs around your neck and you caught a triangle and you go to sleep and every fight starts standing so you have to have some understanding of striking because you have to be able to close the distance but there's no one way to do it that's what's interesting to me it's like there's Anderson Silva's way to do it it was the greatest middleweight of all time and his way to do it was through striking he would just stay up with guys and just fuck them up with timing and precision and Muay Thai but then there's guys like Daniel Cormier who take guys down and beat the fuck out of them choke them you know and and there's a bunch of different people that with a bunch of different styles in between but if you look at the majority of world champions the majority except maybe a couple weight classes they're dominated by wrestlers hmm yeah there's a lot of pictures on the internet by the way of me with Anderson Silva's tag this is you're innocent so you don't look anything like anis is you wouldn't believe how many people stop me especially if I'm in like Vegas when there's a UFC event you're Anderson's oh that's ridiculous you don't look like an arson sumo man I'm telling you I don't think so either but I'm telling you I get it a lot well people yeah people are weird I mean dressed up for him like as him is hot on Halloween and went over like gangbusters did you wear the Bruce Lee outfit would you tank well listen man I'm glad we had this conversation it was a lot of fun I was brilliant by the way I hope at some point every single thirty million people that watch your shit get a chance to stop by the studio personally this is the dopest studio Thank You VIN in you must live it I would just live here Oh what is going on but like everything in here feels like the dude I'm talking to and so kudos
