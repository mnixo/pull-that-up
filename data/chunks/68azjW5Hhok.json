four three two one dude first of all what possessed you to want to swim around the entire UK how many thousands of miles is that yeah two thousand miles altogether do you and miles of swimming yeah yeah it seemed like a good idea at the time and then halfway around I realized how big Great Britain was but you you've done some long swims before but not like nothing even remotely like what's the longest swim you did before this yeah I did this is a bit of a strange story I did I tried to swim between st. Lucia and Martinique to Caribbean islands it's only 40 kilometers from point to point and for charity I was trying to swim from point to point with it with a hundred pound tree attached to my trunks so I was put in the hundred pound tree six foot waves crashing down and I actually didn't make it from point to point I was like five kilometres from the end and when I didn't make it I decided to swim back the other way so I ended up swimming over a hundred kilometres with a hundred pound tree took me thirty two hours but still didn't make it so so what went wrong where you didn't make it tides currents you know and I know you just got swept away yeah yeah and socially attached to a tree right cuz it was this tree it's 100 pounds but it I mean it floats but it was more of the drag right so if there's any influence from tides or currents and it's pulling you in one direction I mean I was basically gonna miss Martinique so I don't know I was heading to Cuba you know somewhere like that and then on the way back down you know a they turned to me again and they said like you're gonna miss st. Lucia you're gonna end up in I don't know whatever's further south than st. Lucia and I think I realized is as physically fit as you are and the ocean just just doesn't care you know it doesn't care and so after that this was last year this was November last year kind of felt I had unfinished business with with the ocean and came but came back to England run up friends of mine at the ruins I said guys look this is gonna sound so strange I said but I just I need to get out my system I just need to see how far I can swim in 48 hours so I swam for 40 hours but it wasn't yet 160 kilometers something something like that and I finished and I had basically trench foot so where your your your feet and your hands are so kind of I've got so much watering that's always going moldy yeah so I had 21 I'm sort of sitting there nursing nursing my feet and one of the one of the offices a good friend of mine and they came over and they just said they were real English Romer and they said you boy and I said yes and they said huh what are you training for I said oh I'm training for potentially attempting the world's longest current neutral swim and then just pause then he sits his cup of tea and he looked me up and down he just goes that just sounds a bit lame that's like okay what what do you want me to do any pauses and he says you just need to man up you need to man up and swim around Great Britain I was like whoa I can't cause I couldn't say no one said watch you swim with me bitch somebody asking you to do you know so I said fine once the ideas stuck with me I mean you know that we've got this real history and heritage of a British eccentric explorers hmm and for me growing up there's a story of Captain Webb so the first guy to swim across the English Channel and for those who don't know English Channel you know the tides they believed were too strong the water was too cold they said you just can't make it across the English now it's impossible the captain Webb refused to listen and 1875 August across the English Channel and this is the part I love on a diet of beef broth and brandy in a woollen wetsuit he swam I think it's 23 hours breaststroke with his head out of the water because and I quote front crawl was ungentlemanly like and there was that element that I just thought that's amazing front crop what is the front cross so basically that's front the regular one yeah but way back in 1875 was like know that he said I was ungentlemanly yes of the movements at sur themselves yeah it was still being developed as whereas you know if you were a gentleman and you were a swimmer you swim breaststroke you know Wow exactly head out of the water the whole time the whole way 23 hours and again like the the support boat was saying you know get out you know you're not gonna make you not gonna make it and he just refused and 23 hours so you know that's part of a night swim as well head out the water just all the way why brandy she's getting fucked up or just a little bit of brandy you know I don't know maybe might even a bit of Dutch courage but I think there was you know certainly back then sports nutrition isn't what it is today Brian so I think there was an element he was even like lubing himself up being in goose fat you know this is way back make himself slicker slicker and I think there was an element of warmth for that was the certainly in the leaf right so it is the Tour de France guys didn't they drink wine that was like a big thing back in the day way back yeah I mean it wasn't too long ago I mean general just was just talking now about football back in England and it wasn't till you know two longer maybe a hundred years ago they used to just keep brandy in the dressing room in case you needed to warm yourself up real and out yeah wow so they play soccer drunk Wow and I think you know people don't understand that it's taken you know people like Captain web maybe me to a smaller extent to just raise the bar push the boundaries and and you know you've seen that I think our generation have seen that with the UFC with mixed martial arts that has evolved so fast I'm always remember Forrest Griffin used to kind of a liking himself to the basketball players just shooting three-pointers with the ball between the legs you know and that always resonated with me because I was like yeah the the evolution that we've seen and what sort of Bruce Lee had the the foresight to predict is amazing and I think you know in a much much much smaller way again to go back to sort of British athletes and adventurers Roger Bannister in it first night is wonderful four-minute mile right and people said couldn't be done and he was a medical student at the time leading physician said he can't do it your lungs will explode your legs will fall off all sorts but no he says you know Oxford laced up his trainers and and ran a four-minute mile similar right now to what I think we're seeing with Kip Choji you know and the two hour marathon and so that's why in again in a much much smaller way when I had that conversation about swimming around Great Britain everybody said you can't be done yes it's 2,000 miles but there's giant whirlpools in Scotland called the quarry of eken Penland Firth renowned around the world if you get that wrong you're disappearing backwards at ten knots you there's no way you're swimming against that and and 10 knots that's a dolphin speed yes it is ten knots in miles per hour a base of 10 miles per hour oh my god 10 miles per hour backwards as you're trying to go forwards basically yeah penning for the top of Scotland the currents that go across there so it's running in a good clip but yo yeah records yeah I mean we got it good we we managed to basically predict it so well that III think that was probably my top speed which I dare eight point seven knots eight point seven miles per hour I was basically cruising along the top which is how which is like a dolphin you know you were having the waves behind you pushing you almost and see now that's what's interesting because I had the tides and currents with me not necessarily the way yeah and when you get but but actually you made a good point in terms of when you get wind over tide so if you've got ten knots going this way but you even got a little bit of wind and waves going this way it can get choppy okay and and again sort of looking at west Scotland wind over tide you can get 40 knots coming straight down the barrel but you're trying to swim with the tide yeah so the wind is coming at you but the tide is going the opposite and as you can imagine that oh my god yeah yeah so how do you predict this this this tide that you have to get right yeah I mean it's it's incompletely in theory and this is what I realize we're not when I sat down and we started sort of plotting the great what is this called again what is the the issue that'll push you back oh just the tidal yes what is it called that area oh you say you gotta get right oh it's at Penn and Firth pending for the Penland handling for ya yeah and that's that likes it renowned around world but but equally if you imagine the shape of Great Britain there's all sorts of kind of compression where the water will just come rush through and as well as the pennilyn fur you can get you know six knots around Wales there's an island called scoler and if you get that right you are disappearing up you know and you're winning you get it wrong again you're just you're going backwards and four more for me to do a continuous stage swim if I'm going backwards I've got to start where I was going backwards so for me getting every single tide right and that's why I saw what the team were amazing those are the captain Matt was just incredible that every night the homework we okay here no did we crash alright folks if you're listening or watching we had a little technical difficulty so this is not streaming live will be uploaded later we were just going over how you predicted you had to and your team had to predict how the tide was coming because if it went wrong you'd get pushed backwards like 10 miles an hour yeah basically and this is the thing I think with the Great British swim we were kind of taking swimming as most people understand it and we were we were removing it and putting in in an arena that was so different so and I think that's why it was it did so well kind of online as well the community around it because obviously swimmers were interested but you know surfers started to get involved because they understood the waves sailors fishermen you know all sorts of people started to say you know sometimes in Great Britain it's not safe to take a boat around the top of Scotland you know for instance never mind a swimmer so that's that's why it was amazing that there on the entire series it became a melting pot and exchange of ideas because nobody knew how to get a human body around the coast of Great Britain it wasn't just about swimming and that was what was really cool how do they know like when the tides are going one way or the other how do they predict that yeah I mean tides are so predictable so in theory they change every six hours so in theory when we sat down and we looked we know that if you do six hours on six hours off for 157 days you'll make it around the coast of Great Britain you know and that was the theory so you do this biphasic sleep and you swim for 12 hours a day but that's all theory there's times when as I mentioned whirlpools or or the tides might not necessarily if you imagine sort of that's Great Britain there the tides don't necessarily go always like this are they're not that predictable sometimes if is kind of like this like that's kind of Wales there the tides will do this so you might you're you're doing all these different things that people are not gonna see what say listening to it on audio so just try to just describe it right is they're basically rather than the tides just going up and down and working with you mhmmm sometimes it cross across yes you're just kind of getting slapped across the face one sides essentially and it's not just helping you you're gonna basically zigzag all the way up the coast of Great Britain so as predictable as tides are we found those so much stuff that when we're out there we were like whole it wasn't meant to do that or a giant whirlpool wasn't meant to be there you know but it is and and that was what was you know pretty yeah pretty sketchy at some times you know that when we were out there if a whirlpool just decides to appear you've got there's not really enough time to say hang on that wasn't on the map can we look at that can we speak to the Met Office and talk about you know weather report no you just you I've had to swim through it or try and get out there as quick as you could so when you encounter something like that and you get stuck do you pull out of the water and try back again later at the same location you do but quite often if it was there it's still gonna be there oh it is what it is yeah so sometimes there's there's no option and perhaps the best example of this I mentioned before bit it's called the quarry a vacant so sort of west coast of Scotland and it's a giant whirlpool and and Matt the captain turned to me and said look Ross you know I need you to swim on I need to swim hard you know you need to swim six hours you just need to be clear of this whirlpool so as we were swimming past it I set my watch and some hard for six hours but about three hours in I got stung by a jellyfish and I've been stung by jellyfish a lot before Eustace you know it's painful but it was it was bearable but this one particular jellyfish it just it was searing into my skin it just it wouldn't stop throbbing and so I carried on swimming three hours past and it was just unbearable so I popped my head up and I looked at Matt the captain from the boat I said Matt I'm so sorry I've been stung you know I'm gonna have to stop I've been stung by a jellyfish but the pain just not going away and as I said that to him he looked down I mean he said yeah I know because the tentacles still wrapped around your face so I've basically been swimming for three hours with a jellyfish on your face wearing a jellyfish it wrapped into my goggles so I took my gun peeled this fat tentacle threw it away and they're like that I'll show you in a minute there was a picture where my face sort of changed shape and the goggles wouldn't fit on my face anymore because my eye sockets was so swelled and but I knew that again for all of this happening the quarry of ekend the giant whirlpool was still to my left so Matt was like you still need to swim you still need to swim so I ended up putting the goggles over my face and to try and get them to seal I just punched them into my face so you just had these perfect ring and then I managed you're so swollen yeah so you had to push them through the swelling basically yeah so you swim I made another hour we got clear of the choreo vacance we managed to clear this giant whirlpool i collapse onto the boat and and this is the thing it was at that point that I collapsed exhausted face now a different shape to when I started that particular swim and and the team looked at me and they saw how bad I was how how be an upper was but they also knew that that the sea just doesn't care and in six hours the tide was going to change and I'm gonna have to do that all over again well and it was that kind of brutal lesson from nature that from a sports science background I'm interested in you know rehab rest recovery nutrition strategies all of this but with swimming around Great Britain it very quickly became apparent that the sea just doesn't care it just doesn't care that you need to rehab your shoulders it doesn't care that the ligaments and tendons in your shoulders are hurting you might get impingement from swimming too much you know none of this and that's why it went from swimming as I understood it and how a lot of people understand it to something completely like surviving basically in the water so you're swimming schedule would be six hours on and then you would try to rest when would you eat during the swims or between during the swims yeah yeah so quite often just you know throwing bananas at me and and Wow salty bananas basically yeah yeah just salty but I need to eat them while you're in the water yeah yeah cuz it cuz again going back to what we were talking about with the pendulum first you could get out and you could get on the boat but sometimes in a really good tide if you are just in the water you could be making four knots you don't have to swim but if you get in the freezing cold water of Scotland and you are quite happy getting hit in the face by tentacles you can still make four knots and so that's why so often it became about something different than swimming it was just it was just mental fortitude it was physical fortitude it was basically I always remember actually first day of autumn I got up it was two o'clock so it was a night swim two o'clock in the morning and I left my wetsuit out to dry and I had to scrape just a thin layer of ice off the wetsuit before I preferred it but if I didn't if I didn't get in and I didn't spirit that that way see then that would have been you know 15 miles potentially that we would have missed out on and then you missed those 15 miles that the window of opportunity to swim around Great Britain because of the British summer being notoriously unpredictable and quite short we wouldn't have made it round because even towards the end there was two storms storm a lemon storm Callie Allie and Callum who kind of stopped us for those two days where we couldn't swim because you just couldn't swim in a storm it wasn't safe so when you were swimming this was all during the summer yeah yeah through the autumn and then we finished November the fourth which was going into the winter Oh as well and you started what my June the first so for since June you've been swimming yeah basically that's so crazy yeah that's interesting too you're not built like a guide expect to be doing this right you're built like a tank like that's not normal like you're a big jack guy you look more like an MMA fighter or a powerlifter even right you don't look like an endurance athlete yeah which and we were just we were speaking about it because I love the episode with you in Ct Fletcher I loved I love that and and you know as a big fan of you know cab there you are look at this fucking picture if someone said that guy's gonna swim around that guy's gonna swim for half an hour and he's gonna have fun heart attack you're right there was a lot yeah I'd probably be inclined to agree with you but what I find interesting is when you start looking at the strength and stamina for so often people believe the two couldn't coexist right and Robert Hickson and his is sort of research around concurrent training they're basically saying if you train for strength and stamina you dilute the potency of the stimuli so what I mean by that is if you know we went into the gym just now and you know me you and Jamie walked into the gym and we were like okay okay let's let's go and see what we're doing on in the squat rack you know that's strength your body's ability to generate force and we trained that and then all of a sudden okay now let's go over to the rowing machine or let's go for a swim that's got in swim 10k then all of a sudden our bodies are gonna go well hang on which one do you want us to adapt to you know looking at you know molecular biology which one do you want us to adapt to strength or stamina and again you dilute the potency that stimuli however there's the theory that if you separate them within the laws vert I'm going off on a little bit of a tangent here but please thank you good looking at verkhoshansky so one of the greatest strength and conditioning coaches to every resist he talks about this idea of adaptive energy saying that in any given day you have a certain amount of adaptive energy and if you are able to fit both a training session that that like I said causes your body to adapt to both strength and stamina you separate them under those conditions they can coexist so you separate them by how much time as much is needed for optimal recovery so so yeah if we did and this is that this is what I find fascinating about MMA because you're essentially saying to an MMA athlete I need you to be strong fast quick I need you to be muscular injured but I also need you to have plyometric speed strength and their bodies going you want us to be all of those things right you know and that's why quite often it's the athlete with a higher work capacity who can you know adapt to those looking at like you know the Diaz brothers who just do triathlons for fun you know they have this insane work capacity you know say so that's kind of your your body's ability to perform and positively tolerate training of a given intensity or duration right so if you have the Diaz brothers and you say okay we're gonna now do weight training in the morning but by the afternoon I also need to go swim a 10k their bodies could tolerate that whereas if you have another athlete who perhaps you know doesn't have that work capacity their body's not going to positively tolerate it right a person who's used to working out maybe only an hour a day yeah absolutely so so that's essentially how I would would approach anything like this but what I found really interesting when you're talking with with Ct Fletcher was when you look at strength and stamina it's it's so specific so you know said principle specific adaptation to impose demands you know you get good at whatever you continually practice and when you look at endurance in weight-bearing sports absolutely you know you can argue that that running for instance is is just you know power to weight ratio it's it's a series of successive jumps and when you start looking at that there's research that will show adding and we did this with the raw Marines back in England when you just add one kilo of extra weight in a backpack its effect on pulmonary ventilation lactic threshold time to fatigue all of those things just one one kilogram that's it and so that's why when you see Tour de France and people like Chris Froome Bradley Wiggins you know from Team Sky they are just looking at the body saying okay your vo2 is what it is your power to it your power to weight ratio that's what we need to improve we need to treat you like a Formula One car and we need to take away anything you know so when you look at Chris Froome you know an unbelievable athlete and they say well you don't need biceps you don't need triceps so they will remove those controlled muscular atrophy and how do they approach that intelligently I suppose looking at anything from you know a calorie deficit cell not to pick anything up ever kind yeah there you go you know triceps they don't run away exactly but I mean that is that is the perfect example of you know you know said principle specific adaptation to impose demands that all he does is he lives on a bike so as a result his body is a byproduct of what he continually practices just got a bike muscles yeah yeah and so so looking at that and sorry going back to strengthen stand with it when you look at running you could argue that you know being jacked and being heavier yes absolutely your power to weight ratio is gonna impact you so for instance I like to run but I don't stand a chance against some of my friends who are you know fell runners and they weigh you know thirty kilos less than me how much richer or exactly yeah then lean longer just yeah you look at an unbelievable specimen of a man you go yes you were built for endurance mhm but as soon as you go in the water things might start to change a little because now it's non-weight-bearing see them how to weight ratios a little bit different so then you could art and this is all theory for the moment but looking at the body shape to swim around Great Britain because no one's ever done it before so you can say okay what does that body type look like and when writing down a checklist you say we need someone who can swim in you know 40 knots of wind wind over tide that we're talking about so you're not going to break on top of that as well you can start to look at all of a sudden we need someone who's never gonna take a day off so I wasn't sick throughout those 157 days so there you start looking at adaptive energy and and work capacity that we just spoke about and then all of a sudden you can start getting real into the detail of looking at okay someone with a higher muscle mass if they're able to effectively swim and the biomechanics are on point so that's not you know this muscle mass isn't interfering with their biomechanics could it be argued that that stored muscle glycogen can almost turn them into a human whale you know they're yeah you're right you put me into the pool with Michael Phelps and he lapped me you know he he - look at him swim it's unbeliev he looks like a dolphin it's it's beautiful but when it comes to something like swimming around grouper and it's just it's just an eating competition you know with a little bit of swimming involved and you just need to make sure you don't break and that goes back to the tides as well your body working with ties if you can just keep getting in the water for 157 days 12 hours a day and not break you'll make it wearing great brand base so you think the muscle Mouse aids you in that way I would argue yes yeah I mean enough this is purely anecdotal and I'd love to actual more research into this but but certainly with a lot of athletes that I train with there it's almost like a bell curve so if you can imagine you know for those listening like a bell curve like that how do you describe that just I'm just so like a horseshoe yeah yeah so you can argue that here around endurance so if you've got somebody who's you know to use rich rods example an amazing swimmer that over 10k he's gonna be amazing because his efficiency everything but then past this point so when we start looking at the mileage that we were covering so it sort of English Channel swimmers 20 miles plus a day at this point this leaner swimmers gonna start running out of muscle glycogen his biomechanics might break down because he doesn't have the strength to hold that position continually all of those things the waves start crashing in starting to swim into 40 knots of wind what's gonna happen are you gonna be would you favor the the lean a quicker more streamlined swimmer or would you argue that the guy with more muscle mass here is gonna continue to swim not necessarily at the same pace but would continue not to break I think it depends on who the man with the muscle mass is because a lot of guys with muscle mass they got that muscle mass for doing very low reps high weight I mean what what kind of exercise do you do that gives you a bill like that see and that's a good point I mean I loved what you did with them was dorian yates and i think when you start looking at the the three mechanisms to build muscular hypertrophy start looking at metabolic stress so metabolic stress being exactly what you just said lots and lots of reps during it's been a great example of that that is more muscular hypertrophy the bodybuilding centric work yeah that's metabolic stress lots and lots of reps but then you can also look at mechanical tension so that's more your power lifters you know really really high weight lower volume just real strength your body's ability to generate force that is what I do and yes it's shown to induce muscular hypertrophy so to increase muscle mass but arguably more functional you know than when you'd be looking at a you know bodybuilder mr. Olympia something like that and then you have a muscle damage which is more eccentric contraction some more arguably sort of CrossFit so a bodybuilder to achieve their physique besides using steroids they have to you lots of repetitions yeah is that the idea yeah that's it so so when you say what do do I specifically use it's more mechanical tension so more power lifting cleans dead lifts is exactly yeah yeah cuz you're not bit like a bodybuilder but you you're built like someone was very strong yeah yeah and I think that's it where you start and that's not to say you know when you look it you know to use you as an example so if we had you in the sports lab we would say okay what is your strength deficit so your strength deficit is is I'd say we had you on you know the leg press and we said Joe we want to we want to look at how much force your legs can generate with you just using basically your training strength your training strength is defined as the strength that you would use just leg pressing not getting you all like site of pre workouts smelling salts none of that will just say Joe go and leg press and you just leg press and that's what you can generate there but then in the sports I'd back at local university we would start using basically electric basic using electrical impulses to to make the muscles contract beyond what you could generate yourself so that is what your body could generate without you trying to send those impulses bodies you the actual the actual potential muscle the the strength of the muscles themselves how do you determine that like I said basically electrocuting the muscles and stimulating involuntarily and through that do they measure it how so oh so then that measures your your maximal output with you not trying to use it yourself it's involuntary so that is something that you wouldn't have control over so this what are they how do they do that like essentially electrocuted you but what kind of what is it like electrodes a slap on your legs and they force you to extend your legs yeah you would have seen it yeah exactly that you lift a weight with that yeah you can do yeah so that's what they do yeah yeah I've never heard of such a thing yeah so you would be sitting in a leg press and more the extensions and then make your legs extend yeah yeah Wow so they would monitor your strength so the difference between that so all of a sudden they'll say okay this over here your training strength is what you could do Joe when I was just saying okay lift that right that's what you were going okay I'll lift it and then over here when it's involuntary that is what you could actually do that's the potential of the muscles what's usually the higher number oh absolutely well so it's always involuntary really always yeah yeah absolutely how much what and that's the strength deficit mmm did you see what I mean so okay so over here this is what you could generate when you're just going okay one two three and I'm lifting it myself okay that done and over here is what we do when it's involuntary now if there's a big deficit okay so if there's a huge deficit between the two that means you're a pussy it means if there's a large deficit between the two it means that you have muscle mass but you're not fully using it right so you might see a large deficit between the two if you had a bodybuilder for instance because they've got a lot of muscle mass but they're not using it does that make sense why aren't they using it because it's its strength is functional so they've got all this muscle mass but they're not recruiting it they've not actually trained strengths because strength is near a muscular so when a bodybuilder does like high repetitions and what was the type of load that you were calling that how they were that was causing hypertrophy so that's metabolic stress metabolic stress so just a sheer number of sets yeah just constant repetitions over and over and over again with not that higher weight yes yeah and that's meant but then mechanical tension is when it's more power lifting s right so there's your difference between the two so the reason being is meta but so when you start looking at mechanical tension that might produce an athlete who has a smaller strength deficit right so when again using you as an example if there was a smaller strength deficit between what you could voluntarily leg press in a leg extension hair extension and then involuntary there's a smaller deficit it would like it either liken it to okay do you have this much muscle mass but you're using a lot of your potential you're using it already it's almost like you've got a Formula One car with a huge engine but you're using it to its full extent you know and and this is why I'm going off on a slight tangent here but this is why when you start looking at bodybuilding centric work so this idea of increasing muscular hypertrophy it can be a good thing when you understand that strength deficit so you might have an athlete who you go okay you have a small strength deficit it's very small so for the muscle mass that you have you're using it to its absolute full potential it's like you have a very small car but you are just pushing down the accelerator so hard and it can't go anymore which is a redline exactly so the option that we have is to increase the size of the car the option we have is it increase the size your muscle mass is a means-ends it does yeah it does what kind of training were you doing to increase your capacity for work while maintaining the mass yeah and this this guys it's a bit of a strange story so this goes back to something I almost call you know horsepower programming which i think is it's so often lost now I think training is very specific when you go into the gym are you training for strength speed stamina whereas horseback programming I almost borrowed from Soviet Union principle so you start looking at general physical preparedness as it was as it was known and this is this just idea of you take an athlete certainly younger athlete and you're trying to increase their work capacity by nonspecific movements so you'll get at you're an athlete you're handed a magic okay you're you're young kid just growing up and then your parents hand you to me I'm your coach and I say okay I don't know if Joe's gonna be big strong I don't know if he's gonna be able to run far or fast I don't know so what we're gonna do is just create increase your song your muscular efficiency and work capacity and so by doing that it's kind of jumps throws nonspecific these natural movement patterns and we get you to do lots and lots of this what that's doing is work capacity your body's ability to positively tolerate training and giving some intensity or duration and I think from the great british swim when a lot of people will say how was it that you were able to tolerate those 12 hours a day the jellyfish things and everything it for me one of the biggest things was going back to you and this is gonna sound so odd but I I ran a marathon pulling a car three three years ago I think now and so that is almost the perfect embodiment of horsepower programming in that that sheer stress on the body but it's not a specific skill when you see you were in a marathon behind a car but pulling him up pulling a car in front of a car yeah not behind a car no yes it was then you pulled the car and ran a marathon yeah what the fuck dude yeah you seem so normal that's what's so confusing to me like if I met you there's something about a lot of these endurance people well how I guess I'm not Courtney Courtney door Walter she's so carefree and silly but you're very loose and relaxed I always consider like those people like dark there's some darkness to those extreme endurance athletes yeah there's darkness that there they're running from some darkness you know I mean no I do I've had this conversation with a few people because they said something similar and I think it's seven I mean you know it's a slightly Goffman on another tangent here cuz I think we've covered the physical aspect and work capacity which I've addressed but I think and this is one thing I genuinely just wanted to almost quiz you on and get your thoughts on this is there certainly the throughout the Great British swim it subjected my body to a fatigue like I've never experienced before it was just yes sleep deprivation just ligaments tendons in my shoulders just wondering what's going on and for me you almost develop a split personality in there there's times when I'd quite often say you need to swim with a smile because you know it's 157 days if you're stressed or it's like a marathon where you'd grit your teeth and you try and get through it I think we're very aware that you know the body is this complex biochemical organism and if you're stressed cortisol levels spike inflammation your immune system everything's affected so for me I was treating it not like a marathon I had to treat it swing with a smile you know think this is this is life now right at sea but then equally there were times when you know I wouldn't swim with a smile it was just you know choreo that can being a great example you know I certainly wasn't they're happy then and and for me it's those times when I say you've got to just get feral you really just got it and a good friend of mine you know back in back in England SAS trained and he said to me Ross you're you're a really nice guy and everything but there's gonna be times when you just need to you know no smiles and just get feral which which I thinking about it and because I had 12 hours to think okay I was mulling this over in my head for me it goes back to Tim Noakes central governor theory looking at how fatigue is an emotionally driven state that we use to pull that physiological handbrake so you know for those listening sort of 60 miles into a marathon you might be saying no way I can't keep putting one foot in front the other is no way and then all of a sudden 25 miles in and your family and friends are clapping you and you get that second wind and just sprinting and for me looking at that this sort of central governor theory I found that in complete exhaustion like when when you absolutely have nothing left you almost go into this feral state you know so like a like a like an injured dog and you know where a lot of people will say oh you know remember why you start to think of your family and friends and I was like no no no I was at a level of fatigue where I wasn't thinking about you know family and friends I was thinking almost you know Maslow's hierarchy of needs where it starts with just food shelter oxygen I was at that sort of level where there was see else's I mean my next kind of heal now but you know there was times when chafing on my neck my tongue was falling apart fine now by the way Jay hutong was far apart my tongue is on the salt water yeah yeah and and falling apart how saw it it's what it's called salt tongue and after 12 hours in the water every single day and your tongue would essentially start to disintegrate so Jesus yeah so I was I woke up and there was parts of my tongue on my pillow yeah no this is is there any concern that this is permanent or it was permanent at the time we are concerned absolutely and there that's that's but that's what goes back to that that hierarchy of needs where you're not thinking about family and friends or what motivates you and what you know you know you're thinking I want to keep my tongue because no one is really what people have gone on long swims before but has anybody done six months I don't think so there there's been the competent moment who's going across the Pacific but he is using a snorkel so he kind of revelry whereas for me I thought no this has to be done without properly were you thinking about the guy who was just doing the breaststroke I'm saying well if he did it this is it yeah it was Wow so yes it's noted that and it was at that point that I think you what you are feral you know you're just thinking oh yeah one one arm in front of the other keep going keep moving exactly that you are so here the pieces of your tongue this is a video that you made our piece is your tongue we're falling apart Wow defective salt buildup on the tongue and this is on Ross's Instagram with it which is Ross EDG le why I put it up on my Instagram too i retweeted or reposted one of your things to let people know about this oh that is so nasty dude bad that you can see the taste buds on it that's how so was it's fucking with your taste buds oh yeah yeah where you tasted things oh yeah I'm and that started to have an impact on you know the food as well because I'm gonna like granola I was eating so much granola but when that happened it's like rubbing sandpaper on an oh yeah right it's the grit the oats exactly so and that was how we had to just adapt on the basis so it's during that that video is great actually I mean that was in the cabin and I remember just thinking like now I'm not thinking you know family for Institute awk about those as you just said those those darker moments I think now it's very easy for me to be very grateful I'm warm sitting the studio view there's no jellyfish but there's times there were you know his dark on my neck as well I mean my neck was bad but we didn't actually catch that the moment was probably the worst on that were I went to bed with this open wound from the wetsuit chafing basically and then as I woke up the the bedsheet had fused to my neck oh so I just had to put on the puss oh Jesus Christ son and then you get in that salt water which must've felt great right yeah fuck man yeah what was it like when you finished what did it feel like when the last stroke wasn't he got out of the water and you're like holy shit I just swam for six months it was yet it was it was so strange because when we left in June we came back obviously to the same point and we left in the British summer and everyone was on the beach and and then I came back round people are putting up Christmas decorations and I was like wow I'd been gone for so long let's see it was just so crazy how many days is a total 157 oh my yeah that is so insane it just is so much changing oh here yeah here we go that was the finish so this is swimming back this is you who are these people these fucking hangers on following you around pretending they did it - it was such a team if I how those people waiting for you my legs were so shaky Joe Oh at this point I'm thinking don't fall over don't fall over Wow because it has I mean this is the thing I think I stumble in a little minute there's such madness man yeah there is such madness and you crossed the red bull finish line got a trident that was pretty cool Wow oh they hooked you up yeah what's that made out of it was really sturdy I feel the way that it captured everyone's might it just only felt right today do you swim yes you do yeah what Christina pool know how I found out about you cuz I was I was reading on the internet and I found out about it I sent it to all my friends after sober October to show what pussies I was like you guys think what we did was hard you did shit I sent it to Tom and Bert and our and we were all just like fuck because whenever you hear about someone doing something crazy there's someone always someone who does something far crazier to just one up the crazy person and it keeps going and going and going like there's a race that Courtney do Walter who's been a guest on the show before she won the Moab 240 which is a 238 mile race through the Moab mountains and it's just an insane race not only did she win it she wanted by more than ten hours ahead of the second place guy and she's just a fucking straight savage so she recently entered a race and she came in second place in this race they would run for four miles in an hour and then they would stop when the hour was over they would stop and then when the next hour started they would run another four miles like four point something miles and they'd do it for six days that's crazy they did is like a Last Man Standing and then at the very end one person one like it's like who's gonna drop out last so they just kept doing it so the guy who created this race see if you can find anything on this guy because he's apparently very sadistic and his idea was that people run these 100-mile races or a 50 mile race and if you just finish you feel like a winner and he's like well bullshit he goes there can't be a winner if if somebody comes in first place and then your second place you're not the winner yeah like there's one winner oh basically a marathon yes yeah he's apparently James Fox - he's amazing so this is the Berkeley marathons you know about this did you see last Fame guy he ran he created that race and this is a he's amazing so did you see I think it was last year I Jamie is it right it's the Berkeley marathon which is a Betty barking Berkeley Berkeley or Berkeley is the Berkeley the one that nobody could figure out how to Berkeley it's Berkeley I thought that's the weird one yeah and I think it was if you search this Amy's well I think it was last year or the year before I believe it's the 24 hours or 48 hours but the guy missed out on finishing it by I think it was a minute so he ran oh yeah and then at the end and you see him on the floor he's absolutely devastated and he didn't he take a wrong turn somewhere along one yeah cuz it's really difficult to follow that yeah path yeah and but admirably he just got up and he shook his hand and just said I just want to thank you you know for that he said sometimes you know the Berkeley walking marathon wins but you know that that takes something different right well definitely take something different to see fine if I'm correct in how they do it i retweeted the Courtney Dahl Walter won i retweeted it from Courtney where it says it's like getting punched in the face very softly over and over and over again yeah that's exactly yeah I compare it to being funny put it up does put the article yeah that's exactly it so if you scroll down you'll see the the specifications yeah yeah and yeah and this is what I find amazing because then it becomes about something completely different I mean we were just talking now about Kip Jogi in the two hour marathon but it's like if you pick Jody into this you know who's gonna win mhm yes says they had an hour to complete the four point one six six seven mile loop and then they finished within fifteen minutes to spare the bell clangs again it's 7:40 a.m. they run it again and then at 8:40 a.m. they run it again at 9:40 they run it again so every hour you run this four point one six six seven mile loop and then the Bell just keeps clanging forever what do you think there's more people doing these events now well I think it's the same thing as everything else the same thing is if you you buy a car today you want it to accelerate from zero to sixty and two and a half seconds yeah a few years ago that was unheard of if you buy a computer today you want it to be 3.8 gigahertz and five terabyte hard drive and that's it's the same every year we want improvements right and I think when you hear someone's going to run a 100 mile race you go there yeah that's cute but I'm gonna run 200 miles no like that's not even possible the same as the four-minute mile right someone runs the 200 miles like holy shit I can't believe a guy ran for three days here in 200 miles and then someone like Courtney comes along because I'm gonna do it in two days yeah you know what and then she runs she runs it in two days and then someone they're talking about now doing a 500 mile ultra marathon yeah but and what I find amazing whoo what's the athlete look like who completes that you know to me he's Courtney's very thin she's very light and very thin and you know she's not the type of person that would win a regular marathon this is what was interesting my friend cam Haines who also runs these he ran the he's he's pretty jacked yeah yeah he works he lifts a lot yeah yeah but he cuts a lot of body weight when he does those okay but the way he does it is he's a hard man he's what I was talking about like the speed without darkness yeah he's got some darkness he just like he'll burn 3,000 calories eat mm and so he'll force his body to eat itself right so he drops down to the 160 something pound range and then that's what he likes to way when he normally walks around like 185 he's pretty built yeah yeah but then he drops way down he'll lose like 20 pounds of muscle because he's always lean he's not losing body fat he's just forcing his body to literally eat itself just through mental toughness he's still quite big yeah even when he's tending up on the start line and he's looked like he's doing big for an endurance athlete amazing but maybe that's one of the reasons why he doesn't win these things he comes in like third fourth I mean and also you know he hasn't been doing it as long as them and he's 51 years old now but he's an animal man and this is just that that kind of mental fortitude that it takes to do one of those things or to do what you did it's a very unusual kind of Drive and people are very excited by that drive and they're very intrigued by it and it's very attractive it's very attractive to attempt to do it's very attractive to pay attention to and watch because everyone knows how difficult it is it's undeniably difficult like if someone says you talked to someone who doesn't know how to run at all does they don't do anything they just sit on the couch yeah hey man get up get up we're gonna run miles like fuck at the end of that three miles they will collapse the lay down their back their heart would be pounding the chest to be heaving so they know that's hard everybody knows that's hard everybody at one point in their life has run until they're exhausted mmm whether it's 500 yards or five miles or whatever every from when you were a kid there's always been a moment where we tested ourselves so we're familiar with that feeling of not being able to go on so when they see a guy like you who went through that feeling for six fucking my it was at five months final five months five months man five months is an insane amount of time it is now upon June July August September October November you're into the sixth fucking month when you stop that's insane but but what you just said they're like do you think and this is again because I had 12 hours to think yeah every day do you think it is unusual or do you think that we now think it's unusual because Society has got real comfortable you know and I maintained the stuff that I was doing with salt tongue and everything ancestors do not think they would have just thought you know that's that's just Monday you know that's just I don't think anybody ever thought that was just Monday no I don't think they would have force themselves to do that because there's no biological or evolutionary need to do that it's not like you could swim for 12 hours a day and get across the channel and get to a place where there's better fruit you know that I don't think our ancestors ever did that I think they did what is that type of hunting there's there's actually a term for it Aaron's hunting well they run an animal down I don't think it's called endurance hunting I think it's there's another term for it but they will litter it like if you take an antelope they don't have sweat glands and so they can run far faster than us but it comes a point in time when they overheat so if you just stay on them persistence hunting that's all that was named it right when you pulled it up to him persistence hunting is and you see it in these a lot of these African men who go on to be phenomenal endurance runners I mean they win marathon's left and right in this particular parts of Africa that produce incredible runners and they think a lot there was a really there's a cut in run is a fantastic episode of Radiolab that details these men from this one certain part in Africa I forget where it is but see if you pull that up but this this episode detailed the horrific circumcision rituals that these men had to endure where they cut their dick and they like stick a stick through it and then they make them crawl through thorns naked right oh yeah so I saw that there's a guy back I think it's Bruce Paris he's an adventurer he has done everything you can think of every tribal initiation and that's the one that he refused good for him keep you did contact those crazy guys the San are the oldest inhabitants of southern Africa where they have lived for almost twenty thousand years the term sand is commonly used to refer to a diverse group diverse group of hunter-gatherers living in South Africa share historical linguistic connections many now accept the term Bushmen or sand is that that's Bushmen hunting is that from the radio lab thing yes that's what they call themselves you see article yeah is that the same but is that the same with the the horrible circumcision ritual yeah the whole it's fucking horrible but they were arguing in the the when they were discussing it and one of the guys who was on it who had actually been through it and now I believe he lives Elissa maybe he lives in America but he was saying he would never have his children go through that but he but it made him who he is yeah and that the idea was that not only are these guys physically gifted but they also have unbelievable unbelievable pain tolerance and mental endurance and just mental toughness mmm and this is one of the reasons why they become so successful is that the ability to push a pace for two-plus miles or whatever is their marathon time is not just dependent upon their physical ability but also dependent upon their ability to endure pain and to force themselves past the you know anyone can kind of trot along it is really leisurely paced it's not painful if you're going hard no you're really going hard this is the radio lapses at Enya yeah it's the yeah capo key I think is ah there we go so before you mean well I've kind of described it but they describe it even more horrific detail in the podcasts and that almost crosses over to I mean again I'm not advocating what you just write you know genitalia mutilation I'm not advocating that but there's that idea of adversity training bit like if you're ever in the gym it's like what your training it's just like strength for your training speed and this is why I'm a huge fan of wim HOF because so often what he's doing when he's submerged in ice cold it's like wow I'm training my capillaries yes I would you mean your training your capillaries and it's these where atrophying these age-old inbuilt mechanisms so again I'm not advocating you know what yeah but do you have a keen tolerance yeah and do you think that I that's maybe missing I mean again looking at MMA like maybe that you you see you know whether it's you know mootai and they're like kicking trees and stuff yeah granted that's you know making denser bones or do you think there's that element as well yeah when you look at what was it was now but you just start looking at just putting people in high-stress situations just to see how they're gonna cope like John Fitch he was like notorious for letting people almost try and submit him and then they tie themselves out he was just completely calm and then what's what I mean that's that really depends on who's choking you cuz Josh Burkman choked him completely unconscious okay okay yeah yeah you know Berkman's got a hell of a guillotine and John Fitch shot in on them and Berkman caught him in the guillotine you just blow asleep in the first round well I think if there's there's guys they can just put you to sleep right I can if you think that you can get away with that shit with like a marcelo garcia you're gonna wake up going what happened rio k yeah okay but most guys won't be able to choke you sits at that point you know and again i'm catching up on 157 day if UFC you know why I was actually out at sea with the McGregor and khabib but on that no do you think he tapped premature do you think though you had to sleep McGregor went to sleep oh that in that fight oh you met John fish's Josh Berg yeah neck crank right no he did not tap premature um he did not defend it though okay here's the deal he was done he was beaten down could be fucked him up could be smashed him but there was a lot of people that don't train and this was very frustrating to me there's many people that don't train that think that that was something that you shouldn't tap to they're they're out of their fucking mind okay that is what's called a fulcrum show that's okay okay it's it's not necessarily a choke but it is it chokes you but it really feels like your fucking heads gonna pop off right what he's doing is he's wrapping around the face and you don't have to even go under the jaw you can get it on the chin especially if you're as strong as khabib then you clamp your hands together and you're pressing your forearm against his back so you've got this and you get the forum against his back and you're doing this just leave this fucking head it's just like hits and khabib is so strong his gray he's been grappling since he was a baby right all of his muscles are designed to squeeze and crush and smash and he gets a hold of your neck in that position and he's got that forearm pressed against your back see if he can find an image of the actual submission you could really clearly see what he's doing and then there was a video where Dean Lister and my friend Hans Mullen camp described it that's pulling that up and it's been taken off that video yeah the Hans mollenkamp Dean Lister video Wow maybe someone reposted it and that link is gone yeah huh did you check gene Lister's that's so weird wonder why anybody would take that down um anyway mizuka fuck your face up without even going under the neck a good example here's another good example just pull this up you got it okay one from right after the fight but he's still describing it okay oh this is perfect this is perfect so Dean mister who's a a world champion Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt as legit as it gets and this is my friend Hans Mullen camp he's also Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt and see see this is exactly what khabib did see how his forearm is pressed against the back and the arm is under the chin see the difference is what Dean is doing he can't even help himself he's immediately putting his arms his hands on the arm that's choking him that's what you're supposed to do now if you look at what Connor did Connor just waited until he couldn't take it anymore and tapped right right when you see Connor both of his arms are down he's getting his neck cranked and he doesn't do this right that's what you're supposed to do you supposed to do two on one and then you drop that like look at this see what he's doing he's tapping let's see where his left arm is okay yeah the left arm should not there's you you can't you can't do that see that is a perfect example of the fulcrum choke see how he's doing that pressing his forearm against the back squeezing the head it's it's a neck crank it's a choke there's a lot of shit going on there it doesn't have to be under the chin it could just be on your face and you're gonna get fucked up so all those folks out there that were saying that it wasn't a choke need to go have someone apply that to them and they need to start training jiu-jitsu and stop fucking talking about MMA submissions because they don't write that you're gonna tap bitch don't say you're not gonna tap you get a fucking tap right not everybody's gonna tap from that because other people unlike Connor are gonna be better at defending that they're gonna great like you get a hold of world-class brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt who's also an MMA fighter like like Vinny Magalhaes he's gonna grab a hold of that he's gonna defend properly he's gonna just he's gonna try to get out of that yeah he might have to tap if someone gets him in it I mean he people tap but he's he's not gonna just have one arm posted mmm that's just not the right way to handle but I think that's because Connor had eaten bombs when I was about twice so that's all technical do you yeah so there's that almost as a I don't know like a continuum than technical yes you've just you know and again I should point out you know again I'm a complete layman when it comes to mixed martial arts but I find it fascinating the this adversity training aspect so you're just saying he was eating bombs before that would that would have helped you know that if he wasn't he didn't mean that where does it cross over from being tea would help if he wasn't as tired so like if that choke was applied during the first few seconds or minutes of my first round I think he probably would have had a good chance to survive okay okay what's gonna put on Dean Lester he's Eco choke and he's not it's not being done well but this is a dif this is not an easy kill Joe this is this is uh what this is is I mean it's kind of an easy kiyul but see where his hand is you got to really get underneath see his left hand that left hands got to go not just there it's got to go under the chin that's not good enough for a guy like Dean you got okay now it's pretty fucking tight now it's tight and he's got to get further and further and the further that left arm gets into jeans neck mmm the more more there's gonna be a possibility of him choking but Dean has been fucking choked his whole life which is but I do have to say that Josh Barnett made him tap and Josh Barnett is like one of the few guys that's made Dean Lister tap and I think the first time he tapped in a decade and Josh Barnett got him in a scarf hold and I thought that was in metamoris and Josh Barnett who is he's a catch wrestling specialist yeah go to the very end of it here Josh Barnett gets ahold of Dean's he gets it you see in this position right here he's inside control which is just impressive enough that Josh is able to do this with a guy like Dean Lister but then he gets him and what's uh he probably has a different name for it but it's uh we used to call it judo side control it's quite a bit further down on this you got to keep going keep going keep going to keep going all the way to the end so he gets a hold of his he's got a head and arm choke here it is here it is so he's got his head and his arm trapped together and Josh who's an enormous leap our 'fl is really neck cranking him as much as anything and then Dean was forced to tap but this is at the end of a long match and you know it could have been exhaustion might have played a part in it it most certainly was Josh's skill and his ability to apply that technique but the point is is a guy like Dean Lister you're not gonna tap that guy easy but this is an again again it with sort of holding my hands up saying I'm so sort of naive a huge fan of anime but not necessarily any of the technical aspects but what I love is when you look at someone like you know Nick Diaz or Michael Bisping mm-hmm you know people don't understand his conditioning and he will just wear people down massive mental toughness - with what Bisping has is just insane mental toughness you know Bisping basically has one eye well if you look at his eyes his one of his eye actually and I hope he can get surgery on it now because he is retired he has oil like embedded in his eye to protect his retina because it's been torn so many times been torn he had surgery I had a repair torn again his right eye is fucked up man and one of the reasons why he retired is he started to see some irregularities in his vision in his left eye so his good eye was fucking up too but I mean Michael Bisping is a fucking animal I mean he is he's about as tough as it gets and he's not like a spectacularly physically talented guy like a John Jones or Yoel Romero is just this unbelievable specimen Michael's you know a really good athlete unquestionably but it's just tough just fucking tough so to answer your question there's there's us and you could speak to this because what you're talking about the ability to overcome adversity like some people when you were talking about that fatigue is an emotionally driven thing that there's this feeling that you get and you can give in to that feeling where you're like oh my god I fucking can't do this anymore and some people are more susceptible to that than others and they give in to it quickly I mean for a person here's here's where you can experience this like what whether or not your mindset can affect your endurance get on a treadmill or a stationary bike or whatever you want to do for cardio and then listen to a really kick-ass song and put on headphones and that song comes on and you just can't fuckin yeah you can just go there's something about that and even if you're tired even if you're tired and you've put on a good song like fuck that we're gonna keep going like nothing has happened you haven't taken in any kind of a supplement or any kind of a stimulant that you haven't gotten an injection in your body or you're not sucking on some kind of new gas mmm your body is exactly the same but through the motivation that you're getting from this music the emotional stimulation you're just like fuck that we're gonna keep going yeah and you can keep going not only can you keep going you can go faster you could push harder you can find these reserves so the idea is that these reserves are always there you have to be able to achieve the state of mind that you achieve when you hear a really good song mmm you know and that's true that I think people don't understand you are the alchemists of your own body that you know in terms of neurotransmitters chemical signals in the brain you can impact those sometimes yeah you need external influences music as you spoke about sometimes you know caffeine but when you start to control them yeah it can be so powerful some people do it naturally ice appears and they've just got it inbuilt but when you start to train and I think it's only now that we're we're going down that route and looking at that as a you know until previously it was one of those intangibles know that you kind of under appreciate it in any sport and now we're going on okay yeah you know that person over there is you know that mental fortitude or what you're talking about there is maybe their ability to alter their own chemistry biochemical reactions body yeah there's something real that happens right yeah like when you hear a song and you get excited like whatever that yeah whatever that that burst is it seems like a real like if that was a pill and you took it you believe oh this works absolutely I mean but and the thing is is it's been around years when you look at like an you know Marcus Aurelius meditations or stoic philosophy and they're talking about you know dialogue being both external in turn also the the conversations that go on inside your own head are just as important as the conversations you would have with other people so we've understood this for years but it's only just now that we're trying to kind of apply a little bit of science to it looking at the psychology in this mind-body connection but the fact is yeah some of the greatest ancient Stoics they were trying to figure out as well right and when you can start to tap into that well that can become and it only might be a particular song you know my favorite is something you know if you get into you go into a gym or that you've got a friend that can bring that out of you yeah you know my own training back home so you know Andy Bolton who was the the first guy to deadlift a thousand pounds I mean yeah yeah I mean thousand pounds yeah I mean the clip when you see it any people's a thousand pounds for sight it's since been being by Eddie Hall who did their half a ton so why lift off fuck Eddie thousand pounds a little bit less so I think a thousand pounds was that for I thought a ton was 2,000 pounds isn't it so yeah Eddie what's a thousand pounds in kilo oh you're trying to kill yeah yes sorry the two so yeah there was two metrics there so Andy Bolton which was a little point two kilos per pound no 2.2 pounds per kilo yeah and then yeah and when you see him I mean this is what I love when you start looking Jesus Christ so this is Eddie that's his that's his office how the fuck or his knees staying together right there look if you look at how big his body is and how normal sizes knees are that's like look at the bones and his knees they look so normal yeah I mean that is fucking people I know it's unbelievable oh my god so when those guys retire how fucked up with their bodies how would you know Eddie's Aloha what's Brita Beast tattooist inside of his arm so he's gonna argue with them yeah you're a fucking beast his nose is bleeding yeah oh that's right right his nose started spraying blood while he was without him or another guy though I think he was another video Arnold Classic I forgot his name he's Russian yeah shit was alright but I mean Eddie against a strength especially with the deadlift such a simple movement and and you know the deadlift is just strength is your body's ability to generate force you know so it's neuromuscular like what your your brain is telling your body so that goes back to that's strength deficit right that we were talking about you're basically saying to your your body recruit every single muscle fiber possible and working conjunctions with ligaments and tendons and let's get half a ton off the floor exactly right but when you look and and and certainly with Andi bones a thousand-pound lift he had his friend in his face and he's hitting him in the face so when we were talking earlier about against strength deficit is is that sort of deficit between what you can voluntarily contract an involuntary contract that was him obviously voluntarily contracted no one was alleged to him in that video you want but they're there and you do anything that you can before you actually step out onto that platform and now I mean he would have just been you know completely written off after that that sort of adrenal dumped afterwards yeah you know emotionally but and so you have to you have to think about that have I forgotten who said it now it might been prevailed but they said you know a safe fatigue for competition and I know you've spoken on the force yeah speaking pebbles a fascinating guy with his concepts amazing yeah so he's so ahead of the curve and I know you were talking to you it wasn't talking about farmers strength and that ability to stop short every single day so never necessarily going to a complete failure mmm any one's for us for answer hobby I think it was yeah talking about continually kind of avoiding that exhaustion phase and solely existing in the adaptation phase yes so you know I mean this goes back to cell you sort of 1936 a Hungarian physician who found you know you give you know took some lab rats give him a lethal dose of poison they kill over and died but he found by giving them a little bit of poison a little bit more a little bit more that they built up this intolerance to it and that was the general lactation syndrome but it was from that that we discovered stress and stimuli is the key to any adaptation it wasn't until the strength and conditioning community cottoned onto that and we started to think okay how can we apply stress and stimuli to the body to bring about a desired result and I think certainly now I think that's kind of overlooked in sport but certainly the wider fitness industry that you know it's it's it's easy now in very sort of marketing driven to they get fit in you know five easy steps or you know where as reality is you know it's get fit in eight months after a lot of stress and stimuli yeah that's but that get fit and five easy steps is really just for it's just a gimmick to get people who don't actually work out to get involved it is and that's why I love what you broadcast and even with the sober October and stuff I mean I'm a huge fan of Burt but people I know he's so funny and everyone loves Burt but he's a beast as well I mean it went to rock up and just do a marathon and again that's a power-to-weight ratio what he did was amazing and I've seen he's really fat right that's what I'm nice okay wink wink I forgot you he's a well that's a nice way she's a fat he's a well-built male somebody took a picture of my face I'm burned body and I fucking threw up no yeah one likes to drink and he's still he's he is a beast cuz he despite the fact that he doesn't look like rich role he still can keep going I'm people I don't know he was he was very entertaining the marathon Stefan's actually watching that as the sports scientist in me was like that's amazing and no one's talking about that his power-to-weight ratio n he's still running that marathon something that and and yes at first as funny in as entertaining it was to watch I honestly was like Bert that's amazing what's more amazing is re honestly because re really didn't work out re came in second place in he came in second place by only a thousand points which is the one day I got a thousand points in a day so he was really only a thousand points behind me but it's a crazy day that's like seven hours of work in a day or so at least six and a half hours of work in a day and a lot of it at 80% of your max heart rate but he still he wasn't doing anything before this thing started and he was the first one to figure out that you get the same amount of points for 80% of your max heart rate as you do for ninety right I thought you get more for ninety so I was just trying to kill myself every day and then I was only being able to come up with like two hundred and thirty points and and somewhere along those lines but I was I would max out I was doing like 90 percent of my max heart rate for like 30 35 minutes I was like exhausted and then already figured out that 80 points pays just as much right and so he started watching movies while he was on an elliptical machine and that that just turned the whole thing into this sort of steady yeah not fast marathon yeah which was really fascinating because I never exercised like that before and it changed my endurance radically over a month yeah yeah what's interesting is it changed my endurance in things that are explosive like kickboxing okay what's a having that aerobic base yeah it's something expect a lot how did because I would mix that in so I would do I would do after a while we were doing so much exercise and I had to do different things or I would get bored so I would do a circuit of the elliptical machine and then I would follow the elliptical machine with where I do I would run I would some days I'd run elliptical machine kick box and on other days I would do the echo bike which is an airdyne machine that robe makes and then I would do the rowing machine and then I would do the Versa climber and then I added in that air runner treadmill which is what is it called Air Assault I think Air Assault treadmill yeah which is a treadmill that you power yourself you you your feet pushing on it and pulling it is what makes it go fast it's not like a treadmill that you keep up with it's actually more difficult than actual running 13% more difficult than actual running on the street so I was going crazy I couldn't do the same things over and over again so I kept mixing them up and when I would mix them up by the end of the month my kickboxing was I had way more endurance like I could do 10 hard rounds and going three minutes each round and then I would recover in between rounds the one minute in between rounds I'd recover quick like Mark because I'm wearing a heartrate monitor I'm watching my heart rate dip yeah it was dipping really quickly and then I had all this energy and madness like everything was changing like my capacity for work changed everything adapted I got a little dehydrated one time and I had pissed it looked like iced tea which is not good so I started I'm panicking and wondering about things like rhabdo Milos's and kidney failure but I didn't have anything wrong with that was just a little bit of hydration but what's interesting to go back what we were talking about there you just perfectly described that idea of giving a clear cellular signal to the body so polarized training yeah it was you know that 80/20 that you do 80% of your you know your work your training in that air robic realm where you can keep doing that it's you're not gonna over train there you're gonna avoid that exhaustion phase you know so sell your indestructible rats you know you're not gonna keel over and die from a lethal dose of stress and stimuli right but then over here you know you would that 20% it was powerful it was kickboxing so there you're working technique but you're fresh so you're drilling motor patterns that are completely fresh and not fatigue because you're doing this 80 percent on an elliptical trainer while watching a movie so you're keeping the two completely separate yes but considering the body in its entirety that when it comes together you've created a more powerful version of yourself and I think it was interesting what you just said there about recovery between bouts as well so when you start looking at strongman training you know the some of the strongest guys and one of these strongest guys in the world all understood the benefits of cardio respiratory training you look at you again jeff capes two-time world Strongest Man was running fel races and marathons at 25 Belarus fellow races it's it's yes quite specific to England so it's kind of trail running uh-huh but we call them fell running because you're going and going through bogs and marshes and felled trees not necessarily fellow cheese but just kind of the terrains a little bit different from a trail run right so he was doing that when you look at a Bill Kazmaier again well Strongest Man a power lifter but understood the benefits of cardiorespiratory trying to improve his recovery between sets Brian Shaw as well one of the you know the sort of you know the newest sort of strongman and former basketball player you know so he had that cardiorespiratory endurance that base that aerobic base and then he built this incredible strength on top of that aerobic foundation hmm goes back again - whether you know they knew it or not they were almost creating an athlete like they were creating athletes back in the sort of Soviet Union era when they were taking athletes going right you're giving me a kid and I don't know if he's strong quick good at running running fast over running fuck I don't know so we're gonna build this aerobic neuromuscular base and when they show any sort of genetic potential to be strong quick whatever we're gonna hone in on that and that's only when we're gonna get specific and you're almost doing that now you know and certainly Brian Shaw did it again you look you look long through all of the best athletes in the world they've all followed this blueprint but it's only now that we're kind of dissecting that and saying oh okay I'm making a bit more purposeful who's this gentleman okay there's Brian Shaw he said yeah that's wrong with his legs nice one even now as I I tell you what Jamie if it's possible actually I mean Brian Shaw he accidentally you must have seen this clip set the indoor rowing record I think it was for a look at the size of this motherfucker oh my god and he rocks converse all-stars look at that he set the visit there's a clip on you that man my man's weren't chucks he sets that the cliff on YouTube where he sets the the rowing record the indoor rowing record and it was just because he didn't know sir you know so what things basically down there he's rowing and it sounds like someone started an engine and it's better like this he go and we hear this so this they've just looked rows of the mouthpiece look the whole thing they have to hold it down in the end because it's coming out of the floor Christ these guys are standing on it it sounds like a like just an that's a jet engine right all that power from a leg exactly well no and his bear I mean that technique as well I mean Brian doesn't mind me saying it's not necessarily you know Olympic rowing technique but he doesn't need it because he's just got silly power playing a hundred so the hundred well there's a catch phase and it's more you're almost treating it more like a deadlift where you're using your larger leg muscles where Jesus look at him go there you go crazy - why believable the amount of force he can generate he looks like a very tall man - he's huge how big is this guy 686 yeah I mean so that helps - right because the long stroke absolutely it's just pure power but anyway so they found that they during this session I believe what happened is they said well you know a rower shouldn't make that sort of noise he's basically two people put together he's six foot what 401 654 425 - big guys strapped together in one body he's almost 200 pounds above the UFC heavyweight limit do you know insane that is 265 he's almost too heavy to fight in the heavyweight division of the UFC motherfucker basketball basketball background and and a still look he didn't know that he was gonna set the world record for Rowand so the rowing record they go his one was twelve point eight I believe it was 1308 broke the rowing record but because he had that neural neuromuscular background that they said hey Bryan you're big and powerful just this is a rowing machine right he went oh okay there you go congratulations there's a world record Wow so it's that base that I think's often I've heard you speak about certain Eddie as well talking about breakdancers making great yes you know be today and again whether you know they had that neuromuscular foundation they understood proprioception where then oligomers tends everything should work right whereas if you had someone with a similar work capacity or someone of the same age everything was the same but they didn't have that neuromuscular efficiency you'd say okay and again this is me so naively again on don't claim to know anything about BJJ but you go okay this is an armbar this is and they kind of go okay let me try and figure this out and you can see there's like a Rubik's Cube they're trying to piece it together but you get someone again like Brian and you go okay this is BJJ or something quite complex that requires you and he I'm not saying he wouldn't even fight it's too heavy similar movement to deadlifts which is very common it is he's used to that movement it is yeah it is but I suppose where you saw him you know that wasn't actually there was no extension of the back right he was bent over just ripping there's another one again even to use Brian is an example where he does I believe I can't endure the name with a ward now but he went up and Thor as well another strong man did a I think it was a clean and jerk there was a ward that was predominantly clean and jerk and there was this amazing crossfitter technique was beautiful disappearing under the bar over his head it was amazing to watch and I think it was Thor or Brian sure went in and just instead of a clean injure and Joe honestly he just basically upright rows the whole thing and complete and they were like well that's not a clean and jerk but you just set a record so there's that element to use an example as well with with oh here we go here we go oh my god okay there's another strong but there is there's another one of those where you see the CrossFit with this amazing beautiful technique he's he's so far from his chest it's crazy that he's doing it like that and what is that 225 pounds in the fucking shit that is so crazy - he could do that he's doing so many reps right right that is insane but he doesn't have a pause no back a so that's meant to be a clean and jerk I know so that's what I mean about that neuromuscular efficiency that he's gone okay here's a new sport come get involved and he's got a key I see the rules of your sport but I'm gonna do it my way and didn't count well yeah I suppose I mean if that would is just put the weight above your head like that guy did it normal that time right yeah yeah but there's like this if you put in you know Thor versus CrossFit that then it will probably come up and you get to see an amazing crisp technique mmm and then equally Thor is basically doing what what Brian was doing just there I'll say here you go so this is they keep putting on weight until one of them I believe the competition ears you keep not yeah they're your CrossFit versus amounting it's amazing technique disappears under the bar you know incredible and then I think you know Thor will eventually come in and give it a go and basically just upright rows here we go so you saw that you know disappears on speed of movement amazing and then thought come come and have a go at this and this is what he he produces is that neuromuscular efficient it's just mad strength it is it is I mean you could do that too of you just an empty bar you know I mean like that kind of person the kind of person they can do that when you think about him dead lifting a thousand pounds or any of these guys that can deadlift in insane numbers just the whole machine can generate so much force yeah yeah and that and that's it though it is they're able to do that again because of that foundation they say a body can generate that force and then you say here's a new movement yeah and you can see them look at you know like for that example okay so that's a clean and jerk okay I can't figure that I think I've found a way you know ISO lends credence to the concept that deadlifts is like the mother of all exercises because it really does work all your muscle groups yeah and if you can get really strong at deadlifts I mean it really does enhance almost any single athletic endeavor you participate in yeah yeah and I think again that sward have been lost a little bit along the way that they're you know getting the joints ligaments muscles everything to work cohesively you know and when you do that for your training you can pretty much apply to anything so I think that's why I mean I again I used to swim ages ages ago way back in the day but I was never gonna make sort of elite standard I'm you know five nine on a good day maybe I'm built like a whole bit so everybody just great great oh yeah so I ended up again almost accidentally going into strength training I played water polo in the end - that's a fairly good level so I was doing that but again I just got beaten up I was sixteen playing in the seniors league and you know just big guys with beards just beating me up you know it's interesting what you were talking about earlier is in terms of mental fortitude and your ability to adapt and the ability to overcome I wonder if we're ever gonna figure out a way to measure that like to measure in mental endurance or measure mental capacity or mental stimulation you know you can measure your vo2 max mm-hmm and you know what the body is capable of but I wonder if there's a way like when someone does hear a great song and it kicks in whether it's through fMRI or any other type of detection device where they can figure out a way oh this part of your brain is firing let's concentrate on building up the the activation of that part of that brain of the brain like like a muscle when like think of that endurance or think of that motivation as like maybe even a mantra that you can call upon because you call upon it all the time and you can recreate that state yeah I mean I think on on that point certainly over in Britain at the moment so basically or women for the first time can actually apply and be in the Special Forces so at the moment it's really really interesting because speaking to you suddenly the raw Marines they were saying we've got hundreds of years that if you handers 500 young fit men we can say there needs to be this weight this tall and if you give us them we've got years and years of experience of putting them through this training system of mental and physical fortitude everything down in limb stone it's the the the training center of the Royal Marines and we go on this endurance course we go on a 30-mile jump with a backpack everything and by the end of 32 weeks that's what it takes to be a real marine to get your Green Beret after 32 weeks we can take you from being completely not said entry but unfit to being a raw marine and that's one thing they pride themselves on but now what they're saying is obviously you know females can now apply to Special Forces and what they find so interesting is and I certainly do as well is what does that look like for a female raw marine you know what does that look like for things on and again to go back I mean I wrote an article a ages ago run like a girl and I was saying I wanna run like a girl you know someone some of my best training partners a female and they their perception to fatigue is unbelievable that's purely anecdotal but also as well when you look at the top tier of ultra marathon runners and swimming as well Diana Knight first to go from Florida to Cuba to Florida you know incredible like she was getting stung by Portuguese MANOWAR's and just unbelievable just purely and it but now they're saying you know why is it that that certain female athletes have a greater tolerance e to pain and I think to your point if we can start to quantify that because there are biological differences you take men you know high testosterone can have an impact on high hemoglobin generate muscle force all of these things but but I think if we could quantify why it is that certain female athletes are dominating the top 10 percent of ultra marathons and and open water swimming what is it that they're doing that would be amazing I think the ability to endure pain and this is not my thought honestly I should just say this has been theorized before has to do with their ability to endure the pain of childbirth child labor and childbirth I mean just the fact that they're forcing a baby out of their vagina and yeah I mean that is insane I mean you don't do you're seeing the Machine they do they've taken these electrodes they put it on men and recreate the pain of childbirth yet and watch these men funny fall apart like fucking turn it off yeah it's I mean obviously I haven't given birth but it's supposed to be unbelievably painful and women are biologically suited to this this is like so I think their ability to endure that pain is just it's probably just there's an evolutionary advantage to having this more higher capacity but I also think one of the things that I learned from teaching martial arts is that women they learn technique better many times than men do because one they listen and two they don't try to muscle things so women have less of a problem with learning something from a person and this is also true about archery my friend John Dudley who's an archery coach says his favorite students are always women because they listen better they don't have as much of an ego they don't have to pretend they already know something they don't want to just try it without and they follow it to a tee better like generally obviously we're speaking in generalities yeah but they also don't have the extra muscle that a man has so men are strong we'll try to just force things and muscle things where women will try to follow what's being described to them what's the proper technique and they knew it properly all the time and then they develop this pattern of proper technique I noticed this with Taekwondo and I think my friend John said he noticed this with archery I think this this this benefits them in sports because like if you learn jujitsu really the best people to learn from our smaller men or women because they the smaller people they don't have the physical strength to pull it off on a big guy hmm so what they have to rely on is correct technique hmm but if you learn jujitsu from a big guy man big guy jujitsu is weird because they could just grab your wrist and you can't get go you can't let go and they can get away with things like okay you go wrist control and throw the legs up wrist control okay wrist control on who where I try wrist control on that big motherfucker that was rowing the world record they didn't say man you're gonna go flying through the air that wasn't really gonna work right you're gonna have to go against his strength you're gonna have to figure out a way to move around it you don't have to go you're not gonna go through it right that big guy if he was teaching jujitsu let's just grab the neck and then you squeeze it he's got the kind of horsepower that a man like you know a normal man can't imagine yeah do you think that's changing a kenta to bring it back to the US see I suppose because now I mean with what Cormier is doing and you know John Jones coming back you know the lightweights are all moving up to heavyweight do you think you know gone are the days of the huge dude who was just a physical phenom and now the smaller technical dudes is that there's a there's a thought with the 265 pound weight class and the consensus thought seems to be that somewhere around 240 pounds is the magic number that's what they think they think that 240 pounds is the amount of weight that you have where you're strong enough that you can knock out any man but you have more endurance than a man that may be ways to 65 or heavier and cuts down to 265 okay now this has not been substantiated the problem is there there hasn't been a really super powerful World Championship athlete that weigh 265 pounds there's been Brock Lesnar but yeah Brock Lesnar's enhanced right you're dealing with a guy who tested positive for steroids he probably has had things and then this is a new world he's also 40 years old now so it's impossible to tell what he would have been like it threw knee if he was clean and then you have guys like Francis and Ghana who's 265 pounds massive knockout artist natural 265 pounds but doesn't have the wrestling base got exposed in his fight with ste paimio CH if you can't knock you out he's kind of doomed and he tired out after the first round okay so it's hard to say because there's never been a 265 pound version of Cain Velasquez ok Cain Velasquez my humble opinion when I look at all of the different heavyweights that I've personally seen fight Cain stands out as the best the reason why Cain stands out as the best is because he has superhuman endurance yeah and his ability to put a pace on guys you would see these guys just wilt under the pressure of and I think with Cain you this is where it gets really interesting what did him in is probably what also brought him to the top is his mental toughness because his body started breaking down he started having all these back injuries you needed back surgery multiple back surgeries shoulder surgery knee surgery everything was getting fucked up and I think it was getting fucked up because he was working through pain and because he has the ability to tolerate pain that most people don't have right he's just a fucking animal but that's also probably what led to him having this insane endurance mmm is the same kind of mental toughness I'm sure there's some genetic advantages as well because they would talk about how he would take months off and come back in still fuck everybody up because he's just that good but that also could be attributed to the the cardio base that he had from competing for many many many many years at a high level and and being known for that insane endurance mmm perceptions of fatigue going back he said if you could quantify that you'd put cane up there with one of those people yes he has that in abundance yes and anyone else in the heavy weights then would you say well Cormier for sure has tremendous fatigue ability to tolerate fatigue and tremendous endurance and he breaks people you know they call him the king of the grind and but on top of that they would they both have is tremendous wrestling technique that the wrestling technique as well as the endurance everything plays a factor Jon Jones fits into that camp as well Jon Jones has tremendous wrestling technique as well striking technique massive physical skills but also mental toughness his mental toughness is unchallengeable like you you absolutely have to give it up to him he's had his arm fucked up by Vitor Belfort completely hyper-extended refused to tap and then one up tapping Vitor with a with a Americana I believe it was the next round and toe against Chael Sonnen I was Thomas fuck even notice in Todd was interviewing them I was interviewing him he looked down oh shit look at my tone he started going to shock was as bad as turned upside down it was completely turned upside down I mean imagine that I mean if he wound up going into the next round if he didn't stop Chael Sonnen and his toe was that fucked up and he wound up losing to Chael Sonnen because his toe was bad mmm that's insane he also went through that fight with Alexander Gustafsson where he wasn't really training very hard for that fight and Gustafson won the first couple rounds and then John Jones won the last two to take it away and and I watch that back obviously with all the promotion at the moment and I think was wink with Jana Jackson when he starts shouting the heart heart you know shouts and that was that that was the decide I mean that's you know that was the deciding factor that you come out and you produce that yeah also in John Jones's favor I believe he has to fucking super-athlete brothers yeah and they used to apparently beat the shit out of each other all the time and his brothers are bigger than him right I think that is a factor because I think that there's mental toughness that comes from being around that kind of combat in the household all the time yeah yeah I think it's a bunch of different faiths but it's it's hot you I don't know I think you can teach that I don't believe that mental toughness is something you either have or you don't have I don't believe that I think you can teach it but you gotta want it and you gotta be willing to learn you got to be able to bring yourself to a state of mind where you're unbreakable I think it's possible I really do and some people just have that that is that mean and I think they've developed it over a long period of time and once they finally got to whether it's wrestling or jujitsu or MMA they already had it and then they accentuated it and and added on to it and then it got stronger and then they become known for it like that guy is just an animal he's just a mentally strong but I think that mental strength comes from many life experiences and probably probably the guidance of their parents or some other role model in their life that also showed them incredible endurance and incredible discipline and this this mental fortitude I think you can teach it though yeah I think you know I don't I don't believe that it's something that's just either have or you don't have I think you either have it or you don't have it but you can get it that's what I think and you know I'm a huge fan of Dan Hardy we've been chatting since the the swim and I always go back to that armbar with the George st. Pierre and oh yeah everybody was had yeah and and and I couldn't get my hat and I can't wait to catch up with Dan about that and sort of exchange notes on this idea of mental fortitude because how he survived that I mean it was rendered I was cringing watching well Dan's a savage I mean he's and he's an intelligent savage and you know he's he's not like a thug are a brutish guy he's a very well-read intelligent thoughtful guy but he's also a guy that knows how to dig deep you know and you know when he fought George st. Pierre that was his big shot you know I mean his big shot was against a guy who was at the time was in his prime and it was the greatest welterweight arguably of all time I mean the argument is it's between him Matt Hughes and I believe now tyron woodley is in that camp as well was like that the greatest welterweights ever but you what you get out of Dan Hardy is a guy who's thought things through I mean he it really comes through in his commentary he's a very very intelligent guy would you say he's the same sort of cut from the same cloth as call me a them because I know Brendan spoke about this recently saying he's the most intelligent fighter on the UFC roster at the moment Cormier yeah but his approach yeah in his approach and how he will break people but again you know when you watch you in the UFC and betting and stuff you like you can't help but love Cormier such a nice guy but and this goes back to what I suppose you said about the swim you know when it was like oh you're very smart and stuff but I see that in Colma he's the nicest guy but I would never get in the Octagon with him you don't know fooling anyone no he's a sweetheart until you're locked in a cage fuck you up the difference between him and Dan Hardy though is that he's a world-class wrestler I mean he was a two-time Olympic team member and just one of the best wrestlers to ever compete in MMA and you really see that in a lot of his fights like the Derrick Lewis fight Derrick had no chance like no chance you know and Derrick just knocked out Alexander Volkov who in a lot of people's eyes including mine was one of the dark horses in the heavyweight division but Derrick just did not belong in there with Cormier who was the light heavyweight champion he carries a lot of fat on him yeah he's mean and I think if if he wanted to if Daniel Cormier really dedicated himself he could drop down to 185 pounds I really believe that but he's just you know easy why would he's a fucking heavyweight champion that's the difference feeding him and there's many difference between him and Dan the success ratio is very different you know Cory has been extremely successful the only guys lost was John Joe you know so but but I find that with rest and this is on a complete tangent here but when you talk about that mind-body connection like so often they're seen as separate you're over an intellect or you're just a physical phenom like it's rare that you see the two but when again ancient Greek philosopher you look at Plato like Plato was an accomplished celebrated wrestler yes I think he said something along the lines of you know you should wrestle to find the answers to that philosophers siècles it was something like that he was such an advocate of it and and I think and again this is coming from you know sort of my limited background because obviously in Britain we don't have have wrestling like over over here and stuff but there's something about wrestling it seems or I suppose my question to you is like that it just teaches that like mental fortitude yeah you know yeah physically yeah you and muscular efficiency and stuff but it seems to just produce this breed of humans that you know did you think is there's something about being faced down in a mass somebody's just trying to contort your limbs you know so that to go back to stress and stimuli you know it's also building up that progressive over lot in your own head yes that and what you just said there about experiences that that quite often now when I go swimming I'm like it's not the career vacant I'm not wearing a jellyfish tentacle on my face you know it's not that bad right and I think what did do you that summer my question is do you think it's the same with wrestling that you like I've been in a worse position than this I think for sure I think there's the the strength that they have the intellectual strength and when I say intellectual strength there's actually solving puzzles whether people understand it or not you look at wrestling you think it's always brute force and strength and endurance but they're solving puzzles right they're setting traps they're trying to set up techniques and they're doing this under heavy workload right they're exhausted their hearts pounding and they're resisting a hundred percent with another person who's resisting a hundred percent yeah when you see guys tie up and throwing each other around and they're fucking digging their toes into the mat ain't getting and wrenching there's a tremendous amount of force that they have to keep up for minutes and minutes at a time and I think a lot of that has to do with your ability to maintain intensity and a lot of that has to do with your ability to tolerate being exhausted and tolerate fatigue hmm and to force yourself into an a highly aggressive and efficient mindset and to be able to maintain proper technique under fatigue that's a good point technique and intelligence I believe again I was with the Royal Marines we can be when training with them I find that it's crazy how you you don't have the cognitive functioning of the five-year-old you know you are completely right you're in a 30-mile yawn with 50 kg on your backpack and somebody asks you some really complex question and you're just like I you know I don't know well you know and and I think certainly going back to the swim there's times where I said to the team I was like please like when when I'm six hours into a swim through the night I need just really clear instructions yes like raw swim this way Ron Ross wind that direction and again purely anecdotal for the moment but you know I love cowboy Cerrone and there's times when he's just in his corner and he's just having a full-on collie so relax yeah you know and it's just like that you you could see somebody probably fatigued and they're panicking and he's just sitting on the stool like he's got great Durance to that that helps that certainly helps his ability to recover right hey Trina rounds you see his fight this weekend I've got to catch up when it was a variation on sensational the best he's ever looked but he was on the bottom when Perry can when yeah I mean Perry took him down but he said to me goes he goes he started to take me down was like shit I'm gonna let him he said I'll let him take me down and then he reversed him immediately and got him in an armbar and then broke his arm he snapped his forearm in half he sent me the x-rays yeah yeah I think anybody seen this oh sorry Donald I'm not supposed to turn this I gotta send this shit yeah we've been going back and forth and you know for him I think it was a matter of rekindling his excitement here it is yeah it was a pretty emotional but oh oh that hurts right can you see that you want me to send it to you here I'll send it to you Jamie also I think with Donald when it comes we were talking about stimulation and motivation he has a son here's a little baby son and he brought his son into the Octagon with him who's celebrating with his son he just seemed different to me he seemed different in his poise completely in control the guy who's fighting Mike Perry is fucking dangerous he's fucking dangerous he hits really hard he's very aggressive and Donald just handled him and and Perry took him down I think he didn't like what was going on stand up wise he just snapped that shift but but you mentioned there as well we're severely talking about his son and it was such an emotional post that he posted on Instagram I loved it and and and going back to what you said about finding something that that alters your biochemistry you know and now that he's fighting for something and you knees got is good did you think that's that's what we were talking about music before my getting is my say maybe you use caffeine like whatever it is but something you think is now different in Cerrone because you know it's love yeah yeah the love of his chair as children he has something that mean he what he said was I never knew what I was fighting for I said now I have something to fight for I think he was fighting for excitement before for thrills cuz he's a he's a thrill see he's a wild motherfucker he likes jet skiing and jumping snowmobiles off the side of mountains and he's an animal week before a fight but yeah he doesn't give a fuck he doesn't know but this is a different thing with what he's doing in in this fight in particular I think this is a different thing because he's fighting for his son I mean he's got this family now and it means the world to him and he looks over at this guy like this guy's trying to take food from his family and he just was an efficient assassin it was just it was beautiful to watch it was like I think the best performance of his career and you know maybe Mike Perry is not as good as Darren til or is Hafele dos Anjos or some of the other people that he's fought in the past but he's fucking dangerous and he's a legit welterweight where Donald's not Donald confided 155 pounds it's one of the things Donald said after the fight he said khabib he goes I'm back I'm coming for you and so he wants to drop down to 155 and fight khabib do you think he might know something's different do you think do you think Thank You Comiket r1 will zoom and khabib is the motherfucker of all motherfuckers agrees you know I mean who's gonna beat that dude but that dude Molly Watson maybe but Askren is a different weight class see astron 70 and khabib x' 55 if kabhi Ben Askren agreed to a caffeine spice that is absolutely a possibility and absolutely a possibility that a screen could best him because if someone's gonna beat khabib it's gonna be someone who's a superior wrestler and Askren is a motherfucker of a wrestler but is he better than kabhi we really don't know and we will not know until they they fight but I do have to say that khabib in the training camp at aka this is coming straight from Cormier and a bunch of other people who trained with him say that he trains with Olympic caliber wrestlers and fucks them up that's how good khabib is khabib is he's he's so goddamned good on the ground when he gets a hold of guys they look perplexed and I always bring up the Edson Barboza fight cuz a moment in the barboza fight in the first round where he'd that thousand-yard stare where it could be but taking him down he was mauling him and he looked over in the distance like how the fuck am I gonna get through three rounds of this shit yeah and that's thingamabob poser I mean Terry acted that kick yeah so to see that it was just I mean it felt like if I was to do mixed martial arts did you just say I know you spoke about it before you said if somebody doesn't know you know what they're doing like like me it's like drowning you know and and that's exactly how I would you know feel I think it was just humbling in its way but it's something that you could learn see the thing what you've done in my eyes what you've done is so difficult I think you could do anything I really do I think what you did by forcing yourself to do that shit for six hours a day take a break six hours again to do 12 hours of swimming every day for five fucking months that kind of mental fortitude if someone just taught you I mean obviously you're very physically strong and fit if someone just taught you technique and taught you how to grapple and taught you kickboxing you would be a motherfucker at because your mind is so strong that that you know there's a different mindset to have that same kind of mind strength with the adversity of another human being trying to kill you yes that's the thing how well do people deal with other people so like there's something about a person breathing down your neck that's trying to choke you that's very disconcerting but if you can get past that and I think you could you would be a motherfucker or anything you did and that's actually the thing I mean even at the moment now I'm used to just training for 12 hours a day so right now I'm still sort of in biphasic sleep so I've only been on land really a week so that's crazy yes are you sleeping in a boat this whole time yeah yeah six thousand dollars off what is it like to have the ground not move dog is standing boom honestly when I got on I was I mean I was doing media interviews and everything was swaying you know this is this is it but even even that night my first night the the bed it sounds so weird but the bed was just a bit too stable it's a bit too comfy Wow I woke up in the middle of the night I was with my girlfriend and I'm looking for my goggles you know thinking with tides about to jump back in yeah and she was just go back to bed and like honestly I say it now like sort of joking but there was a real element of you know just that you'd been conditioned and all I really cared about as soon as I woke up I wanted to know what the tides were doing you know what where is it running how when does the start winds how have we got good tidal bad side is it spring tides or neat tie so spring tides being strong and neat ties better and that was my currency that's all I cared about yeah and it was really strange that you to try now and integrate back into society you know even just walking you know through LA the cars everything moves very fast now you know and you kind of come back and it's a it's a bit of a shock it's a real you must feel like you're in an alternate universe or something look to go through five months of one reality and then to come out on the other end yeah it does so what I almost but but then even it's not intrinsically or something my body's used to working hard for 12 hours a day and just getting battered by wave so at the moment you know I'm sort of sitting here and you know I've been doing metre it's been amazing but there's an element of me just kind of go in I need to use this work capacity and so I am sort of training at the moment the first session I did I was in there for like six hours and I was and they were like the gym shut you crazy but one of the things that we all talked about after sober October was that none of us had ever done anything like this before but we're worried now that we're gonna go back to our sedentary ways and they were gonna lose all this work that we put in because at the end of the month re who had never worked out before ran 15 miles road five kilometers and then got on the bike for a while I forget what he did on the bike but I think he did at least a mile on the bike and this was a four plus hour workout but he had never done anything before I mean he did jujitsu I bought him some jujitsu lessons I bought him a year at tenth planet jujitsu like like ten years ago he went for a while and then he hurt his knee and stopped going but he was ten years of nothing hmm and he's fucking forty something years old and it forced himself that's mental fortitude so he's shifted I mean I was so like the human body I found it so lazy like we love homeostasis a habitual level what we're used to doing you know that status quo and then when you do shift that and it's all relative because you know it can be you know swimming for 12 hours a day and stuff but it's relative and and I think when you do shift that it is hard and I think you have to be so conscious of that so even now I look for instance my legs at the moment you know shrunk but not just my legs I mean I essentially skip leg day you know for 157 days it's like your arms must be jacked is kind of it so we went into the gym the other day and and because of like ligaments tendons but not only just generating force like a bench press but if you imagine like 40 knots of wind you know wind over tide that we're talking yeah my shoulders are used to being contorted in ways that they shouldn't be so your shoulders are resisting the winners it's coming towards me so you're you're especially with your shoulders yeah I knew my times I would take a stroke and then a win I mean there's times when the waves hit me so hard I thought I'd just hit a boat you know I hit something and that would be poor so it was that resistance as well so on the bench press it was just kind of like took you know 160 you know not saying it's necessary as a sort of sport science experiment I kind of unlifted and then just took 160 kilos just for a ride and it just kind of felt okay what's 160 kilos sort of 160 kilos in sorry Jamie but then equally my legs you know in the squat I'm barely lifting my own body weight 53 53 50 year for you know eight reps says it's that that sort of strengthen and so you had lifted weights in five months and yet you like upper body but but bleep but lower body no you know and and it's not even that though like you know my legs it's the-- it's my feet as well so right now genuinely and a lot of people afterwards like what are you gonna do next you know what's the next adventure and I said I've got to learn to walk again and everyone laughed and I was like naina nude like the arches in my foot of collapsed these ligaments and tendons so it's I mean I think a lot of collabs just from not standing yeah I mean yeah you got to think 12 hours in the water every day but even when I was on the boat I was probably eating or sleeping whoa I didn't even think about that so your load capacity or ability to like hold your body weight up that's diminished yeah I almost entered into this small group of people like astronauts where you've been in a non-weight-bearing environment for so long so I joke and when we watch that video back in our second our jaws you know try not to fall over there genuinely I was thinking please don't just fall over with all the camera on laughing and another thing that intrigues me is you're a young guy you're not a lot of these endurance guys are old angry people they get older and they develop this ability to just fucking fuck the world and and and push through things how old are you yeah a three yeah that's very young to do what you did isn't it yeah and I think you're right actually and that that would be a really sort of good point to make there that I always think when people say I'm too old now to train and stuff I'm not absolutely not when yes granted when you're younger elasticity in your ligaments yeah higher testosterone muscle mass ability to you know increase muscle muscle stuff absolutely but when you're older and to your point there Joe when you look at these you know back in England fell running which we're talking about you get these guys who just look like they live in the mountains you know where the thick faces you know their calves are just like this just thick calves and they have that capillary density that like mitochondrial efficiency movement efficiency so their cardio respiratory Durance has just been built up from years and years and and these sorts of people as well they almost they love the mountains and and running so much that they don't care that they're overtraining or like they need a rest occur there we go honestly Christ when I'm throwing I am getting lapped you Neela yeah ok you have to wear those shorts no composure he seems like it is numbers next to you dick that's weird too those are those are shorts that a girl would wear in a porno movie it's called the Bob Graham so there's a famous fella race going back to sort of the bargain rush there's a famous fell race back in English called the Bob Graham and you know legend has it there was a guy Bob Graham and he sort of said you know I think I can do forty four peaks in the Lake District in under 24 hours and they were no no no that's not possible it's not possible he said yeah so that was like a bet in a pub you know and they're like yeah and sure enough that's what he did and so there's this race now called the bagram and it's amazing in that it's it's steeped in history in heritage that there's a a hall in Keswick which is a small town it's called moot hall and if you were standing there Joe and your you're running gear with those shorts huh but you were running there with your running gear and you had your hand on moot halt and you were looking at your watch like that runners would walk past you in just be like oh he's about to do his Bob Graham you know they'd come over there's that real solidarity that my good luck good luck answer and then you have to do it in 24 hours and Billy bland who's the one who set the record which has only just been beaten by Kilian Jornet who recently ran up Everest as well I think yeah so many savages are base so this and what I love about this is yeah yeah there you go Kilian Jornet so the guy behind in the blue set the record says there I needed to suffer says Kilian Jornet after breaking the record that has stood for 36 years 36 years Wow I needed to suffer but but these guys and it goes back to you know too often it's sports science sports nutrition let's look at look at your gait analysis running biomechanics what Footwear are you using minimal issues on whereas with this with fell running it took 36 years for somebody to get close to that record yes doing so far back granted you need to know the terrain like you could on this descent on this picture for instance you could be running down there struggling down the rocks and you might not know that just you know 50 meters to your right there's a perfect sheep trail and that's kind of the concept of fell running so it's just a matter of getting up and above and over it no matter what path you take yeah yeah but certainly efficient if you know something and so that guy in the front there is pacing him basically because it's very easy to get lost on there's no specific path that you have to take you have to get over it there's certain points that you have to get you but then in terms of the terrain and perhaps it no not really so it's just point to point to point to point how do they mark those points do they have our cones well I mean this year will be long established that to do the Bob Graham you need to do that point that point and then you come back to MU Hall you know within hopefully 24 hours and if you do it then you have you but they're back please have your Bob Graham these guys look like a guy that would do that whereas you don't right this is my point about you and during it's like how your physique you don't see a guy with your physique doing this kind of stuff yeah you think that you could do this kind of stuff running I mean no I and I always say I'm not self-deprecating and how much do you weigh about 100 kilos which is a lot considering 20 yes that's about 120 pounds yeah yeah so aren't yet the Bob Graham is something complete different and that goes back to what we were talking about about power-to-weight ratio right in a weight bearing sports it was something like running cuz you're so heavy yeah oh you have a lot of power yeah do you think it would be possible if you put if you added more power to obviously not now because you're getting off for five months on a boat but if you built your legs and your feet back up do you think you could do this yeah I do you think I'm just possibly on surf but nowhere near I mean Kilian Jornet what he's he's amazing I mean with Killian he I believe don't come out he's almost sort of semi-nomadic he grew up in the hills semi-nomadic ya know so for him he would run a marathon to go and get his you know carton of milk in the morning oh Jesus you know so when you are lining up on a start line I mean if you're racing it can you look over and you've got a guy like that fuck yeah you can't beat that guy but he's but he is built for that this is my bike so you but you don't think that guy's built for swimming like if that guy had to do what you did swimming wise he would be at a disadvantage over a certain difference going back to the bell rang that somebody like that and in my experience when I have raced or swum with you know guys who are doing you know 10 kilometer they they will be quicker than me over 10 kilometers but then it gets to a point when we're like you thirty kilometers in where their biomechanics just because of muscle injures that starts to break down maybe as well and this is so often overlooked actually but you've got to train your digestive system so again this is mainly anecdotal but you know in strength based sports you know a lot of guys won't think anything about putting away 15,000 calories a day which is what I was doing so I'm doing that while you're swimming yeah 15,000 yeah 15,000 calories what was it in a lot of it you were sitting down once got inside the boat yeah what were you eating just it was so intuitive so it was it was kind of strange because the diet was calorie dense so you have to make up for your calorie requirements the day also looking at nutrient dense cuz you got a care for your immune system but equally palatability so when my tongue was falling upon you know I needed to look at that and even seasickness who's not really spoke about as well which is kind of like you need something that hits those four points and that's 15,000 calories a day so for me that was quite often just like porridge oats you know mixed with honey mixed with almond butter and then even like an oh here we go yeah so this is you eating what's that yeah oh there might be one there somewhere yeah what is that in there Bo beans mostly yeah and this is what just got to the point where it was like what can you just like what he's gonna so I was just eating out the pan just trying to shove it in your face yeah so I what what would you eat like what would the fool this this is probably quite a good one yeah like so yeah there you go like in terms of so essentially as a nutritional sort of in theory the framework you get what was that mask oh so that was to stop the jellyfish oh no but it doesn't matter like even the mask is the giant jellyfish of Scotland there'll be a pitch on there somewhere they're kind of like six feet long so when you're swimming at night and you can't see them the tentacles will they'll just kinda they'll get you and so I got like they can go in your mouth and you're in I got one in my ear I got like wet willy by a jellyfish it just kind of got me there so it's like that that yeah they're trying to find and adapt the same way with the mass but nutritionally as well but also looking it as a framework you're having your protein which is pretty stable you know 1.7 grams per kg of body weight per day you know that kind of stays the same so then for the rest of the 15,000 calories you basically need to make it up with your two energy-yielding makarand you change so carbs and fats and so for me it was very calm dependent because when you are swimming for a giant whirlpool you can't say can I have some fats which the body has to go a certain process is gonna take longer no you just need fast-acting carbohydrates but then equally looking at MCTS so a medium chain triglycerides as well which are a fat so they have the calorie density of a but they're treated more like a carbohydrate rather than long chain triglycerides so there was a certain amount of site so a lot of people would say you know a fifteen thousand calories that mean pizza or in everything it's like well you know yes to an extent but then place too much emphasis on that and you're not caring for your immune system as well right to get 15,000 calories I think yeah I always point out that it's using things like MCTS which will find in coconut oil and certainly again not to get too much on the science but capric and caprylic acid which are converted to ATP adenosine triphosphate it's a molecular energy the muscles when you understand how to use em see T's like that it can be quite easy to make up 15,000 calories you know you try and make up 15,000 calories of vegetables right yeah exactly especially you might have like protein and then fruit and it requires a different digestive enzyme and then you're gonna tell me to go and swim for a giant whirlpool and roll on my stomach for 12 hours a day it's just like with seasickness it's not gonna happen yeah you just you must need a lot of a really dense foods yeah and and that's the thing that it goes back to again this this bell curve that I've spoke about but you know what quite often a lot of endurance athletes that I train with who are amazing they're unbelievable they're sub-3 our marathons they're incredible you know they're they're the guys that will go and run the Bob Graham but quite often they say but Ross can just eat and it's just like yeah that's often overlooked you know that my body you know I didn't have a sick day for out the whole swim that's really was that attribute and I pop I started at 92 kilos and you know when you when you look at the pictures from the start to the finish I just look like just like hereok yeah but just also just bulk because you are asking your body to swim around Great Britain so it's not just the fact that you are you don't want to be in a calorie deficit can you imagine how much microtrauma the body's gonna go through so you're essentially just trying to nurse the body saying look I know this is horrible I know it's cold I know I'm asking you to swim for 12 hours a day I know there's gonna be jellyfish toxins I mean not something off stung like and in 20 times in one night in a single tide you know so it got to the point where I talked about my face or changing shape but equally the toxins in your body your heart would start beating faster and you know so there was just this idea that just eat just to look after the body so when it comes to nutrition and were you taking any supplements were you taking vitamins yeah lots and and that goes to like I said that calorie density mm-hmm but also to make sure that you're making the immune system yeah you're taking everything from super green shakes you know to multivitamins to protein shakes just to make sure that you were supplementing that calorie density I think so often overlooked the higher turnover of like phytochemicals enzymes micronutrients what about fish oil anything yeah mega threes yeah and that's what just anything that you were thinking well this is even two glutamine to a higher turnover of amino acids so after a for instance after training as well you can have all the protein in the world but if it has a low biological value so I can I'm gonna try and keep score but if you look at you know immediately after a workout you know your body's basically saying look when you protein to repair and regrowth protein synthesis and your muscles are saying please but if you don't have a high concentration of leucine specifically so branched chain amino acids leucine within that is what will trigger to your motor receptors to basically repair and regrow so quite often you can have all the protein in the world but if it's of a low biological value if it's not very good quality protein your body's not going to assimilate it right so it's not about the protein that you eat it's about the protein you assimilate right so you would take branched chain amino acids post-workout yeah yeah and specifically I said leucine just to make sure that I was kick-starting that whole recovery process because as soon as you got out of the water after six hours there's always the temptation just I want to pass out I want to just go to bed I want you know and it's just like no you've got now what about your protein what you're getting it mostly from a lot of whey protein deficiency and also as well you've got to think in terms of the boat and Stocking food like a perishable you know food so you know as much as I love my barbecue ribs and everything like that that wasn't gonna happen wrong this small galley that we had on the boat right so did you get any fresh food eggs anything along those lines we did yeah when we could stop in a harbor would you know the team would go out I never touch land but they could go and quickly provision from land and bring a bat but ultimately yeah it would it was trying to find a way that was was sustainable as possible that within the parameters that we had yeah and that was what was tricky what about your joints I would imagine repetitive stress of swimming would wreak havoc on your shoulders yeah and that's why this goes back to I suppose this goes back and I lost a chance a rich role about this actually where once she developed that sort of horsepower program that work capacity that was talking about before from when I ran the marathon pulling a car it was this is such a strange story but I then there again to raise money for that for the Teenage Cancer Trust I I climbed a rope but I think it was a 10 meter rope but I repeatedly climbed it until I climbed the height of Everest so it was 8,848 meters and it was that that actually taught me the movement efficiency plays such an important role in terms of endurance because you you could be you could have the best muscular endurance the world cardio spirit injuries but if you can imagine with a rope climb if you're solely relying on your muscles your arms like the bicep tendon is just you know and then you can be the fittest guy in the world but within that kinetic chain something's going to give like the weakest part so you'll write from that I had the work capacity from the marathon then from the rope climb I certainly understood movement efficiency and sort of transferring those skills over to swimming I knew that you couldn't swim like a conventional swimmer everything that I taught you especially in waves and everything so I ended up developing quite a weird technique that looked really slow and comes to my all so I almost looked asleep but you know it was really rolling and that's why I asked you about swimming and even looking at a bird again to use hims up I know it is triathlon but for everything that is taught about swimming it's probably for someone who looks like you know Michael Phelps or you know amazing specimen swimming so you see in birds fat as always I I am so I'm saying that but for the record you heard that Jamie for the record I've heard it as I repeated on record I think a specimen of a male his belly hanging out its most ridiculous is after he ran a marathon is this pre or post as I brought to because he really lost a lot now there yes he lost 18 pounds during sober October he's the only one that lost weight I gained weight but it was that vide cuz he was dancing in his bathroom yeah he wasn't he would they look at this photo and impact that that's not even the worst one I love wise Bert Kreischer Chrysler so fat that is a fine specimen of nine that's the one that's one but is he because he wore those for the wayand is he got me sober octo he's got a bunch of those he's got more than one for him that's what he wears I love him the fact that he ran a marathon with that body it's amazing it's like yeah running LeMans in a Pinto calm up but and everything that that's not real it's not that big that's a Photoshop or something but it would be the same it would be the same with you that if we were looking at your swimming technique they'd be CERN everything that you'd probably learn probably wouldn't be applicable to you because of how broad you are how things that you could actually use so I was basically really engaging the lats that wraps the larger muscles of the back going back to the the video with Brian Shaw when he was just ripping that yeah yeah you're ripping out the floor and and I knew that I couldn't necessarily do that looking at delts high catch high elbows right well you can do high elbows for a hundred and fifty seventy days but our right you knew so everything that I'd learn and certainly you know great friends of mine who are in a Liam tank got 50 meter world record of a backstroke in a Korean pain double world champion 10 K these are amazing athletes I'm not wanted them so you developed a more efficient slower a style that you could continue for five months yeah and you just end up it's like moving meditation it just became like you know the limiting factor was just like I was just getting bored I wasn't actually breathing what were you thinking of this is the thing I mean you had any given time any tied you had to think of something that was going to be more powerful than the thought of stopping or fatigue or si else's like deeper into your skin and so sometimes it was real easy because you were swimming with dolphins minke whales that's one with a basking shark did they come over to you yeah brilliant yeah there's a video of the ages ago with the the minke whale and the house for 12 hours cross the Bristol Channel so that's kind of England to Wales and this but this was without doubt for all the hardship that I've spoke about I just want to say that there was some amazing moments this one particular moment swimming across the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden minke whale kind of about because this table breeches right next to me I was like whoa like to me surprise I turned to map the captain I was like man am i safe like what's going on actually I get out the warranty said no you're absolutely fine and I was like is he's a minke whale that they find they're friendly I was like okay fair enough so I keep swimming and then for the next five miles the minke whale circling me it was breaching over the top it was coming under me and swimming like that well I turned him out I said like now what's going on and he said I've never seen this he's been sailing like 40 years he says I've never seen this he said but what I think is happening is I think it's a female and I trying to fuck you well I said it's not mating season is fine again what I think happen you for later four months in this water I'm gonna fucking mating season is probably right around the corner she's like if he sticks around no Matt said no no I think it's a female I think that she thinks that you're an injured seal and so for the five miles she basically guided me all the way to the shallower water Wow and as I got there it was literally the depth for the water Matt said yeah yeah much shallower water and we turned whale breached one more time and then and then swam off as if to say you know you're safe now Wow amazing that's incredible amazing yeah so for all of the hardship and everything that I described there were moments and sunsets and and and swimming with seals and and it was amazing whoa so that's the basking shark is that what you encountered yeah so that was in that's the actual one you encountered I don't know if I can't I mean I assume but seems like you could swim in there I was I was concerned about that one but they know so that's a basking shot so they're friendly right at the mat can you imagine seeing that like yes swimming free Scotland not mountains either side of you and so so to your point about asking what you think about it's very easy to swim when when you know there's dolphins and everything but there's times when you are lost in this moving meditation but then you see something like that and you very quickly got to get your wits about you yeah because because there were killer whales as well up you know coming from sort of Iceland around the top of Scotland so that was that was a concern were they interested in knew what thankfully we didn't see any but they wouldn't attack you or anything well so this is it so we were speaking with marine biologist at the time saying look like what's what's the situation here and they said well you know what's really interested they're so intelligent you know killer whales are so intelligent and they've never been known this was what they said to me they've never been known in in the wild to attack a human and I said okay fantastic and they said however if they're gonna attack a human it's probably gonna be you because no one's ever spent that amount of time in the water as well you know so I was like right they said all right so they just said look all you need to do is make sure that you don't look like a seal because they might mistake you for a seal but they might bite you but then they will go oh whoa that that intelligent that'd be like oh that doesn't taste like a seal so they might you know so I was just trying my best not to look like a seal well I think when they've attacked people in the wild though it's always in them in captivity it's always been trainers yes I've been Aang frustration yeah you know and that was my experience with the minke one I think it was people said like how do you swim at night because suddenly around west of Scotland it was a depth of 200 meters so you just you can't you don't know what's under you so there was that element but but I think having swum with the minke well around the Bristol Channel I was very aware that in the hierarchy of the sea I was very low down the pecking order and and if it's comforting in any strange way I was like look if I was gonna be eaten I'll be eaten in the day just as much as I'll be eaten at night right you know it's just it's just one of those just darkness yeah yeah just like you can't you can't see the hand in front of your face it's like the more ether for instance we were 40 Mars away from land and this kind of cutting across this huge Bay across the top of Scotland and you know it was clouded over so there was not that you couldn't even see anything because there's no moon lights or no stars and it was you in that complete sensory deprivation you can hear everything and it's just if you hear a noise a rip or like I really hope that's not a killer whale but they know you've then got six hours to contemplate more it's so it's this and again like I said Marcus Aurelius meditations stoic philosophy that the conversations you have in your own head are just as powerful with other people and I certainly found that all the way around that you just there was times when you am i doing out him like seriously and that comes from I think you know this this idea of you have to be doing it for the right reasons and and I've again to bring it back to MMA I suppose it's really fascinating me you know some fighters you know Liddell coming out of retirement we all tease and certainly you know you know McGregor's made so much money you know what would get him back out of time it's come a fight Mayweather and you know again I've been out at sea so I didn't quite understand what was going on there with the his kind of going over to his Japan fighting and it's like what does he need he's got so much money what would all the way whether yeah they were the spends money he suspends my like crazy he was gonna fight tension tension how do you pronounce his life this is ya know so I've been out see so I didn't really see what was going on here yeah let me see if you find that on my Instagram he's out of his fucking mind would that been a bad idea boy he was a head kicked into a coma but but you kind of asked like what what what are the reasons and I think a I think he spends a shit ton of money he thinks they're saying they're trying to get it back on track said Floyd had been duped into agreeing to the contest like they will dupe him by the way they are very different if those if this happens believe you me he's gonna get kicked in the head Wow they're gonna they might say no no Kiki no Kiki listen man you get in the ring with tension he's gonna try to roundhouse kick you into another fuckin dimension so it was a special battle so there's gonna be no kicking I don't know if they agreed to the rules Wow okay but tension not suka was I think he's 20 he I think he's 20 years old he's a really fantastic talent Wow yeah I mean he really is but but it fascinates me so I'm catching up on all this like I said so I've missed all of this for 150m they looks at I even missed the McGregor and caapi vine says go do striking breakdowns on Instagram Lawrence Kenshin has he's done a bunch of breakdowns as is Brendon Dorman's done a bunch of breakdowns - intention but uh his lawrence Kenshin has this really fascinating video of him fighting this world muy Thai champion and he wheel kicks him in the head was more like a jump spinning back kick to the chin but the way he did it it was like a really weird angle and you could see him setting it up he's really creative and he just found like a weird opening for this guy and just kicked this guy into oblivion right he's nasty and he's really sneaky like the kind of techniques that he lands very clever with his reads and his understanding of distance and and what's possible right you see it striking breakdowns on an Instagram huh but the end it's with this that it you know how much money does he need don't spend that much oh that's a good question I think he can but and this is what I love again I'm only just catching up one of this like said out you I should point out happen at sea 457 days but with everything that happens striking breakdowns on that I just got to it striking breakdowns start coming up no maybe there's something wrong with Instagram hmm I don't know I got it right here here I'll send you the link so we could see yeah anyway I'll send you this copy link sorry folks but this is a I don't know how much they were offering him you know so I don't know how much okay I just sent it to you I don't know I mean it has to be millions of dollars that's the only way he'd be willing to do it mhm but if they offer and he also tension is quite a bit smaller I think he weighs 130 and Floyd walks around he's fought at 150 for 150 ish and foot McGregor was at 55 mm this this kid is fucking nasty man but he does a lot of wild shit like there's a there's a video here they see him fight this Muay Thai guy and he hit some with this crazy that's when he was a little kid like see how he does shit like that like sneaky shit I'm the only this man zip-zip and that he was younger this crank this is the one with the world muy Thai champion boom puts that due to sleep but the way set it up that's a weird angle for that kick very tight yeah yeah very tightly and it wasn't a round it was straight so it was basically like a jump spinning back kick to the chin she's hard to generate force oh no no no no power yeah no as long as he can get extension on his legs it's just he had a jump and talk and spin but the fact that he chose that angle it's like he realized that the guy was gonna see things that were coming around yeah so instead of coming around he had it come up and and through the middle right which is which made it much sneakier but that's what we described me now is it never intangible right yeah in creativity yeah exactly I mean and what I found it so interesting when you know McGregor and Diaz and I was just saying I'm a huge fan of IDO portal so you know he was doing but I was just like look and I think it was um I think McGregor was on I want to say Kimmel but I don't think it was he was on a chat show and he was talking about that spinning capoeira Crescent yeah and he actually did it he performed it and I was like look if he lands that you know the same way with Aldo would be like that is the movement is is it you know you don't forget cardiorespiratory endurance strength everything that we talked about there the metric saying you know heavy what you got to be two four five you know whatever the Milan no it's just movement he would've reinvented again well and I mean come is wrong I think with yes he did try it didn't he and it missed I think um I believe he did through it I think he through it the thing you know that technique is a legit technique obviously wheel kicks most certainly works yeah but it's not a high percentage technique it doesn't it so there's only been a few wheel kick knockouts in in the UFC the first one was Edson Barboza over Terry Adam that was number one there's been a few since then Vitor Belfort shocked Luke Rockhold will the wheel kick it's it's happened before right but it's just not a high percentage kick and it's usually a kick that's you know it comes out of nowhere you don't expect it right but that's but but can you tell when someone has it and doesn't is because it's an intangible so if you said if at the start of the you know barbozza and Etem fight you said you know knockout by timing your creativity you'd say like what would you mean you know but if you could foresee that the same way that you could quantify that sort of mental fortitude I think you start opening the door in sports performance into something that's just this whole other realm that you don't talk about weight as a metric strength car dealer spirit changers you can stop talking is that hard to see again with tight well yeah with creativity especially regards to striking technique yeah that's a that's a crazy intangible because you're essentially deciding when to move and what to do right like you can throw a jab you throw a front kick you can throw a roundhouse kick you could throw a wheel kick and you threw a turning side kick you could throw an axe kick if you're crazy you know there's a lot of different things you can do so what do you decide to do and why decide to do it is it because you have a style like some people style is like Conor likes to hop in and out he throws like a little front leg side kick he throws like that for a movement he likes to keep his arms wide and understand the side waist dance some guys like to hold up like this in a Muay Thai shell and they move forward lifting that front leg up and they they move forward and then challenge with leg kicks and striking technique some guys just like to wrestle they'll paw at you and they look to shoot like Ben Askren you know he's not gonna stand up a strike with anybody he's looking to take you to the ground beat the fuck out of you yeah that's what he does so it's all and what do you decide to do and why do you side to do it and when do you decide to do it yeah when do you engage you know you're throwing some feints you know you don't want to be the guy who makes it obvious that you're moving forward because then like Connor clipped although you get rocked mm-hmm you know so it's crazy crazy sport is but you if you enter into that realm and even start applying more swear so again we talked about that sort of strength deficit as well that if you get someone you know trying to like like John Jones who you know move up to heavy weight is it gonna be will it benefit him when he was strength training for instance you know a common but his deadlift but was pretty impressive pretty impressive I think was six hundred pounds big deadlift yes so when you look at that strength deficit John Jones very lean was using neuromuscular he was recruiting voluntarily all of those muscle fibers it was unbelievable but if he moves out a bit would it be would any more muscle mass be functional and I think when you start the question looking at when should he do that that's another good question because you're beating your body up to do that yeah and is that conducive with high aerobic capacity training like multiple rounds of sparring and bag work and pad were and you're all the lower back muscles that are getting stressed and does that lead to potential injuries is the potentially damaging his discs yeah his knees like there's a lot of a lot of things to be considered and when should you do that a lot of people do you think you should do that when you're nowhere near a camp yeah yeah like you win a fight and then you decide to build up in between camps yeah and I think that's awful even dare until you-know-who huge huge you know welterweight huge yes yeah he's a nest weight in his title shot against Tyron Woodley and then he got rocked right put away so if you're moving up how do you do it do you and do it intelligently do yes but but then there are guys were just you know like they say training is the real eyes of realization of one's genetic potential and when you get someone like you know Rumble Johnson it's just you know no you never met me he fought well no he made weight I'm sorry he made weight against Tyron Woodley didn't he yes he made videos with he didn't make great against Donald Cerrone right that's what it was he came in very heavy against Al Zahrani he's a big motherfuckers what he is you know he's so big for welterweight I think he'll be way better off at 185 pounds but I think many of them will I think there's a point of diminishing returns where they're significantly defeating themselves right to make that weight and then when they don't have to do that they have more energy yeah seen that time and time again exactly but when you did Rumble Johnson he fought a welterweight right he's so big base got like go on and then all of a sudden move move and then you know was it Noguera I mean yeah I could fight heavyweight he did fight heavyweight successfully in in the PFL he not he broke Andrei Arlovski 's jaw he fucked Andrei Arlovski up as a heavyweight and that's what always fascinates me is that and I suppose it's that god-given kind of power yeah for all of the the training it seems you know with someone like Johnson and a he because he said mr anything he said he's gonna come back for heavyweight if DC and Jones go up he's thought about it um you know I think he's he's in the weed game right now is making some money selling weed which is legal now no he's doing that what Wow okay I'm gonna sighs him now but he fought Hardy right yes we fought Hardy and he took him down which was interesting he didn't want to stand with Dan yeah back in the day was a different thing I mean they kind of made an agreement to stand with each other and then he's like bitch bitch and he took him down and he won by decision but that was a different Rumble Johnson I think the rumble Johnson at 170 he had no fucking energy right he was on death's door he was just always exhausted he would lose fights he just he got choked out by Josh Koscheck he was just too tired yeah and I think weight cutting as well obviously you know there's been some changes now but even now and I love max Holloway but it was I think it was UFC embedded where they flew his favorite cupcakes over from Hawaii and he's like yeah I love cupcakes I've made weight and then he's just you know nailing cupcake outsmart no and I think there's just that element now that that I think as much as MMA has evolved and again this is someone who doesn't understand the technical aspects but as someone who loves kind of sports history you know and I've watched it and I'm just like that is amazing but it still got so far to go again we were talking earlier about you know football or you know soccer is known here back in England and the warming up of the the brandy you know in the in the changing rooms I think even now it's crazy when you have someone so gifted like that but they are you know rehydrating and re carb-loading on cupcakes it's it's like yeah there are better this way better way way your body is basically in fight-or-flight you know you've subjected it to a form of micro trauma you know body's kind of sitting there going on and then you're going to get he go his laser cupcakes you made weight yeah yeah so there I find that really interesting that you see some of the guys who you know was it Gleason to Bao wasn't it who just like it was so big it was he got in me it was like he said he'd weigh in and then it would be like he sent his older brother in like they were unrecognizable yeah and and and I think it's really interesting that that physiological puppetry if you know how to do intelligently it can be so powerful but you do it for the wrong reasons but even if you know how to do it intelligently there's still a demand that it places on your organs that's it's there's consequences you're right and and over time your body resists it and this was the thought behind max Holloway's last weight cutting fail is that when he was trying to cut down on short notice to fight khabib nurmagomedov he was cutting down only to 155 and he couldn't make it right and they they pulled him out of that and then he started suffering some significant problems when he was getting ready for brian ortega right and they think that when he was ready for getting ready for take what was going on was his body was reacting to the fact that he was trying to cut weight again and it was like fuck you we just got through this man right you know and he was like really messed up because of it and he had to go through a battery of tests before they approved him to fight again so his body had a like fully fully recover months off and then get back to training and now he's okay but but I think it's changing I mean now I mean Frankie Edgar was almost the first heave to fight like five pounds that he wouldn't even cut weight he wouldn't cut anyway yeah that was his wake well this is what they say Frankie although was the 155-pound champion and now competes at 145 pounds really he should be fighting at 135 and 135 is where he could be at his best that's what everybody says Wow especially people that know like weight cutting and they look at what he walks around and like look twenty pounds from 55 ain't shit yeah you know those guys do it all the time especially you get a guy like a George Lockhart who really knows how to do it and put that weight back on you you know and how to do it correctly scientifically it's but we're seeing that now across all sports I think this evolution that we were understanding asking Carlin Isles is one of my favorites say he was a good American sprinter he was di believe your name top fifty you know he was he was amazing but wasn't quite making it you know he's not a you same boy he's not a Justin Gatlin so they just said hey Carlin his a his a rugby ball and again oh it'll be on YouTube some ways like why do regardez are the fastest we can play they just handed him you know boy now there's one of my favorite clips cuz he it was one of his first games or something and and I think it was an Australian commentator and he just ran like rings around everybody like scored a try and then the commentator was like guys I cannot believe this can you believe here we go look here we go here's the ball oh my God look at him go good boy that is insane oh my god they're all quitting the guy chasing gave that guy there's more this is a love corners and he ran past him like the guy was ahead of it there's no I'm not even gonna sites at you because I don't it's like he doesn't even respect their speed look how much faster is in those guys that's hilarious was that's all in many ways right isn't it like that other guy who broke the world record by rowing you're doing something else and gotten so much power and energy in his body that he could translate that to to rowing and we're seeing that now but and that was what's amazing there with recolonize like I said he scored a he's got to try and then the commentator there was two commentators talking they said I can't believe he's only been playing you know a number of months and there they were like yeah that's amazing and then the other commentator said no no I can believe it he's just tried to give the referee the ball and he didn't know what to do he'd scored a try and he was like just listen man just run but what do I do when I get to the edges get again and then we'll talk I'll tell you what to do it'll take about three minutes baby I think you spoke about it's not too long about I think you might have mentioned LeBron James saying if someone like that I was taught MMA oh my god everybody'd be dead what would happen yeah and I think we're seeing that now that you know sports now there's more money you know in MMA and it's evolved to what it is now it's amazing that if you get you know some unbelievable phenom as a kid you go you're going to MMA yeah but it's not as popular as basketball and it doesn't pay as much money as LeBron James makes cuz you LeBron James what does he make 100 million dollars a year something crazy just from basketball it's like 35 or so 35 million just from basketball like and then sponsorships like unless you're Conor McGregor or Floyd Mayweather you're not gonna make that much money from fighting they can make that much money from fighting but they're so rare right and then Conor could only make that much money from fighting if he box Floyd like even though the fight with khabib was the number one MMA pay-per-view of all time the number two pay-per-view in the history of pay-per-views just behind Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao right it got more pay-per-view buys than Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor I believe I believe that's true Wow look that up I think it was 2.2 million for Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor and then 2.4 million for Floyd Mayweather versus khabib nurmagomedov I think it was number two of all time Wow just behind the Floyd Mayweather Manny Pacquiao fight which is just incredible so they must have made a shit ton of money from that but how many times can Conor do that yeah don't you know I mean look the Irish support him but people thought he had a chance of winning that fight and then once he gets smashed like that I don't think they're gonna think he has a chance of winning again unless he does something significant right right yeah he has to beat somebody like he has to fight like Kevin Lee and fuck him up mmm you know if you fought Kevin Lee or Tony Ferguson and fucked him up mmm and then you know said look I had two years off I wasn't ready for could be but I'm ready now mmm fuck the Mayweather's and he said something like that people he's got to have some success though Floyd Connor was six point seven million Floyd Manny was four point four million and then it would have been right around the next one which has been Oscar and Floyd which is two point four so yeah that's like two point five two point four is I've been right around numbers so number three then number three overall number one MMA number one MMA but number three overall it could be tied so what were the what are the boxing numbers again what was it six point seven for the Floyd Connor 4.4 for Floyd Manny that is so crazy six point seven for Floyd Connor wired my numbers off but with that amount of money that that what it's so interesting that you know with that thrown around this kind of extrinsic motivation money meaning name this is intrinsic motivation and and in a strange way with the swim you know uh when we got around John O'Groats at the top it was everyone was like yeah yeah yeah you just set the Lands End to John O'Groats record well done and those cameras and it was amazing and then I was just swimming across the Moray Firth getting hit by jellyfish in you know six degree waters it was horrible and and I think I think right now as well and khabib fascinates me that you know and I don't know the logistics again you know I've been out at sea so I'm still trying to catch up but he was offered so much money for the rematch hmm but I believe he turned it down could be no right there was talk of a rematch but the UFC did not offer him a right financial sum that was rumors they hadn't even talked they were trying to figure out what to do next and in fact the UFC said that most likely next was Tony Ferguson ok ok so that's that's the current the last time they talked about someone fighting for the title again but it was a while ago now again might been UFC embedded when I and I think it was when could be years ago now met George st. Pierre and and could be you know said lovely to meet you again just who and then could be was smiling and he said ah you know my dad has always said that he'd love to see me fight you know George st. Pierre and and for me that was really interesting because could be motivation seems to be intrinsic and and yeah his skills against the best people in what you could offer him all the money in the world but he just wants to do something you know he talks about his dad his family in it and it's it's a different beast and that's what I find really interesting there but but but I'm not saying different as in better worse good or bad because ultimately Mayweather's never lost but when you see someone like Mayweather you think is he just an extrinsic Lee motivated when he's saying and if it doesn't make money it doesn't make sense you kind of look at him going war you're extrinsically motivated arguably and I don't know I've never met the guy and stuff but you you're extrinsic motivator but you've never lost so which one's more powerful I don't think he's completely extrinsically motivated I think that's a lot of it as an act do you think yeah he's too good looks too good there's I mean there there has to be some some deep emotional connection to his work there's got to be some connection to his legacy what he's been able to do the way he's been able to retire undefeated as a professional boxer which is almost unheard of right because that this I want to believe that and I hope you ask you because because you almost taught like intrinsic motivation do it for the love you know and sort of you know the sweet science I want to believe that Mayweather is there any studying you know but maybe he doesn't want you to see that side ho no he's too good he's too good he's gotta have a love of boxing there's no way he's too good the way he's artistically taking guys apart like you go to the Canelo Alvarez fight and the way he was like it was slipping away from Canelo's big shots and popping him with the jabs like pitch yeah not today not today it was intelligent in his approach to that fight too cuz he made Canelo drain himself to get down 250 pounds right that was a different thing he forced Canelo to cut a lot of weight to get down to his weight class but it being Floyd really realistically is 147 pounds only fighting in these higher weight classes cuz the money's there right it's a fucking wizard man he's a wizard but that's what I mean about like that that will starts mm-hmm he's playing with everybody's head yeah you talk about like psychological warfare you know the art of war and everything like that and he's doing it on a mass scale like we've probably never experienced before well was fascinating was Conor was doing it to him was screaming in his face with a hard-on by the way when at the weigh-in so I don't know how he generated a hard-ass but you know he must have played with his dick before he got out there it took some viagra camping I really think that might have been part of the psychological motivation just just scream in his face I'm gonna fucking kill you you little puke you piece of shit and flow is just like this just dead face staring at him right didn't scream back dead face state coms like tomorrow I'm gonna fuck you up and there ain't no goddamn thing in the world is gonna change there right right well Connor was like the first guy that Floyd ever fought that could fuck him up in a real fight though right was the there was different element of danger there because there was agreed-upon rule set where Connor wasn't gonna kick wasn't gonna take him down was gonna strangle him mm-hmm so because of that Floyd knew he could win mmm but he also knew without a doubt if they were just going to fight fight hmm if there was no gloves if they just put the gloves aside and just had a street fight Connor would fucking kill him I mean it's not a question on my mind is not that not there's not a doubt to be had yeah Connor would kick him from a distance he would probe in with front kicks kick his legs Floyd would start to limp Connor would step in tie him up elbow him take him down smash his face into a bloody pulp do whatever he wanted to him strangle him rip his knees apart with leg locks he did whatever he wanted to him if they were gonna just fight fight em hmm you know and he said that to him he's like if this was a fight I'd fucking kill you he just looked right out of and he's saying that to him Floyd how to just eat it but it didn't matter cuz it wasn't a fight it was a boxing match and he didn't have a chance but do you think that worked with Aldo for instance because I can again this is me kind of just talking more on the the mental warfare side and not really understanding the technical aspect but that world tour was fascinating to watch and the whole way round and again this is me not understanding all that much about MMA but being fascinated with a mental aspect there and again George st. Pierre when he fought Nick Diaz and and they were saying you know we're gonna he's gonna talk to you he's gonna talk to he's gonna walk you down right don't be affected enjoys happy I was across ya won't be and then he was talking so much that George have you even said it just invoked again actually going back to what we were talking about you know our bodies as much as we like to think about it's black and white the complex biochemical organisms so when and I'm not saying that you know the Diaz brothers necessarily think like that but they were I'm gonna talk to you and I'm gonna mess with your bio mechanic do you know you're the chemical reactions within your body neurotransmitters making you for the oceans mind fuck you yes they're doing it for sure they're doing they're not stupid when Nick's doing that to you is like what bitch what's gonna do bitch he's fucking with your head man I remember the first time he did that to Robbie Lawler Robbie was like 20 21 years old and Nik was young too and they're both standing to the they moved into the cage and they closed it and Nikki has just started saying Stockton motherfucker stopping bravi Lara was like what he's like standing in front of him that's against Carlos Condit he drops his the best one was against Anderson Silva he fell to the ground and pretended he was sleeping he put his hands together like he was taking a nap he laid down and I couldn't stop laughing I was like this motherfucker is so crazy he's just like right there drop down and start of relaxing go to the back go back that one's better yeah so when you see him lay down and leaned on his head like I'm just gonna take a nap here like what Anderson Silva did Forrest Griffin and his career but he's doing this to a guy who's the 187 85-pound rather best ever right right and he's not even a hundred and eighty five pounder he's really a 155 pounder I mean Nick Diaz when he was a champion in Strikeforce or LEED XC lead XC right he was 155-pound champion what's what's amazing here is everything that we talked about in terms of intangibles mind-body connection Nick is imposing his mind-body connection on Anderson in that he's gonna I'm gonna back yet with yours fucking with his head for sure what will see the champ why am I not remembering it was it a LEED XC or Strikeforce that Nick Diaz was the champion of it might have been Strikeforce why can't I remember yeah but but why did I think elite XC know he Ali the Fatih lead XC did he oh okay now I remember because that was because mayhem Miller and Jake Shields had a brawl in a LEED XC and Nick Diaz was a part of the brawl they all piled on each other and those chaos but strike that was a him Paul Daley the knockout I mean no but also just kind of yeah like fell and and it so it's it's so strange that this intangible this thing that I'm now fascinated with like energy news leader XE so he did fight him in elite XE that's right so he finally taxi and then became Strikeforce champion that's why I'm confused Wow yeah that he whatever Mayweather did differently to Aldo might have been granted different sports granted but there was something that McGregor was like it's not working the way that when he pinched you know Aldo his neck and Aldo turn around and you know again without understanding the technical element that was for me it was so fascinating watching the two and like you said Mayweather stood there completely stoic you know Aldo was not comfortable with it in he lost his composure and he attacked he attacked Conor in a way that exposed him he got exposed to a counter shot he was he wasn't patient he was very emotional and he just wanted to fuck that dude up and when he's got clipped right right now and look Connor played him perfectly played him like a fiddle yeah yeah hey man I gotta wrap this up it's already five o'clock we just went through three hours they're not sorry it was awesome I really appreciate it and what you did is beyond impressive man I mean it's fascinating stuff and I feel like we could do a hundred of these kind of conversations though often you in Los Angeles this is my first time we'll come back next time we're gonna swim to the moon let me know we'll get Burton again for your record he's an amazing physical specimen of soccer right or like okay we'll do something let's definitely do another podcast this has been amazing way thank you really appreciate thank you alright Oh tell people with your social media how did I get to you know bless yeah um so yeah Instagram just rough sadly spell please yeah I know it gets difficult ro SS e BG l ey same on Twitter and same on Facebook yes snow for thank you thank you brother thank you alright folks that's it for today bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
