the Joe Rogan experience did you ever notice that maybe were for yeah we're probably it's maybe we'll fall did you notice that when you go on there's homeless people I'm in Torah fucking Boulevard I'm Lancashire Boulevard under bridges everywhere has I never come to your mind that anyway you go there's cars everywhere and the between uber and lyft and cab is now there's traffic every major fucking city there's a lock or whatever did you notice that maybe it's not that I hate Cubans or Mexicans or Puerto Ricans or black for Germans or Irish maybe that will fucking fault have you ever come to that conclusion yeah we're just full right now yeah we have to take five years or four I would accept that I would accept that I would accept a special circumstances like why you have family here so but at this point right now I will fucking fall yeah yeah will fall we don't have nowhere else to put anymore we really don't looking no steadies unless we pack them all to Iowa and send them all you know send them all into my where's the highest population of Mexicans in the country I would probably say Southern California right wrong yeah hi they form a ton of shit up in Chicago Illinois you know where's the highest population of Puerto Ricans the Bronx you're wrong Cleveland clean doesn't the 50s they shipped today all the dealers were worth taking Puerto Ricans is putting them to the Cleveland Ohio area to work in the fucking Ford plants and all the other plants and that's all those places sat down all those people sitting there holding on to that dick when you go to certain parts of Ohio there's a suburb outside of Cleveland twelve fucking Puerto Rican Wow you know interested it's I don't think of it as we hate Russians or Charlie Johnny that I look at it from a different perspective at times and maybe we'll fall you know this for me to send my daughter to day camp cost three bills a week I'm not complaining that's a great day kids a science can't they make potions they're learning about light bulbs and electricity my point is I did the same thing for free when I was all I do is walk to my park there's no funds left hmm there's nothing left for these kids you know I don't know if you when I walk into a Dodger game or an event I go I always think of the family of four in America today that both parents have to work you know and everybody has to work if you go by my office for the podcast in the middle is a 24 hour day care and wait times I'll leave my office at midnight I see parents picking up their kids you know carrying the mile over their shoulders into a car you know it costs a lot to control of the American family yeah there's not a lot of jobs well you think you see everybody's driving over if you take all this Uber's is interesting I'm think I doing a documentary I'm just gonna nobis and talking to these people ask them why they're over it yes they had an engineer engineer lost his job 58 years old gotta work Asian fella very nice I tip them extra you offered me to plug the phone I mean you know you know you have to look at that and go wow there's a lot of people in this country without work there's a lot of fuckin homeless people hmm we're running out of money to take care of we got ya Hey did max Holloway is he the one who started the bottle-cap challenge do we know that for a fact he's the first one I saw I'm so tired of seeing people kick bottle caps I saw I was gonna say there's something different about his is that the cap stayed on the bottle everyone else is just kicking the cap off spinning coincidental I know but that that might be to the bottle of Tito's I think that he used but like that's a little more impressive than some of the other people just knock that offer slightly slightly it's not that big of a listen there's a reason why so many people are doing it it's not that hard it's just not that hard he throw a wheel kick like this he just like gets I'm gonna hold it get someone a hold tight and the wheel kicks like this and you have the bottle cap barely on so the bottle cap is like this and just make sure you throw wheel kick like that but you don't knock it off that's everyone else knock it off he kept it on well I think people using water bottle caps which have a shallow set of grooves whereas like the bottle that he used has a deeper would it be more impressive if they showed the whole bottle and that not someone holding it you only I think so I've never even thought once about doing it so like I know how to throw a wheel kick it seems silly to me like with Jason Statham's do it and when John Mayer did it the fucking shark was jumped that assassin I think max called him out on it he did it yeah he called out John Mayer why it's like why does Justin Bieber want to fight Tom Cruise there's so many questions I would watch it I think Tom Cruise will and lock him up with all those crazy voodoo superpowers from Scientology and the aliens belief in himself man the fights last weekend yeah all right I just I so I didn't want to watch him I was on I was in Texas and and I called there's this ice cream and they were in Austin I was like they never have it and they had it one time I was I drove from Houston Austin to get some ice cream really yeah you drove from Houston Austin that's like three hours yeah you drove three hours for ice cream I did oh my god you're embracing the fat [Laughter] people to see you in the later stage James Toney remember yup I don't want to be James Toney I want to still be able to take off my shirt but man I had to go get it Wow Wow but I did watch the fight we are able to do calculations in quantum electrodynamics let's say a quantum field theory in which we can figure out the precision of some thing we can predict it to like 10 or 11 decimal places of accuracy and when I look at the the achievement that was necessary to have Theory agree with experiment to that level and then I listened to some of the discussions about well just take these hoaxes about you know somebody who submitted parts of mind comp to it you know as with Jews rewritten as men Peter right now those two subjects are taking place in the same institution mm-hmm one is incredibly rigorous in demanding and completely unforgiving and the other thing is just like frivolous and nonsense well maybe there's a core of it that makes sense but there's it's not going to get anywhere close to the achievements of the of the hard sciences but the core of it whether or not it makes sense the real problem is the motivation for doing it in the first place well the real motivation may be activism but Activision activism and scholarship aren't I mean there's so many things that I want to be true that just aren't I want beautiful I mean like you know nature you spend time in nature you want to think you know like nature's a community in where the forest is a bunch of different organisms all working together no it's read of tooth and claw everything that you think about universe that is purely beautiful an aspirational is contradicted by some system in nature and that's why evolutionary theory was the first thing on the chopping block it's just like well this contradicts everything we want to claim about organisms well tough luck I feel like there's a way to define this clearly that makes people understand it better okay and I don't I don't know if I'm the guy to do it but I feel like someone there's a this is an incredibly complex issue right where you're dealing with emotions and feelings and people who feel like there's unjustice in the world and inequality and they focus on those things to the point where they're almost participating in social engineering by ignoring reality and focusing on what they want to be true in sort of this way of reimagining the world and they're also demanding compliance this is a big part of this whole right that's going on here then on the other hand you've got this stuff yeah these hard sciences that demand just wriggle is rigorous intellectual debate they demand careful study of the facts they demand a deep understanding of complex mathematics and to achieve these results and to be able to verify them and they're unforgiving unforgiving yeah there's just they're two totally different things and what you're saying is when one of them that is this sort of for a frivolous Airy kind of utopian version of what they like the future to be and interferes right where they want a certain amount of diverse people all not half and I'm not even saying that it's frivolous I'm not even saying it's not scholarship I'm saying that whatever it is I don't care [Applause]
