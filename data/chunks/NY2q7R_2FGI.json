the Joe Rogan experience train my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day look it's just like a fucking baby bird over there hoppity my Bilborough impression that's pretty solid right there it's like a fucking baby bad um so Pat from one Aki unleashes what can only be described as a cartoonish hurling like the Gipsy the movies oh my god is the movie stand by me yeah for Jonah opening in a way that you never see in the real world will this tops that god how can that guy just Pat up you just sit there well he just did he's an animal that Gustin is the guy that got puked on his he stood like this cuz nothing good in his open mouth okay it's fine well in the beginning there's no visual for the first Bob man so you can give a little there you hope that helps you I'm joke is older yeah anybody would you say no to a shoulder rub you're an asshole my foot rub they said if this interview ends with my wife under the tape oh that's you know considered a failure I rather it not happen to stay friends room I've been marked already today so marked morning a lot about that and what was your first experience that was ineffable for you it's like what subs news yeah well the first um the first experience I had with anything outside of the norm was MDMA that was the first like world what I didn't know this was available you know I was in verse like introduction to the idea of consciousness altering experiences and then the next one was psilocybin and then the first ineffable experience you realized oh I am connected directly to the development suicided pretty much things yeah the UM dose that the MDMA experience was just a realization how insecure I was and how insecure but in general are in our interactions with each other and how much of our interactions with each other are sort of dependent upon our perceptions about people are going to react to us and that we have this like woman that that wall completely went away on MDMA and I found that fascinating you know I didn't know that that state was available but then the psilocybin experience was one where I just sort of kind of understood it that was the first time I'd ever really wrapped my head around the fact that this is not the top of the ground and you're not standing on something and there's not an above you but that you're sort of in the middle of everything I've never really had that in my my own head before that was the first time where like it just sort of really dawned on me and I have watched the cosmos documentaries had seen a bunch of different you know right things astronomy where I sort of kind of got the idea that worth the outside edge of the galaxy and this galaxy is swimming in these galaxies but it never really sunk in until the one mushroom trip I'm like whoa you know we should really sort of wrap your head around like that it goes that way forever and that with you know it's a weird sort of turtles all the way down and the DMT was always described in tea as mushrooms times a million plus aliens yeah yeah yeah have you had much experience with ayahuasca no no my business partner the guy makes stuff he's done twice down to Peru now four seven seven to seven days a time oh yeah between three and four experiences also did what you got too much Picchu and too many times that's out of it I mean been there oh oh we've got a co one place I've ever been this really craziest Chichen itzá sale via nature railways and I've ever been to well you're ahead of me there I for some reason I've never been to the Mayan room really but I've been to the Inca ruins like probably six or seven times just just because I go down there so much I do a lot of stuff down which are you know both research and teaching and all that what is your take on you know Oh yo what's a call yo Tumbo or to Tom Cole anti Tom oh that's that the incredibly large rocks and fitted in unusual like jigsaw puzzle spaces yeah fuck did they do that that's a good question what's your town yeah man well you know I don't really know my my opinion of I mean the other place you see that is sucks my model which is you know the ruins complex outside cusco similar thing you know rocks half the size of this room that have been moved around i don't know how they do it but i will tell you one thing you must know Graham Hancock well his had one part okay he his writings have completely changed my perspective on that whole thing because I think he's right I think that the Incas could not possibly have built I mean all of this in the hundred years you know the the height of the Inca Empire was basically from 1450 to 1550 they say before that there was much you know but I don't buy it I and he says his postulate is that the Incas didn't create all this monumental architecture they sort of moved in that this came from a much more ancient civilization possibly us back as far back as fifteen thousand years you know not all the ruins but some of them like the the Sun gate at Lake Titicaca do without godean talks about how look at its astronomical orientations and all that it's aligned with thee with the equinox you know as they were fifteen thousand years ago I think his I think fingerprints of the gods which I'm only about halfway through is just a fascinating book you've read it right yes it just throws the whole picture of archaeology into you know into question he's not a crazy really person he's presenting evidence like these maps yet he talks about in the first chapter this is not stuff that he's dreamed on who also the geological evidence on Sphinx that's another was logical that it brings up yeah the the more recent studies have shown that there's a layer about at about twelve thousand years where they repeatedly find this glass that exists from nuclear explosions when they blow up nuclear bombs war from asteroid impacts right I think that a twelve thousand years ago probably hit by a devastating meteor shower yeah I found that in the same level all across the world they found this you know it was like a global catastrophe at about 12,000 years and that's confirmed and they've been finding this over and over and over again you know it stands to reason that if we do have all these ancient tales of catastrophic events and civilizations wiped out that there must have been something and most likely we are you know we build we fall astronomical events or global volcanic eruptions that changed everything yeah yeah it's not implausible I mean you don't have to you don't have to invoke miracles it's just it's something that happens and somehow we I mean I don't understand why archaeology is it's another one of these things that it's a denial about this stuff yeah or well did you hear what they found about cheese they found the more recent studies have shown that the the oldest the carbon dating they're getting back from these cheese making whatever they were pottery whatever fuckers 7,000 years you know they're making cheese 7,000 years ago that's not that mean that is that's advanced stuff and when you you add that to the really the previous notional so at 6,000 years ago like sumaré those probably the oldest thing we know then they find Gobekli tapping right as they're uncovering that and they don't for sure that's at least 14,000 at least 14,000 right so I think it's entirely plausible it's not that far-fetched to think that there may have been some get some contact with an extraterrestrial civilization I mean you find this myth you're talking about listen necessarily and I'm really sure you jump from civilizations are older than thought to you sexiest other than that yeah oh but they all have this this myth of in the Incas a new world it's very culture of a superior being who appears that there's historically critical juncture and basically symbolizes is any possibility that if that superior being is some dude who grew up in the other part of the world that had the mushrooms their whole culture evolves to a radically higher level and then they get in boats and come over to these eight white people they're still throwing sticks and glue together much they haven't gotten yeah something like that shopping bag of mushrooms ago catch you cats in a couple of decades work it out herself yeah they came back think is the slaughtering people no I got you guys doing it wrong right right so you know I don't know this is why we need to admit time travel so we could actually go back and verify just what the fuck was going on somebody said something was it was one of the most I may have been kurtzweil I don't remember who it was but he said that one day they're going to get to a point where computer processing power is so incredible that you are going to be able to take you on all the data on all the variables of life and circumstances on this planet and calculate those and go back in time based on what we have today and knowing how fast cars are what it takes to burn gasoline but all of these the massive insane amount of data and literally be able to extrapolate what what happened in the past through some sort of a mathematical equation yeah it's impossible for us to wrap our heads around now because we're just not there yet but whatever it's a thousand years from now five thousand years from there literally we'll be able to at least go back in time in Meishan way well this so this is similar to I'm going to say it I think say you're gonna say the physics of immortality now or actually I'm pretty sure foundation is as most foundations like based on that idea except they use demographic to calculate what will happen yeah I'm plan for a society right based on these incredibly complex computer algorithms about here's the demographics here's the economics here's the social dynamics you can predict what will happen what will happen everything the finest level of detail yeah well you know Frank tipplers work the physics would be more child with you know I've heard he didn't everything in that book yeah it's interesting I mean he had this idea that you know computing power like he says like Kurzweil computing power is exponentially increasing and that at some point it will be possible to simulate heaven and that you know people it will be essentially possible to well to enter a simulated world that is the the world beyond death that is envisioned by the world's major religions and but this is you know at the end of time we will in fact all be resurrected into this as computer simulations of ourselves view for you're familiar with this most recent idea of computer simulation theory that they have actually found this self repairing computer suffered repairing mathematical code in the equations of string theory we seal and stuff no this guy was with Neil deGrasse Tyson how this interview with this physicist that's trying to explain it but it was a type of self-correcting computer code that they discovered in 1940 or was invented and created in 1940 I'm opposed this [Music]
