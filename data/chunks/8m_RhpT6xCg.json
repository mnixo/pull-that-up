mm-hmm headphones sir oh yeah do I have to there better lock in would live hey Andrew how you doing I'm good how are you I'm good man what's up chillin man thanks for having me thanks for being here hey I like what you doing thank you I like a lot of things you're doing first of all I like the year you decided to put all your shit on YouTube yes fuck it yeah look it's hard look there's about a million fucking comedians today right there's more comedians now than ever yeah I'll walk in doing there's like a million comedians today yeah and a lot of these companies are overwhelmed yeah no room for all these up-and-coming guys that are coming up yeah and you know some some guys like you are really good I think if there's they're looking you know like how do you how do you get your shit out there well just put it out there on you do exactly that oh yeah I mean everybody just said no to me that was a thing so I didn't have a choice well a lot of people that's happen in the Brian Cowen right now right and then he just did his right yeah posted his thing but he's releasing it on iTunes he's releasing it on all the other platform right but there's no fucking room yeah it's it's a weird thing because I guess for me you know that the stand-up industry wasn't really inviting to me even from the beginning so a couple years ago I filmed my own and especially when I did it in New York and I did five clubs and I did the cab rides in between and the idea was are if you don't fuck with me at least you can appreciate you know this part of stand-up that is being a New York guy did you do 15 minutes that's it yes please oh wow that's cool yeah so I was like I was like if you love the game yeah you at least will take a look at this and maybe support this right and everybody said no like see so said no whoa and I had a show with them humbling you know and but I just believed in a project and I thought it was dope so I cut like I cut a 15-minute version but I'll tell you I did is cuz uh you can learn everything you need about stand-up from asking people who don't do stand-up really yeah like I asked all my friends and just people I would meet up who you watching you know these days and you know they'd say the names we all know and then they'd always say this they'd be like yeah it was funny man but I didn't finish it hmm everybody said that right and I was like all right so it's too long yeah so I cut it down to 15 I did like a 15 minute version of the special I did for clubs and I just put it right on the YouTube and it was weird I like sold-out shows that weekend in San Diego and I was never a sellout guy you know I have a few guys come out from the podcast I do and that messed up but it was never like a like a sellout you know right and I was like well that's kind of weird and then I did a show in like Columbus Ohio you know the was at the funny bone out there yeah a great Club great Club and I think we stolen like 1600 tickets and I was like what the fuck is happening like I was never not in Ohio you know and like people are coming out like I like the thing I was like oh shit maybe people are watching this and I started to kind of like sit back for a second I was like why are people watching man maybe it's short and I was like all right fuck it you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put a joke out a week for a year you know I got another 45 minutes left of the special and I could probably produce some more stand-up I'll just put a joke out a week there was this singer who was doing that and like he just put a song out a week his name was Russ and I was like all right that's he's a worker I can I can at least control that I can outwork somebody so I'll do that and I put the choke out for a week and like the joke started to go and like someone would go viral and I was like yo this is crazy and people were coming out to shows and then my YouTube guy hits me he goes you know something weird has happened and I go what's up and he goes when people watch a clip they'll watch for two hours what do you mean like they'll just get lost in a wormhole and I go so wait a minute so people aren't watching an hour of stand-up on the network's because it's too long but they're watching two hours of mine I'm like why the fuck would that happen and we figured out that it was you made the choice when you're in control your destiny right you'll invest as much time as you want it's hitting snooze on the alarm clock so I'll take another eight minutes I'll take another eight minutes I won't set my alarm clock for an hour later yeah that would be irresponsible but I'll snooze snooze snooze and when people make their own fucking choice it was like it was just crazy to see what happened man it's also the platform the platform mean people on their phones Netflix told me that half the people that watch my special watchin are followers absolutely so people that are watching phones they're they're you're you're on that goddamn thing all day long and it's way easier to flip a channel it's ways you just you get that remote in your hand anyway when you sit yeah that's a really good point when you're on your phone you're going fullscreen you gotta like tap it move it and you don't know what's in it I know if I turn this channel it's espn2 exactly I don't know if I leave this video what I'm gonna see next yeah yeah a hundred percent so a little bit of that there's a little bit of phone addiction that contributes to a lot of views yeah but people love fucking YouTube I mean the YouTube never ends you could be on it for the rest of your life and not put a dent in the content yeah yeah I mean it's space yeah especially if you have like me I got a lot of weird interests like you look at like what it suggests for me yeah it's like shit on the cosmos muscle cars professional pool matches MMA yeah it's chaos yeah archery it's all elk hunting and shit it's crazy like I could never leave my fucking house just sit with my phone plugged in the wall and just shit to you right oh yeah and then relates yeah I do want to check that out as soon as they did that I saw this one back when there was no suggestions remember those days of course the dark days yeah as soon as they start suggesting shit I was like oh my god that's a dig that's a game-changer yeah and then the next video just automatically plays like you got yeah it's over it's like it's just right there you have all your access points to it you know I mean that that was the beauty of it I found it's like you know with the special your fate your your maybe the best joke that you have on your special to someone else mmm it's 33 minutes in right so that guy's gotta wait 33 minutes hoping you're gonna hit that joke right on YouTube like if I had your special not cut it up to jokes on YouTube what topic not you know everything we're under an umbrella you know and you have an access point here you have let's say six different access points with the new special I have out now right it's it's six different pieces so is different access point every cent of time some people might come for a Trump joke some people might come for a tranny joke it doesn't matter right so it's not the situation where you have to go okay maybe I hit 37 minutes in this bit that I love no you're gonna get that bit right away and then you're gonna go back to the beginning and go okay I'm gonna watch this all the way through hmm it's the music model like for me I didn't invent anything I just stole it from music right it's like musicians put out a single for a reason yeah I I kind of I'd like that if you're thinking about marketing yes complete complete like you and I aren't places with stand-up right like you're one of the most famous people in the world right so you don't need to find new people to see you people are going to watch your standup because they're like all right I have an intimate relationship with this guy I listen to him eight hours a week and I just want to see his stand-up right I'm still in marketing phase I'm like how can I get new people to say there's five people that should have comedy specials now Rock Chapelle Louie Burke that's it everybody else should be an acquisition face why I don't know about that man I don't buy any of that I don't first of all I don't think that way I never worry about it what other people are doing I just don't think about it and then to all I concentrate on is doing my best shit that's it right and once I got to a point where I was successful enough where I didn't have to worry about money it was a huge relief and honestly I think I started doing my best work of course because then I wasn't thinking I didn't have any resources that were dialed into how do I promote this and how do I get that going all my resources like this bit need something more I gotta figure out how to really sell that I know I gotta put maybe if I switched it around and so it's all about alchemy yeah you know it's all about adding shit I'm gonna make gold we're all doing it's like stirring in the lab trying to make because you love creating them yeah well I don't have there's no thoughts on marketing now but but that's you found out you love creating yeah sure creating what people some people don't know that like some I feel like success teaches you exactly what you wanted like these people who blow up with stand up and never do it again yeah they never wanted to be a stand-up right right right right it's like if you blow up and all you're thinking about is how do I make this toe knuckle hair joke better right you love the game yeah you're like I know the greatest thing that ever happened for me was I stop desiring things I couldn't control right like I realized oh I don't care about a special on HBO or Netflix I just wanted people to see it right and if they see it and ten people see it that's cool because I just loved making it and if a million people see it that's also cool but if anybody sees it as gratitude right here I'm saying like yeah before I was just this void like so many so much of us are like comics I was just like trying to fill up you know like I'm sure you get you know people asking to be on the show and all that shit on it all the time and like it's just comics trying to take you feel themselves like and I was in tight a little fucking brat probably why don't I have a special one that there's a lot of that go on it's useless bro but I couldn't you know how like every rich person goes money doesn't make you happy and every poor person is like man when I'm rich I'm gonna be happy yeah it's I feel like it's like that like I needed to get a certain amount of success for me to realize man I just love making these things yeah everybody does it's like everybody does and if you don't if you don't mean you're either blessed or stupid yeah one of those things it's it's either hey this guy's just pure or a woman who's pure right from the top and you just use all about creating but yeah it's really just about you know I was talking to shop about it that we were at the comedy store back on stage I'm like how fun is killing killing is the most fun I don't understand how people could quit this yeah quit doing comedy man how how why would you call my got all the shit that I do if they said you could only do one abliss comedy question everything else I could just pretend I'm doing you know whether it's a UFC commentary I just sit at home and watch TV and just talk about what someone's supposed to be doing you can't fake it right Caffe calm you can fake literally everything else everything else you can't fake Ellen yeah you and I can have the same fucking conversation we probably would if there was no cameras no if you and I were just chilling in the main room green room with the only store we probably have the same conversation facts 100% yeah but when you go up there that is a that is a precision art form that requires calculation and also zen-like smoothness and alpha flow you got to be in the zone you got to be in that flow state yep you got to be happy you know Charles got to be focused yeah I'll be having a good time but concentrating on these people and and projecting to them and you want them to have a good time you know the whole ideal is one of the best things about this job is you're making people feel good yes you're you're they're coming out of their house to see you and they come out of there feeling better they have a good time yeah everything goes right they love it no better they and my mom my mom said the exact same things like you're very lucky you get to make people feel good for a living yeah a sickle job yes like how rare is that imagine he's like insurance guys has to like tell people they can't get their bills paid from their car accident because it was their fault our imagine feel like one of those big tobacco guys you're driving around Rolls Royce knowing that someone's on an iron lung somewhere yeah know what someone's drowning in their own fluid it's like it's bull fighting yeah that's what we do it's what you said it so well he's like because people used to always make the boxing analogy and I hated that because I used to box a little bit and like I never at all felt that it was similar like I've never heard a boxer go yeah this is just like stand-up it is like a martial art in that the truth is what works go on that because in martial arts if you like the in particularly in martial arts not just in boxing boxing is a martial art but the only stuff that works is the stuff that works and if you hit a guy he goes unconscious it doesn't matter one of the things that I used to like about fighting was that everybody could hate me and I didn't care I didn't care because when I got in there yeah I'm like I knew that I was gonna fuck that guy up it doesn't matter what his friends think doesn't matter how well loved his parents cheer yeah I'm gonna kick that dude in his head and I'm gonna separate him from his consciousness meritocrat that just gonna happen yeah and there's nothing and you could hate me all day long it doesn't matter but then I had to switch gears a hundred percent in the comedy and I thought they were so different and then I realized because in comedy you have to get the people to like you right you can't just have these ideas and be unlikable can't you get them to respect you yeah but they gotta like you I mean you can get them to respect even respect its liking you like do you have to be someone could say one thing like there's like the late great Brody Stevens who just passed yeah if you looked at Brody's material on paper some of it wasn't funny and when you looked at it in real life it was some of my best material that I ever saw anybody do right because Brody's personality was so likable he was funny on stage that you just wanted to laugh at him it just he figured out authenticity yeah it's yeah and when I was starting out I didn't have that I was I couldn't I didn't I had a hard time making that switch then once I get better it's I got better at stand-up I realized I go there's it's so similar because either it's funny or it's not funny take either it works or doesn't work and your job is not like some comics get they get caught up in their image they get caught up in how they want the audience to think of them yep yeah and they dress a certain way on purpose because they want to project this image and they'll even say things on stage that are kind of gross you know that they're only saying it because they want the audience to think they're cool all right and it gives you a little like you but maybe they're good enough so that you see laughs not everybody yeah say it is authenticity illuminates all those comments can't follow a real comic right never notices like when you see someone who's being truthful he might not even be as funny he might not be killing as hard but it's so authentic that when the comic comes next it feels like they're reading jokes off a paper right right and it's our bodies are keyed into like comedies reptilian if you do it right right you know like a lot of times people ask like why like old women can laugh at the same jokes that I'm telling that like these young people can laugh at and then my response is always it's not their choice like I'm not telling you jokes to your choice like The Daily Show Trevor Noah is jokes about how you want the world to be right I'm telling you jokes about how you deep down via is going at your gut it's reptile shit yeah so it's like if it's in here already right you're gonna laugh for Gus how old you are or goes to how you were raised this is how you feel and I think it's why you guys love Diaz so much yeah doing it mean it's like he doesn't have know how to not be himself is he's like like he's like what is he Latino what kind of latch is he he's a Cuban Larry David yeah do you know what I mean it's just like like what is Larry David the whole show is what if someone was authentic 24 hours a day right what was Patrice raw authenticity 24 hours a day were drawn to that in its worst form in its best form but we're fucking drawn to that and like there's something beautiful that like that's why I always use a bullfighter analogy it's like the bull for me is the premise it's not the crowd mmm the crowd is still the crowd right it's like how close can I get to this dangerous premise right and I don't want to box with it I want to dance with it right I wanted to put my his nose up against my nose and then I want to secure it but before Ice Cube up and do that shit where I click my heels and I do the little cape and I want to entertain the fuck out of the crowd with this dangerous that's what the fuck we did that's why we roll our eyes when we see the pandering shit we're like right what are you wasting this for exact fucking superpower well I think we're in this weird time period you know there's an ebb and a flow to comedy and right now it's the weirdest AB because right now you have this weird comedy that it's people are saying things that they want the crowd to hear rather than saying things that are funny they're saying things to hit all these checkpoints of progressive thinking as a cyst white male it's like a real it's not really special to have that now is called views from the sis yeah it's a play off a Drake album called views from the 6 but the idea is just like yeah these are straight guy views yeah yeah this is what the world needs right now well you know the world needs authenticity yeah whether its authenticity from a trans person or authenticity from a straight guy the world needs someone to go out there and and say what the fuck they really think and have a well measured take on things and that's what I see you're doing what you're doing is you're you're going out there you're expressing yourself and the great thing about being turned down by all these platforms is they can't censor you yes they're not gonna tell you hey Andrew we really like you but um tranny we can't have Trant you can't say that you know why not well I was like how come you can say cabbie but you can't say Tran granny yeah the joke I have is transgender tranny grandmother granny it's yeah dick how is this bad right now what is happening we it's kind of cute bro it's we do it out of love yeah if we shorten something and adda why it's affectionate sort of what uh if you pull your hammy talking shit to someone to call them shorty hey fucking shorty ready yeah that's longer shorty is longer yeah if you add that's why black is wrong right sorta yeah traps what about it that's not good but Jackie is cute Jap are you talking about Japanese people Oh calm the Japs yes Chinese yeah why is that bad well it's bad because that's how the soldiers used to talk about him and the people just talk about him during World War two when they were at war with them so here's my question what if somebody was like you know as one of the most refined cultures and delicious cuisine that I've ever experienced these Japs you can't say you know dance is the best the spics it's like so I was talking to this there's a there was a there's a trans chick that got upset at the joke and she was like you know she basically said to me she's like how you know you probably wouldn't like it too if as you were walking home at night someone called you tranny and then threw a bottle at you and I was like I'm out respond to you know the negative comments but all I'm thinking is if you were walking home at night and someone said transgender and then threw a bottle at you I think it'd be equally upsetting yeah right it's not what the word is it's like there are certain words that are made to make you feel bad the n-word is made specifically to make you feel less you're a black guy is using it with your friends right and even then it is like you can use it however you want but the designation of the word right is to make you feel but that's what it's designed for that's what it for but I think black people have successfully taken a word that was negative and empowered it sure to the point where it's laughing fun a but good times and bad times you could use to describe a powerful person yeah you'd used to describe an amazing artist an amazing athlete yeah use it yeah it is the most fluid word it's unbelievable it's an incredible word in terms of like its ability to be used on you know it's almost like the word fuck right like you could stub your toe and fuck or you could see a Ferrari go fuck yeah it's you know in brazilian it's the word come they use for that when why yeah it's Pau Pau ha okay so like you know like someone will catch a guy in a choke or go poha like that's a good thing or you fuck up yourself you like poha Mikey in Spanish it's a puta holiday yeah like mother bitch yes like a great could be a good thing both I'm out I do but that makes sense like mother but come doesn't even make any stray my feeling of it when you come it's like that is the sensation like that was so good watching you do that almost felt like me nothing and it could be bad in that like your dick tricked you and the fucking this girl you've been trying to avoid and then you come and you're like doing that is theirs we're great women will never understand post note syndrome syndrome because this is something exclusive to us yes like I don't know I like you until I come yeah that's true right yeah yeah and that's why it's so fucked up like when you know women think we're fuck boys and we're pieces of shit as dudes it's like you don't get it I think I like you right everything I'm saying to you I believe right and my dick is just saying yeah we will find out and there are times where you nut and it's like damn yeah you realize you've made a mistake especially if the woman is really into you and you're really not into her you're like oh I made an error and then you do feel like an asshole yeah but if you say that to them they're like you're a fucking asshole Mike I'm just being honest with you ology I got tricked yeah by genetics yeah why can't that be my biology why can't I feel so for women yeah explain what this is like yeah you have this it's like finding out your guy was poor this is what it's like this is how I describe it having an erection and getting excited it's like sitting in the backseat of a really long bus okay and there's some other guy up there driving the bus most of the time you're driving the bus not when your dick is hard when you dick is hard to some other guy driving the bus and all the windows are rolled down there's papers flying around the horns honking tire and you look at it life taking place through a dirty windshield a hundred feet away from you and you're like do you even know where the fuck you're going and your dicks like just shut the fuck up and calm down I got this and then when you come all of a sudden the fog parts and you're at the front of the bus holding the wheel you're like what what am I doing here yeah how do I get here ah and you look down at your deck you motherfucker bro it's it's being a werewolf yeah it is being a where well right like isn't that what it's a data for for oh yeah you're this ravenous creature you're running around doing crazy shit and then you wake up in the morning naked you're verified covered in blood yeah well sometimes sometimes yeah yeah god damn it what did i do what did i do I got to turn myself in yeah it's it's terrible but that's one of the reasons why you know it's so hilarious when you see someone who is a stereotypical male feminist because you know they barely have enough testosterone to keep their heart beating and they probably don't get PostNet syndrome because they just want everyone to love them yeah and they're in this weird state of you know Benedict Arnold there being a gender traitor this really what's going on man that want women to be valued there's men that want women to have all the same all the same opportunities and equality and they want they want to value them as human beings and that's all real though that is real but there's way more sneaky weak fucks that are pretending they think like this because they know that women go good good you're on our side you're an ally come over here ally here you're a male ally and they're always he's like weaselly little dudes with tiny hands and even if they're big they're like they're awkward and if had a lot of time with women and so they just shit on these men who they feel they're in competition with it's a complete hater moves absolutely you see and everything you see in comedy it's like oh I can't do that type of comedy so I'm gonna make that comedy radioactive so that this is the only type of comedy that's allowed yeah you know I'm saying hey that comedy is so for example like it doesn't have to be comic it really be any kind of situation and so you're just trying to carve out the market share right oh that commies dirty that's edgy that's sexist that's bigoted censor it censor it all that's saying is I don't want to compete with pussy with those guys it's a little bit of that but it's also like the same thing you see what the right versus the left like there's a lot of people online from each side they wanna censor the opinions of the other people for sure instead of having a better opinion yeah so it's like and when they don't have a better opinion they just make you radioactive so they don't even have to talk to you yeah your race is hey Joe Rogan you're racist you know what do you mean let's talk about you're like I'll talk to races yeah that was clever what you did yeah I went through that like the second I had an opinion that went against the grain immediately I'm labeled as something and they don't even have to have a dialogue with right they just shut you down well yeah oh you're white supremacist exactly oh you're alright yes oh you're this you're that yeah it's it's it's a simple week way to end the conversation but all does is except it only works it's like it's like a magic trick it only works if you don't know what they're trying to do so how what percentage of the population knows it right that's that's a question I've been trying to wrap my head around is like like you and I can sit here and and see this all day but I think most people are seeking confirmation not information right most people like they start out their day going I feel this way it could be right left central it doesn't matter and then they're seeking out information that confirms that you know what there's a parallel to that with what we were talking about what stand-up comedy in your career because the reason why those people seek out confirmation rather than information is because they're insecure they're not at a good place yes but once you're in a good place like everything feels good like say if you're in a good relationship and you know you have a good woman in your and you're happy and everything's going well then you see a lot of things for what they are versus if you're in the hunt you're trying to get people to love you you know no man you don't have any excel it's like I mean this is a weird like segue to it but like I tried mom I've never did a lot of drugs by tribe Molly at Burning Man right and it was the first time that I experienced maybe outside of like comedy but first time I experienced having like extra love yeah right so instead of operating on a deficit and like trying to make you laugh so I feel the void are like trying to say something interesting so I feel a void I had extra and what I did with the extra without even realizing it is I called my closest friends and my parents and I just told them how special they were now I didn't realize that until years later that that's what you do with excess yeah right so how do I get to excess without drugs right the question for me was also how do I find fulfillment in shit that is not in other people's hands so much like when we when we were talking to the Comi store like would I fucking love about the LA scene right now is that comics have control of it right so it's like comics are pushing the comedy culture right now and it's because they're empowered you guys have money you guys have sustainability with your fans you're not going how am I gonna get another pilot with Comedy Central am I gonna be here of course when the industry ran it comedy sucked you guys are talking about fucking unicycles and shit right and that's why and that's why now it's true and and and and look we would come out in from New York and we would come out and we'd be kind of disillusioned at the comedy scene back here and maybe that was like some New York west coast East Coast beef or whatever and but what's funny is how the ecosystem always balances itself because as soft as comedy was out here all the sudden out of nowhere this show called roast battle pops up right show the heart grow like wild insane but here's a perfect example Comedy Central took that and they half watered it cut it like they would sell cocaine yeah but you're not getting a pure no not even remotely they took all the juicy stuff right out but it was real for you can go there still on Tuesday night and that place gets fucking wild I get sad what do you mean I feel sad for some people that get toasted up there I saw a joke there was some kid who's not retarded but what is it yeah yeah and and and he's up there with his palsy and the other guy goes uh he goes he goes you look like your arms drew your legs [Music] put your body in a blender no he looks like someone put your voodoo doll in a blender oh it was so ruthless but that's what it needed to balance a system right well it definitely helped you know there's a bunch of factors but what would roast battle is first of all there's the there's good things in bad things about first of all Brian Moses the guy who hosted is one of the nicest guys on the planet wolf and that helps and then also he says you know it never gets physical at the end we all hug like this good in that of course you know and then when people go after each other like there's a guilty pleasure to it that doesn't exist anymore it's like there's a guilty pleasure to that kind of humor it's very hard to get if you're a fan of that kind of fucking vicious awful comedy it's very difficult to get anymore because people don't roast each other anymore no they're free yeah there's freedom there and they're soft like like these kids are soft man and it's we gotta stop blaming kids we just gotta start blaming parents like my parents were hard made my mom is immigrant maybe that's what it is she's Scottish but like my parents were tough like my mom let me punch my brother in the face once because he like pulled my backpack or something he like pulled my back when I was like mom he pulled my backpack and I just punch him she's like once it was like for her when she grew up that's what brothers did yeah and like people always do you know I know you have some guys come on the show and they talk about how like it's happening at the college level like where entitling these kids it's I know it's happening in elementary school it's when these kids what happened my boy Marco pointed this out to me both his parents are teachers in Rhode Island he's like what happens is these these fucking kids complain about their teacher in school right and when you and I were in school our parents would go well yeah sometimes your teacher don't like you so figure it out yeah and now these kids go well mom dad the teacher doesn't like me well let's switch you out of this cool let's switch your teacher let's get your teacher fired so they start thinking the world bends around them right yeah and then now to shit with the colleges it's like I can't get into USC and say don't worry we'll figure out how to get you into USC that's that fucking college thing is nuts but we'll get to that I want to know what do you think is the root of the softness like what is the surest is I what's the shit I know exactly what is you know when power is taken it's not given it's taken you have to take it you have to rip it out of somebody's fucking hands per hour right yeah and after you take power out of someone's hands that's the last thing you take it's give right if you have the right Constitution you have the right constitution for power what have you done with your power you've uplifted a comedy scene you've you do these shows where your host them at the improv right that's not for you right that's for comedy okay you're hosting shows at these different places you can sell out arenas but you're choosing to do shows in this city I'm assuming because you understand the value of giving you're operating with excess and just talk about that but honestly the shows are for me to work out yeah to work out but you could do an hour you don't have to put other comics on it Yeah right yeah no I have to say so it's can you come into the show tonight you know the main like The Improv on Hollywood which is sold out I already sold out yeah I was about to try to help promote it but it's like so so what happens is if you have the right constitution for power you take and then you provide for your people you give back it certainly helps it helps you do people don't realize like how helping is addictive yeah that's we can get to that you know in a little bit but like once you realize the value get from giving as long as it's the right person yeah then you just can't wait yeah it's a trick I think that you should keep it all to yourself because when you keep it all yourself you feel like shit yeah you're a piece of shit then you become that weird old miser that lives in the mansion on the top of the hill and no one could talk to him and you're miserable yeah and you can go anywhere no it's uh and everybody looks at you like you're that guy's got all that money I gotta figure out how to get his money I don't want to be you want to be Ali yeah Ali walks around any neighbor he wants he's dead but yeah whatever what he did no security now he could knock anybody out but at the same time if he just goes hey guys give me a second I need one he was older and he could barely walk you would just go everywhere any way you want to love them because they recognized man we want to follow but we want to follow the worthy so we'll test worthiness no you know I'm saying so what happened why these kids are so soft is the the King takes power and then raises a bitch-ass son because he never had to take shit right right and he doesn't want his son to go through what he went through right you know how hard it was to take his power I'm I got one foot you know what I mean I lost a foot in a power struggle and now this son is everything's given to him it's like the spoiled Prince in every movie hate that fucking Prince so I think the generation that's raising kids right now spoil princes the generation before that Vietnam right you know I'm saying like they understood sacrifice war yeah they understood the investment in the country and then the generation that came next was just handed shit yeah hey everything's good we're not we're not going whoa war is just handled over there I don't got to get drafted and yes it's like no I almost think we should all be part of it bro it's like a regret of mine that I didn't do some sort of service because it's like how you complain at all about the country that you didn't put your life on line there's a lot of countries that have mandatory service they have extreme levels of patriotism and this yeah like South Korea for example they took dong young Kim on was it uh ya know who was it sent son Jung that's who it was in the Korean Zombie that's right that's right he took him out of his prime and he had to do two years of service in this great army there's a Robinson basketball player had to do that Navy time really Joe yeah like you want stand because we're so detached and I don't hate on people for not realizing it cuz we are detached it's what we do like little you know some child slaves make the iPhone them you know we're like I just go you can only really be connected to what's in your world direct world I'm cool with that's life it is what it is there's really no good or bad things are you know what I mean so it's like that's something to get to but it is what it is right they were trying to do an ethical phone remember that phone was that phone called again they were they're putting together some ethical Android phone man come on fair phone yeah it wasn't fair nobody bought it fuck that shit was expensive I don't think it's more expensive they have a fair phone to pull that bitch up let's see what we got let's see if it can fuck with I'm trying to get off the Apple tip I told you I got this Galaxy Note now you gonna come back you're gonna come back bro how beautiful that screen it's always freezing the pictures isolated true that's not true come on I got a pen this has a pen a modular phone that's built to last what does that mean that you can like attach it to it onto the phone that you built to allow ya so you could add your writings yeah oh that's gonna break and definitely that can't be waterproof it says batteries are those batteries yeah you replace the battery yeah yeah those memory used to be able to replace batteries you said pops out the back your phone Adams got a samsung galaxy like seven or some shit remove a little battery Android seven this motherfuckers got Android nine you need to catch the fuck up nah bro what else fair materials look there's a white lady in the front how fair three black guys who are working for what the fuck is fair about that picture if you're gonna help here materials how about you have white guys in their 50s working in a factory and not Chinese babies we don't have to acknowledge that like you know yeah I mean make it fair make all these people all these people who want to buy iPhones and you want to have your iPhone built by some Asian slave you know pal you work for a year in a secular army you wanna I phone put the time in right but we should acknowledge that white women really kind of are superheroes in that way white women yeah how so cuz like that only people who care about the environment the only people care about animals only people who build wells in Africa like they're real my friend Justin rent builds wells in the Congo he's a six foot 324 fucking top ten heavyweight ask him who are people helping them it's Rebecca no no no miss Phyllis might be a lot of women that you work for about a lot of men at work for him to the station they fucking in it they're getting it hard right now because I think they're tired coming at white men so they're looking for the next you know when the grease is boil and you got those someone in it but when you won't talk about humanitarians right like who gets fucked by more races than white women true like this is really true true except who gets the short end of the stick there is that a penis size joke don't even women know Asian men probably fuck the the smallest percentage of different races right yes America at least I know the rock a hundred percent yeah yeah they do the yeah I think they have like something like tinder they do so my tender studies showed that that is a weird thing yeah cuz the Asian women no problem at all but other ethnicities it's weird that it's not made to size right how so like like you'd think that it's made to site like Lego tiny women would be into know just like vagina would be like you know I've never I never thought that like asian pussy was that much smaller than like everything research you know I had a miracle evidence you know yeah well you know this doesn't make a hundred percent sense okay but I've met girls that were tiny that you could not fuck hard enough yeah then yeah but none not just that it's just like they want it like that they want they want savage they want to get fucking smashed YNS because I think they realized that they they're tiny they have small genes so they want to get savage genetics inside them so they have survivor children I really believe that I think it only makes sense some more nice curls have irritated my life way about a hundred four pounds and these big Brienne of Tarth chicks want it real soft no nice baby they want it because they know that those are the little girls a fucking giant it's gonna keep going it's a never-ending battle for genetics dude it really it's a hundred percent it's a never-ending battle of genetics and if she dies girls fucking these like beta dudes may not do it for a little while they barely fuck them they always say they have headaches listen I know a lot of beta dude who is it dude the girl does like I can't they don't want to fuck the guys dude I had a friend of mine who was dating a guy like that she was I really like him I just do not want to fuck him no wow because why would you like that is rough what are you gonna do stop fucking dude it's it's dude it's insane man it's like I see this all the time like these like hardcore perceivably hardcore feminist chicks yeah you know they'll hear my comedy could be the opposite of that right and they're in the DMS right saying I don't know why I'm here because I think feminism in general is a direct result of a failure by men to be fair and by a failure by men to be actual men and to raise actual men who treat everybody with respect the the when men are abusing women those men are bullies they're they're weak men the kind of man that would do that to a woman that would like physically abuse a woman that's a weak man right right that's the type of man that would beat up a smaller man or take someone from someone with force insecure he needs to feel powerful he's a bitch yeah he's a bitch right the the antidote for that is to be a strong man right like do one of things I've been telling people like this is how you fix bullying in school okay them out of fight not the bullies I mean not just the not just the victims but the bullies themselves out everyone now to fight when they feel confident that they can defend themselves they don't have to nicest fucking people in the world yeah martial artists you know and go to martial arts gyms go to a jujitsu gym I'll take you there are fucking nicest boys there's no hugging everybody and friendly they're gonna choke each other half to death and help five minutes and before that they're all found happy playful yeah they're so secure and outside of there there's social secure and relaxed they're a different type of type of person obviously not all of them maybe there's people over to move apart yeah we very wildly right but almost always to a human the mean wants whether it's mean women or mean wet male yeah women women will tell you this yes work at an office yeah and they've got a female boss that's a cunt yeah that is one of the worst fucking because you can't even fuck her there's nothing you can do nothing you could do to make that bitch happy she wants to take from you she wants to squeeze your blood at least if you're cute and your boss is disgusting and he's a fucking asshole you could flirt with him a little bit and you could like maybe get him to like you more to it obviously don't do that but with the female boss you have a personality too shocking what the female boss not even that a lot of women don't like women right one of the things that I love more than anything yeah is when I talk to women and they'll do this thing where they look around to make sure no one's looking no one's around I'll go look I would never say this publicly but some bitches are fucking crazy that's what we do the thing about these yeah yes well this women feel like it's they've got momentum in this little war of ideas right with the me to movement Bill Cosby getting arrested and r.kelly getting arrested Harvey Weinstein in my opinion and I bet you think this - these are good things yeah when shitty men get put away or they get arrested for abusing people yeah whether it's their physically abusing men or physically abusing women it's always good you shouldn't be physically abused again I'm out of here yeah I beat those guys up yes I mean this is handled in the community when we were younger teenagers a bottle blood you know was rough with this whatever who was rough right and we went over that engine if you were married in Harvey Weinstein tried to fuck your wife and she went in on an audition and you knew that there was all these sorority guards and all these fucking levels before you got to him and your wife got it to that level and he was treating her like shit and being mean to her and telling her if you want to work in this town you got to suck this little fat dick I'm shocked like somewhat didn't Brad Pitt try to send home or somebody did step to him did he swing on him I don't know what he did because you got him right like well that's the other thing that's fucked up about this is like there's gonna be Weinstein's yeah like these people are gonna exist listen man they still exist yeah they still lose hearing about one last night the most I can't tell you hon ik cuz I don't know wait he's a television personality who's apparently a closeted homosexual Oh what he's out there and he's out there like dudes yeah just that go on a landless no more I don't know he's trying really hard I'm making him uncomfortable really really how how well-known I don't know crazy fuckers out there they're still rolling it old-school yeah they want to get caught okay I'll swear he's Brad Pitt threatened to kill Harvey whines yeah but you got a swing man but you got to swing on him bro you gotta leave some marks I believe it so what depends on what Harvey did versus we if he grabbed her it did anything to her physically then you got to swing on him but if he just said something creepy and you tell them okay then we have word take your fucking life yeah I'll take your life well I think the issue with these things is like we know we're gonna have Weinstein's but the people that protected Weinstein yeah the second you complain about a guy for groping or doing something crazy right mm-hmm you that woman is doing exactly what she's supposed to do right she experienced some you know sexual assault and she's telling ya right now if you silence her shut her up that's where the system falls apart right right so whoever is protecting him throughout he got it they gotta go to machine that woman did exactly what she was supposed to do right there's gonna be Weinstein's throughout life unfortunately a question what about the support staff all that many people send all them are almost there not worse because they're not doing it but they're so bad because they stripped the person who was assaulted from like not only equality but like they stripped her from from life in a way they made that person go oh shit life isn't fair and I don't have a shot do you know the expression on diffusion of responsibility it comes when there's large groups of people that watch something if someone's gonna step in it's like that lady Genevieve sees or something remember that there was some woman who was getting raped in Queens and she was screaming for like 40 minutes and there was all these neighbors around like yeah I heard it but I thought Ted was on it oh Jesus you didn't hear about this no I think Katie Genovese or something it's an old story but yet everybody see it it's the same kind of thing it's like well it's just how corporations work so if you're working for a corporation the corporation's dumping pollutants into the river you know you feel like well it's not my responsibility I just work here in accounting okay you know like somebody else is gonna handle this right yeah this is and I think when if you're working in like The Weinstein Company and you knew Harvey was out there slinging dick first of all in their defense you probably didn't know the specifics right because it's like oh Harvey's a dog he's always out there trying to fuck yeah well that's sort of normal yeah like a lot like people have to understand this why does a guy like that get rich why does he get rich is he like some patron of the Arts who loves creating maybe there's a little bit maybe he likes power yes you like power why do you like that power what are you getting out of that power but you have a Ferrari once you have a Mercedes once you have a mansion what are you getting your getting post baby pussy not even about the pussy it's about power right it's about power so much shit I giving these pedophiles I don't even believe anybody's attracted kids well they definitely are I don't believe it I believe they're attracted to power and they're so wildly insecure that they need to be looked at like a god and children when they look at you somebody that they admire something they truly look up to etc they can look at you in that godlike state and so I don't think it's a physical thing like I was watching that abducted in plain sight mm-hmm he he gets whacked off by the dad right what you didn't see the subducting plates oh my god oh this guy this this pedophile destroys the whole family bro he to get to the daughter he fucks the mom and dad what this is insane is this not enough Netflix yes you've never and they censor kinda can imagine that imagine they don't censor comedy though they don't they haven't censored mind not you're not but it's like and we're the bad guys essentially but like my point is that is a crazy story it's there's a dynamical power like like people say the Catholic Church makes these people pedophilia pedophiles no they have that thirst for power and they're going who in my community has that amazing power where they're looking at him as this godlike figure oh it was the preset our Catholic Church that sounds like an evil choice let me give you an alternative expected from psychologists okay there's a thing called imprinting that happens with young men in particular sexually it happens with young women as well but one of the things that can happen is young men can be sexually molested by other men when they're young and they develop this imprinting the the vast majority of people who are abusers were abused themselves right and there's some horrible hijacking of the psychology of the person when you're a six year old boy and some grown man has cock in your ass because there's something about that it fucks with their head especially if it happens a lot right it becomes a part of your life and the guys nice to you as well and buys you things and does things for you and then you get older and you for whatever reason perpetrate this same horror on other kids this is some what happens what is I don't know what I think it's maybe maybe it's a combination of both right maybe you have that imprinting right and then it creates this massive void that you need filled like I think so much of everything that we do everything that people do is about filling the void and what is it that you need the void filled with dictates off how often if you're evil sometimes if you're good there are some people that are addicted to working out right there's a void there they need a fill some people addicted to eating those are the same addiction essentially but one is a lot better to have than the other you know it's like even with I mean there's even with Kanye right like I see Kanye as like this guy who's just wildly insecure and he's trying to justify his coolness constantly by taking things that are not cool at all and making them cool within a community within his community right so it's like everything Kanye does like down to like it started with like the wasup culture I'm gonna take like preppy New England you know polos that are pink and shit and I'm gonna make that cool now before the hip hop community I mean I grew up in New York we were like yo that's some gay shit bro what the fuck is that now Kanye where's it's like now you gotta look fly and this these pink waspy things and my khakis whatever then he takes grunge culture right this fuck have you seen the bright that's ripped sweaters and all kind of shit that's Seattle Nirvana shit but he said oh I bet I'm so cool I could make it cool right then takes dad sneakers I'm so cool I could you know you think my community loves cool sneakers I'm gonna make dad sneakers cool and then what is the most uncool thing to his community what Trump know and what does he try to make cool it's selfish is all about him all he cares is about proving that he's that dude and he takes the most uncool thing and puts it on his head and he's like yellow I'm gonna make Magga cool and that's when people are like at least his community was like nah we're not going we're not gonna play with that shit you know what I think I think you know how like you have something that's supposed to take like eight volts you have like a charger yeah supposed to take like you go to Europe and you plug it in right well like when you plug something to the wall like we have alternating current like you could have something that takes way more amperage right I think Kanye has the wrong plug to the universe and in a good way okay with that motherfuckers getting like a hundred volts all the time yeah so he wants to do you ever talk to him no I talked to him on the phone and it was a stream of consciousness that was so intense I was like okay now I get it I kind of got we had a long conversation he's a very nice guy yeah we had a long conversation for like 15-20 minutes on the phone which is the long conversation these days on the phone yeah who the fuck talks on the phone he does yeah but you're I think hundred volts bro okay he's got design going through his head and new song lyrics and new fashion and all this and I think he's just catching whatever he can yeah and hold it on to it and waiting through the waves to fill the Joe to fill there's a little bit of that but with him it's almost like affirming that he's okay because he's so much different than everybody else like Elon Musk like a lot of other people sure what's up did when he used the Confederate flag do you know about his statements on that he he said that like he used this in a quote what does he say oh react how you want any Energy's good energy the Confederate flag represented slavery in a way that's my abstract take on what I know about it right so I wrote this song new slaves to look at the Confederate flag and made it my flag it's my flag now what are you gonna do right can I take my equity and see if I'm so dope but that's also his recognition that you can take something like the n-word and use it as a positive you could do anything I mean look if if black people really decide I just I'd do this bit okay go Isis bit about do you remember when the fucking duck dynasty guy was he was talking a lot of shit about gay people's like I don't understand it I don't understand and I was like look I don't understand yellow cars understand why you wasting all your time yeah you better be nice because I go if you keep fucking with gay people they're gonna do something and they're gonna do something and you're not gonna be able to take it back like what if gay people decided to take over camo and the bit was like look what they did to the rainbow looking on the room I go you can't wear a rainbow shirt anymore everybody like bad it used to be leprechauns and pots of gold now it's dudes but fucking broke would have to do is start off every gay porn in a duck blind two dudes dynasty and you get the gayest black guy in the world camels like some about duck huntin make me horny yeah and some dude just drops in out of nowhere and pulls his camo down sucking his dick if they just had all porno and camels it it would turn camo into a gay thing and if black people just just went whole hog on the Confederate fat look at them they got cam a wall paper so absolutely that's like some Annie Leibovitz shit though that's like some Vanity Fair cover nonsense you know that's like some organized shoot very meta those are we they know what they're doing though these guys are smart they're by the way that's a shit pattern that's a bad camel pattern well Ducks might be their pattern yeah I bet it is there's a swamp it's like I don't know you know the gay shit is like you know it's just it's not the climate for it and I feel you know it could be don't remember deliverance yeah but it's like a pig yes yeah but that was that was rape row just so we're clear bro that guy is fucking you this is about sex and power I get it you're not gay but it's still suck people want it man that's the thing I don't know I think the kind of thing like he's just a guy who thinks way different like for whatever reasons the connections that's one of the reasons why I think this Kim Kardashian relationship works so well okay it's because like I bet she just handles normal regular stuff and he could just be Kanye I mean like it seems like there does he see difference yeah how different deaf different different like tell me it's me cuz the music is phenomenal outside of that okay it's real simple yeah have you ever been locked up in a mental institution no he has yeah they don't just lock you up bro they never locked me up yeah you know my wife never I never came home my wife has some fucking two gorillas that are in those lab suits they're staring I'm in with the big guys Hospital like sir we'd like to handle this quietly just go to the mental institute bro they fuckin they velcro you what the mental exertion doesn't mean that your genius there's a lot of crazy people who are just crazy yeah yeah well he's definitely crazy sure but he's also but he's brilliant to see the work that comes out of that crazy is genius work right so what is it about him that allows him to be so prolific as an artist ever notice how prolific is yes the guys constantly wears it constantly banging out songs Khan and there he doesn't have bad albums no he's is phenomenal at music without a doubt phenomenal at music but this is all from this energy that's inside of him he figures out how to channel that energy and put it in good ways but occasionally like it's not all he's not a coincidence it's not a coincidence yeah that when Kanye was on stage I think it was in San Jose yeah and he said that he didn't vote but he was gonna vote he would have voted for Trump and the crowd went crazy and they dude the shit out of him and then he canceled his tour and then he went to the mental health institute right all that shit happened together because he felt the pain of this then his response to that was to double down his response to that was to tribute qualities to Trump that he doesn't even really have right and so Trump in his so in a lot of ways very wise the way he handles things socially he let Kanye coming to the White House man where that Magga hat just rant up a storm yeah yeah Kanye could define who Trump was he could define what loving Trump meant forget to find why black people should you should embrace Trump he could define all this in his head to sort of justify what went wrong with him right and then Trump just sits there and goes like this and lets him talk and then he leaves and Trump goes what the fuck this shit right here that's what this is now look at that white lady with their arms crossed the bathroom watching the blonde chick right there in the center look at her face she's like okay what her face says okay what and Kanye's like show and Donald Trump is phone and Counting Donald Trump goes lips pursed yeah phone mmm Kushner show me some lyrics like a devious smiling face dude how about the black dudes sitting there like I can't believe he's like what in the fuck do I do you gotta be fucking Ryan Gosling with the boom mic oh look at that guy yes I can't wait to get on gab and talk about this amazing meeting of the minds look at his face his who Trump reached out to know I'm friends of his son though like texts friends really yeah he's a nice guy he's a hunter we know each other through mutual friends writing one of our mutual friends who committed suicide oh so I was like no but he's a nice guy I mean I don't agree with a lot of things that a lot of people that I know agree with yeah I think I think we're allowed to be reasonable and cordial with each other yes well you matter what do you laughing at what is this Jim Brown was also sitting at that no Jim Brown used to do the early commentary for the UFC really yeah men used to wear one of them African hats there's like traditional yeah he was like he did my job for the UFC like UFC like one and who is he MMA savvy no he's just a dude you know sort of fuck people up that's true he's Jim Brown man yeah yeah now the guy on has left our left to our left is build super foot Wallace okay that's a world champion kickboxer from the 80s he's a legend in the kickboxing world there is Jim Brown I just started taking a couple kickboxing yeah classes trying to learn you gotta get friends for it yeah I use the box right so it's like the most humm first of all it's nice to have something to like want to get better at that has nothing to do with career sure that's really fun you know but uh the the interesting thing about the kicking aspect of it is uh when I when I would see you guys learning how to box like the hook is a tough punch for people to get right because it's something you almost have to kind of like pop right and people try to throw it instead of let your body throw it and that's who I am with kicks mmm I feel the like the exact same person I was trying to teach how to throw it's just my body doesn't want to let the legs go that make sense yeah yeah I'm not slipping yeah you know I can help you yeah yeah I used to teach right yeah that you do not it I could definitely help you with that yeah you know what to think the way to do it is you do it slow right yeah you do it slow and you don't try to hit anything hard yeah when you try to hit things hard then you tense up yeah herky jerky and goofy yeah key to learning how to kick is to do it slow so that's a big part of it yeah yeah yeah it's a you know try to smash you just try to like get your torque right right right make sure you're pivoting off your bottom foot you know the support foot at the pivot almost with every kick basically yeah with every kick your support foot pivots support one is the one that I'm standing on yes yeah yeah yeah that standing foot has to constantly pivot it has to go you have to be you have to be planted right but you also have to be able to move with it it's like a coordinated dance yes that's why it timing and kicks is so difficult because you gotta you got a time it and then you got to twist your body in right at the same time but everything's got to work in coordination it's gotta work in concert such a cool I think kick boxers got to be the worst marketed sport in the world I know that's what I said do you it's the greatest sport it's to me in basic for stand-up fighting yeah it's the best of what there's a company called glory okay and I've been trying to edit the Japanese one no no no they're American alright I'm sorry from the Netherlands from Holland find out where they're from okay but they're international they do a lot of events here in America right but they're on UFC fight pass and I think they're on espn2 what headquarters are in Singapore Singapore oh that's interesting that's new they might have got bought out could have moved there too okay so you're trying to do some of the best fucking fights you'll ever watch in your life I watched I have a in my studio my gym I have Apple TV and I watch glory I'm like an app okay UFC fight pass okay I'll watch it and some fucking amazing fights so why can't they most people don't know because Dana White has a really good point in the 1980s with that bill super foot Wallis guy was fighting he was actually before that he was in the late the seven yeah and then into the eighties there was a thing called PKA karate and it was on ESPN and it was terrible and it was kick boxers who are basically like not the best kickers and not the best boxers and then it was like kind of goofy and clunky there's a few guys like Rick the Chet Rufus and some really popular guys who were really good that we're also doing it at the same time for the most part it was just terrible to watch right it was boring as fuck yeah and then you'd watch boxing you'd see Mike Tyson at the same time so Mike Tyson's on TV Marvin Hagler's on TV and you watching these guys and these guys are like out of shape and they're so tainted the well a little bit you're saying laughs yeah a lot yeah it's an muy Thai for whatever reason I mean you go to muy Thai events and they're rabid and it's like a very deep community of people that really understand and appreciate the sport yeah they'll play the Thai music in the world of Hmong Kong on their head they bow to the train legs and it's amazing to watch same thing is kickboxing more or less moist the hardest it's the hardest it's above all of them more version of kick box because it's elbows and knees and a lot of clinch work and a lot of dumping where they trip you and slam you to the ground and and they kick you on the way down to they look like if you're good they'll throw you into the ropes and if you're still on your way down you're getting punted in the head yeah yeah I mean and it's legal it's a hard sport man it is just you feel like hard as it comes no no you feel like we could get people to get behind me even you'd have to have some sort of an epic change in the way we view things but to me it's way more exciting than football like if those football players all decided to do muy Thai it would be better for their brains right believe it or not yeah a fighter and two you would see these elite athletes fuck its little mash in each other let's talk about it be incredible I want to talk about because I was talking to Brendan about this and then and Izzy is he came on one of my podcast and we were talking about when when are the elite was Izzy out of Sanya oh yeah yeah yeah Oh style bender yes that's a style dinner man that's my guy man I love him he's the peas light East he's a perfect example of of the style that is so fucking exciting to watch mm-hmm shows his opponent he's fighting this dude that's the Loom yeah Gastelum who is one of the elite of the elite out there as well saighe wrestler short stocky blasting striker good recipes whistling I know you see these fucking wrestlers as how our world their toughest fuck but they have power it's it's a unique thing because sometimes the jiu-jitsu guys don't have power with the hands but these wrestlers it seems like they offer our and I was asking some folks around and they're like its core everything awesome yeah some of them but like Ben Askren who's probably the best wrestler right in the sport doesn't have any power doesn't even try yeah but he's just about getting you to the ground fucking you up right he's just he just has such unbelievable confidence and he should he's undefeated in his wrestling yeah that he just concentrates on absorbing whatever he can grabbing what is his I mean like maybe I'm just such a you know newbie to this but like whoa I don't understand his his leverage point like what is his skill is he's he's so strong that his is it's a grip like what was not doing physical strength its technique it's an understanding of it you got to think of wrestling the same way you would think of chess like if you only know a few moves you're not gonna beat a guy who knows all the moves he knows all the moves so once he's locked with you you defend you think oh I'm gonna stuff I'm gonna dig in my hooks I'm gonna pummel under here and I'm gonna defend here he knows you're gonna do that so he's oh he's shooting waiting for you to palma as you're pummeling he's switching to the inside he's tripping you he's grabbing hold your legs it's really awkward way he's rolling back he knows your weight is going to be going in a certain direction he's anticipating several steps ahead and he has international wrestling competition experience which is just next-level he's wrestling these guys from Russia and Iran and some of the best wrestlers in the world he there's levels to this fucking thing yeah yeah his levels it's ended but the same you could say about style bender see the thing about style bender is he's an elite kickboxer he lost the glory middleweight title in a very controversial decision to Jason willness who was one of the elite of the elite one of the best guys out there so style bender competed at the highest level of one of the most difficult combat sports in world and in that world he's known as a precision artist writing that world he's a technician he's not like there's some guys that are just thugs they got a good low kick they get a good shell they throw bombs they're willing a brawl they know a few things they know how to pump the double jab and lead and to get that inside leg kick in yeah style bender is a different animal he's switching stances on you he's hitting you with upward elbows setting things up I know this in with the fancy food he fucks people up there's a video of him the the one when he went into god mode that I had on my Instagram that Lawrence Kenshin broke down do you fuck people up man and he fucks people up in an artistic way - the way he picks his shots yeah he just knows what you're going to do before you know what you're gonna do and he has several steps so he has that same level of skill that Ben Askren possesses in wrestling yeah he hasn't kickbox what is more valuable on an open site here like you stand in front us - Boxey setting him up looking for the moves wait wait to see how the guy responds and then hit watch this Samson it and he walks away the walk away KO one of the most devastating psychological maneuvers of all time he's a special guy but there's no one thing that's better right the most effective form wrestling because of the best wrestler can dictate where the fight takes place the best wrestler can get a hold of a guy and drag him down like khabib nurmagomedov who might be the best fighter in the world he's the UFC lightweight champion and what stands out about him is that he can get a hold of guys and once he does they can't do jack shit about it he's not the best striker in the world but he's good enough so you have to be scared of him on the feet because he dropped Conor McGregor I mean he could tag you he could walk you up he's got power he's not guys out but more importantly that's to set up the clinch and then once he gets the clinch you're his that's it and you're going for a ride and he's getting the fuck beaten out of you on the ground and you're getting strangled that's just how it goes but he has he has the full skill package like he can strike with you he can submit you but his grappling is what allows that to take place now with style bender style benders grappling allows him to stay up on the feet see he's a very good grappler in terms of his ability to get back up and his ability to stuff to take he's got the sprawl he's got or whatever yeah and not just sprawl but he gets the fuck out of there he pushes your head he pops his legs out yeah kicks back and then he punishes you on the way out yeah take that with you yeah a great distance yes it's different I know this is different like with the the the sports that involve legs but like you guys fight it at a further distance of course you have to and but it also makes you you know susceptible for counters in a way like like when when Connor was fighting Floyd my biggest concern for Connor was not speed or counter punching it was the distance that you're gonna be able to counter and when when Connor caught Floyd it caught Floyd a couple times in the beginning I think one was a left uppercut it closed one that was shocking to me because I was surprised that he had boxing counter punching speed the distance is half yeah compared to a kick sport yeah I would say if we're standing what two three feet away from each other in kickboxing it's one and a half mm-hmm in boxing right so to cut that distance in half and still have the counter punching ability was impressive yeah I mean well he's done a lot of lower level boxing and the gems is when you get up to that level it's a different fucking game Floyd Mayweather is on a completely different planet than anybody he's the greatest great of all time that's what I'm eating like I think he's better at boxing then Stephen Hawking is at astrophysics you might be right look he's 50 you know the Conor it does count even though it probably shouldn't right I mean it was a real boxing match but it was a guy that had zero professional boxing memories but he did get tagged Conner Kent punch he's a good fighter he's a very good mixed martial arts fighter but the thing about Floyd is that Floyd is the best at not getting hit on Owen's better so I've been tagged really tagged like three times four times in his whole career I can name him five times yeah it's Sugar Shane Mosley yep Maidana the end of the fourth round yep the other ones are early I'm Judah right hook actually dropped him Zab Judah was a wicked man it was great I was a kick box that's right he came from that at us what his name something something do you ever forget his name but all guys do all do it yeah and then uh DeMarcus chop-chop Corley oh that's right I forgot him oh yeah yeah yeah my pops is like a massive boxing fan used to like go to Ollie's uh he was a journalist back they use to cover like Ollie and his fight Selena so I kind of came up you know generationally really boxing so that's awesome yeah dude it was like I mean some of the best moments you know what else poised has gone him that uh the best jujitsu guys have gone for him is that he's not physically powerful like the best jujitsu guys are smaller people right because the smaller people learn how to use leverage and technique and they can't muscle things whereas if you're like a 250 pound gorilla you're some cable football player dude and you're like man I want word some book Jiu Jitsu yeah if you don't ever have to be on your back right now like I was talking shop about that go shops thinking about doing jujitsu again yeah cuz I was telling them I got back into it recently I'm really enjoying it he's like I don't know I go just roll off your back man tell it to be a big guy with a guard no big guys have a guard it's so rare right because big guys just get little guys on the ground and they they have a nasty top game but then when they find themselves on their back a lot of them are Turtles right they don't know what to do yeah it's it's a technique thing a little guy has to learn perfect precision technique because they don't have that exercise click-click the point guard the NBA foiiows WETA hands he's broken his hands many times yeah and even though he's capable of knocking guys out it's with precision oh he's gonna knock you out like a John the Beast Mugabi wood or Francis and Ghana wood or a fucking a real power puncher Joe Smith there's guys who just fucking get you to the cage or in the in against the ropes and just smash yeah uncanny some of these guys it's just raw power and it's yep he Floyd is all precision and he's all like one of the most fun things from you is watching Floyd in the first round and watching him take away your life yeah like I like to see him take away a fighter's confidence Yeah right like he knew that Moseley was gonna get off with the jab at least he knew Mosley thought that he was gonna get off with the jab and there's a moment even in the first round I know he gets tagged with that overhand right but there's a moment where Mosley Mosley pops the the left jab and Floyd sees it steps back slightly and then come straight over at the right and that moment you could see Shane know that there's nothing he can do because Floyd has timed the jab and countered it directly so now your jab is done now I've lopped off one of your arms I've literally just cut it off now you got to open up with the right you're not gonna do anything with me just straight right I mean I got the filly shell it's over yeah it's like seeing him take pieces away from a minor I just I love fucking Floyd man well he learned how to age too and his dad was a wizard his dad when he was young fought Sugar Ray Leonard in a very good fight when Sugar Ray was in his prime good pedigree man yeah some good pedigree they know how to do it there's a smart fighter schools Roger Mayweather the black mamba yeah you know his brother was a motherfucker man I used to love watching his brother fight in the or his uncle rather I still loved watch his uncle fight he would fight on like ABC like whatever television shows we're having boxing on television during the day yeah maybe it was ABC I don't remember but yeah you like that family he grew up boxing and he also got to see the things that people do wrong you know and here's another thing that boy that's going for him conditioning on fathom he's always in tremendous shape always just always in shape I think it's a hustle when you see a meeting the McDonald's and shit like that shit means that you think I hope that regularly on a percent yeah you could eat that shit it's just carbohydrates it's just bullshit the thing about that like you were the eating sugar or like he'll drink a soda after a workout he's working out for two and a half hours you can take some sugar dude not only Keith takes some shit there's an argument that that kind of sugar is not bad for you after you have a brutal workout huh dude when I was we did this so burr October challenge yeah yeah all right man dude already look phenomenal fucking funny saw him in New York I was like dude you are was gonna be my biggest competition - cuz he listened tired in his face like his head is exhausted yeah he's like yardarm yeah so tired of this bullshit but his body was fucking shredded yeah yeah what is this Chad Johnson he always eats McDonald's he's doing yeah while he's working out right here yeah yeah dude you can do that it's all in how much you exercise now that's not obviously he's eating healthy food on top of that yeah but if he feels like fucking off and getting a Big Mac he could do that and there's no no performance benefit right no but no penalty yeah yeah you can do it so when Floyd does that he is doing that yeah it really is eating that nonce is Chad still working out yeah just for exercise just for fun he loves it right two miles an hour it's his comedy what does he do with these days so what he'll do is I mean he'll like play guys and like play guys in FIFA he's a great follow on Twitter it's hilarious oh yeah I follow him it's like hit like a girl will post a picture and then he'll say what's wrong with the picture this will be smoking hide like a bat your shades or $30 like you know don't put so much money into your outfit when the blinds in your house are $30 like he'll just nitpick little things like dude he's hilarious but his um my guesstimation is this is his commie like remember you're saying yeah yeah he used to sleep at the arena or at least at the stadium he when he played he was obsessed with it he loved the sport he was talking about fighting Anderson Silva at one time man a nice great ballplayer cop Anderson when he was in his prime I think he has martial arts skill though I'm not defeated yeah nice little southpaw actually he's gonna find him hitting the pads or hitting the bag yeah cuz I think he has real martial arts skill like legit martial arts well that's the questions like one of these elite athletes gonna enter MMA damn well they are but in small who's the small numbers well John Jones is absolutely an elite athlete but he's got a 20 inch vertical how elite he tastes got small calves but the fact that he has those small calves allows him to be six foot four and 205 pounds right you see he was bottom heavy he'd be 250 yeah he did a different weight which he could be he could be a heavyweight he could bulk up and go up to heavy weight but he's got like weird calf genetics his calves are tiny right the thing is you don't have to jump that much in MMA and he can hit you in the face with a flying knee right but the what he knows how to do and what he can do physically in terms of his wrestling right and his ability to close the distance of smash guys in time people he's an elite athlete well I think he could he could have done that his two brothers play and if here is his Chad sparring a little but he's in blue right yeah still can't be touched he says well he's a southpaw yeah so let's see this Silva so he's full okay it's good good help right good head movement yeah for sure I like the way he moves hands down though ridiculous see this is the duty sparring though we don't know shit about hands being that guy might be terrible yeah you know I mean the guy didn't want to try to go to the body he didn't duck in you know when someone's moving their head around like that just smashed their ribs you go right after those clots of the arms yeah hit those arms that's what they try to do with Floyd man yeah good luck yep good no flaws in the game no things like Longpoint one fling it's like we're talking about with Ben Askren that when a guy is a super elite wrestler yeah you think you're gonna do something but he knows you think you're gonna do something so he does it you do what you were going to do he anticipates what you're going to do he has an answer to that and then you have to regroup and he's already moving on to step three like there's too many steps that he's ahead of you can there be a guy like with him that you don't engage on the ground like you just kind of jabs stay on the outside Russia yeah for sure look Robbie Lawler almost took Ben Askren out in his last fight Ben's mental toughness and his ability to endure punishment most guys would have probably gone unconscious there yeah but style bender like a guy like style bender would be one of the worst fucking nightmares for a guy like Ben Askren right he's super difficult to take down and on the feet he's not gonna do anything stupid right you're gonna move forward and try to grab ahold of thing and you're just gonna eat knuckle sandwich a knuckle sandwich and he's gonna slowly chop at your legs walk yeah and you're gonna feel that low calf kick back you're gonna feel the inside of your thighs shit yeah you're gonna try to walk off the pain you'll switch stances cuz it starts to hurt Rock he didn't recognize he switches dances he attacks the other leg now both your legs are fucked up yeah he comes down the middle with a need of the solar plexus oh you're hurt yeah trying to play it off it's just a matter of doing his game in his in style Bender's game his game is keep the fight standing right fuck you up and then Ben Askren its grab a hold of you fuck you up right raggy to the ground fuck you up it's a matter of like who who's better at the weak aspect of the other person's game right yeah yeah how can I take advantage yeah it's so great and no one could be the best at everything so some like MMA math is a notoriously difficult thing to do like say say if if Jamie beats me but I beat you but you beat Jamie yeah like that happens but that's what I said I'm a math it's right race we always say that with like you know yeah but it doesn't work with Floyd see in boxing that styles make fights only goes so far with MMA it's it's because the sports more comprehensive because there's more skills there's more different things happen it's football compared to basketball mates like there's more there's more tools that can be used in here they offset what's going on it's basketball the Warriors are gonna beat any team four out of seven games mmm that's just gonna happen I don't know shit about basketball or football so I'm just guessing you could be a superstar like there's no 1 position in football it can change the game mmm there's yeah I think a quarterback is overrated and to be honest before I think the most important position is offensive defensive line well I'm always amazed at Tom Brady's body how regular it is super into a reg super regular but they get it that hold that team gets it they like like I think Tom Brady's like 15 highest-paid quarterback in the league it's like right but if you look at a elite athletes body right I want to see a dude is built like Camaro Iseman yes the UFC welterweight champion yeah that's a elite at you look at him I go oh yeah not an elite athlete looks like a UFC champion he's not only that when you hit well greatest quarterback of all time whoa see this guy without sure you know he looks like a Tom yeah I mean what makes that guy so special as things like sometimes you know sometimes went on yeah he's up here and I think you know he's got a lot of it up here and he works hard it's like you know sometimes the greatest art picture of him next to kymaro is my you know what it is it's like sometimes having all the natural tools is a to your detriment look at that yeah bro come on simple yeah like a leopard yeah he's ready yeah Ben has been similar too he's got a little muffins he's got Ben aspirins got even worse pull him down and wait Ben Askren cuz doesn't want oh and he's got it like that I knew a fuck he feels like he's so much better as a wrestler that everybody else is fucked give me an image yeah go to his abdomen look at that I mean he's got AB he's got nicely underneath that that's from one Fc he looks even worse now yet winning yeah there he goes I mean that is not that's Tom Brady man the ideal male combat body you would think that's not what the ideal combat body looks like I'll fuck shit up this is a picture of him with Camaro awesome on there but he's got a shirt on yeah who's mine isn't looking lucky for him but like this is just some guys that like okay Francis and Ghana is a perfect example yeah some guys look like a destroyer yeah they just look like a destroyer yeah and Ghana was like six five 200 maybe more than six sometimes those guys like I think you were saying it earlier about the about the jujitsu right like and it's not just in in this it's and any things like sometimes the guys with all the natural ability they don't have the the work ethic to be the greatest because it comes so easy yeah you know it's like like we all know comics that are like so funny hanging out mm-hmm and they're okay on stage yep and it's I think it's because comedy comes so easy to them mmm they don't hit the gym yeah you know what I mean like maybe it's you need that like Jordan almost like sociopathic approach to it you know we're like if we were having this conversation earlier is like huh like do you think Jordans happy I don't think he's happy remember when he was inducted abducted abducted inducted into the Hall of Fame I thought you'd like to tell me he was an abductive in plain sight do you remember when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame and he was talking about writers he was talking shit about writers fuck yeah it wasn't thanking his coaches and his teammates and it's been an amazing ride and I feel so blessed and fortunate no he's still I can fuck you remember when you said that fuck you 1993 your Sports Illustrated issue you said buy shoes look shitty yeah well that's his furnace yes yeah some people have some people need that as a furnace like they need that that competitive drive you know and like I feel like I feel like that happens when you don't derive joy from what you do you know like you derive joy from that outcome you're obsessed with outcome you know like at least for me everything before was outcome right it was like I'm good if if I get a special I'm good if right I'm doing these things or I'm good if I kill in the second I was stripped of the opportunity to do those things I actually found like I loved creating more and then whatever the outcome was was extra mmm does that make sense right yeah I think it's a happier path I think so too but I don't know if it's the path to greatness as much as the path of the psychopath especially when it comes to competitive sport understand something about the best athletes they all miserable they have a fucking self-loathing they and they also have an ego then they have this this anger towards the competition yeah like if you beat them but they would say that if you beat Jordan it came anything fucking hate you for playing again yeah but it needs it right he operates on I'm not good enough and if I beat you then he was alright I was good enough I don't even know if it's that he thinks he's not good enough is that he knows he can get you don't quit motherfucker I'm gonna get you why do I need to get you he needs to because it's like he needs to confirm something maybe right I need to comfort it's constant confirmation I need to confirm and that great confirm confirm where it's not that he doesn't believe he's great is that he wants to confirm it constantly it's if there's a little shadow of a doubt he's like I'm great I'm great he's walking around I'm great and there's a little voice in his head that's going he might not be that great however when he played baseball that motherfucker could want to prove yeah you're the hardest thing that sports hitting a baseball huh it's the hardest fucking thing and he just jumped from basketball to baseball and was people act like he was trash he wasn't even that bad he hit like 250 no no no no no no baseball card I'm looking at says he was 302 not that maybe what it might be for that's for another 180 when I have other 615 at-bats bro what's talking about it the hardest thing in sports is hitting a fucking base moon the fact that he I mean there's a bunch of rumors and why he even went into baseball the first place but like that's it's that cycle isn't right that some people say is gambling some people say you know there's there's a bunch of different things I don't want to you know put out there because I don't know but like it's one of those I think there is a balance man I think that you could I think if you truly love what you do like if you love the creative aspect and then you have high standards for yourself then you can achieve both yeah I think that achieving quote unquote greatness um and living with misery I don't think that's worth it no I don't think that's worth it for you it's like you got one shot at this man like this this life man like you got one shot at try to figure it the fuck out and it takes time to figure the fuck out but it's one of those things you can't even really explain to people but if you can I'm approaching this point in my life where like yeah think I get it Sam Sann say how old you know 35 yeah and like it's like my buddy explains it like this he's like there's these different phases in life he's like there's and none of them is better or worse than the other but you know there's this vegetable phase we're like just going to work and then coming home right and you don't think about anything then there's a y phase right which is what gets us into comedy a lot of us right we start asking why about stupid shit like why do I have to have breakfast in the morning or like whatever it is which is why and then there's the phase which a lot of the discussion is on on this show and a lot of comedy operators which is everything is and isn't not everything is or isn't right right right it's like what where you operate and why people are drawn to this right and why people are drawn to maybe my stand-up and other things is we're shaking the foundation of the world we're showing that the world isn't one way you're not either good or bad right everybody and everything is both the maggot hat is so offensive to women right because it stands for these offensive things it's like well what about the Viking helmet yeah like they did some fucked-up shit to women didn't they right we wear that every Sunday for Vikings games there are people all right so two things can be true or two things can be false you know and like that that place where like fucking comedy little arms nuance where comedy lives in the conversation lives you know yeah that is an amazing place they not everybody gets to well that's what's so offensive about progressive fake comedy is that they're pertaining the world's binary that's one and zero and you have to punch up all comedy is punching up I had a conversation with this guy wrote a book once there's no great there's no great it's it's black or white right so without gray they don't even believe there's great like you and I take for granted that we understand there's gray yeah we truly understand we truly get it like that's why we can have a conversation about maybe some of the most vile things and try to put context into it or nuance as you're saying yeah you know that conversation tons of people are gonna write comments are you motherfuckers are this and then the other side is gonna go you motherfuckers yeah it's so problematic that you're talking about yes so why why can we do that what makes us able to do that what do we understand about the world that allows us to do that and how do we you can't tell people things you have to show them how can we show that humor I think that's it I think that's I think that's why we're the first persons killed when a dictatorship takes over the comedian's yeah the philosophers comedians like anybody who goes hey look at the world this way like get them the fuck out of here right stop mocking shit stop making people think a little bit well also the thing about comedy is I've always said that if you can make someone laugh about something you force them to think about it if you just onstage spouting your opinions like one of the real problems that I have with a lot of what they're calling comedy where they're just waiting for applause breaks you say so bro clapper intersectional you know ideas must be approached with the same they're abusing comment know what you're doing yeah that they're doing is they're doing is their time what they could do whatever the fuck they want with it but I know the difference that it's it's a it's a hack they've like they've figured out a way they like to make a short cut but it's not stand up it's something else it's like you're just expressing opinions but if you just on stage saying your opinions on things I can be in the audience going well I don't agree with that I have a different opinion but if you're on stage saying something that makes me laugh even though I don't agree with your philosophy bullfighting yeah that's that's when it gets you like if you're a hardcore Republican trump supporter and someone does a joke about Trump that makes you fucking laugh you're like god dammit he got me motherfucker god that's the game the second you told me I can't joke around that's what I want a joke around about yeah now you just gave me the bull and there's this thing in bullfighting where if you put a little bull out there the crowd boos all right because they want a dangerous bull yes they're true so and that's how comics feel when we see you do an easy job 'when we don't we don't say it out loud but in our head we're like yes they're all gonna laugh at a joke about how women are smarter than men yeah because there's a bunch of dudes trying to get pussy that are at that show with the girl they're trying to get pussy for exactly exactly yeah you know so it's like how do you it's putting it's it's that world where it operates in and then the next thing is I think what I'm not there yet but I get glimpses it's like from nothing comes everything you know like for me I remember for the show in the comedy store in LA when you walked in like that was crazy for me because obviously any comic you're you know watching the show and you're seeing and you're like man it would be so cool one day to be on Joe Rogan's podcast right and then but it was nothing I would ever ask for because I stopped asking I stopped feeling entitled to anything I just decided like when you walked in I was like this is awesome because I never expect see I'm saying I only do the shit that I want to do because I can control that and if I just worry about expecting or wanting shit that I can't control be miserable right so and you walked in and did the fucking show and you're like okay I heard some good stuff and want to check it out and I was like that's fucking unreal and I was overwhelmed because I didn't ever expected shit and even in that moment I wouldn't ask you to come on and I didn't care if I didn't come on I didn't give a fuck because I was so grateful that that had happened it was almost like I was just true to comedy and all I want to do is good comedy and the fucking that's how our universes doors oh that's it that's it that's fucking it if you especially in this world the world that we live in if you're doing real shit people find out about me I hear about you I heard about you through several people and I was like really oh okay cool let me check them out and then I saw some of your shit online like ah I could tell there's people that are doing the real thing they're out there really doing comedy and they're trying to make things funny and they're talking about controversial subjects and talking about different things and their perspective in life and they're not worried about the industry's opinion of them and what you said was so true that in the day buddy was trying to get a sitcom and that's all they were doing they were doing these acts like you would get actors who'd get into comedy just so they could put together a seven-minute set yeah so they could get a sitcom off of it and then they would stop doing stand-up it was a lot of that mm-hmm but that world dried up on the sitcom dried up yes and it happened right around the time that Fear Factor kicked yeah there's one Fear Factor kicked in reality TV show squashed all these sitcoms yes you know what's really funny because some people were it was I had an argument with a comic about that and he's like man I just think it's fucked up that you you're doing a reality TV show in supporting reality TV I go why he goes because it takes jobs away from comics that write on sitcoms I go hey man I go first of all they're not writers on sitcoms they're taking a job writing on sitcoms while they're doing stand-up comedy they're fucking comics okay I'm taking a job making people eat animal dicks while I'm doing comedy right the difference is I'm still doing comedy yes and these motherfuckers are just looking for some sort of a gravy train to ride off into the sunset right there if the show was good people would watch it instead of these reality shows simple as and then it wouldn't exist anymore but there was so many bad sitcoms yeah that it opened the door to Real Housewives and all these other things and the next thing you know name me name me three sitcoms go that are on right now oh can I take it one step further yeah they'll never be another hit sitcom again it probably won't it is over probably over and I'm walking around my agency that I'm with yesterday and I'm talking to people and they don't get it no bro if I felt like Christian Bale in the big short I'm just walking around are you it's over it's over do you guys not know like we need a write a show around you I'm like guys guys guys there's no more you know what's really over go you ever look at the fucking ratings for late-night television okay it's done it's crazy so this is why this one's crazy lips up like it's I have you just put your clips up put your clips up Instagram everything look everything that I've that I've done it's for comics like don't think bit like you're copying or anything like that it's for you look at the blueprint yeah copy it improve it tell me how you it but empower yourself that's what this is for The Blueprint are putting things up on putting things up YouTube Instagram Twitter like any and like I have a lot of comics to reach out and just ask questions but I'm here as a resource for you comedy at its best when we are helping each other and New York doesn't get that right now just yet well there's less opportunity that's that's it you know what happened in LA that's it comes in so you're fucking yeah dude it is so done this is how you know you know how I know it's done what is your favorite scene in a sitcom or what top five scene just a scene you loved in a sitcom even though I was in a sitcom for five years yeah I don't really watch them so okay fair enough well watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt yeah that's a single camera it's a little different because there's like no audience but like here anybody's listening right now right like you can think of one of your favorite scenes right try to think of how that episode began you don't know try to think about how it ended you don't know right because the narrative was never important the narrative was to fill 30 minutes of time the only thing that was important were the five sketches that filled that 30 minutes of time 22 minutes or 20 22 yeah exactly so so it's like those five sketches don't have to have that bullshit narrative right right so right now you really just need four or five friends that are doing the same kind of funny shit we're already seeing the new sitcom right now it's already existing well an Instagram it's just a not a good art form you know if you watch like the Big Bang or two and a half minutes and those are grandfathered in right it's like that came from a time when I was there but like they weren't they're not entertaining they certainly don't stand up like that's also why Netflix kicked in with a lot of their dramas because they can get away with things on stranger things or on ozark they can get away with shit you just could never fucking do on regular television it's way more water it's way more raw it's like you're watching a better movie they not only does because it used to be that if you did film you didn't want to do television because television sucked right like television you do an air wolf or something like that you doing something terrible bullshit it's obvious you see it coming a mile away it's made for morons Yeah right yeah or you know you did film and if you did film boy you got a chance to work with some of the most amazing directors and do the incredible pieces but Netflix came along and and really was before Netflix Sopranos laid the blueprint exact surprise later on oh yeah the wire I didn't watch the wire but it did the same sort of thing right they created a new movie every week and it all went together yes it lasted a hundred hours right and so you're like oh my god well regular movies is so shallow I come into the characters right yeah this guy's ten years later you see him ten years later in the same movie right he's got a beer yeah fuck is this this is terrible and and why is it because movies got so expensive to make you couldn't take risks on stories that we didn't already know yeah movies became 200 million now if I go to you and I'm like okay give me two hundred million to make a movie about it's this mob guy and he's kind of got like some anxiety you're out of your fucking mind right but if I say give me 200 million to make a movie about Marvel it's like oh that is an existent fanbase yeah is it based on a book or a comic so right now the only movies we see are either big-budget that have a built-in audience or $3,000,000 comedy mm-hmm yeah right that middle ground right there that used to be awesome movies TV yeah so now TV is the shit it's all these dope stores like Breaking Bad should have been a movie right but they turned that motherfucker into a TV show a betters way better yeah and they were restricted because it's cable it was an HBO it was and they had commercials and all their stupid shit yeah I mean what happened was with comics was the internet came along and all of a sudden there was these this wealth of avenues where comedians could show their work whereas before you were limited by the gatekeeper yes the gatekeepers are either sitcoms and the sitcoms was what everybody wanted to get because you got a sitcom then you were all set you were Jerry Seinfeld or you were Roseanne yeah and then it became something along the like Russell and you like both guys Russell Peters in particular yeah became gigantic selling out arenas from YouTube that's where it came put little Clips his shit came up and if you ever met Russell he's one of most generous guys in the world generous I know for him comics whose rent he's paid he's the best he's such a great guy but he's also a guy that recognizes that you got to give some back you got to be yes and this just says his personality is just a gregarious outgoing guy all these podcasts that popped up people realize like hey you know we're not in competition with each other like Jay Leno and David Letterman work because everybody wanted the Tonight Show spot now there's a thousand tonight shows and if you have the Tonight Show and I have The Tonight Show I'm like hey you should check out Andrews Tonight Show it's fucking great like this is okay this is the Tonight Show you're Carson but we figured out a way you're Carson now do you know that right that's the difference that's the shift that's why Netflix can't even compete Netflix has done they're not done I'm done what are you talking about you see Charlie Wilson's War know movie about Tom Hanks movie about America getting involved with the Afghan conflict in Afghanistan war doesn't really matter but the idea is this they're fighting the Russians the Afghan DS right so the Americans go okay boom give them a $5,000 rocket launcher and they're gonna shoot down a five million dollar helicopter and eventually Russia just won't be able to compete right netflix pays a hundred million dollars to Aaron Sorkin or whoever to make a TV show right right that distracts you for two hours right YouTube pays zero million dollars to Joe Rogan and Jamie to make a podcast that distracts you for two hours every day Netflix cannot compete but it's a different animal you got to realize first of all they have way more people than just me they also are putting together something that requires a lot of money to create so if you enjoy films yes or if you enjoy a show like Ozarks or stranger things long for narrative it takes a lot of money to make those things or special effects there's my hammer people and makeup people in here there's a lot of directors and producers and actors and it's a giant fucking tent with people people are watching it you know what there were a lot of people are watching that they're watching friends no no no not in fret dude there's a reason it's because it's terrible bro it doesn't matter if it's terrible as Jamie the most two most viewed shows on Netflix right now Netflix doesn't own okay Netflix isn't even trying to make money anymore they're getting bought out it's Facebook Amazon up by who but they want it that's the goal of the strategy now the ten billion in debt there's no way they can make money there's ten billion and billion billion but they make hundreds of millions of dollars a month like how many people do they have on board how many subscribers do they have that are paying nine dollars as far as I know they don't share that information they're killing in terms subscribers but they're ten billion in debt they just took on another two billion right when I say Netflix is done I'm speaking when anytime I make declarations I'm speaking in the future right I'm right we prepare now for the future right so it's like well how are they here it goes Netflix will keep friends through next year and a hundred million one hundred million dollars right for one year of friends and then the office too you know that is though that's like nostalgia nostalgia right so all viewing right now is nostalgia you know not all viewing well if you look at TV right what did great this these this past years in TV right the OJ trial and FX what is that I remember I was when the OJ thing came out did that do that great killed it really won all the awards everything the Versace story which is another thing like what mice that out of the loop I'm just in 39 million one hundred and thirty nine million subscribers paying $10 a month is that what it is how much do cars like that maybe even more maybe 11 how much does it cost it did is bumped it up to 12 I say 12 bucks a monster that ladies and gentlemen is a fuckload of income sure so they got a lot coming in but they're spending a lot too because they're trying to 130 they're trying to overtake all the others and then they got Jeff Bezos you know captain moneybags up their Scrooge McDuck right he's trying to do the same thing Facebook supply which is where I saw you right BP yeah I was like a true but that's the thing Bezos can lose money on this ship because he's making tons of money on paper towels whatever how much he is losing because he's got a lot of fucking series ain't nobody watching them that put it out there but he's doing something that's even more weird okay because there's no one watching those shows yeah there's a ton of fucking shows on the Amazon that fucking no one's watching yeah I would like to see their numbers cuz I bet they have some shows that might they might spend a million dollars to make and have like four viewers yeah it's fucking no one wants no no's they were just going after awards their thing was we're gonna make the artsy shit it's gonna give us a Grammy or something like that and then it will like qualify our platform it's a smart approach like YouTube's approach was the exact opposite right we're like we're just gonna create the stuff that we think people want to watch well YouTube doesn't create much they did a little and they took down the paywall like my thing I'm I guess with YouTube is there waiting for Netflix you know that scene in the movie where like that somebody's caught in like a enclosed space and water starts coming in mm-hmm and the water gets right up to like his lips you know he's like he's trying to breathe a little bit more and I think YouTube this is gonna be the one to pour the last drop of water I think it's such a different thing I think you're talking about two totally different things because Netflix is never aimed to be a user created content streaming site right right they're not but at the end of the day it's just distraction I think I think that's what we got to start looking at content as right it's just raw distraction and Netflix occupies a space for distraction that's smaller than YouTube so I can watch a two-hour thing on YouTube at home on my TV and I can watch a two-minute thing on the bus as I'm going to work on YouTube you know I can watch a 15 minute you know piece like vlog or something like that I can watch all the whole spectrum Netflix I'm really just watching at home or like a film on a trip you know what I mean it's really I'm not watching a two-minute thing on a flex right you know I mean it's it is the shit for now don't get me wrong it's absolutely the shit for now right but if I was being if I'm putting my money on it I would say if I'm Facebook I buy it and then imagine having your Facebook feed you just watch the show and then you get to share it immediately on your Facebook if I was Facebook I'd be super careful about buying anything because I think the government's been thinking about breaking them up for a while only Elizabeth Warren is already talking about that that's one of the parts of her platform and running for president is breaking up Apple breaking up Facebook breaking up Twitter she wants to break up all these things she thinks are monopoly what's your feeling on that get the fuck out of here with that she or she is goofy she's Goofy's fuck what's up the Disney takeover of 21st century takes place I think next week the 20th seborrhea they're gonna put out their own stream everything they've just they've bought like everything except for Fox News and Fox Sports yeah whoa took over all of their production movie facilities hmm like 5,000 people might be losing their job because all that contents coming off of Netflix and all those Marvel shows all that shit is gonna come over to them really so now they're gonna have a nice man I wonder if that's why they've been canceling all these Marvel shows why would I keep invested in something there right you're gonna take off like I'm gonna build up a brand and then run and remove it right you shown it yeah they've got so they got all the kids movies your birth dad yeah I mean dude I go to Disneyland twice a year at least which you cannot have a streaming Disney program with adult Apple's also starting their streaming service soon right tomorrow or some shit oh and those win but there's bunch some tons of rumors are coming out today yeah you know what it's like you know the perestroika like what happened in Russia like where the overnight you know it fell and they sold off the state assets like a few people and everybody came billionaires right that's what's happening right now in entertainment dude you don't realize it but like it's fucking done like the days of the days of like Fame being about distance or done distance distance like I'm Johnny Depp I'm gonna go to it in my like little home somewhere in the Alps and you will see me twice a year you know I'm weird Oh Marlon Brando I'm out here I'm weird I'm different you know it's like now it's proximity there's reason why you'll value and being weird anymore whoa Marlon Brando Tyler Perry has an island bro really mm-hmm that's interesting have you been invited no no that's fucked up I don't wanna go ain't going anyplace fucking Island what about it's my rule Ronson someone who wants to ask Lance in the virgin dude Richard Branson or Devers named Branson Branson icon it's fucking island I wanna do that Branson why why when I could jet ski with Joey Diaz listen I ain't I'm not hanging out with any dude who has an island get the fuck out of here why Marconi Ryland cuz they always want you to go to their Island like bitch I ain't going to your Island whatever just go to the diner no we're gonna do the fucking a while who's that Eddie Murphy Eddie Murphy has an island yep what the Bahamas where daddies I'm Michael daddy's he got it got it how like Eddie I met Eddie and I was good friends with his brother and good guy but Charley was the best Charlie is the greatest guy of all time yeah I met Eddie when when I met Eddie Murphy I met Eddie Murphy and Maui and he go it first words out as Michaels you a funny motherfucker I was like god damn yes this is recently no years ago maybe more than 10 years ago yeah that's like 2007 so I'm like that I'll be unreal there's crazy funny well in Hawaii family I'll say thank you like what do you say when Eddie Murphy says you're a funny motherfucker Mike holy shit Wow felt great you know if you look at your wife and they see okay chuckle every once in a while my honestly at home I'm not that funny my wife cracks most of the jokes really yeah I'm not I don't have to be funny like I don't need it you know it's one of the reasons why I like to hang around with Joey Diaz cuz he's always funny yeah and he's always the funny guy you know I like it it's a you know I like being around funny people man I'm not there's a thing about comics especially the needy annoying ones and the early days like early days of your career they have to be the center of attention yeah the shit is really annoying yeah and one of the things that you learn for sure about hosting a podcast is you don't really want to be the center of attention you just want to facilitate a conversation right you just want to make the best creation yeah what's the best creation the best creation is let this guy rant you got to let them rent get out of the way if the best creation is you rant with them and you jump in together and you go back and forth like a game of tennis then you do it that way right but you have to be able to feel the vibe yeah and then some people are not gonna like it that way they're gonna want why don't you let your guest talk and like people love to say shit like that like you know why don't why are you interrupting his rants yeah I love to say things like that so you're trying to make a creation yeah yeah yeah there's a comics on our great listeners some of them are and well the ones that are are great at this yeah right and the ones in our it's tough for them to do this and people no man think it's it's how how comfortable is it when it gets in through their ears yeah like is it getting in easy or is like oh this guy's on or you hear the guests say something and I just cringe because I anticipate the comments will you like will you quiet somebody no I mean if I have to I try not to if I have to correct them like if they're saying something that I know to be inaccurate if it's in my wheelhouse like sometimes people say something and I'll just say that's not that's not true here's why that's not true yeah you know I've had people say some goofy shit and it just happens to be something I know a lot about yeah and I have to stop it yeah okay that makes that make sense yeah it's just but for the most part I just I want people to just be themselves I got to figure out how to get you to be yourself that's what a lot of this is anyway comfortable make you realize that I just want you to do great I want everybody to do great are you ever intimidated by gastein by their intellect yeah like Elon monsters is intimidating yeah talking to him because you realize what a champ you are that way oh yeah I'm a fucking dummy man but like talking to this guy I'm like I'm a fucking chimp here's a question fuck who's making electric cars bro sending rockets into space right he's drilling holes under the ground you had to dump him down with making solar cities we didn't even did any work but so here's my take on it right I'm watching musk right and he basically is opening up to you about how he's not happy Yeah right as this moment where he's like I think he says something to scent of you wouldn't want to be me yeah he just was exact words wouldn't want to be me he wouldn't wanna be me so that me he doesn't want to be him I think in some level he doesn't want to be him right yeah and he's so with these guys that we admire because they're so brilliant they have all these brilliant ideas and we're put in this matrix of we're all in the success matrix on some level right where it's like get things done good don't they can get things done bad right I wonder if if he's chimp ish in that he's potentially wasting his life being upset or miserable when he could be focusing on things that would give them joy I think that being is that being a fuckin chimp is being so smart that you don't even try to just be happy and focus on your happiness I don't necessarily think he's unhappy but I do think that he puts himself into situations where the amount of stress that he absorbs is almost unfathomable like when he was trying to get the Tesla Model 3 production schedule ramped up he was sleeping on the floor of the factory and working literally working like 19 20 hours a day that that's untenable you can only do that for short periods of time right but I think that what I was saying about Kanye West applies to him tenfold he's he's got a power output that's extraordinarily different than the average person and that's one things he was talking about when he was young I mean you could probably put him on some sort of a what I don't know what the super genius spectrum is like like what is you know what's what's Albert Einstein right what's with this guy what's that guy he's in there somewhere in this crazy realm of the way a brain works like I think the brains are like all other body parts some people are born with little tiny dicks and some people got giant hogs and that's just a fact giant hog of the brain and it just works better it just it just is operating on a level that you and I can't we can't comprehend but I never invented a goddamn thing in my life but I'm driving around an Elon Musk's car you know that motherfucker made a car and that's like some shitty does on the side you know his car thing isn't like after he invented PayPal yeah and he's by the way while he's doing the car he shoot rockets into space and drilling holes into the ground he's trying to move traffic on the ground he fucking he's making solar cities like he's hooking up Australia with these massive solar panel power battery plants you fucking fix their energy needs he's on another level no doubt on another level it's a different thing but so is he happy Joe I don't know and amass nice guy that was thing around though he seems happy yeah yeah I mean yeah it was there's what is happy right is it is he happy and bursts well I guarantee you when I saw him when he was shooting his fucking flamethrower and my for yay he was happy your for yay yeah right out here man yeah he had a fucking flamethrower he was tapping that bitch when he walked through the door he's unboxing it in the middle of this hallway out here is got flame there's a picture of him standing in front of the freak party sign yeah blowing flames look at the smile on his face you can't tell him he's not happy bro you know what look at that smile he's happy as fuck it's because he's a kid man yeah we're in a lot of ways yeah there's this there's this fucking guy forget his name is dr. Robert pie or something that is like his French consulting is like some fucking genius and he's like decoded cultures right and every culture he's decoded and he people hire him to consult right and like America's code is it's the verb is to do and the time is now right and we're just kids at the end of the day right it's like everything we will have big tits in America right most popular plastic surgeries big tits and like France most popular plastic surgery is getting tits were reduced right everything about them is like precision and like the food on the plate were their most popular plastic that's what he said I mean maybe it's changed to like lips or something more common now but maybe the one you have to go on Deficit a dark one don't fuck with your lips lady I like it when they get a little lips if they know if you have a fucking B but then you have a little something you see the thing in there it's like it like lets you know they're extra needy there's like something going on they wanted that they wanted their lips to be you know there's like a symmetrical proportion that your face is supposed to fall into this Fibonacci sequence of right numbers like if you get a nose job I look at you and I go what's wrong like something is wrong it registers wrong in my head because your face so like re per example yeah sorry got a nose job you're like what the fuck is happening here yes what's wrong with your face yeah you've already had like a small Irish person's nose he'd be like what is happening here it's the same making sense yeah maybe not for his face no right his face is there's a sequence like your lips match your face they they match how far your eyes are a part where your nose is we see a girl and just a little tiny little skinny thing with little fingers and also I just got this yes these big weird lips don't we like things that like stand out like we like skinny with big tits we do wrong to it right with other things that are abnormal do nice big slut it's a trick the big tip one is a trick because it represents where sexual viability it represents your ability to breastfeed a child right which is attractive to your genes doesn't make any sense yeah I said you would know that there's a bag of water underneath her skin that she had a tube down her throat taped to her face yeah she's half dead they're cutting her open with a sharp knife yeah and stuffing this bag of water under the meat of her breast tissue yeah or they're cutting her nipple off and opening up like a fucking manhole lover and pumping that fucker in there it's crazy like we know that that's what happened and we still think it's hot all those things are nuts I'm Chilean bro yeah yeah it's in here we can't help it but like it bothers me when it's a but when it's a fake but it bothers me like if there was a way that a girl could lift weights at the gym and make her tits bigger and she went and got fake tits you wouldn't like them as much wait a minute wait a minute oh yeah yeah yeah knowing you can earn it yeah you could arrest I might yet lazy lazy but thing is it's you off if it doesn't match the legs like if a girl's got a big butt I got some legs like damn this bitch is dead lifts yes you know like that's hot yeah it's like I've never said that in my head but I know what you're talking to member said this bitch's bitch good squat I say that all the time just go work out it up I guess I like girls with legs that look like they can carry shit yeah it's hot yeah I'm heavy carrying me around can get tired but it but I like girls that are athletic or you know I like it it's hot so if a girl's got a big ass cuz she's squatting that's hot yeah but girl's got a big ass cuz she went to surgery on my bitch you're gonna get cancer yep she's cancer now do you know that yeah way from implants yes they're starting to see cases of butt cancer whoa jack that's what you like I'm talking about son bro that that's power that's too strong for me oh don't be scared I'm afraid that that girl hurt you she will yeah that is that's like trying to fuck CrossFitters fist you know I'm saying like power look at that lag do it attaches a ha outstanding I mean the butt cheeks are it's the thigh meat it's too much he's an athlete I like it yeah I don't know I like that if that girl's in a miniskirt but if she's not flex inch part looks hot as fuck you so you're into a very strong now I like good jeans this kind of other ones Jamie I mean this girl has stacked that girl stacked the only problem with those gals is that there is a reality to certain levels of musculature that most likely they're only achieved by injecting male hormones so the klitz kind of get big or whatever a little bit have you ever seen that are you allowed to like fuck around what's your relationship with your wife definitely not no okay okay how long you been married ten years ten years okay and then how do you yeah do you have a gate that no yes could you please explain to me how you do this mess lazy way jackoff how does it work game yeah the this this level of athleticism miles Han yeah like there's a certain line that there are they are crossing but most likely is because of male hormones yeah I can't get into it there's there's some level to that do they grow some hair jiu-jitsu girls there's a lot of jiu-jitsu girls that are competitive Jitsu girls that start doing a little bit of steroids they start taking a little bit of testosterone yeah like a friend of Mines wife was doing it I was like hikes you saw the stuff yeah she's really getting into jiu-jitsu she's competing and she's starting to take a little bit of testosterone I was like okay you know happens though my whole day and horny really like a dude really yeah but they got this big dangling Claire I don't know it only gets big when they go whole hog like when they go bodybuilder found a real bodybuilder weigh-ins big no every day went back in the day no never never fucked a girl was a body built never what never no girl was like like very fit and strong but she had a normal vagina normal clip totally normal clear back though weird okay yeah it's a little true so it's not feminine it's not nothing but this clipping fascinates me so the clit it just is there like is that you can't put a picture of that up can we look at them no no tell us can you pull it up doesn't you know what it is a little dick a little that's what I'm wondering it doesn't have like the head and like the rim s oh yeah here bro are you saying you've never looked at enlarged klitz you never done that that's exactly what I'm saying I look fake pussy's I worked up like tranny pussy's but I didn't look up and those that's not good what do you mean the tranny bosom what do you mean they're not good like date it's not good it's not real yeah I know it's not real but I do want to be able to tell can you tell no but I feel like bro there's a dick on inside a nut yeah that's what happens that's not real no it is real it is real oh wait no no it is gross no way how about that one in the lower right hand upper right hand corner oh the dark one Jamie they'll blow that that one pow how you like me now that's a dick he has balls yeah no no that's balls bro that's not that's not that's Lucy lips Doug okay slips now that one down there what about the giant one below that Jamie dude the one middle what's happening there no bro that just looks like a witch finger that might is gnarly yeah that's Photoshop that has to be dude this is on my Florida real him freak porn yeah dude well when girls take a lot of testosterone they do develop in large klitz there was a show on HBO back in the day I think was called private dicks but it was like that girls into that though no that's a little much yeah that's a Shaw yeah that's Lera she's pretty looking though she wasn't flexing how to eat a couple sandwiches but anyway there was a show on HBO called private dicks okay and one of the people on it I think that was from that show but what anyway there was this lady was talking about she became a trans man okay war and by through taking massive amounts of testosterone her clip grew she said to the size of a thumb yeah because they're taking I don't even understand carry on high levels of testosterone to sort of achieve that they get hair on their face their voice DBA yeah you know they get broader and thicker and they keep a lot of that too I don't get it I don't understand so your clit is just your is just a cock essentially right well not really it just resembles one I mean if you looked at that if my dick look like that I'd go right to the doctor I'm like which one the long run which is finger yeah with the joints yeah it seems like a joint it seems like a clit with no skin or get dick with no skin yes that made me feel uncomfortable to look at it should imagine pulling a girl's panties now sure that things if it happened to a friend of mine dongs boyfriend okay a friend of mine who I used to work with on a television show her she was only story about her ex-boyfriend met this girl and they're fooling around and they get back to her but and she was pretty feminine but she had a clit like a pinky it's the way he described it and then he pulled her pants down and then fucking panicked and then said oh my god I have to pick my friend up at the airport fuck I can't believe this and he just that was his excuse the dude panicked he went into a full-blown panic and just ran out he couldn't deal with her clit I mean it gets to a certain size where that's like yeah if it's wrapped around her leg and tied in a bow you're like oh you know like kind of like push it to the side to insert you gotta hold it like a handle it's like the reins on a horse like you're hanging on to it it's like just did the random shape of the human body and how we've decided that this is what's appealing right hourglass figure yeah the ass comes out the tits are here it makes it look like she's like sexually viable and she'll be good at like the big ass and all that fat around that area means she's got a plenty plenty of nutrients for the child like right wide hips it means the baby's gonna come out easy all those things are like directly connected to fertility so we're not objectifying them at all well we are but it's nature that's caught like there's a reason why the standard that men are after when it comes to women it was rectly connected to them baby think you're gonna make some kids yeah so me thinking you have great you know hips or tits or something like that is efficient yeah it's not sexist it's not hateful it's not in any way objectifying or maybe we're supposed to objectify to create people hmm I think there's that too but then there's also like if a girl's in really good shape one of the things that you admire is that that girl's got she's got discipline and power like a girls hitting the gym all the time and working out oh that's a girl gets things done like if you see a girl and she's lazy and her body is just like soft doughy she's like skinny fat yeah yeah like oh you're gonna complain a lot you're gonna hate a lot naps yeah you know you know what up after this getting after it yeah you have to get things done you're gonna want to be you gonna be sad you're gonna want to complain you're gonna want to stay home and stop but is that biological is that smart you think it is yeah this some biological to it your body rejects that because you know that this girl like if the shit hits the fan and fucking apocalypse comes got to take your children and go to the mountains right this girl's gonna be tired all the time stop lane but he's gonna weigh you down she's not gonna carry her own weight I like a gal who can carry your own weight right and you can't do that if you're carrying a big old clip leaves stuck to it no imagine if women had dicks and men had pussies and we were just really into big dicks just just as possibly a by means of called gay guys but now the arbitrary shape they like you strange yeah we attract sea horses right isn't the male seahorse have a pussy while the male seahorse accepts eggs from the female there's actually video of it sounds pretty gay to me yeah she pours her eggs into a sack in his body it's very straight knotted in it looks like they're kissing while they do it it's really weird I'm okay with it oh you got a video of it oh yeah here it should in perspective when you look at the old weird fucking animal seahorses anyway yeah like what a strange little creature it's so weird I think that's why we like nature stuff because it like it puts in perspective how fucked up humans are look at that dude that's that's her him is that him giving birth dude that's how I come with look at that kicks fucking shotgun dude I come the opposite way I feel pulling back on a punch yeah but you got matches one of those ones that's stuck in there one of them little baby seahorses like ah I mean you forever because he's the last of them is like the last is like one or two at a time see like these one guy it's the last drop he just keeps pumping huh but there's nothing coming out okay those are babies so those are sperm babies that's so we didn't see them like have sex with each other maybe hatches inside of his body yeah that's crazy dude thank God we gotta do that imagine all the what a drag did your did your wife do natural no see oh no no no no no waste oh oh I mean natural but like yeah yeah yeah epidural man the c-section thing that means with some women it's imperative they have to do it like maybe they have small hips right you date one of those like a little girl date one of them bent big giant dudes a gorilla fucks you I am fascinated by it when like have you ever seen that guy the guy from Game of Thrones the amount with tiny she's doing the mountain up she weighs three pounds let's see it Liz she looks like a chick she's smaller in comparison to him than

biggest human beings do you think that he's packin I don't think he's pack why are you talking he's got a big piece he's got a dick like everything else you see on him if he didn't have a dick like

trunk that's that's oh wow I don't know if he got the piece man would you turn that big if you had a piece like this he's a savage he's from fucking Iceland that's what they do they're different humans out there man those are Vikings yeah there's a reason why he's that big no bullshit that is Viking DNA it's just the best years ago guys like him would be on a boat with a fucking dragon in the front of the boat and they'd have a sword and they couldn't wait to jump off that fucking boat and start hacking people to bits yeah that's why that guy exists that's why he's so big yeah yeah you just took the best genetics from wherever you stop that's why Iceland did you vice did a whole piece on Iceland okay about all the strongman competition winners that live in Iceland okay they're all Vikings man its Viking DNA real a hundred percent okay but isn't Viking DNA okay we went to Italy we raped some chicks in Italy we bring them back death they bring back the best women but they're the ones who survived all these battles this is so big man you got to read this article that Vice did on these strongmen in Iceland okay it's crazy bro yeah yeah there's a whole country filled with gorillas big white gorillas that are just smashing pussy and lifting weights and throwing fucking beer barrels over the top of train like fences that's huge there's a apparently there's an app in Iceland to make sure you don't fuck your family member - bro cuz there's only only like 300,000 people right on the island right so everybody down everybody a lot of people are very related so you can like type your name it will say oh you're Genson Jorgensen ours fuck Oh Oh with a drum by the bed I do beat the drum Oh boom give me a pace to go to yeah damn that's a crazy crazy race of humans man you ever go there ice no no I'd like to go I'd like to go there just to see the Northern Lights it's one of the things that I had thinking that I need have you been yeah you saw the Nepean sign up there what is it oh you did yeah yeah in Alaska it's harder in the city when you're to say but uh yeah they love stand up there I think like I think they're their president or something was like a huge Stanhope fan likes good stand-up - yeah make sure I'm not missing but like a pair I think he was a like a massive Doug Stanhope fan they were good man they like know English they're like apparently the KFC there they of save one KFC huh it's popular as fuck well the rules for food are super like high so it's like the best chicken tenders you've ever had oh because they don't let process bullshit none of that right but it's still caves so you could do that one you have a country that as as many people as Boulder Colorado right that's the thing people don't get like when you've got a feed 300 million people it's like we're gonna GMO some shit right yeah like we're gonna use corn 300 million people yeah it's like like what a mom has nine kids it's like there's gonna be some grits yeah like mmm yeah McDonald's is gonna work but yeah Iceland was a shit in the Northern Lights you look at Northern Lights and you're like oh I completely get why people believed in God oh yeah like you can't not does that make sense or you look in the sky and it's painting itself yeah you're gonna believe what did they think it was back that had to be the guy dancing I wonder what they thought I'm wondering buttocks explanation they have for the Northern Lights how do you not like years ago I don't know man sometimes the more I like look it I was raised without any religion but like the more I look at it now I think it's just people trying to explain it was like there's like people use this look at that real color for Minnesota yeah yeah you can see it Wow but go to another way for me I didn't experience like that's Nowitzki it's more just like that name Dirk Nowitzki or probably thinking no I heard that name - Travis Nowitzki he's he was that gotta do is he's just a famous photographer perhaps try to photo yeah photography by Travis Nowitzki yeah I think that's what it is I think I think I've seen his yeah I think he does a lot of nature shit yep how could you not do it like how can you how do you blame anybody for believing in something bigger oh just a storm man yeah you know a hurricane like yeah we live in big cities this shit is not real you live in the Bahamas and you see the power of a fucking hurricane it puts things in perspective like you know how important we think we are that goes away when you know at the blink of an eye your house everything you worked for is gone because of wind mm-hmm wind and water holy shat shit right there look at that pig that's where it's crazy Wow says northern the lights now appear in Central Europe this is because of climate change wasn't I supposed to get hotter I don't know what that means like why is it saying well go to that article why is it saying that noise right now up here what what is thank scroll down roll scroll down no says Europe much of the US Central Europe and much of the US I didn't know that much of the us's northern you can see my oh hi oh sometimes alas you can see the naught you've seen it I have not but I mean the other pictures show soda you fuckin Ohio people do an ass in the parking lot seeing lights in the sky yeah there's that fucking big storm is hitting central us today right I got fog then like Denver were they calling a bomb why they call kalam cyclone as its clickbait marketing it's good marketing bomb like bombs you're gonna read article is a problem yeah right bombs Gary do marketing's fucking everything I thought this shit like look when we were just talking about the uncircumcised like like that even that term is so dumb right it's a normal deck yeah yeah like what it is it's a dick why don't we yeah why would we even use that yeah right well what's crazy is it's more common to be cut you're it's more common that a dick is sliced off when you're a baby yeah she's they take the cap off than it is then and then when it's not we're like what's why didn't her parents cut your cock when you were born what about that why you have the blanket over the top of the head cut that off expose that try that head out yeah weird yeah it's listening man you get people to believe anything it's like you've got to grow it into them you know it's there's this uh I feel like I've tell a story every single time I'm talking on podcast but like there's this great thing about how Nescafe broke into the Japanese market if you heard about this no and it's like they went to this consulting they're asking him how do we get in and he's like you can't get in and like what do you mean he's like it's gonna be 15 years all right what are you talking about he goes well they don't know what the fuck coffee is over there okay you're trying to bTW you're not tea so what you're gonna do is you're gonna make a cartoon and you're gonna spend some a few million on that and then you're gonna make a candy based on a cartoon and then that candy is gonna be flavored as coffee and when these kids grow up they're gonna have this memory of coffee and the flavor of the smell of coffee and I think last week they just opened the biggest Starbucks in the world in Tokyo and these people devour coffee like no other and the idea is like the takeaway for me the reason why I tell the story all the time is like change comes from underneath yes is this how they approached it they actually did it that way that's that's that's the same guy that consultant rep I I think his name is and he's a book or something I called the culture code my buddy's doing like a series with him trying to break it down but the idea is like if you want to change any the same reason why I did my shit on YouTube is like if you want to change any industry or something like that it's never going to come within the traditional structure you know I mean it's like I would never be able to do the type of jokes I was doing on on maybe you are and the bigs can but me they'd be like I don't that jokes about you know trans people you can do that Center so it's like if I want to make it okay I got to do it outside mm-hmm you know I have to go a little bit outside of the industry and make it okay and the way they were thinking was hey let's get underneath and just fucking to grow these ideas in I think that's why we fight wars over ideas all the time right it's like people understand oh shit if people start believing in socialism or whatever the new thing they want us to be afraid of now they believe in it and it sounds good enough they'll want it so we got to nip this in the bud of Vietnam yeah you know there's a little bit of that I mean Vietnam is super complicated it depending on who you ask most like it was about heroin a lot of the whole war you think a lot of it yeah a lot of it was about the heroin trade billions billions and billions and billions of dollars controlling the heroin trade really yeah I more so then then the spread of this ideology stands about the heroin trade my understanding was with yeah i understood that heroin ramped up radically but there's all sorts of positive aspects to most of the ideas that they push right right there's positive aspects of trying to stop terrorism there's positive aspects to trying to stop radical fundamentalists right taking over parts of the world and radicalizing segments of the population and making these terrorist cells and attacking cities and doing a lot of things that we know really do happen that's true but what's also true it's a hotbed for heroin so it's a win-win there's a Geraldo Rivera segment on Fox News where Geraldo Rivera was talking to soldiers who were guarding poppy fields and they were explaining that the u.s. soldiers had to guard the fucking heroin because this is how they got these Afghani farmers to cooperate against the radical fundamentalist that we're running these religious sects watch this shit put the headphones on fighting the opium trade a Marja this town in the middle of Helmand process province was the easy part the hard work now is governing this province of province as you suggest that has become addicted to opium in many many ways that is the principal crop that is being grown here the Taliban lend the farmers the money they are indebted to the Taliban they have to grow the opium now the Marines in their success are in a sense of victim of their success because now the population is you know if they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it we are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy it now the population would turn against the Marines and it would be a real just clearly risk let me introduce Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Christmas here the commander arguing the syrup the 3rd battalion 6th Marines really a wonderful group of Marines here position if you lay on the you tubers gonna be a problem let's pull this now stop now because so but they're getting heavy with heavy hands that against copyright so this is interesting because this is this is this the gray area we're talking this was early in the war I mean this is like what was that from I want to say that was probably from 2005 yeah dude this is doesn't yeah this is the great right this is hey this is how a country makes its money there's it's not just that someone's profiting there's fuckin pay millions for their GDP some one is profiting I do not know where the money's all going but there are billions of dollars involved in heroin right billions people are buying it all over the world ninety something percent of it comes from Afghanistan do the math just do the math we're still there I mean Sturgill Simpson wrote a bit about it or a wrote a song about it and they played that song on Saturday Night Live and I don't even think they knew what the fuck the song was about right and he's up there playing a song about the government being involved in the heroin trade I mean there's something to it there's some and you say oh that's conspiracy theory stop stop there really is billions of dog and heroin being grown in Afghanistan the production of heroin really did ramp up considerably the US invasion is it possible that this is their commerce and a singer goes on SNL exposes Afghan heroin trade and no one even notice that's my boy but it's assumption what that this is their commerce in the same way like some communities fish this community plants poppies and they perhaps what are they doing with all that money that's the question Ram or goat are they getting well they're doing Afghani go to delicious I don't know what they're doing I don't know I just can't imagine someone is not getting a cut of this and I can't imagine that there's no might as well there's no mainstream investigative work that's being done to sort of expose us I don't know I mean I might be good why not maybe these farmers are not making all the money maybe the money is all going to drug dealers and we let that happen happy fucked up it'd be cool if every cool they got it but like look the world is fucked bro like this shit ain't peaches and cream man it's like every time I see one of these stupid Senate hearings where they're like did you do some bad things in South America it's like yeah yeah bad shit happens when Trudeau is involved in that thing and like what is it Libya you know like when they were bribing you hear about this Trudeau from Canada yeah there's this big scandal up there in Canada because he was involved you know with this company which is a Quebec company that was that paid like thirty six million dollars to bribe the Libyan government for like some contracts and it's like oh yeah that's how it gets done over there you bribe the government for contracts and these people in the Canadian government like how could he this is against his policies it's like no no welcome to the real world the the you're operating in the 1% of the world which has these rules we just made the fuckup of fairness and equality and equity and all this bullshit it's like the real world is hey I'd like to do this can I give you some money and we make it happen the real world is Geraldo Rivera walk into heroin fields talking to a general that's the real fucking world town there's a lot of that yeah I mean it would be nice if everywhere was like America but I don't know if it that's what's really fucked up right like with this fairphone shit I don't know if that gets done I don't know if I don't know if you get an iPhone unless it's getting made by someone who's making five hours a week I don't I don't know if you do and if you do get it how much does it cost tons what is it like three thousand dollars how much does it cost who's gonna pay like you you already struggling you already got two kids right I mean like you bills to pay like you gonna spend $3,000 when you already struggling we're operating from a place where we have some excess people are trying to make it everyday here yeah they don't give that's why the election should is so simple to me like the Democrats are gonna offer money and Republic's gonna offer jobs and you see it happening right now it's like every platform for the Dems on some level is here's some money hey we should look into reparations here's some money your boy yang was on here how long we just gave everybody $1,000 here's some money yeah just given money right now let's break up Facebook and did it well that's one of the reasons why for hardworking people the Republicans are so attractive even though a lot of people they fall into a lower-income community like that they're not these rich cats they would think they would be looking to have you know like big business succeed but the message is that you roll up your sleeves and you get to work and that you work hard you don't get a free ride and they like that that's also one of the reasons why people that are Republicans are more likely to be involved in churches and a lot of church-going organizations because that's where their community comes from and community support instead of getting community support from the the government they don't get community support from local churches that's a good point yeah so you have your support you have your we all need that man yeah that's something that really is missing with atheists yes community yeah and they're miserable yeah there I've never met this happy atheist it's like they're vegans it's like stop convincing me that God does go if you believe it we're good yeah you don't need to convince me right if you are trying to convince me cuz you don't believe it well it's not that they don't believe it it's just a nerve eyebrow their overzealous dude what do people who are over cells are overcompensating for something right a lot of times what are you overcompensating for with God cuz you know shit is bigger than you cuz you fuckin look up sometimes you're looking at the stars and you're like fuck something's up I don't know what it is I don't know if it's God I don't know if it's aliens I don't know what's going on but you are minuscule yeah and that's hard for people to take man it's like do you think that's why they're really into pushing atheism I think it's cuz the religion that they see is so offensively stupid I mean look it was a funny thing that happened the other day where Pete Davidson did a joke on SNL about the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church demanded an apology right forgive him yeah you're the forgiveness people why my apology how about he made a joke about child molesting you guys are the number one kid fuckin organization in the world how worried about jokes and paying attention the fact that you basically run a kid fuckin organization that also sells Jesus kff can fuck a factory Bell that's man in a lot of ways and but at the same time there's the gray air because they do a lot of fucking good yes they save a lot of people's lives they feed a lot of people right yeah so it's like they they give people community to give people a place to connect yes yeah we're in the most connected time in history and we're the most fuckin disconnected think about that we've got a million friends on you know Facebook and all these other things and people are lonely because we're connected with electronic devices connecting we're not connected with life right and and we're and we're connected to outcome right we're connected to hope did this picture I post get enough likes yeah right that's where they really fucked people with likes once they figured out how to get people like supremely addicted to interactions and exchanges and likes man dude you know when like you know movies in the morning you wake up and you smoke a cigarette mm-hmm right like that was what the movies we watched coming up and that was the first thing that the badass or something like that did in the movie wake up roll over undo the pack you know whatever it will be look at your phone's mentions there's gonna be some of that that's good what these characters do yeah yeah so it's like what do you do you got kids do you take do you say no how do you how do you teach your kid I don't have kids I don't know but like I think about this all the time how do I teach my kid to not put his whole fucking value in the hands of get them involved in sports cuz you learn yeah you learn reality you learn reality yeah you if you don't get that ball in the net it does not score you know there's no points for effort yeah there's no you don't doesn't work that way you got to learn what real life is and you got to learn that there is it feels uncomfortable to fail but that uncomfortable feeling that you get is fuel and then it will generate your kids fail will you let them fall on their face they fall on the first of all time my kids do sports you know that they've been involved in athletics in some form whether it's martial arts or gymnastics since they were little they do things that are difficult we do stuff as a family that are difficult we do like escape rooms we play games we do things that are hard I don't let them win all right yeah I mean my little one I let her win sometimes and stuff like we play carnival games against each other or something like that a lot of carnival games yeah I could go to like Circus Circus like when I was in Vegas I was in Vegas for this thing that my daughter was doing so I took my youngest daughter Circus Circus for playing these carnival games okay I'll let her beat me a bunch of times Shh don't tell her but that's where I'm fun yes laughing being silly talking trash to each other - yes she high-fives me and stuff it's fun but uh I I think there's value in learning that it sucks to lose yeah because that makes you reassess like what you did that the other person did better and how do I beat them yeah it's like what we're talking about weed but weed making you nervous and makes you paranoid like I like that what I like is like I'm entirely too successful I like how vulnerable I think this is it's a lot of good to that you know like legitimately I like that feeling because it makes me it makes me more connected it makes me more humble what do you mean you're too successful well you can only have so much success in this life before you start thinking that you're different than other people you know it's you're thinking that you're something special yeah yeah it's you look if you're on a path right if everybody's on the path and you start off here and then X amount of years later you're way away yeah you could start thinking oh I'm better than all those motherfuckers yeah but you're not you just you just have been on this path longer and you haven't fallen off of it you've figured out what you need to do stay on that path we know a lot of people that were on the path at one time in their career and then something happened and they lost their enthusiasm or their body wasn't as healthy or whatever the fuck happened and they dropped off I'm still on that path why I'm because I figured it out what is it keep going keep going don't be a pussy keep working improve objectively analyze in your performance look at what you're doing wrong treat everything with respect treat all of your endeavors with focus and intensity and intention look at what you're doing and and pay attention and do the work do the goddamn work do the writing do their performing you'll see me I'll do four or five sets a night in LA and I'm doing 15 20 minutes half hour I'll do an hour here I'll go down the Icehouse I'll do an hour the Icehouse do two shows the Icehouse tomorrow night I go I go there's no excuses I go you know it's like the end to me the way I've got it set up it's great my kids go to bed by the time my kids are in bed I leave you're out you know I say goodnight I tuck them in I'm out the door I'm headed to the club I'm home in four hours you know and when I'm when I'm done I get in front of the computer and I write I write I get up in the morning I see him off to school go back to sleep or I go to the gym I get things done keep moving yes I keep moving shark my job is the task it's like my job is I'm trying like right now it's the most exciting time for me in my career arc my my comedy arc because my comedy arc is put out special it's very exciting when you're putting out a special but then the most exciting time is you know my special came out in October yeah so then those months afterwards where it's this mad rush to create a new a new hour in and solidifying perspectives and honing material and uncovering new layers and looking at it and reanalyzing it stepping back and listening to it drunk and listening to it sober and and and and smoking weed and going over it again and just spending time mashing the keys spending time looking at the notes you can type your stuff you know yeah yeah yeah yeah it's very valuable to be able to type because you can get out your thoughts way quicker than you can writing yeah writing makes you remember it better than right yeah remember it better when you write it down physically on paper yeah so if you look at my notebooks I'm like a maniac I'll write the same thing over and over and over again because I'm just writing down my set yeah and writing down my bits and the key parts of the bit so that I have them solid in my brain yeah but my writing in terms of like my most prolific creation of things that I never thought of before comes out writing with a keyboard writing on a computer but can you write how you speak nope but I don't have to so it's just that I come up with gems right this year and they form yes if I was gonna write a bit about Geraldo Rivera and the poppy seeds right I would smoke a joint I would sit down and I would just go router Rivera with his porn moustache strolling around these trained killers in Afghanistan wearing his goofy ass fucking tie right I wonder how those dudes think notice I think Alone's dudes think about strutting around puffing his chest out hanging around these guys been blown people's brains outs for the last six months protecting America while they're also simultaneously protecting hair what like is that when your boy gets shot protecting a fucking heroin field and it doesn't even make it into the paper and then I'll just start going and going and going and going and I might type out a few thousand words and then when I go back I might have two lines or or a seed yeah then I'll take that seed on stage and then I'll try to see if I could water that bitch or if it's toxic no no no you know no how long will you give the toxic that depends depends on the pit some bits are just juicy right out of Ochs some bits he just start them up and you're like oh we got one kid yeah yeah you know and the ones that like what about the ones that don't work but you know there's something there oh you've seed it how long will you water depends on how how intense it is it depends on what's there for me like I had this bit about Bruce Jenner like what really happened like with Bruce Jenner okay you know and I got to try to figure out how do I make fun of this guy becoming a woman how do I do this yeah like how do i how do I figure out how to do this and the way to do it for me was to make fun of myself living with all women because I have a wife and I have three daughters and it's like this law holds feminine energy around me and like that they diminish my manhood so that I had this like that I've never been happier but I've never been more of a bitch in my life this whole long and then it got to you know I've never been more of a bitch in my life but I'm telling you this I'm not going out like Bruce Jenner boom and the whole thing was everyone's like oh he's a woman trapped in a man's body maybe maybe or maybe if you live with crazy bitches long enough you fucking around okay yeah and then I got it this whole bit about the Kardashians becoming like these gargoyles and hovering over his bed and talking to him while he's sleeping he's a long time yeah there's a that's something I would love people I would love for people to know I mean I do this I do this joke all the inside jokes where I just get comics to come and we we take our most divisive premises no one can we work it out together yeah and that'll be so cool to it with you man we'll do it I'll definitely do that be sick no Chris Rock went through that with his probably one of his most famous bit right his most faint one of his most famous bits is I love black people I hate and we're - yeah yeah so that bit is one of his most popular all-time bit he told me he bombed with that for a year oh yeah a year yeah said it could you couldn't get it to work yes but this is a fucking workhorse some people don't know about Chris man like it's a great story that exposed everything about him he was filming his special at the Apollo in New York mm-hmm and there was an after party for his own special that he left so that he could go work on that set at the strip Wow so that's work yeah right you gotta do man the guy didn't become one of the biggest an ups of all combat same with the shit work the chef works yeah keV is out there what rabbit makes you tired exhausting yeah yeah and we get it you can jog yeah yes with him it's like he's like our joke version of the rock you know you know I'm saying like because you fucking never never ends it's all private jets and hitting the gym yeah and fucking concerts in front of 50 million people he's it's the same shit man like this isn't an accident once would wedding is an accident they can expose the ones that are faking the funk boy that's the reason why Netflix took out the fucking thumbs up thumbs down you know all that shit and everyone they liked you because there was a few those specials that look this their specialty that have been on comedy YouTube is interesting because they still have this thumbs-up thumbs-down you know which people do game but the reality of that thumbs up thumbs down is you get to see what the fuck people really think absolutely to a certain extent you think I think it's a hundred percent bullshit doesn't really point it was it was useful but now back to your like point that you have it you have a little bit about how many thumbs up and thumbs down have you ever clicked on zero right yeah so a certain subset of the population is thumbs up and thumbs down it's like well it's like yellow leave comments yeah yeah or bright reviews for fucking food I think you've heard a madrigals bit about that no it's a good bit of us I forget wake I don't want a butcher but if something about like someone left like a like a 3 out of 5 review and it's like who the fuck are you like I get if you loved it right or you hated it right what the that's good right about some people fancy themselves to be like foodies and a journalist you know exploring the subtle nuances of cuisine if you're hungry it's good it is but when you see a guy like Andrew Zimmerman traveling around the world and doing that or you see Anthony Bourdain or a lot of these people you tame I want to be lense for culture though Yeah right it was like it was more than just food it was like what is this food say about the people some of the other guy like like I mean I don't know Zimmern what is it the weird food guy yeah first of all he looks like a salmon and it's just weird when you look at him right yeah it's just Anna's making his way up a fish let's try to get he's trying to get I would say a tuna okay he's got a little tuna at him mmm handsome fella gorgeous could be on a bill um anyway yeah I don't know why the fuck they're leaving these things but it's you know they invested so much money in certain things that were getting down likes and I was like yeah I guess they were doing it with stars right was it stars with Netflix yeah yeah they pulled the star system too bad I had a lot of motherfucking stars bitch yeah people are gonna watch your people gonna watch yours regardless I think you give them an advil and added-value there's certain people that give Netflix the added value and there's certain people that want the value from but it's also they're documenting some of the greatest stand-up specials in the history of stand-up yes like the Chappelle specials maybe some ones that he did they're putting that stuff out there and they're they're doing it in a way where no one else would do it like HBO which was the gold standard for the longest time yeah they would never do to Dave Chappelle specials at the same time Netflix is like okay we'll do names like I got this new shit I want to do I'm gonna do it in the belly room economy store you know and Dave was so ridiculous about it I Dave and I were downstairs yeah while he was doing this while he was filming this we were downstairs in the smoking area of the comic store getting high as fuck yeah and he was so casual about his like hey man you want to do a set like you said on the bus just wanna watch I said no no I did three sets tonight I go I'm just gonna chill and hang out the back of the room but he is so relaxed like during his special being taped he's offering me a guest set he's like hey man we'll do a set you know he still shows up he'll fly to places and show up and just do guest set yeah I was in Denver I come off the greenroom Friday night as Chappelle's there and Chappelle the greenroom what are you doing commands feel like coming to Denver I go you want to do a set he's like oh yeah fuck it so I bring them up on stage the audience is leaving they're leaving come back yeah yeah yeah comes back in just 40 minutes yeah it was amazing because it's just that's how he's doing it he's like he's doing it for the art he's not doing it because he's making any money loves he did a free 40 minute show fucking for these people that came there to see me yeah fucking loves it and it loves it and it's it's like true with him man he's a perfect example of it just being true he'll show up Monday night at the Comedy Store in front of 13 people yeah and he'll go on stage they'll do a half an hour in front of 13 people and he'll drink and he'll smoke cigarettes and he'll talk shit and laughs at his own jokes and everybody has like one of the most magical experiences as a audience member you could ever have I was young comic in New York and there was a place called the comedy village which was the Boston to Boston sure so became comedy village when did it become the village no it's done now but now it's like a Japanese restaurant Japs restaurant no no but uh there's a in this is I'm young like bark and asking people to come in off the street right like and how old were you when you started 23 23 23 yeah and and Chappelle comes in and when he gets on stage there's probably 13 people in the crowd right and the fucking word gets out and you just see people start slowly grabs a goldfish you know what I mean when they could send some little or ducks or something like that when they sent some breads coming in the pond and the place was packed with in like 20 minutes walk outside it was just everybody texting their friend oh my god Chappelle zero so crazy and he did six hours what's broke unreal dude hundred there were bigger girls like falling asleep or something maybe four hours work four hours something like that it will one of these long ones landed its it was jazz right it wasn't like it wasn't like I'm doing bits and I'm murdering the whole time he has this ability to make the audience comfortable in tension so that it is not anxiety inducing right what what he can do is talk to you for five minutes straight without a punchline yeah as an audience member you're not going oh my god this is right is this guy not funny well that was when he was he was doing that for awhile and where he wasn't doing scheduled shows all he was doing was these pop ends and not only that but he brought a fucking speaker and set up a microphone in the park in Seattle outdoor outdoor you know he did that early on yeah I was there I wanted we watched him do it in Monty New York or not do it in Montreal we did a set together at club soda and after we got out set we went outside and Dave just said gather round people gather right and he started doing stand-up to people in the street and they were like what in the fuck he was probably like 20 so do you know William Stephenson yeah comic recipes yes diverse and yeah he was one of the original like comedy in the park guys doing stand-up and what Charlie Barnet was here Barnett yeah yeah yeah and Dave would go with those jumps yep yep and like can you imagine a more hostile environment for stand-up than New York City / New York City Park you compete with guys doing front flips yeah over Swedish pooris yeah and then there's a guy just with jokes yeah hand hanging on his you know handle in his own mm-hmm it's like then you put him on a stage with lights and fucking mic and some cigarettes yeah that's yeah it strength-training it's like running with weights on so how do what the question is how do we do that like how do you find that the the more successful you get when you have people that are coming to see you no matter what where do we get our strength training where do we get my weight and get paranoid that's what I'm saying feel scared yeah feel nervous I like it I really do I do it all I like I joke around on stage about how I take edibles when I go to the airport cuz I like feeling I want to know what the fuck's really bothering me but it's really true I really do do that I take it edible when I fly just so I can freak out because you're too comfortable with this yeah I get something out of that freaking out like I'll find out where the holes in my game are I'll find out where my mental game is lacking what what's really bothering me and then things that freak me out that I don't like about myself I've work on them a fix them you visit the wizard you do you want to visit the wizard I wonder if this comes from having a fighting background because the one thing about fighting is if you have a hole in your game mm-hmm it's exposed in the most brutal way yeah right everything else in life you can ignore the holes in your game yep you can just make oh I'm not a bad storyteller a they were just busy I concentrate on my strengths yep boxing or fight whatever it is it's just like I better keep my hand up yep you better patch up those holes bitch maybe that's what it is with Stan yeah I think that's what it is with me just that's my formula I mean I don't recommend it to everybody who's ever but it isn't have the same personality like you might not have those same deficiencies like it actually might be psychologically damaging to some people to get as high as I get you know like it might fuck with your head too much where you don't come back from it I come back like a nicer person but I'm in the same throws of fucking agony that a lot of people are when they get too high so you're purposely yeah fucking you're shocking my system Shh yeah I purposely freak myself the fuck out yeah and you don't think you'd be able to create without it oh it definitely could but not as good I don't know if I can as good but I know it works I like doing it I like doing it because I always benefit from it I feel like I come back from those little paranoid journeys like a little bit of a better person and I think it's been responsible along with other psychedelics and becoming a father all those things may be a better person may be a nicer person may be more compassionate more understanding more friendly yeah more understanding is the big one more more just I get it you know I don't want to be confident all the time I don't want to always be successful like people listening right now that like that's all they want but they haven't experienced the other side of the coin yeah Jun's saying but when people get too confident and then they have an audience right if you have an audience that's part of the problem is we've all seen this when comics become really successful they work to their own crowd and they don't do sets yeah they don't do a set like I'll do at the store you'll do where there's like ten people on the line and see daliyah yeah they might be there to see a fucking Eliza they might not be there to see me at all right but I want to hit those motherfucker yes I want to hit them hard and they want to go oh look at this meathead you know this fucking chimp looking dude what's he gonna say like you you can't be smart and funny you can't be interesting whatever their biases is I gotta figure out a way to soothe that over and the best way to do that is you got to perform in hostile environments occasionally ya know this is this also critical man you're so critical have good openers leg-up killers can I bring murderers with me on the road only way did I bring Joey Diaz on the road with me man I brought Joey Diaz in the road for years I would tell people they would get white in the face they're like what oh no open for you in Dallas ideas dead Joey do you watch Joey Diaz in front of 6,000 ideas look important and you ain't seen murderer you ain't seen Joey Diaz at the Chicago theater for 3700 people yeah and the fucking lights are dimming yeah the lights are fucking crushing so hard people are falling down yeah they're in pain yeah in pain yeah you've never seen him live I was in love I've really wanted to when I was in LA set it up how long any town for I got to go tomorrow you leaving tomorrow yeah is he around tonight I'll find out I would love to he might check they might be doing set at the store tonight I'll ask him Manus there he's the goat his opinion really yep whoa I never seen anybody funnier whoa he's might not be the best writer and he might not have the most consistently after hours but in terms of the highest highs that motherfucker breaks through the magneto sphere and he he Wiggles out into the outer atmosphere of space like no one he hits these highs we're like comics comics were crying like holding your stomach crying and he's screaming and yelling and it's like you ain't seen nothing like it man he was on stage I wrote about I put it on my Instagram the other day he crushed so hard and I can't even say what he was talking russian so hard yeah and with such controversial material so good unapologetic good push yeah any one point time people were like what the way he goes what do you want from me I'm almost dead yep you think I give a fuck and people were dying I mean dying I don't think there's ever been a person for I've seen everybody dude I've seen everybody from Rock to Chappelle the louis c.k I watched Sam Kinison when he was alive I saw Bill Hicks when he's alive I opened up I'm a follow I had to follow Pryor when he was dying when it looked for five weeks in a row but I saw Pryor live I've seen everybody live I saw Martin Lawrence and he's in his prime people forget out funny Martin Lawrence was he was distraught I saw him back when he's wearing leather jumpsuits he realized man was leather jumpsuits and smash smash just struggle on after him but I never saw anybody like Joey Joey's on another level who is who's your toughest follow Joey without a doubt yeah man you got a you got to ride that wave but that's what's good about is like if you're if you're funny and you're working on your stuff and you're you enjoy comedy you go on stage already laughing so you go on stage already in a good mood that's that's what's up like part of the being a tough tough follow is two things one you're used to going on after scrubs and there's a lot of guys that are good comics but they like to bring scrubs on the road with them and then they get settled in in that easy sort I'm gonna save the show exactly there's a lot of guys that do that man they'll take guys in the road with them there really are barely professionals yeah and these guys are filling theatres yeah and they're bringing weak acts yeah and they force this audience to sit through a half an hour of bullshit before they go onstage and then there's guys who don't do it like that they just look I don't know I don't know who was doing it that way before I was doing it but my thought was I like if a guy makes me nervous when I go on after him that's gonna make me ramp it up like I don't I don't walk on stage cold I'm backstage throwing punches and doing jumping jacks and I'm doing breathing exercises when I come onstage I'm fucking guns blazing yeah that that's in you go on after Joey Diaz when he hits that crescendo ready when you came into the store I remember I was about to ask you something and you're on the wall and then you just fold it in half and touch your toes and I was like what the fuck is going khals all right this is ritual I'm gonna let him do his thing up yeah I get loose and I figured out that over the over time you could just walk on stage and everything would be fine yeah or you walk on stage with it already you got some intention yeah I can sometimes I got to remind myself of certain things to get up there now the most important thing I learned is reminding myself that this crowd wasn't at the last show yeah like you sometimes you would take that energy from the early show you're just bodying it and you're like oh I got this let's go let's just walk they weren't there so you can't do that coming back yeah you know you gotta you gotta always always appreciate the audience's attention span and that's something that I've really learned from Boston and Boston it's cold as fuck the women aren't the prettiest in the world and people are angry yeah and they got to work in the morning is that a right B I'd be ready i Tuesday night I did this I did this thing and I never got picked up and I put it out as part of this like series essentially it's like I emulated Bourdain's thing I want to look at a city through the lens of comedy mood right and I the first city I pick was Boston because all my favorite comics are from Boston and I'm like why the fuck as this city produced so much funny what are such immigrant people is that it yeah so they wouldn't land the matter and what type of funny huh Patrice O'Neal's Marco right so it's like but Patrice but is one of the girls for sure you can do Bill Murray one-liners yeah Burke late whatever Steven Steven Steven Wright Conan is from the area I think we're talking about all different types of comedy mmm Silverman's I think from New Hampshire or something like that right but like there's something about the region that no matter what style you see you funny come from here yeah where you're from area what what part is it Newton Newton Boston you're actually yeah yeah so start in Boston I knew you started there but I didn't know if you were from the city or what I was born in New Jersey but I lived all throughout my high school years and everything I lived in Boston so it's like what the what the fuck is it about this city what is called what's cold as fuck it's cold in Minnesota yeah but something there I was too cold hi you need to be warming up to talk to people yeah you need to be warm enough we go outside also well you know it's a scene that's like a scene has to be established too because Boston does not have a scene it used to have in the 80s right but LA has a better seen than ever yes and scenes are fluid they come and they go you know like Denver has a scene and they have a scene because of Wendy who owns the comedy company lurks here but there's there's different places that have scenes and Barry Crimmins and Lenny Clarke and Steve Sweeney and Don Gavin or all those guys that were part of the ding ho in the 1980s and Steve was on my podcast yeah those guys created a scene and through that scene the and because they were all competing with each other for spots on The Tonight Show and all these different little venues they created a monster dynamic where all these young guys were coming up following these killers and I was very fortunate to be one of those guys and that's why I wanted to talk to Steve and tell him that on the shows like I saw that fucking guy I saw that guy murder murder to the woman no and nobody was watching in terms of like the national audience it was just Boston but he would go onstage at Nick's Connolly stop and level the crowd leveled it like a fucking hydrogen bomb dropped in the middle of the room you know just boom so you learn what killing is yeah like I feel like one of the toughest things about the alternative scenes and I'm not knocking necessarily comedy but the the litmus test for murdering is different you know when I was coming up in New York and I had to follow you know recipes Mike DiStefano you know Greer Barnes guys that maybe are not household names but people on career greens a beast Greer and I didn't shows together we did colleges together bro back on the road wave in the 90s if if you want to know at least for me if you want to know what Chappelle is Chappelle is Tony woods and Greer he is a Tony was another beast but Tony is unfathomable but like he's the gremlin that popped off of both of their back so if you could mold them together like everything that is amazing about Tony and amazing about Greer well I mean that's how it is with music that's how it is with everything we need each other you know that's why when I see a guy like you coming up I'm like oh good thank you I'm happy you're around I like it I like comedy if I stopped doing comedy tomorrow I want more comedy to watch you know I love LA I love laughing yeah I like that's why I tell you I love sit I sit down and watch Joey Diaz I fucking love ,
