hello freak bitches but look at that the same way I kind of look at music or the same way I look at writing or comedy or anything so it's fascinating to me watching someone go after something and and and put it together and make something that is almost unfathomable take place whether it's a creation of an album whether it's you know comedy special whether it's a someone writes an amazing book I love when people get shit done yeah yeah I do too it's a beautiful thing yeah right yeah well as artists right like does that like as an artist does that inspire you when you see like if you go to see a great movie or read a great book or something like that does that inspire you to want to create yeah it doesn't inspire me to create a write a book right right right but I think I kind of know what my lane is at this point yeah yeah but yeah I mean I'll definitely go see a movie or or read you know and and it'll get my creative juices flowing mmm and you know inspired me to be to just be better and try and contribute you know I didn't contribute something good or be positive and make make myself feel something to make somebody else feel something I don't know it does something to me definitely it's hard to describe I've still can't on you know describe what it is that makes this creative thing click or explain how I do what I do but you know definitely see in movies are here and you know here in um you know like great musicians great guitar players something you know to freak me out mmm yeah it's evolved a little bit you know what I mean I'm like this but yeah that's like okay I respect that let me go get on you hit on my game and yeah this guy was born in the 60s yeah you to take over yoga's thousands of years old the balls the balls on this guy literally I'll tucked away in that little rape smuggler anywheres there was a guy in my class that used to go there for a while he used to wear the crepe smuggler yeah he was very SOT nom he was very yeah oh ma stay no hit a man bun - yeah it's muggers in a man bun I want to beat you up in the parking lot totally totally and I think the other women look at you over there and you're Nike workout stuff and like all right he's he's fine they think so yeah they like thank you for not doing that I hope so I don't know the place I go to is very nice very nice people yeah but again it's not like the hot young hard but I'm probably the best looking girl in the class rude it was a joke didn't help it it's not true either cute ones but the point being is that's not what it is it's you know but there is a sexual vibe there day I mean you're just there to do yoga but there is that kind of thing and which is why I'm not too big a fan of the classes that team you up where they want you to partner up this thing yeah you ever have that no oh like you stretch you out yeah I get a partner get on the happy baby with your legs behind you know your partner push down on you you know fart on this lady that be actually the smart food as a married man that would be the smart how much porn takes place in the oldest - yoga studio where the yoga teacher says I would like to review some poses with you after class there's some of you some tips that I'd be like if you were Melissa let's just be as politically correct about this possible if you were single and the person actually was into you and this all went down according to this this that would be the greatest like fantasy ever like you're in that hot yoga class all hot and sweaty and afterwards the teacher wants a fuck whoa damn she's like Tom I just really feel like your practice could aid with just a little private one-on-one instruction yes you'd be like sure sure the first we're gonna start with massage okay lie on your back all right oh okay and she's rubbing your feet and lifting your legs I'm just gonna stretch your legs out and she's rubbing the inside of your thighs and you start moaning she moans back thing you know it's on time papa namaste [Music]
