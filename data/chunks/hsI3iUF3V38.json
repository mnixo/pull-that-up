talking about before the podcast started we want to hear me I'm gonna pour some yeah coffee like an alcoholic meeting I need a cigar hey I'm Joe don't don't have cigars I do right we should they're in one of these things one of the things that I realized is that if you work out like I'm working out like fucking three hours a day yes I'm trying literally trying to kill Burt on one part to try to keep up with me you want him to die though I'm trying to kill him yeah I'm trying to give him a heart attack cuz you know what bothers me what this is all weed and there's mushrooms in here and there's no cigars all good shit a humidor we're gonna get a huge humidor for you humid or humid um what I realized this is what I'm trying to kill Burt yeah he likes to pretend that he's a shepherd yes this effort is spectacular ya know it's nice to pretend that he can push himself and he's got this incredible will he's in last place of course yeah deadly by quite a bit yeah it's really sad yeah and you know he takes days off when everybody doesn't he take it I took three days off when I went to Vegas I'm still in the lead yeah well you know hit I've seen I've seen his cooking show I know I eats I've seen his fucking it's the booze man yeah and the booze to his body I mean he's yeah I love Burt and this is one of the reasons why I'm trying to kill him I fucking hate him let's fight you son of a bitch you want him to realize like this is not you're ten years younger than me and you have to take high blood pressure medication this is all not good yeah no it's you're doing something terrible to your body by drinking every night yeah you shouldn't do it would you do a bottle of night you think she gets down dude yeah yes daddy drink he'll drink a whole box of wine when those box wines he's a friend he's a Francia freak he's an animal man he'll drink a whole Tito's like a whole jug I've seen that I've seen that go down what's going on here he's freaking out the shirt off it takes his shirt off no shit us yeah look at that fucking stomach here's the thing can you see his dick do you think he sees his day we could search for it yeah find it it's a hiding hiding go this is there's a podcast I saw this Norton and him he what was he was saying on this hall his wife for something and asked about what some about sex and his kids were oh his kids were in the car Oh wonderful yeah any been any planning he hasn't done that with no shit hammered but Tom lost all the weight when they'd had that weight-loss challenge two years ago not last year the year before no but score looks good Segura never gained it back no yes taste a little yeah he looks fucking fat he looks fantastic and he's in the hunt it's like Ari and him are just behind me are in him are neck-and-neck Ari's number two and he's just behind re and then Segura's weight I mean way Bert is way behind it but Ari needs to lose no weight zero weight he's our deal and he's already thin as fuck he's down to 180 pounds he said for the first time in like decades what is he 6 3 4 4 6 4 yeah right that's gotta be right for um but he looks great yeah he's thin and healthy I mean for a snarling Jewish guy he looks good yeah his face is bad but his body looks good little angry without the wheat this is helping him and this is one of the things I was saying is that working out like I'm literally working out 2 sometimes 3 hours a day you do - you split it up or you just wonderful just go what I go ham fuck I'll just go hard I'll just mix things up like I'll run and then I'll come back from running and I'll kick box then after a kick box I'll get on the elliptical machine or I'll lift weights and after I lift weights and then I'll get on the fucking echo bike you know with the echo but you know yeah darn thing and then I'll get on the Versa climber and get on the rowing machine I just do rounds when I can't row anymore look at this fucking puddle I left behind this is a puddle on my elliptical machine jesus fucking christ yeah I mean it was crazy this is two hours on the elliptical machine and this was I just wanted to see like what's possible and then how I felt the next day I felt fine the thing is I work out a lot already submit now my body is just adjusting to like a ramped up schedule yeah all right doesn't work out at all he hasn't worked out in 10 plus years so for him this is like a whole new thing yeah but he's still second place it's his mind or he's got a strong mom yet he's got a will so what does the end sugru is just gonna finish somewhere in the middle saguru my win do you never do you think oh come come up how do one beat me no there should be much anger I should be something big big on the line yeah there's nothing I see salt yeah it should be something big I have to finalize that belt Jamie it's a good artwork yeah but yeah folks get at me on instagram so Gramps use the hashtag you know use like at Joe Rogan tag me and if you win I'll give you 500 bucks okay look at that people are scrambling fuckin pens rise up with the best design I'll give you 500 bucks if I don't choose anybody nobody gets shit we haven't already don't use anybody you burn the money that's what Joe's gonna do is gonna burn a quick yeah we need it quick I have an artist that's trying to work on it too so there's a run there's like this is a mad run here but the thing what I was gonna say is yeah all bullshit aside and jokes and I do love yeah yeah yeah I do love everybody else doing this but about all jokes aside I have like zero anxiety zero worry zero stress like when you burn your body out like that do like two hours of working out a day no yeah I don't give a fuck about anything like I'm in traffic people caught me off mic give a fuck fuck good cut me off dickhead who cares I'm not angry like there's nothing what is it because your body so burnt you think you're just so fucking exhausted I think this is my my feeling I feel a lot of those a lot of those feelings would you have whether it's anxiety or stress it's just extra energy that your body has it's unnecessary it's unnecessary energy and it's just like your body's looking for trouble that isn't there reading for danger that isn't there looking you know look looking for something that's gonna like steal your food or invade your village all that shit who's gonna kill my family well I think your body has to have a certain but the way we were designed right for all the years that we were running away from wild animals and other tribes and all that shit I think your your body in your brain have a certain amount on reserve always looking for some sort of danger looking at your see a deer in the wild that's like like oh yeah twitchy and yeah they snapping around shot a mountain lion top mountain lion that a mountain there's a mountain lion in my neighborhood by the way there is yeah the neighborhood one of the neighbors spotted a mountain lion you got your fucking boa yeah good luck shooting a mountain lion would be fun though huh you'd have to the odds of you shooting them out yeah what is that that walks by that lady is that a cat that's a fucking no that's not a cat what said it was a mountain lion because of how its tail popped up it it looks like a mountain lion but it's just way too casual walking by her she doesn't give a fuck it definitely looks like a cat she thought it was a dog huh it kind of looks like a dog it's this way to calm the way it walks by er that's not a wild cat I think that's a dog man but it doesn't look like a dog maybe a mountain lion made its debut nobody knows what the fuck it's terrifying or not and wildlife experts are looking at that video and they're like that see like I'm down a wildlife expert but I've seen a lot of wildlife the tail does not look right the tail looks like a cat does it yeah yeah it does see it again the tail definitely said cat doesn't look a dog tail it looks like a balancing tail like if you look at out I guess yeah it's like yeah yeah yeah it kind of does look like a fucking proceed again I'm sit again that's a fucking dog though you know people trim their dog hair and they make their dog but it's like whale looks man it's like the tail it's holding its tail in the air yeah yeah it is we check the tracks and they were definitely dog tracks see there we go just a dog it's a faggot dog it's my dad I told myself I was gonna say the f-word anymore and they did it and snuck out talking about a dog it makes its way out I think this out of a closet this dog identifies as a cat it did I heard the dog identifies as a person now that it doesn't it wants to be called Cal Kelvin that's its name yeah the dog says I'm Kelvin well I'd have to respect its feelings mm-hmm it has every right to be whatever it wants to be man you just assume that animals I fucked up assumed its its identity yeah that's fucked up big mistake on my part got a lot of fucking nerve go right to have a lot of nerve that's I'm fucking deeply embarrassed by myself you need to go to support group for people who think that dogs are just dogs there was not even a cat maybe it's just a sentient being maybe it identifies as like a sentient being it's just a being it's an orb of energy dog not a cat just stating that it exists yeah and maybe we don't have the right to define it I can really call something a cat by whose judgment my humans judge and that's a feminine word and you assigned it you asan yeah you say a cat the way you said it sounds feminine what about cool cat like if you're a cool black guy yeah he's a cool black people up there rules don't apply that they don't use that anymore do they cool anybody no no once an jive Turkey anymore either guy of Turkey was fun I bet though for a while who do you think was the last guy to say jive Turkey in all earnestness I think I think I sound like a shitty the movie in the 90s were somewhat like a black comic used jive Turkey Oh Nick Cannon I saw a thing and Nick Cannon look up jive Turkey in a standard ed serious he's cut it out John Turkey yeah oh but he's probably being silly comedian yeah sure comedy special sure yeah yeah Jimmy smirking it was called his stand-up comic version was called stand-up don't shoot really I'm dead serious it's called stand up don't shoot okay any war any war uh you know he wears like a spacesuit yeah what is it called cat outfit he wears like a fucking what is it called when them Indian Muslims had where he doesn't he know no job a job a job yeah he wasn't his job yes he does that's a fucking it I know not but look groom the Canon he job he where's the shit fucking but Howard Stern was giving him shit about it forever because he keep because he was wearing it watch a little comeback soldier bro he wears a turban oh wait a minute what the fuck Nick Cannon explains his reason for wearing a turban get to the zoo please on Ellen I just don't have any breath of my body what is his explanation I don't remember what he said it me say I don't know some fucking bullshit I'm in a second you know me I'm a conspiracy theorist I think the government did that they set her up what is that about Mariah now that was some hold on a second Ellen 58 then asked Nick about Mariah's New Year's Eve televised performance that was marred by technical difficulties and he said you know me I'm a conspiracy theorist I think the government did that I think they set her up it was a distraction oh he's joking yeah no no see you said he was a comic I was hilarious that was so funny why does he say I like his white chiffon jacket that's I've never seen a white one like that it's like an old-school motorcycle jacket but it's white guys can't wear white jackets that's what not I can't sure they can you can't wear a white leather jacket I can with hoop earrings okay earrings yeah I want to see you wear those if I had hair braids that should be the bet hoop earrings you white guys they don't seem to get called out for cornrows it's really a white girls can't wear cornrows yeah but white guy do you see white guys with cornrows I don't ever see white guys look at this Nick Cannon weight gain what the fuck is wrong with people let the guy gain a little weight you fucking idiots worry about yourself but taint bourbon where does his reasoning for the turban I can't that picture that I posted on my Instagram about the British Iraqi genderqueer whatever the fuck is look at this quantum physics really helped me understand my queer identity I'm British Iraqi gay non-binary and identify as that is real by the way this is a video if you go to whose Instagram Oh James Woods posted it on his Twitter page if you go to James Woods Twitter page and he says is that that's all eg right that's B satisfy knee yeah or that's Sascha this is Sasha Baron Cohen yeah if you go to his Twitter page and you find it from yesterday that's where I saw it and there's an actual video that goes along with it now here's what's interesting when you listen to this person I don't want to assume it's out there no just something this something it seems very intelligent like a very intelligent person sure but yeah I post a lot all James Woods does all day is just drink coffee and talk shit about liberals keep going down yeah just keep going it was some Cavanaugh mixed in he's got some fake news mixed in it's in there I like beer into you how I still like beer keep going I might be in there no no no I don't think so BAM okay go live yeah go large go large on this go large go line and bring it to the beginning because this is quite Pollak hold our breath the beginning here we go my name is Lambros tea that you might categorize as intersectional i'm british iraki gay non-binary and also identify as Muslim and the Glitter isn't in physics his makeup I've never seen on any human to t1 of physics has helped him understand this queer identity okay no listen she's fucking space cadet the pictures are insane the listen glorious sect of physics that looks at the subatomic particles that govern our world so inside the neutrons electrons and the protons are looking at the quarks leptons bosons and the Higgs whereas classical Newtonian physics is obsessed with the universal formula that govern our reality it's so fixed resolute answers quantum physics reveals that there is no fixed reality and it's full of beautiful contradictions okay so here's my point you can keep going on and watch this but this is a very intelligent person so why am I so dismissive why why can't this person we're weird like if a woman was beautiful and she wore like a dark red lipstick but she was talking brilliant science I wouldn't have an issue with it so why do I have an issue with this glamour ooh fella it's character glamour a fella WOM lam rich oh why do I have an issue with the bright blue glittery lips the literal rainbow colored eyeshadow with glitter the falsest akashi 6:9 is that what is this Takashi six nine and I think here's my thing with this whole thing I don't give a fuck what you want to be who you want done if I with I'm for real cool with all that shit I think this is like peacocking and it's at its finest form this is calling for attention so the reason that we all are like ahh and when they get mad like what are you looking at you know what someone's like what are you looking at you're like you you you fucking did this show for me to see otherwise you'd stay in private and have your own life you want me to react but why do I like some of it like if there's a seven-year-old black dude and he's got like a red velvet suit on he looks cool as shit right with like a slick Fedora and he's walking down the street with a fucking snake head silver cane Hey Joe Rogan you know I'm saying yeah look at this cool motherfucker yeah but he's peacocking as well yeah but it's a different this but this is attention-grabbing because they want you to do these people the people who do who want to be larger than life that do things like this to express who they really are mean that they want to have a discussion whether or not they want to have true discourse they want you to go what is this what are you what they want that they also wanted like quote unquote inform you or argue with you about who they are yeah said identity yeah but why that's my whole thing why can't you just be be the thing you want I don't you don't need to have so many fucking with that nine labels and my rocking gay British Muslim it's like dude what I'm just your glam agree with you yeah be glamorous but I also myself I'm questioning my own judgmental nature he's saying why we joke because I care because it's outside the realm of normalcy it but what is no no see this is the this is these are pre fucking normal foods from from ghent from normal standards of what's kind of the same thing you've seen for the past you know right so we fit in the culture where we don't stand out so we're not asking for additional attention I don't yeah no yeah this is this is a call to attention a call to discussion and and again I don't give a I don't have anything against this fucking person I don't know I'm I don't give a shit about him I just know that this is clearly for you to go what the fuck that's why they that's why that is what if I was just exactly like this but I a thick rope chain with a star on it that had all diamonds you want me to say something about it that's why you wore that right you'd want me to go why the fuck you why you wearing that shit right why the fuck are you wearing right in fact it would be insane if I sat here the whole fucking interview and didn't end wasn't like didn't do a show what the fuck is the star like the size of like a Mercedes emblem roll and diamond and you'd be the asshole if you go what what does this do I have to fucking to do you have to know my identity with my this is a part of my culture man okay well explain it cuz I don't get it because it's not what I'm fucking used to or okay how about a white guy who dresses like that but talks like he's not a white guy right right right like the whole well dude this guy here's that's every guy's cool he's a great role he's actually so good at it do you think he really got pistol-whipped in Brooklyn and robbed or did he no no I think that was all a big fucking media push but I think he's a genius for doing it cuz it got him way more attention and I think I think mr. Rob I think this kid is is actually very smart what do you say Jimmy you got his stuff back they took his chain and shit and they gave it back real thieves don't get shit back the chains go back sometimes what do you know about black streets some guys sometimes the chains come back I'm on black Twitter you guys don't know my black pen mark I went to the Drake concert I bought the Carter five fellas listen up jay-z and Beyonce will no longer speak to Kanye and Kim Kardashian fact according to the fucking fake news bro no it's just out yesterday yes disavowed Kanye West and Kim Kardashian because of his position on Trump Jamie's got a Google it but but you know I don't bleed yeah Jamie fastest one-handed typer in the fucking business look at that see it's over bitch twenty-two hours of guys motherfucker the Daily Mail sever ties it's in hotnewhiphop calm news it's on NME with NME new media entertainment sever ties sever ties it's over we sever ties motherfucker we're not talking to you anymore you don't come to our champagne parties over bitch watch the throne - yeah but it's just more press an album clap out yeah well jay-z's probably can't do it that's crazy motherfucker anymore yeah but you know what this whole thing with Kanye and this whole push about getting Kaepernick to have lunch with Trump it's brilliant it's fucking I think he used the whole platform of SNL just to get Trump to go I love Kanye he wants Trump to be so in love with it Kanye wants Trump to love him so much that he's willing to actually take a meeting with someone he's been publicly shitting on for a year now all Trump has been doing is saying Kaepernick is a terrible representation of this country a bad football player a bad person he's been dumped and dump a dump and then Kanye he's gonna sucker him and twist his mind into thinking he should actually sit have lunch with him I'm I bet my life it'll happen that Trump will go okay I'll take a meeting because I love Kanye and it's just out of respect for Kanye so he'll get a Samba he'll get him and fucking Kaepernick in the room I swear to God watch it how I hope he does but here's the thing Donald Trump's not a cop and he's not shooting black people oh yeah the whole thing is bizarre yeah I don't know it makes no sense when Kaepernick is on his knees during the national anthem that's bizarre too yeah because people are just there for a game it's a game I completely understand that you're disgusted by police brutality sure I think virtually everyone is yeah and my take on it is its first of all it's insanely difficult to be a police officer you have a lot of people that are police officers that have no business holding that job they're under extreme pressure a lot of them have PTSD and a lot of them they're bullies and they get into this position because they want to be the guy with the gun in charge totally and then they have an opportunity to pull that trigger and they do and they face repercussions because someone was filming it mm-hmm and I think that shit has happened from the beginning of time yeah of course and there's film there's a horrible film that we played where there was a guy I posted it on my Twitter it's fucking horrible of a guy shooting a white guy who's crawling for his life on the voice telling the guy to crawl towards him let me see your hands it's in Arizona and the guy's pants have fallen down he keeps reaching back to grab his pants and he goes he goes I will fucking shoot you if you grab your pants and the guy is crawling and his pants are falling down who tries to grab his pants and the guy lights him up in the hallway of a hotel yeah fuck just kills him fucked murdered him the guy was crying and begging for his life and the cop was making crawl towards him like why the fuck would you ever make someone crawl towards you that's insane and he's giving them all these confusing directions while he's in full riot gear holding a gun apparently the guy had a fake pistol like a water pistol or a water gun and was holding it out the window and someone saw it and they said there's a guy with the guns and they came in they're ready to shoot somebody already and then they see this guy but the guy was clearly not threat you see this and this guy had already been in trouble for other police brutality and then got kicked off the force he got acquitted by the way they with video got acquitted and then they got acquitted of the murder yes acquitted he murdered this with the video with got acquitted and then afterwards got kicked off the force for something else he did right the guy was just an abusive guy at the time he was just going off there's a lot of people like that totally and and there's also some that are racist - it's not discounting racism there are some that are racist too but it's just a fucking insanely difficult job right no one respects or very few people respect and these people are in these situations every day where their life is in danger yeah and their whole brain is frazzled I'm friends with a lot of cops I know a lot of cops are had cops in my family I know a lot of cops from MMA I know a lot I've known a lot of cops of my whole life like my whole life growing up my my real dad was a cop I grew up like knowing cops when I was a kid and then you know all through martial arts knew cops because cop sir was taking martial arts to learn how to defend themselves right it's a fucking insane job yeah it's crazy it's fucked up and every day all day long you're dealing with people that are committing crimes you're dealing with people that are lying you're dealing with people that are lying to you right you pull people over their line either they're drunk they're on drugs they've got a body in the trunk it's just lies well even a simple pullovers alive when you know fast you're going like knowledge it Amit Lee had a broken speedometer once and the cop pulled me over and I go this gonna sound so fucking stupid my speedometer doesn't work he's like get that shit fixed I go yeah I shit let me go you know why I'm white white dude white guy and it was only 18 the time black dude is like name it saying you know it's not even something to joke about I'm sad that you just joked about it no but it is fucked up it's fucked up it is fucked up man but here's the thing right ball players like capper to people like that they kneel because they wanted what they using their platform yeah I mean I get that you should use your fuck everyone should use our platform here's my thing though has that helped in any way well no see the problem is there's no there's no okay the problem is if you set the Kaepernick what's your end game to say stop all police violence is like such a vague broad thing to go yeah just stop it it's like well that's not that to have a dialogue about it was what's important but the problem is they need to have we need there needs to be a bigger goal for why people are kneeling like because the conversation is already being had it's not like we're kneeling so we can talk about it what we're talking about it we need that there needs to be some kind of a an end game a goal a point of that it's not I'm not saying it's achievable it's not necessarily going to happen but you need you need something to - you need something to get to because otherwise this is just gonna be this weird turmoil between ultimately racist people because truly the people that are yelling about it that are angry I don't give a fuck - take a knee are they still gonna play football why do you care yeah like but ultimately people that are like you better stand up better stand up boys it's for America oh yeah ideas that we're all on the same team I know but this if we don't want to support the team but why why kneel during but why then because it's because people are paying attention that's exactly right because they all the eyeballs are on right but the idea about a Nation about everybody being on the team together we're supposed to support right these ideals that this song is about I pledge of allegiance to the flag all this jazz I mean that's what we're doing right I know but I find it so odd that things have anything to do with one another I said it on stage one time that I was like it's a game that has no bearing on the future of the United States of America you don't do that for anything else right you don't just you don't have like a dinner party and play Monopoly and someone's like we should say the Pledge of Allegiance it's one thing the UFC stopped that I really liked was saying they wouldn't do the fucking national anthem though what are we doing we're here for cage fights these two men competing at a sport but it was a big thing with boxing and it still is I think he'll do the national anthems before big boxing matches and it's boring it's miserable so you see people sing and it's when people do that thing with their voice they try to be Daytrotter they trying to Wow that's a funny thing ever at any sporting event in the middle of that hole that blast stretch there's always like 50,000 people go like these I think the crossover is so fucking silly we don't need to be singing about America at sporting events it doesn't have anything that doesn't have a the Olympics definitely that's what it's fucking about this is my country versus your country but during about the Olympics I know but I'm just saying I get that fucking national anthems at the Olympics that's what it is but this is just the Packers versus fucking you know the Buccaneers this has nothing you the bearing of American future or will the soldiers fought for your right to be able to put on as far for your rifle to do fucking everything to do do we have to say it before this podcast right I should okay we should swear as a goddamn flag behind me know Santino goddamn American flag yeah but secretly the fans don't know that Joe hates the Americans left on my phone bitch goddamn Americans see this is this is a motherfucker this is trolling he's trolling Joe is actually Canadian nobody knows that shows a conspiracy Rogan theorists online like it's Joe

think there wasn't that I put on my Instagram yesterday that you shouldn't say pregnant woman oh yeah I didn't assumed the gender of someone who's pregnant it's you were supposed to say look at the post training someone that's people were like that's a troll right that's the onion no no no that's real shit no no we are in the fucking twilight zone right now yeah here it is say this of all genders can become pregnant because people of all genders can have the reproductive organs to do so what in the holy fuck instead is set instead of saying pregnant women try using the phrase pregnant people keep going down because people of all genders can fall pregnant you can focus right now not yet fuck falls pregnant pregnant Joe oh I've fallen pregnant because he oh of all genders can fall pregnant can you call in if you're a man can you call and work and say hey I'm not gonna be in today because I fell pregnant they do give that maternity leave for guys yeah oh good identify as pregnant I'm I've just fallen pregnant I need to not come into work yeah well how does that work see but this is what's this is this see this is why this is a propaganda bullshit lie of like getting us all on the same page of not all genders can can have reproductive or and that's not true reproductive organs this is really simple you can't fab it is too easy to survive so people are coming up with all sorts of different kinds of conflicts that they're not real I guarantee you all those people that are doing this they're not working out three hours a day fucking owls they did they wouldn't be paying any attention to this shit yeah it's not it's like this is nonsense instead of saying women are pregnant say instead of saying pregnant women try using the phrase pregnant people oh well they corrected himself the post should say become pregnant at a fall pregnant think your father should pointed this out you put it you wrote that yourself the language you use affects the people around you people of all genders can become pregnant because people of all genders can have the reproductive organs to do so when talking about pregnancy try to use the language that is inclusive of people of all genders well there's 78 different genders now 79 Joe don't be so fucking ignorant you know it's no gender this kind of bullshit is due to boredom this is complete boredom well it's also weak pussies these people that are doing this I guarantee you if they're if this is where you're looking for conflict yeah you you're fucking the whole life is falling apart you're a mess this idea that you're proposing that people of all first of all it's insulting to women it should be deeply insulting yeah no shit oh of all genders can be pregnant the fuck they can yeah you know god damn difficult it is for a woman your your what your wife hasn't been pregnant yet but let me tell you something man I've seen a lot of women pregnant it's rough it's insane hard yeah women get pregnant and it's hard for them yep that's what his pregnant fucking difficult their whole body goes through these crazy hormonal changes they gain a shit ton of weight they get insecure they have crazy mood swings you have chemicals and brain changes postpartum depression with you get suicidal it happens in a lot of women the idea that all genders all genders no no bullshit bullshit lies biology when the fucker there's only fuck it only there's only one there's only one gender that can become pregnant a woman yes that's a woman and that's the end of the discussion but there's not an argument there's

if you can get heat to it 10 out of 20 words without using the red squiggly line underneath the but your phone the fact that Donald's nodding at him I know it should be fluid should be doping fuck did I get to this position when I'm in the Oval Office you know why sitting because he wanted to see kata Kim Kardashian so mad he was like I let this motherfucker come mmm yes mmm imagine these photographers have like man I've taken it's like they've been in such important rooms and they're like now I'm here but see the Kanye thing is like they just let him rant about shit and no one goes wait what take his five meds he's not taking his fucking meds he even said that he stopped taking meds right Jamie isn't that the whole thing it's like yeah take your meds bro heads made him gained a ton of weight and he looked really fucking spaced out did you ever see fat kanye yeah fat kanye is pulpipi of fat kanye with the meds fine so what happened was after he gave his support for Donald Trump he said I didn't vote but if I voted I would have voted on Trump yeah look how big he got they they loaded him up with pills and when they loaded him up with pills he vanished for a while canceled his tour he was like having a fucking serious nervous breakdown and he got big fat that's you that's when he was that's when he was on the pills oh yeah he was mentally fucking stable no I'd rather be fat stable this is what I think because of sober October I think he just needs to work out see I was just gonna say I don't I don't I don't think I don't think it's a part of his lifestyle I think his lifestyles so well that's not true cuz one of my friends was his trainer though he does work out he had a trainer for a while see I feel like he doesn't worry he seems like God that just doesn't have the he had a trainer yeah trust me yeah no I mean he lost weight after all this bullshit was a long time ago yeah he had a trainer I want to say my friend was doing it he looked really good good great seven years ago yeah well you know I don't want to disclose any trainer client confidential shit but it was working out yeah he was working out but the point is look the guys fucking obviously a little loony but that's also why he's so fucking creative fuck yeah I mean that's why his music good I mean I don't think you have to be completely normal look most of my best friends are other fucking minds you're not fucking normal I'm not knowing I got real problems yeah we all right well we all do anybody that's good at something but I also have a lot of self-examination and that's what he's lacking well Susan yes self awareness yes yeah I examine the things that I think and say and how I interact with people and I don't always get it right but when I see him doing that holding court in front of the President of the United States with a mag a hat on like in front of all these fucking people taking pictures of them like threats preposterous yes Christ don't use words like dope because I try to use only positive like lovely dope is positive Devine it's dope like you you sent me a text and I say you Tex let's do 10 a.m. dope dope dope great perfect plus great negative next time you text me I'm gonna go divine yeah if I get when I saw your car I was like dude that's a dope car it's divine Joe oh it's lovely it's lovely it's wonderful it's one that's a wonderful few times in all honesty and I always feel like I'm wonderful will you sound like a bitch a little bit a little bit hey how how was how was that thing you did yesterday it was wonderful oh okay it was wonderful hello cocktail words do you use when you're hanging around with actors yeah was my god wonderful he was a wonderful wonderful perform especially when you're talking about a woman she was exquisite wonderful her performance was so wonderful you know the work is amazing we're supportive really and supporter of woman I hate brilliant in the actor community people say brilliant it bothers me so when they go oh my god just brilliant you're like unless it's brilliant yeah but the rarity of that word sure it should be so so it would should be used so less but you go see Roger Waters at the Hollywood Bowl and like fuck it was brilliant big difference that's of course yes that is brilliant yeah but that's that's decades of hard work and talent and and so many things coming together to make I watched him through the wall here what three years ago at Staples Center and and I was sober ish let's just say that I was sober ish I was micro dosing and I was sober ish and yeah it was I wasn't like lit up but I was like in a good space it was maybe one of the most incredible visual things visual concerts I've ever seen in my fucking life watch them you ever seen that they build the wall on stage as he's performing and they tear it down in the middle of it all damn it was fucking it was visually one of the most stunning concerts I've ever been a part of to watch them make it's not just a band playing it was them making visual art while he was telling this story through music and I was like this is why I'll pay hundreds of dollars to watch somebody not not just to hear fucking Tom Petty way allow would you know those tickets are the same amount of money but you don't get the show like with waters you get like this fucking visual experience mmm he's incredible man yeah he's a lot of crazy but of anti-trump shit at his concerts to write with big heads and she had a lot of government a lot of government shit yeah he gets in a lot of that bullshit but I mean it's it's visually stunning his think he's nuts yeah beautifully nuts right because he's so that's what I was thinking he's so good he's beautifully in Phase II yes but all these airplanes flying overhead and all those they float yeah they float big pigs over you that drop propaganda notes and shit it's dope is fuck dope it's dope it is dope it's fucking incredible hmm yeah but I mean that's I'm saying visually it's fucking just unbelievably beautiful man so is the Jamie you're a part of black Twitter is the black community abandoning Kayne and there are only white people accepting him now that's Jamie you're black I see a lot of the alt all white people excuse me all right all white Jamie part of white Jamie's part of the whole black white let's define it right now what's all white what would you call all white Alt alt white would be not all right yet they're not there yet alt white is all the batter's box it's all white what would you call all white who like give me an example of a person who's all white okay whiter here's one here's one um the fucking Dilbert guy Scott Adams he's all white who's that because he's not all right right he's a really brilliant guy but he's like sort of oh the comic leaders like yeah seems like he had I liked but it seems like he had these ideas about Trump and now he's always just trying to defend them with some sort of circular logic and here phrasing and yeah he's a super smart guy but he never says a single negative thing about Trump it's always well he's a brilliant negotiator and what he's doing is so strategy anyway Savannah Mike yeah is he is that what's going on or is he just like flying by the seat of his pants cause he's a fucking maniac and are you just trying to like sort of justify all the other shit that you've said about him that's really good that's what I do that's what it seems like to me but people don't like Scott Adams yeah a lot yeah like I just think he's a very nice guy he's all white all white he they dance on this line is like listen not offensive my house now they just have dinner with him he's more info guard he's he's more into those positions than he wants to probably admit but from a surface level he's like no you know like what positions are you style all right posit no no mission what's it all what how do you think all white people fuck they don't fuck they stand up in the shower they they they do this the whole time they fuck if you do that if you fuck with one hand up like Hitler if that hand is touching the glass in the shower then it's all white fucking this is all white fucking I think there's a lot of whites out there let's let's figure out who is all white which was white who's my best example of an alt white person that I know that's okay like one of them one of them hot broads it's always talking about white people issues is Tommy larren alt all white yeah she's all Dwight yeah white not all right but all white because you know what's so clever about that fucking chick that she did an interview with that Trevor Noah kid on what The Daily Show and then afterwards they hung out and the paparazzi I pictured them smiling and hugging and all shit you know on the streets does Hollywood his fake his fuck like she does this game but it's like she's not fucking racist she doesn't hate people of color she likes to chase the evocative provocative she likes to take conservative stances well that's what they say about Ann Coulter that if you talk to Ann Coulter she's actually a lovely person well look at it like this there's a map you can bring it up Jamie Jamie bring it up there's a map categorical porn percentages in the United States and the highest percentage of white and black porn is in the south is it like a Bible I just have a bit about it you did but I had to stop doing it because it was to drop the n-bomb a bunch times a bit go over as well they worked it War II didn't yeah either crushed or it was dangerous or after the show Joe had to sneak out fast know that there was a but there was it was like in the Bible Belt there is a chunk of the highest amount of black dudes fucking white like black and white porn is in the most conservative parts of the country well my take on it was it wasn't black guys they were watching this of course I know it's fucking white dudes out of that wish the rest angry yeah fucking I don't want some bitch don't you put her ass you put that big ol black beautiful thin skinned veiny black penis and my wife that chocolates fucking dark sicko snake he's sticking my wife that's all it is it's all this fucking the racial suppression that's those people that like you know that play the game that's all Dwight they're not salt well they're not all the way but they're there you go most searched-for terms the United States lesbian Texas is always Beach California we're all that's hilarious stepsister on a second stop look at this [Music] scan back in again so I could see the actual title of this the most searched-for terms in the united stand this is according to pornhub huh look it Montana and Colorado is that what is the up up on top is that Michigan what are those states know that duck a step-sister is Minnesota right that's that's Minnesota present what is the other two that that's North and South Dakota Alice's lesbian instead of Wyoming no no one's Wyoming guys that's Wyoming in Montana Wyoming is a square yes and that's the only one that's birth there's two states that are perfectly square how they pull that off kalla Colorado is perfectly square and so is Wyoming yeah that's amazing yeah New Mexico almost had it that's crazy like how jealous must like Massachusetts be with goofy a shave your fuck them fuck everybody Florida's built like a dick and they get a look at Colorado go Colorado is like a perfect square Florida's the dingleberry of the United States and sex is just chaos yeah Texas is just we are whatever the fuck we are it's a MOOC we're a boot so Louisiana is okay so so I like one state it's black yeah what states that evany what is it Louisiana black Alaska stepmom Georgia's black why this isn't the map that I was thinking of though there is another one where it was like that it said black on white porn how Ricci is this road I don't go don't go away go back go we doing like googling for yourself motherfucker stop well get milf where's milf one state like Rhode Island oh it is Rhode Island scroll back there keep it right there don't move oh that is Rhode Island look at milf stepsister his main mains got that stepsister shit yeah wait a minute wait a minute women New Hampshire's cartoon three cartoon states for well that's Arkansas and Tennessee are cartoon - those are two states there Tim just like one state but this also gives me a little bit of hope because Jo Jo you've you've come from Massachusetts was still lesbian and now you're still lesbian yeah I'm Chicago we were always lesbian I'm so I feel really good about my consistency of my pornography state catechizing how many are searching for lesbians more than anything and look at Alaska stepmom she's babysitting me one more day Hawaii well I though age Lily how about Eponine only one state doll three states now one tooth evany I like that term too evany happening why does it say evany want to say black that's funny people type in black huh and they type in Ewa the only type in black and once day because I don't know whatever he means down okay Joe this is proving what we're saying is well proven were saying you know who's searching for evany in Georgia and what is that and stop moving this go to min zoom in this is a fundamental difference so evany down there in Georgia and in what is that Mississippi right yeah the reason that those are evany and Louisiana's black is because evany is searched by black people black is searched by white people that's for sure 100% now you're right that's at exactly evany is a black person typing oh my as a bunch of white dudes being like give me a black poor chocolate big old chocolate what is that another evany up up top Jamie what is the other ebony on the right side what state is that Delaware I forgot Delaware is the state that's a mistake to you like that's a state how did we met how do we still they can't just get absorbed by another state what is surrounding Delaware what's next to Delaware Maryland that's right yeah so wait a minute they're evany huh that's so strange go back to the scroll go back to the sides that it was before we were at all milf is only one state that's weird if that is Rhode Island right yeah that little tiny ass bitch ass state a chest state how many Rhode Island's are in Texas look at that there's dudes who own a Rhode Island and in Texas they own multiple rotor hundred percent do you know there's like 8,000 ranches or something like that in Texas 8,000 yeah thousands of ranches that's a giant fucking branches maybe there might be more because I was watching us on a television show and I think it was an older television show number of ranches in Texas 248,000 Ranchers wrench is 248 thousand farms and ranches covering 130 230 million acres 248 thousand farms and rent I want look at the Tivoli the commodities it's all cows baby how do you define the different farming a wrench that's actually extremely interesting I don't got them to be the same thing there's no ranch or isn't a ranch or farm I guess I should go back up again please stop scrolling 248,000 farms and ranches covering a hundred and thirty point two million acres next is the biggest fucking Texas more women and minority farm operators in any other state in the nation you go Texas powerful Texas with a diversity I love that go down for his one second real quick just a little bit there's the thing that said America's biggest ranch goes on sale for 725 million Wow seven click on then what is that fucking place ten thousand acres of land 110,000 acre five hundred and ten thousand acres oh fuck me seventy five hundred pounds look at the size of that fucking place 510 thousand acre this is the kind of money that makes fun of jay-z you know like an America where like jay-z's rich or these fucking people are rich this is this is wealth this is that pure wealth the scroll back up to that building that's a look at that old-school stone building on the property spread you know there's uh I have a friend who was in at a ranch in Texas and they found petroglyphs in a cave what yeah petroglyphs like ancient Native American petroglyphs you have an unknown origin they don't know who did and I was like well don't they have historians come here and rope that off like then they got a lot of it here it's all over the place they don't even pay attention to it I what he's talking about they just don't they don't bother with a ancient petroglyph so they click on that upper left-hand corner the one you just had is that New Mexico yeah they have them all over it's all over yeah it's Arizona New Mexico Texas everywhere that the thing is no one's curating them no one's taken care of them they just exist on this ranch and the ranch was a was a hunting ranch that's he brought an awesome they took pictures of them where is that Jamie that's fucking amazing my friend Steve Rinella whose new show meat-eater is now only on Netflix it's a hunting show that's on netflix like an intelligent really well narrated hunting show that's that's that's done and produced by a brilliant guy man Steve Rinella but he was in Guyana which was where Jonestown was yeah he fucking killed all those people asked John yeah kool-aid yeah and they found these petroglyphs on a rock and they were like who made these like no one has any idea it's like right by this waterfall no one has any idea it's a fascinating series he's in Guyana living with his indigenous people and fishing rivers for like three days and just they just live and and it's three it's three episodes and they camp out by this river and use these like traditional methods of hunting that these people have used for thousands of thousands of years but now they're wearing like like Under Armour t-shirts and shit they're still barefoot it's so so weird it's like this weird my TOMS shoes but also don't wear any shoes no nothing no one wears shoes any what they get all the old shirts and all that so they hands from Salvation Army yeah yeah yeah yeah so they're wearing like this the these these things from Western civilization what and like Steve's got like he's got these modern Hoyt bow and their bow fishing in the river for these things called a PACU which is this brilliant red fish this beautiful red fish and the whole scene is like so crazy it's like a combination of Western civilization you know because they've got like some Western stuff mixed in with this culture that really hasn't changed that much and thousands and thousands of years but then they find these petroglyphs that are by this waterfall and they don't know any he's like he's like where do you think these came from he was like we don't know nobody knows they say like they call them like the ancients the ancients wrote it like they don't even know who the fuck's it so it could be thousands and thousands of years old that's fucking amazing well drew these weird faces by this waterfall and no one's curating it it just is what it is it's like really priceless history there's just sitting there so that also there where they hang out yeah just sitting there you know I mean that's kind of like that's kind of like when I was in Italy it's kind of like walking by these ancient structures and you're like that's just like a part of your fucking life that is also strange to me dude I was in we showed some photos the other day was in Ravello and there was a church Oh weird yeah you were there right after me yes right yeah there's a church that was a thousand years old yep that was on top of a church that was far older they don't even know how old that church was yeah there's a glass floor where you could look under the church and see the the ancient church that's below it oh I went to this fucking yes yes you can look below yes yes yes dude this is also we went to the catacombs did you go to any of the catacombs no this shit is fucking a catacombs in Italy - yeah man I would like some ants where they have the skulls and all the shit yeah I'm gonna show you the same kind of thing I show you right now this is fucking crazy so we went and also online by the way when I looked up like how to get to them a lot of the online posts were like this is oh this isn't necessarily safe what the yeah man what wait a minute said this isn't safe well they were just saying like it yeah it's fucked what is this but what describe what we're seeing here are they standing up yeah yes they have these skulls or what they didn't close what they do is they they reconfigure the bones of the of what they think the human was you know what they look like and they put them in cloth and stuff and stain them against love oh go go full screen with that let me see that is what episodes are fun look at that one with a flesh on them what's happening there the one where your cursor is Jamie is that hair on his head guys dead as fuck - got more hair than me see they found a Buddha statue with a mummy in it no oh that's right yeah they found this statue and they did an x-ray of it and found that there was actual skeleton underneath the statue look at this the actual statue was a mummy so this is in Naples that's in fucking Naples wow those are all skulls and bones isn't that fucked what other citizens you heard Florence is amazing Florence is incredible Bologna is cool too I like I think southern southern Italy is my favorite but this is this is you see this shit Jamie southern Italy like Sicily well I mean Sicily is my fucking favorite that's my absolute that's what families consider that in now their own place but I mean something I mean southern Italy like places like Naples and stuff like that like I look down on you because you have red hair when you go to Sicily they spit on me right away no you know what you know was annoying is Santino be my last name Santino because my family's from Sicily and they immediately hear it they go Santino so they don't and they think I'm gonna speak Italian and then when I don't they're like annoyed good man yeah they're like well no no I went to somewhere better where America English we made it out English I made it out deep that's why I came back here and gave you money money we also went to fucked a dude that hung himself for sure that's a little kid a little dude go to that uh this is all in Rome I mean this is a catacombs in there all over that's in Sicily oh look at the face of this guy cell phones like what do you want what do you want me to do for me we also went to serve oka you know what's Avoca is know where they shot the Godfather look at this this is fucking incredible dude we went to this town where they shot the Godfather and so it must be just a bunch of assholes from New Jersey wandered around Don Corleone here now where do I get some gob of goo Margo come get a picture of me in front of this fucking thing come on hurry up you fat bitch fucking motherland with it so what was this deal with this story of the Mafia to Buddha it's too long ago for us to talk about pull it up like a new yeah but I but it's a thing what do they know why they did that so what did they do they did put like plaster over it and create a well if I'm gonna have any more of this 46th show but it really is nice to at this early in the morning to have a little more it's a little more ice in that thing over there one more glass just one more might as well one more glass that taught me just over October man I can't I'm I'm a guy I'm excited for the science of the curious so look they did an x-ray on this Buddha and they found out there's an actual skeleton inside holy shit how weird how amazing it's not surprising that the southeast that Southeast Asia is home to countless ancient Buddha statues but one of those statues contains a mummified monk that is certainly surprised mummified monk is exactly researchers the Netherlands meander Medical Center found they placed a 1,000 year old Chinese Buddha statue inside of a CT scanner Wow it contains the body of a Buddhist master named Liu q li Quan and Lia Quan Quan Quan Quan who may have practiced the tradition of self-mummification to reach his final resting place music like fuck that I'm wrapping myself out yeah this motherfucker just went hog whole hog that's a really funny photo strange but going in the machine so how do you think they turned him into that statue like what did they wouldn't they put over his a lot and so he probably wrapped himself right and then look it says the organs had been removed and replaced with paper scraps for they were print it was ancient Chinese characters whoa that's like a horror movie yeah tune in Stephen King okay if you wore a monk that wanted to achieve enlightenment and be revered as a living Buddha self-mummification was your brutal option howl monks and the spiritual path would starve themselves for almost a decade subsisting on water seeds and nuts then they'd be sealed inside the statue and ingest roots pine bark in a toxic tree sap based tea for another 1,000 days eating and breathing through a small tube eventually death would come and the monks mummified this Manor were said to have reached enlightenment what what the fuck all right check it out we're gonna put you in this fucking thing you have to breathe through a tube dude you can only you could only drink this toxic tea that's gonna slowly kill you you want to be a god you want to see God dude do you want to fucking see God for three years you need nothing but seeds and we're gonna wrap you and you're gonna breathe through a fucking tube it's gonna be ultimate panic they starve themselves for almost a decade where would they piss and shit while they're in your glue they would stay in the statute and they would fill up slowly with shit and went and that's when they died that's it that would took a thousand days to gargle on shit until you thought it smell shit up to your nostrils you'd have shit right up to the lip of your nose this is an example of self-mummification fact that his organs are removed and replaced paper suggests that may not be true all right so that all this oh this could be bullshit what it's gonna be some dude uses assholes this is an asshole article toxic tea the toxic tea thing I think is fascinating that's just another mind-control way of them slowly killing out people toxic tea but someone must have probably done that because like no matter what you do there's always someone who's willing to go further yeah you know they do those ultra marathons right where they run like 200 miles yeah they're trying to avoid campaigns nine million miles a day yes resident marathon it is he's a machine crazy fuck so what they're you know he was gonna do while we were doing all this so October fitness challenge he was gonna try to get more fitness points than all of us combined probably probably probably not that hard yeah he could do it easy but what they're gonna do now is a 500 mile race 500 fucking mind 500 miles he runs fast though it's all about time though he wouldn't have to run for six hours a day he had to when you sure know this is enough they're running eyes 24/7 no he sanctum oh but he runs three hours a day all the time if he's running marathons he's not running more than three our marathons enough to know do you want three hours a day you know how many my you know how many how fast he runs eight or nine miles an hour do you know what it is I tell you what I wonder if it's a term I ran his first 100 or no when he ran his first 200 - Bigfoot 200 the last couple hours he was running a seven-minute mile do you know one saying that is do you know insane it is that ten minute is that time at 10 miles an hour it's like 9 and some change but just to just understand how insane it is he's been running for two straight days come on - run more than a hundred and seventy miles and then the last two plus hours I think maybe even more he probably like what was actually five hours yeah you know he's dodged about he's running seven minute miles that's fucking insane that's banana yeah no that's insane that's a run I run five miles a day and that's if I in my minor like almost eight-minute mile seven-minute miles a good clip that's something that would that's great you kidding me especially when you anyone that runs over anyone that's just a casual runner that runs over two or three miles their goal usually is eight to nine minute miles to keep good pace seven-minute miles after you've already run hundreds of miles say but that was the point it's like there's always someone who's willing to take pushes to another place yeah and that's the thing with these Buddhist assholes they always wanted to push one guys like oh oh you're just gonna live off live off seeds for a decade I'm gonna do toxic tea I'm gonna live off seeds for a decade then I'm gonna seal myself in a fucking statue damn I drink poison bullshit why because I want to be enlightened I want to get to the tip-top buddy enlightened men wanna understand suffering at the deep like that our Buddhists are like these Italian gangsters deepest level possible the way you choke on your own shoe wanna choke on my own poop on my own self rep sarcophagus seed eatin to breathe in fucking mummy statue well one of the most iconic images from the Vietnam War was the self-immolation guy oh shit yeah you ever see the video yeah man that is it's that pull up the video of the guy the the Buddhist monk lighting himself on fire just sad well the the most fucked-up thing about it is the guy didn't even move now yes that's - he's in the lotus position yeah and he's completely engulfed in flames and he's just staying self-immolation that's a weird bird right emulate to immolate so they pour the gasoline the gasoline on them 1963 so this was really the start of the war so the war went on for more than a decade afterwards right yeah he was really early he's like you know what enough I'm gonna put an end to this imagine if they said to him beforehand yo dude it's not always it's not gonna work but the war is gonna go on for another ten years yeah it's a bad idea stick around and if you play your cards right you keep winding up inside a statue this is like world stocking for little worlds done Jesus fuck this is so crazy because the guy's just sitting I mean covered in flames not moving a muscle it's just such a bizarre scene look at him here yeah and at this point he realizes oh shit I'm dead he just falls over what a crazy way to die I so fucking this and all the other dudes just sitting around going yeah they're all thinking about lunch what do we have for lunch rice hungry eating rice bitch I think that's crazy what if them the match didn't work the future first few times you know he was like let's think about this fuck man I mean that whole thing is just so that's just what is that what was that picture at the fuckin end what is that what does it say ten superpowers and the monks I'm real life well there are some monks that can do some pretty cool let except because they don't get any pussy and they just eat nuts and do push-ups push-ups nuts seeds but that was like a thing where like people would go to train with the monks to learn kung foo do they really have depravity of like releasing they can't come monks can't come it's a good question I wonder I wonder if they come in their parents accidentally to get mad well you have to write you know that shit biologically it's a detriment if you're if you don't ejaculate at some point your life your you will just naturally leak this is what your teacher told you that's a fact look that up that's a fucking fact you will leak Jamie tell him tell about your the tantrum Jamie that's all the time tell us about your nut King he's another Jamie are you a nut King yeah how much do you know them a week if you had a guess how many times oh how many times is a measurement I was like how many tablespoons and is it salty for four or five nuts a week four or five nights a week seems normal first maybe heaven in days a week maybe a little bit more maybe yeah yes it really Randy sometimes is seven nuts if lifting weights maybe at seven right if I'm you know what's so funny I get way more horny after running running running gets me horny as shit when I'm done because my body's kind of exhausted so usually I lift I lift a little bit and then I run or vice versa or I'll run in and I'll lift to finish but the running just like I think it exhausts my body and then I just want to bang I just yeah you might I think my testosterone is just like I got off I want to walk it off that's not don't the monks do like the tantric stuff where they can like do it without touching anyone like sting sting does that shit where he doesn't cut you know he ages and he doesn't come for like nine days it's called being a pervert it's not fucking weirdo it's like people are doing that they're thinking about sex way more than the average person yeah just fuck I'm just gonna hold it in I'm gonna have internal orgasms I wanna have an external back in your system I hope that's the face I hope you go cross-eyed when you come always hope it's like and I go fish mouth a girl is perfect in every way but when she comes she would go oh this is great I can't I had a girl that I dated I won't say I won't mention you but you sure as eight years of years ago I dated a girl in college and she was so beautiful but when she would come it was so annoying like it was like a it was like it was so exaggerated that I remember catching myself in the mirror one time giving myself this face I as she was yelling I was going but I was also like my dick isn't fucking that like don't let's not play the game like so it's so it's not so big just come on do the regular fucking don't give me this fake do you think she was faking it or did I think she was hyperbolae zing her orgasms I think she's doing that to please you yes I think she thought it was pleasing me was doing the opposite was making me go oh my god just regular calm fuckin serious punching you I just start I just start crying and she's coming I'm crying yeah yeah just hold your so it was exaggerated I think that's what porno does porno tricks people at point cuz porn girls like yeah it's like nanana that's in fucking insane yeah do you ever hear point and then they do that and you just want to shut it off yeah I will turn off the volume I'm like this is absurd yeah but then you're gonna look at her face and know she's making stupid noise yeah cuz it's gonna be distracting it's already in there you're like I can't disassociate this always impresses me in porno is when like a girl is taken like a fucking 12-inch dick like some pussy and they're not being loud like I'm always like this girl's a fucking thug what a soldier that she's getting fucked and she's just like hmm like it's no big deal yeah me think like just looking at it you're like this there's no way that's not painful that's a good point about porn though right it's like people imitate like people imitate behavior in films like we're talking about all the the Guido's and imitate Godfather movies and Sopranos that they imitate it they see it they want to act like it it's exaggerated emulate a lifestyle yeah yeah that's the same with porn with sex there's got to be a lot of people that are emulating the sounds and the noises and the postures and all that like when you think people started regular coming in people's faces what what year yeah what year who was the first pioneer in porno that did like a first come shot like in the 30s you think people noted in people's faces out there no they didn't never pull their dicks out they didn't know they didn't know you could pull out in the 30s that was the name inside people he just came inside everybody everybody had a baby well yeah I mean you think about a timeline-wise like fucking pregnancy yet look at the baby boomer generation not one person pulled out my mom's one of ten kids whoa yeah man nobody born in the 50s was a ever pulled out you I mean like everyone that's just what you did hmm and then disease and then we and then disease in the 70s and 80s spawned this idea condoms and protection and then people started learning maybe we'll just not come inside the people well they say that one of the biggest changes in culture it was female birth control because finally holy men had control of their own reproductive side right but what comes with that is that they have to take hormones to achieve that it'd be fucking up their chemical insects dude have you ever heard like what actually happens to them and it doesn't just fuck up their chemical insides it fuck up their hormonal cycle right but it also fucks up their ability to discern whether someone's compatible with them seriously yeah it fucks up the science of their there's there's a thing that women get like there's a like Chris Ryan was explaining this to me there's actual smell like women can smell like when they're not on birth control like if they get guys close and like they'll smell guys close they can literally they're attracted to certain smells and the men that that smell this way would be more genetically compatible with them so the the pheromones literally is the pheromone there's a pheromone blocker with birth control then that's kind of confuses their system wholly also women who are on birth control are much more attractive attracted apparently to alpha male type characters and aggressive men really yeah yeah there's something about birth control that makes them it they're not sure why it heightens their attractiveness towards alpha males yeah they're more attracted to alpha males well that's not really a negative thing I guess well but they're more attracted to certain types of people and you got to think like what is that it's like right I'm not a sociologist or a biologist I really wouldn't know what the fuck would be the cause of that but I would think that it would have something to do with their body wanting something different than the baby that they think is inside them right because they're supposed to be pregnant yes is the whole reason why you can't get pregnant when you're on birth control is tritiated Yeah right so you're walking around constantly in the state of pregnancy so like why would you be more attracted to alpha males or aggressive men gods look at my brain it's like hunting for a Y that would even make sense the only thing that would make sense is you want something even more aggressive more dominant or more better more pretending what you've gotten yeah maybe more protective maybe you think maybe it's too and maybe it's just like superb nature like all those nature characteristics is like I'm pregnant I need ultimate protection I need ultimate aggression ultimate strength and like these are just all natural by the way all the fucking Equality websites would probably light me up for that you know go crazy well I was reading this biologists account of what's uh there's a term called hypergamy that it's a natural state for women to be attracted and to seek out men with higher social status higher financial status programming yeah and and better physical specimens that's this natural state where they're always looking for something bigger and better right it's just a genetic state and it's not it's no one's fault I mean and women obviously don't have to give in to this but it's a natural inclination that they had like if the rock is there all right here's a perfect example right he's rich and he's handsome huge friendly as a giant man and he's probably got a huge hog yeah and you're a woman is naturally attracted to go towards him so am i me yeah you got a great bit about them but this this state is it's called hypergamy yeah and that what I was reading about was this woman who had this awful betrayal of this man and she was the the biologist was relating it to this state of hypergamy they were doing a very scientific sort of technical way instead of like saying look at the slut they were saying this is a natural state totally women gravitate towards certain types of males you know and that this is but this is not discussed very often right no no be good well especially guys now while we're bending all these rules and names and terms and all this bullshit it's like that no people I think we there's such an escapism from like the true nature of men and women people don't want to talk about anymore like it doesn't exist there's a denial of biology it's so crazy well it's almost like this whole fucking Cavanaugh thing and all this shit and I don't want to even get into all that fucking it's a diatribe and nonsense but the one thing I will say that I don't think what he talks about is the sexual and social psychology of men and women nobody wants to talk about when you are developing as a young teen especially a boy and you're learning about sexuality and you're confused and embarrassed and scared and the way that men and women interact in that year from in those years from like 12 to like 16 it's insanely unstable because women are not as not as hormonal e aggressive technically at that time that men are right so these men are fucking hormonal freaks and they want to do things with these women but they're not supposed to kind of and it's like kind of okay and they don't know how to do it and they're these weird blurred lines of women want to be accepted and cool and they're come in their circles so you know it's like when someone hooks up with someone early on when poop two people hook up young and it's like oh and it's sketchy and weird sometimes the girl gets labeled a slut you know what I mean for no reason it's like oh she's a slut like I remember there was a girl my when we were what juniors and she was dating a senior and they had had sex yeah right and it was like she's a slut like she's not a slut everybody wants to do this thing but they're these weird subset rules but every guy that does it that's just what we want to do but I don't we there's no explanation over like how we got to the point of getting comfortable there because men are just these horny freaks that don't know what to do with the thing so there are so many blurred lines of sexuality and relationships at that age nobody wants to talk about it well it's also the Puritan culture and religion all right there's two things that set women up in this terrible place where they give into their hormonal oranges they're somehow tainted right you know when I was in high school everybody knew this and I'm sure you knew this too everybody knew Catholic school girls were the biggest fucking freak first time I had anal Catholic school because they're they're suppressed yes there you're making diamonds okay you taking that question you're putting it under a mountain yeah I mean it's Catholic schoolgirls right and it's all over the country where'd you grow up Chicago Chicago Jamie Columbus Catholic schoolgirls yeah be nice be nice like what they were underneath their jumpers sometimes they had shorts on sometimes they did yeah what little it was a there was a marked difference suppression right between Catholic school girls and regular girls yep yeah well I mean I'm the public school girls around me what is it a whole different thing so most of them are private school girls I was not the biggest freak that I dated during my high school years was a girl it was a wonderful girl but she went to an all-girl Catholics course she was suppressed complete up yeah yeah so when you hold someone in the cage like that what do you think is gonna happen it's like of course when they get out girl was nuts man she was wild but that's but that's so that's what I'm saying no one wants to talk about and again I'm not trying to dive in the Cavanagh bullshit but people are young and they do fucking crazy shit when you are hormonal e at your beginnings and you're confused and weird I mean guys know when guys start masturbating it's this disgusting weird secret creepy gross sad like undercover secret yeah you don't tell your friends oh you're so panning off so and all of that is swirling inside your head over sexuality and then when you do get the chance with a girl it's uncomfortable it's awkward it's weird again not talking about whatever fucking he did I'm just saying you're already in this weird state of men are fucked up when they're sexually reaching this new peak of their life that they just want to like jerk off and come and fucking and how much information are they getting from their parents zero almost none most almost none that's the thing how much guidance oh you don't know you don't know rules you don't understand and also our society perpetuates if you want to be real fucking honest our society perpetuates this weird Poland push of like you know no I don't want you know that fucking song baby it's cold outside you know that song the Christmas song a baby just stay for it and really should go it's cold outside it's a Christmas fuckin song you know what it is Jamie knows about yeah you do it's a Christmas song and it's it's called baby it's cold outside but Christmas song about rape this 1% it is I'm dead serious here he's playing it didn't you play it on YouTube but I really can't stay isn't old she's saying I got to go home my parents the whole time he's like come on just have one more drink just cuz stay out a little ah he's trying to fucking louver up yes and by the way she ends up staying at the end because she wants to be with him the game right so the thing that nobody wants to fucking talk about at all and I'm not again I'm not fucking saying anything other than this is a perpetuation of our culture for a long time of like this pulling taken teased a tease is a game that women play and men play to of like you know look at that I really can't say it's cold outside got to go away this evening has been so very nice my mother will start to worry my father will be pacing the floor I'd rather a really better scurry maybe just a half a drink more that's her finally admitting the neighbors might think what you know what's say what's in this drink ah you're very pushy you know I like to think of it as opportunistic I simply must go the answer is no the welcome has been so nice and warm my sister will be suspicious my brother will be there at the door my maiden's maid is vicious well maybe just a cigarette more so no so she's like no no no no no yeah none of them yeah Oh God okay fine another drink then that took a lot of convincing okay that's the last word that took a lot of convincing yes so what I'm saying it was that shit oh my god just got to be the 1940 s 40s maybe people just right before 50s 52 52 now but he was in the original my point is this shit has been going on forever and it's fucking real and nobody wants nothing to do with the Cavanaugh thing right and here's the thing about the Cavanaugh thing you know what I mean by oh no but here's the thing but even the fact that you have to be defensive right there yeah what I'm saying right I'm not supporting rape even discuss it early all people were ready to fucking hit you in the head well of course there's no conversation to be there's a woman who had a brutal take on it a brutal there's two ways we can look at this there's a woman who had a really brutal take on this Lea that was on Jordan Peterson's Twitter page if you go to Jordan Peterson's Twitter page there's a woman who is I don't know what she does but she talks about how this woman who is accusing Brett Kavanaugh goes to this predominantly or she teaches at this predominantly women's college where 79 percent of the students are women yeah the majority the vast majority of the professor's are women and social justice is the number one thing that they promoted the school right ahead of Education and that everything when you look at the schools like lists of like what it aims to accomplish and how to educate the students like promoting social justice is one of the primary things it's the the first one yeah above everything else and in the idea is that why would this woman risk everything and what this woman's take is who's criticizing this is that she's not risking anything she's rewarded from this understand her culture this is a big deal and she's very cynical about this she's like this woman has no recollection doesn't remember how she got home doesn't remember where the party was but does remember that someone may have tried to do something to her you know I'm not a big fan of criticizing people who come out and say someone did something to them or try to do something that because you don't know you don't know you're on the outside looking in and you're trying to pick holes in their story I don't even know if they know because I don't I don't here it is yeah you click on the video you can hear some of what this woman says like click on it and play something what this one says we don't have to sound sounds like okay but the point is that like there's only two people that know what really happen and they don't even know really happen well you're talking about something happened 35 fucking years ago I mean if he if she said 35 years ago this guy raped me okay that's a different story oh yeah well yeah this is not what she's saying right what is she saying my from what I understood and by the way this is something I distance myself from because I was just it was so overwhelming that I was like oh god that he held her down while the other dude was in the and he kind of helped him he'll hold her down and he had his penis on her or he is that what he's saying wigs out let's find this because people got super mad and we talked about this the other day like you should have done research for you discussed a predator like but see that's what's important first of all I'm not supporting him anyway standing there no no either none of us but that's the thing is like when you talk about it someone goes your what do you say what are you in favor of exactly fuck you I just you have to have a conversation about what's going on otherwise I'm just numb this is a giant platform and then if we're discussing in this giant platform we should be informed I disagree with that because I think that we're just having a conversation yeah we're just about something you just happen to be privy to this conversation because millions I'm not pretending I'm some sort of an expert or that I have some sort of information that you don't like that if you have those misconceptions let me clear those up right now I'm a fucking moron talking to another moron yeah next to another boy honey this room they're all dudes talking okay I don't know jack-shit nah you know I know what I I know I know my feeling of the whole thing I know the feeling of the whole thing is that no matter what anybody it's kind of like what got in trouble for norm you know when Norma McDonald got in trouble no matter what I think people are suffering in a bad bad way okay here what it says here it was surely the most explosive and surreal confirmation hearing since Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill in 1991 nominee for the Supreme Court was asked if he was a gang rapist and a blackout drunk while defending himself by describing how long he preserved his virginity his accuser described him grinding in three mouths covering her mouth and fearing that he was accidentally going to kill me okay well that's pretty fucking serious so if he was if he was covering her mouth because she was protesting and he was grinding in there around some pretty dark shit fuck yeah so that a little bit yeah keep scrolling down please miss Hill 27 years ago dr. Blasi a psychology professor in California was treated gingerly and they can power consumed okay this is BA blah blah but but but that okay so that was their baby she became a very human being telling a terrible story about Judge Cavanaugh in compelling terms that brought many women to tears and transformed the battle for the Supreme Court okay well see that's all I needed to hear see that that the kind of person now look I don't know if he did this but if he did do this the kind of person that covers a woman's mouth yeah that's crazy shit that's an extra level of darkness yeah you're it's not like trying to kiss her trying to ray Ron and against each other covering someone's mouth right that's rape if he really did that yeah that's I'm saying if it's all true that's what that is that's him trying to hold her back from something so Donald Trump said this you know this famous quote that it's a tough time for boys you know so a girl made a song i've that i heard that song song is actually very great song it's a good song and i'm gonna tweet it but I'm like when I was about to tweet and my people are gonna get so fucking mad at me her name is on Twitter it's Mercedes ly NZ she has a beautiful voice and the song is it's a scary time for do scary time for noobs yeah I listen to it a few times it's really good maybe we could play a little bit of it mmm can we play a little bit of her we get kicked off of Jamie's just shaking his fucking head it would get tagged because she's probably got a billion views so anyway her Twitter page listen you know and this is the thing men in particular you're gonna hear this you go oh you fucking support nurse anti-men fucking male bashing shit give me just give me a little volume [Music] I can't go it's look it's she's just going on about how difficult it is to be a girl and when you're not a girl it's not something you consider and so all these guys decide it's a lot of good truth like she's like I can't live on the first floor I can't just leave my window open at night like all these things are fucking very very true it's a good song and she's got a great voice yeah listen this is this is the whole thing that I think we're talking about you're allowed to see to see truth on all sides of all of these issues I don't think you ever have to be so staunch about anything I disagree with people that are so staunch about just being like this is the end of the discussion you're only this way or not it's like no man I don't know all the stories I don't know all the truths of of that Cavanagh bullshit I don't know all the truths of anything that woman coming forward I tend to believe a woman that's gonna go out of her way I don't think she's looking for fame I don't think any of the girls that came out for Louis were looking for fame and attention no one wants attention to have their name googled and come up with this for the rest of their life so I wouldn't say that see I don't say no one I'd I think most people don't want that kind of okay okay you don't you know what you know okay you know who does want that kind of attention does psycho-pass with the Donald Trump but what's her name the fucking floor okay yeah I think she all she wanted was attention I'm sorry I'm like wow she thought the guy consensually and all she did was make fun of his penis like she wants money yeah no she's making money from it and she's like in her 40s she's still stripping it's fucking sad it's it's not dr. Ford and these other one yeah they're not doing it for the fucking 1/10 they don't she doesn't want she's doing that cuz there is a truth in there of what happened and I believe that I don't know what it is but I believe there something fucked up that went down and unfortunately we are in the middle of this what what can be done who knows how do we there's no physical evidence or rape or there's gray area like what am I supposed to do this office is this deep understanding of the flaws of the human memory both his and her totally when you're dealing with 35 years ago if you tried to ask me you know what happened to win you and this girl making out in the backseat of a car 35 years ago good luck iiiii don't know if there's a few moments I remember to remember like very few sexual encounters from high school but I remember with my girlfriend but I know that was consensual yes they're all my girlfriend gave me a blowjob on the porch and I came so hard my ears rang and it's never happened since never haven't since I was 16 years old I nodded so hard it was like the best literally my you remember blow job you've ever had I wasn't beating off back then I was I actually had sex before I jerked off shut the fuck up yeah really yeah I did and it's not like I had sex really young either how old were you when you when you first fucked I think I was 16 how old were you Jamie nine fuck machine [Laughter] school just lifting up skirts just send it at home dick over in st. Peter's hey no seriously how old were you do you know yes sixteen that's right that's average ages man with balls that's the real nut poor bastard there's a bunch of those guys to get elephantitis of

in envelopes I mean I the first time I had sex without proof without like raw without a condom was was my brain was like all right there's a strategy to this you got to be able to last that out the window the moment it was a psych yes every time I ever orgasm was a girl jerking me off yeah well I guess mine was jeans rubbin mine was a dry humping Jamie you did a bunch of that shit you dry hump yeah I'm not from dry up and I probably had like a little bit in my underwear you know I used to have a bit about that like like you ever take your underwear off and there's a stream of sperm that somehow are there from the tip your dick to your underwear like what the fuck is this I go that's those Green Beret sperm that live around the tip of your dick with a knife in their mouth don't give a fuck about your plans for the future those the ones that get people pregnant yes they're just ready to go fuck this is pussy let's go they're overzealous jealous they hit that underwear cuz sometimes you find pre cum in your underwear you like what is this oh yeah what's happening here pre cum as the strongest come that is that that is the most potent yeah that's not savages the hoards barbarian hordes fucking swords shit pre cum is like the good what is it the Green Berets or whatever the fuck yeah it's because my regular cum is like the Navy Reserves yeah like Coast Guard they might come

good you know I mean I had this conversation a long time ago with Anthony Bourdain he was on statins and he decided to take statins because he liked to eat I don't know what it is statins are for people that have it's was that high blood pressure or high cholesterol what if statins for he had obviously he was drinking constantly and he was traveling constantly and he wasn't exercising cholesterol yeah he had some health issues yeah and so they put him on these statins and he started doing Brazilian Jujitsu and we started doing Brazilian Jujitsu he lost a shitload of weight changed his diet radically cut back on his drinking and got off the statins and race but statins have like significant health risks attached to them it's not as simple as they just lower your cholesterol they

Gracie saw a piece on it somewhere one of the best gyms in the world wait I know I'm jumping backwards but you mentioned something that now clicked into my head when the meat eaters show that your friend does yeah Steven illest when he I think there was a show I think there was a clip I just saw online of him using rendering bear fat to cook bear yes I just had watched that I thought that was fucking amazing cuz he was like I mean I've never I'd never heard of that before that you can you can boil down the bear fat to use as oil to cook the rest of the meat yeah because he's saying it was so rich that it was almost like you could fry meat in it he did fry me - yeah I'm sure fucking well I people have you been using bear fat for ages for lard to cook pies and right he was actually talking about on a podcast recently that he has a great podcast as well called meat eater same name and on the podcast they were discussing how fat was used that's him there rendering this bear fat this is a particularly interesting episode because this was all about bears who eat blueberries so all that fat had a purple tone to it purple hue to it because the Bears had been can they had been subsisting on blueberries so they tasted like blueberries how blueberry fat was it's supposed to be fucking incredible and you render it down and make lard out of it and that lard is good literally for years and use it for cooking and for all kinds of things afterwards but bear lard like I have my good friends John and Jen Rivet who live in Alberta and they run a bear hunting operation up there and they bear all the time and they render bear fat into these like jars of bear lard I want to have some you cook it's fucking delicious goal I'm in Canada next week tell them to come see me and

motherfuckers to zero we got it what we really have to do though for real is when it's up like the party you have that's not like a fucking huge party a party you throw a party fuckin when sober October is over we're here what's here why for us Oh party dogs kill these following things I would like to enjoy your party I like the thick crust pizza yeah deep-dish Chicago style dude go get me Polish sausage over there from from from up from Marcos someone who sausage Chicago was really fun because you could tell like you were in your Ellen I feel like we're taking deep breaths I got those wonderful fucking Chicago to a bar we got steaks like yes the best part we walk out of a stay a good steakhouse in this guy of Chicago Blackhawk who I'm a huge fan of comes up to Joe and he's like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan and he couldn't believe you were there and you're like what's up man he's like what's up man I'm a Chicago Black Hawk you're like all right he was like cool you're like hey man you turn to mean you who was that guy I was like that's a fuckin Chicago Black Hawk and I was like oh yeah Joe doesn't give a fuck about snow yeah no I'm saying you didn't know him it was nice the guys know you're super nice but I was like that's so funny to think that like those guys that how he treated you was how people treat him do you know what I mean it was wild to watch how people treat athletes when they're like probably my favorite this guy was like he became a kid again he was a oh my god Joe Rogan's in this restaurant that I fucking love to go to it was it was cool to be on the outside of that to watch that happen especially cuz I'm such a Chicago black off and like I'm such a sports fan so it was just so weird to watch an athlete kind of act like people acted them you know what I mean it was fuckin it was just beautiful one of the weirdest things that's come out of this podcast is and again this is not just for men the podcast is for whoever the fuck likes it but men don't get a whole lot of examples of men that are allowed to just be themselves yeah be guys yeah just because everybody's worried about getting fired from something yep everybody's worried about saying the wrong thing or like when I said that I'd like that song that girls sang I really like it yeah it's a good song that's and I think she's got really good points I'm not saying it so that someone likes me more I'm not I mean and I'm saying like maybe as men especially me as a guy with three daughters you should I should consider and we should all consider what it's like to be a girl you know now I've talked to girls have been drugged I've talked to girls who've had guys creep on them and do creepy shit to them and girls that have been sexually assaulted I like that I like that song I like it nothing I like sexual assault I man I like that song it's gonna get edited out of context for sure I like I like this woman expressing herself and an artistic way that represents the real threat that women face and it's also a catchy song she's got a beautiful voice and I'm still a man yeah you're still okay these things are allowed to exist you don't you don't somehow no there becomes some sort of a cock or a pussy or it doesn't mean that you're you're a loser or that you're you we all know when someone's faking something when they're giving in total to pressure and pretending like actress use the word wonderful to describe a woman's performance what we were talking about we know fake shit we know fake shit yeah it was very good too much goddamn fake shit in this world so one of the more interesting things that's come out of this podcast is because I don't have a person telling me what to do and I can just be myself right people like guys go oh this is like hanging out this is like what it would be right if we were just like right now but people are listening right but normal things you don't get to just hang out because when people are listening then you got to tone the language and say you can't say things don't say careful don't say be careful that word you know why because there's so much misconstrued nonsense people because people are allowed to take any opinion that you have you because they don't know your full opinion they know a piece of what you think hair and they just rip that out and throw that in the fucking space it's recreational outrage yes they're finding a nice little juicy target like oh let's go after it and it'll be whatever the fuck it is when whoever's next whether it's Chris Hardwick or whoever gets called out for something and someone whether they're guilty or not who gives a shit let's pile onto that motherfucker right and ruin their life for a couple of weeks and this is what's going on this world it's it's it's not good for anybody so no for men's not good for women there's only one good piece of it at all if you're a piece of shit like Harvey Weinstein if you're a fucking turd and you rape women yes then you're gonna get got and it's good that you got guy but even him man have you seen the new article I mean there's a lot of article where the woman who is accusing him of sexual assault the the DA is talking about throwing it out of court now because they found a computer log the girl who was accusing Harvey Weinstein one of them of actual sexual assault I will send it to you Jamie so you can pull it up Jim it was on the New York Post page six it was on page six yesterday judge dismisses one is that today okay so this is they decided to dismiss it because this woman had a she they got a hold of her computer because of her former employer or a former employee who said look this is not how this girl described this oh I watched I watched the video records a video of them having a conversation right I don't think so this is a different one this is a girl who gave Harvey Weinstein a blowjob and she said look I'm gonna send you the actual thing that I got here Jamie and her former employee was like this is not what she said this is not what she said to me right and they were they were saying that it was in danger of being thrown out and now it is thrown out so she lied about what it was so the judge was like fuck this shit yeah well done they essentially said that this is just she look there are actual sexual assault victims sure and then there are people there's also people I think that are crazy but you don't have a real accurate memory of things that have happened and so they can paint themselves as a victim and be deceptive about it involuntarily I think that's entirely possible sure I think there's a certain amount of people that are just delusional and they just don't see things accurately did you get that text that I sent you but but you but I also still know that Harvey Weinstein is a is a fucking sexual assault there's just too many women that are saying that he forced himself on them and did things you heard that Nadia love him with that girl you heard that audio I heard of it I didn't some of the transcript but there was also that so make this bigger so my stupid old arse can see it you say old eyes I can I need a bigger two she accused Weinstein of forcing her to perform oral sex a prior employee of Evans turned over personal writings she'd left in the company's computer which appealed to contradict the grand jury testimony the writings indicate it was consensual friendly a source told the post it has caused a split in the Manhattan Manhattan district attorney's office some believe the charges should be dropped and there's a problem with this complaint and then it was just it was dropped yeah there you go listen it's the hole it's hot it's hard man because like you don't want to say all these girls were all lying because they're not of course but one of them could be lying sure yeah when one of them's lying they've got to do what they did and throw that case out but then he's gonna say look it's all fabricated well there's people that will be opportunists in the face of a scandal so there's a scandal where someone has actually legitimately done awful things and someone is gonna stand up and say he did awful things to me when really they just fucked the guy because they want to advance their rear you're right I would I would I would always argue the majority of people that get involved in this thing probably aren't full of shit there is always those BOTS going to be people that want to capitalize there's a there's a real that's just human nature people do that all the time in every asset in that was these people that lied about September 11th where they were these people environment ly lie about every yeah but I think there's miss power oh not in that Laur the other Brian Williams Brian Williams sorry yeah well it was just Hillary Clinton lied about it - come on BRR yeah she lied about uh bullets were flying by er and people like no no no no there's no bullets nope we didn't have you anywhere near but remember that wasn't that there's something about Hillary Clinton lied about being in the middle of a gunfire situation looking people they exaggerate they make things up and some people are just full of shit and then there's people that are delusional and they have a problem with reality right and they might legitimately believe that something awful happened to them there there are people that do things like that like it's it's not all deceptive there's people that have legitimate mental issues and they have paranoid schizophrenia to whatever extent you know whether it's mild or but they they have a delusional perception of the world around them they think people are out to get them totally theirs and then those people get caught up there's also there's also selective memory right there's also manipulation of selective memory there's there's there's a lot of study about people that have convinced themselves that something happened that really didn't happen right that's a real thing they really believe and they're not lying because in their brain that is good literally what their brain has kind of categorized and formulated was that thing did happen they've told themselves that enough where it's been convinced in their own mind that it did happen did too someone's trying to explain that about OJ they were saying that Oh J is live so many times about what happened that night that he might in his own mind believe he didn't actually believe he didn't do it that's why but the human memory like Neil deGrasse Tyson was trying to explain this to me that when when you were taught when you're talking about memory you are literally talking about the worst form of evidence that we know of yeah yeah the the mem your memory is first of all your memory really is your memory of your memory it's not even your memory it's a member of you recounting what you used to remember and then sort of reestablishing it and your narrative of the past right it's a recounting of a thing you tried to recount yeah like I'm pretty sure when that girl blew me when I was 16 I did have my ears ringing baby because I remember like wow that's crazy and it's never happened since well maybe not know pretty sure but probably yeah it happened yeah here's what I know she didn't rape me she didn't punch me in the face and hit me over the head with a frying pan far as you know till my ears rang she didn't do that it would be funny to see her hit you over the head my head went to the shape of a frying pan like those cartoons and back to normal that's how hard I came my head was in a fry don't know man it's high I'm optimistic this is what I think but I mean when people talk about the the divide between men and women I don't see it that much in real life and I'll see it my actual interactions on the Internet see it yeah that's the problem with the Internet the Internet is just writing things and you're not being there with the person and talking to the parade so you don't know if the people are writing things are reasonable you don't know if the people are angry no you don't know what there's no legitimize there's no legitimization to the internet anymore because it can come from everyone anywhere at any time and the problem I have with it with with these growth movements that get like crazy is you're like are they talking to anybody else besides their little internal group like are you talking to anybody other than the people that you know because if you're not you're not getting any sort of outside opinion or sources you're just listening to people that agree with you already the echo-chamber thing is so annoying to me it's annoying we're on the same page it's a yeah stop that doesn't it doesn't help any case at all are you are you actually trying to see what the other side is saying I think there are some people that do a good job I don't have mentioned names of like but there are some people that I follow online that like do a great job of like trying to have good discourse of right and left like Bill O'Reilly okay there's a guy but I just think like there are some people that I like online that like do have a good big fucking balance it out yeah you can but nowadays if you're but if you balance like you you you get criticized because you don't stick to one way well here's what's interesting by both I try to be very very balanced but I lean way more left than I do right way more left but you say that I get way more accused yeah of being someone who favors the right course left people right then I do being someone who favors are left by right people well I outwardly espouse left-wing ideas yes like universal basic income gay rights gay marriage women's rights go down the line welfare right food stamps I'm supportive all these things but I get accused way more of being a right-wing person by people on the left because I do even of being a left-wing person of people on the right when I say I'm left-wing that's because that's because you don't you don't complete the problem I have with the plot yeah you don't comply I don't complain you don't comply I don't comply they get some ID that's my but that's my biggest issue with any for any far stretching side of the of political party when you don't comply they fucking get mad they get mad well then we were talking about earlier that is a form of fascism there are trying to get you to figure out what they want you to behave like how they want you to talk right they want you to comply with that and stick to the script fit in this box Joe or you're not one of us stick to the groove and we won't bitch because we don't do that shit you don't do that shit King but beat also because I know you fucks turn on each other yeah yeah well internally they fight each other up is ever progressive enough nope they will always try when they run out of targets that if the whole world was progressive they would find people who were less progressive they were fine people who are not willing to suck that Muslim queer gender non-binary Iraq whatever whatever that guy's dick is because he's he has a penis right here's some sort of a homophobe they would find a rezone yeah glamor they find a reason for him forever for them she them sir but that's I mean like yeah but I've talked about this shit on stage I'm not gonna tell my joke but what no but why can't what why the labels yeah why the labels just be your your own because people like to be tribal yeah that's right but but all that does is that categorizes you yeah and then they get mad at category you want your you are subjecting yourself I didn't do that you told me you're the debt debt debt debt debt I don't tell you Joe I'm a white straight male who's Irish and Italian who loves feet and doggy style and and I'm also kind of Catholic but you know my mom got a divorce so I can't be all the way don't think that applies to a British Iraqi gay non-binary and also identifies as Muslim person I think you're out of your line I identify as an Irish Italian straight white male from Chicago who he'd like I just think we don't need all these labels you glamour you're allowed to be whoever you fucking want to be and I support the fuck out of who you are always do your shit what's almost always people that don't have a lot of other thing going for them yeah cuz you're gonna you have to like when someone says Stephen Hawking's identified as a British he's identifies a dead guys now when he was alive yeah brilliant British physicist slash heterosexual atheist a heterosexual atheist and uh who by the way was riddled wreak riddled with infidelity I've never met a guy so not capable of cheating and found a way to cheat on his wife well apparently he could still get it up oh well apparently even though his body didn't move his God would feel things that was his site the scientists he used to go to was Eric Weinstein told me about this I was like what he's like he's a freak and I was like wait what he's like yeah he used to go to strip clubs and there's like videos of him like rolling into his trip cover in the wheelchair like he would god that was his thing do you where'd you get littered with infidelity where'd you hear that yeah he cheated on his wife all the time in that fucking movie the whole reason that he well I mean the whole reason that he left his wife was because he fell in love with somebody else but wasn't it like a nurse there was - yeah but the truth was that he was this if you google if you google Stephen Hawking he was affiliative that he was always fucking around you know come on man he was always fucking around yeah that's once he got takes to the good life yeah once he had that cosmology cache yeah you know what also he's happy like am I not going to play by the rules the world dealt me the shittiest goddamn I'm a super genius pleased and you know what I fucking agree do whatever the fuck you want to do and you want to leave me I should leave me yeah why would you only fuck me yeah I'm I'm barely here yeah I'm a machine now I used this finger to talk know if somebody was his eyes in his fucking and his mouth its subway could he use his hands it was nice right yeah wasn't it as I like have a thing where he could kind of click he would do he would he would look at something - he had a thing where he's taken away then I he would look at shit and it was maybe want to see your asshole can you sit on my face face face don't kill me though now hammer out the universe [Music] don't smother me with your pussy I need to figure out how stars work our black holes real or is it just a brown star please I don't want to drown in your pussy I'm still on the subject of dark matter I'm trying to figure out the universe before I nut in my pants that's what that's one of the strippers Eddie we hooked up with is called dark matter I'm trying to figure out dark matter dark matter I could see her with big ol fur coat hell yes a big ol fur bush with a with a pencil because her nails are too long dark matter is that possible that you could grow your fingernails to the girls with long nails they probably have a terrible time texting well how did they touch what they try to touch with their finger right but if you have crazy ass long nails you'd be like deep voice text Oh always looks the whole time but then you got to use your nose just to get to the fucking microphone thing infrared sensors on his glasses see I'm saying I was on his eye best movements in his cheek which then translated into a software program that allowed him to navigate his system without his hands and then eventually turned into his speak his text-to-speech I just want to fuck can someone fuck facts to speak functionality which takes text text seems right it turns into speech in his iconic voice yeah he apparently he liked that voice and didn't want to upgrade it cuz like Siri like if you talk to see like who do you do you have a specific kind of Syria like my Siri is an Australian lady like hey Siri what's cracking bitch okay hey Syria but that's I have I've loved me didn't she who's that - I think it's the name one it's British I think we have the same one I just have an Australian lady they swapped me out the new uh maybe they don't like Australia the new upgrade forgot his voice in 2004 he's a good enough to quit this is how I talk I will always be this I am a robot man I would fun if you heard his voice he he was like yeah what's up with Stephen Hawking super ghetto voice yo sup the talk to eg up in this bitch fucking say to this mother fuck what's up with this dork I'm out here drinking Hennessy and coke trying to find out what the fuck is happening with black mataji what black matter is his that's his alter ego black matter that would be that would be a great stripper name Google's stripper black matter stripper black God exists she does or porn star first start with

DL down at Spearmint Rhino trying to keep it on the steak tip at the ragam Atlanta strip clubs in the dark black ones what was what's it called like little Wayne would go and throw money in the end

there was have gunfights there and sure magic Magic City Magic City that's the most famous one in Atlanta that's the big that's like the one yeah dark ladies and gentlemen come to the stage dark

the main stage dark matter ladies and gentlemen dark matter yes who you think was the first guy they came up with the strip club DJ voice I don't know but that motherfucker has permeated the entire culture you can't hear that you know to the mains recieves come to the main stage rain ladies and gentlemen it's River how about a nice round of applause for Lexus how about a nice round of applause for Kia Sorento it's weird how things like that happen like top 40 DJ voice very similar it's a similar of always but that did but that's a weird thing yeah how did broadcast well cuz I did journalism broadcast journalism in college and they teach you that they teach you broadcast voice well I mean they kind of teach you about intonation so you I think people get so stuck in that that they learn it and it like this like like WB k WB BMW kqx 95 9 it's the Moose on the radio this morning with Joe Rogan traffic at 9:00 from Lisa guys today and the thing it's it's the same rhythm they all have the exact same rhythm and I think it's just because it was learned and then they hear other people do it and it's just such a monkey here monkey do right it's there's a comfort level and imitating it well because it's rhythmic it really is it true I mean truly when they teach you in school they teach you about the rhythm of the voice what do they teach you well they teach you that there's there's rhythmic waves too it's its exact same thing to happen to on-air journalists like local news it's the same way when someone goes and on 95th Street that's where it all went down they teach you about rhythmic ways to lead into the next piece they say it's big it teaches it teaches the listener or the watcher to get to be prepared for the next thing it's almost like a now my shit's bullshit give me what you owe yeah where's yeah they just teach you about rhythms because it because it's it's easy for the listener to hear in the morning to hear people go and then there's dark matter dark matter and is that a girl's name guy I'm not sure we'll get pornhub is just falling apart on us they're like a bunch of parody okay dark matter what is there's a thing that people do like Jamie was on the phone once getting some tech information from this lady something put her on speakerphone while he's typing and she had the most unknown you know that thing that people do it's called up talk oh yeah up talk is so annoying Tech Talk yes there's a way that they talk that lets you know they're in well it's like a very left-wing technologically savvy way of talking up slope tech yeah top day yeah but it's all tech people yeah but it becomes an accent like if it was from Georgia or something like that would be a recognizable accent yeah like oh that's how they talk in Maryland right like you ever talk to someone from Baltimore Baltimore Baltimore you know you know Ryan Sickler yes he says Baltimore Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday yeah my friend John Rael shoutout to John Rael he's from Baltimore they have that same kind of it's a very Boston very recognizable at Boston's got that fuckin ah go up top there's a recognizable way of talking that lets you know that I'm going to agree with everything that is in like the zeitgeist of Swing progressive ecology anything about it's in the cloud who does that the best fred armisen I think does that the best Armisen knows how to like Fred Armisen is that you know apart from Portlandia okay what is she doing let me hear unless they do it a lot I think it's really annoying talk to me now it's Connie Chung that's supermodel Cindy Crawford she's going to do it again oh I didn't have the opportunities then the popular term for it is up talking but you don't have to be a fashion model or a teenager to up talk I came back here because you can hear it on commercials I mean it's kind of self-serve or even coming out of the mouth of a doctor on the president's health care task force because I see the problem from a different point of view she came up to the table and said my name is Belinda dr. Cynthia McLemore is a linguist in Philadelphia who's worked extensive alright this from 94 that's how fucking old this is interesting yeah intonation is way more exaggerated now it's interesting what they were talking about in 94 which is the kind of people may think that up talk conveys uncertainty but dr. McNamara says it can be used in a number of specific ways you can use the rise to convey uncertainty you can use the rise to hold the floor you can use the rise to convey do you understand what I'm saying or do you hear me or do you agree with me or do you approve of me all of those things that's very interesting here in a language describe what it is because it because it been adopted see if you can google Tech Talk up talk that's what I was looking but see if you can finally go because it's way more exaggerated now and the people that you know who I'm talking about the woman that was talking to you on the phone how crazy was she it was weird the way she was talking there's like a presentation to Jayme bazaar what kind of are you working on behringer X and his two one six is that it I felt like we were in a sketch when she was talking to him like this is an SNL but she had no answers for him so it was like she was like bullshitting him well that's just played that's to placate to past time that's like any about anybody in that tech world they had like that's helping you with like any sort of troubleshooting I find that too when I do that on with Apple when I text them about issues everything is like this weird placating like oh I know I can't believe you're having that problem well let's just figure out it's almost like this like having you on the head like subservient like yeah yeah okay in your pod do you need more food in your pod Oh having that issue with the Sonos player it's all Apple all that all Apple Apple has a sneaky you know the Sonos thing works flawlessly with the Apple music service pay for yep flawless Spotify but when you try to get the shit right off your phone that's when a problem so they've done some sneaky shit forced you into that yeah that forces you into using their subscription service sir so they've hijacked Sonos they've done some shit where they've inserted a little fuck to you into the codes Apple did they make it work better with their home pod speaker of course probably works come on it's a much better alternative what we suggest you know you could you switch over to home pod and that way you can listen to everything you say all the time we're listening in even when you mute us we'll just released a new one they released a pixel 3 with a new speaker dock motherfucker of a thing that the new update on Spotify has a built-in thing like so you could it's so you can like ask for a song we played yeah because it's not probably built into your yeah but you have to like allow the microphone to be on of course it's not a big issue it's Joe and I listen to you jerk off did you let do you allow the microphone to me yeah um why is there a piece of tape over the camera we'd like to see your car I'd like to see you on the webcam I want to see your car you see that's only the back of your dick it's not even the front is the front facing you what's the big deal I took the phone under my car what's the big deal if I see your balls yeah that's what I do I put the camera right under my sack yeah I rest my [Music] whatever I'm beating off at so you see I think you see a red screen of my balls like him you drape your balls like over like a light through my lens motherfuckers look ahead look look ahead ahead the knife is very it's very fun to play with let's wrap this bitch up Santino where's motherfuckers know you're doing you goddamn hilarious comedy come see we had so much fun we gotta go in the next year we write a whole new Act I have 25 minutes right hurry up 25 I'm trying I wrote all night last night I got home after the story I did a lot of writing yeah I got almost nothing out of it I'm not gonna talk I won't talk about anything but you have but you work there was a few new things that you had that I saw I got some new shit yeah last night it was really good swinging swinging for the fence looking for gems oh come see me look at ya come see me looking for some some fake gems I got Calgary I'm in Calgary next week and then in New York at Caroline's on Broadway the following week look at that please check me out enter Santino calm Chito Santino on all dem platform all right fuckers see ya this outdoorsy [Music] [Music]
