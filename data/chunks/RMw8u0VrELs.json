mmm four three two boom and will I Pat alright sir good of the University of badassery ha ha ha ha I'm more like the UH I'm more like the vice president oh yeah the president probably uh CJ Ortiz easier but he's the president of the university of badassery my co-host and of a little podcast we do dude I fucking love your Instagram page if there's a guy be surfing I'm gonna call when the shit hits the fan all right might be you whoo rock and roll baby I'm there for your brother I also like guys who are my age or older that still get after it in the gym and your fucking page is filled with you getting after it but we could go on we could full a full segment I'm that alone yeah and and the secret the big secret behind it which there's not much of a secret as you know yeah I mean it's hard work sucks and not everybody's cut out for it yeah people just don't enjoy it yep they try to find a lot of a lot of nice excuses yeah why they don't get after it yeah one of the big excuses is age yeah I run into guys all the time during my full-time training gig REM training guys on the range who say you know I'm 38 or 40 or whatever and I'm getting old I'm like bro let me tell you something this is this is something somebody told me when I was 30 and I've got affirmation of this from guys like you who've stayed fit their entire lives the fittest of a man's age is around like 44 or 45 that's when you could be on the top of your game and ultra rares yeah you know the strongest the fastest the fittest the smartest you know when it comes to knowing your body and and how much you can do and how much you could take after that then you got to start being a lot smarter you know you die how you work out how often you know you like I'm super tentative now not to overwork yeah me too because I've been told there is no such thing as overwork but there is a such thing is under recovery I I err on the side of caution a lot yeah more now and I've got it down man I started this system combat strength training mmm-hmm when I retired from the military because when I retired from the military retired for reconstructive surgeries 13 broken bones and any ground pounder who's you know special ops guy who did 20-plus years there's a lot of freaking mileage on that combat chassis right you know he's jacked up would you get reconstructed the first one was this bicep I was a towed jumper doesn't have to make sense what does it mean it's related to static line jumping where you passed a static line off to a jump master he secures it and the static line at the end of the static line deploys your parachute so it's like you know it's like rookie jumping it's AB it's real infantry BASE jumping well that static line got wrapped around my reserve and around my arm and pulled me with the plane and it pulled my bicep into my forearm broke ribs dislocated shoulder concussion and this is when I was fucking 18 years old just saw it and I already got jacked up next one was um diskectomy l5 s1 just come just a kind of an amalgamation of helo crashes and vehicle crashes and stuff like that if people don't know what that means it means your disks they trim a little piece of it so it doesn't go against your nerve yeah and it was it was a massive herniation so they were able to take the big chunk out and then do that trim up as well which is that's easy surgery ever had really knee reconstruction sucked I mean I was a full freakin year six months of you know getting back on your feet and then another year before I was like a hundred percent right and I was I think I was still in my 20s did you get a a CL reconstruction sass center patellar tendon yeah I did that one hole hardened that's a hard one I did the other one with allograft yeah cadaver it's way easier really so it's six months six months and I was 100% man yeah cuz I first difference yep damn that's a big chunk of time yeah yeah it's but the other thing is that sometimes people's bodies reject those allograft right didn't have with me I got lucky but I I dunno if some people and also it feels like it's healed before it's really healed who do you know how that works the what what happens is they take that graft and they put it in there and then instead of that being your new ligament your body has to replace that with tissue so your broad eight body has to repro livery that tendon with its own cells and so it takes a long time so what it feels stable you're like oh my knees back my my legs feel strong and then you go to pivot to throw a punch or something like that pop pop it just pops like a wet piece of toilet paper yeah yeah you know some people they say some people are a seal depend and others are not but man I needed that one died because I don't understand people not being a seal dependent means to stabilize and ligament in your knee and then the last one was show up shoulder and they were able to do that non-evasive Lee you know scope it they were able to scope it like four different places and they created you see if I get this right they created a bigger injury to promote more healing Jesus yeah so they did like bone scrapes and stuff like that and went in so they were able to do it without cutting the shoulder open Wow what was wrong with your shoulder bunch of tears there was a how did I hurt that one that was I got called in one day and I used to drive my dirt bike to work like eight miles of real pristine forest and a t-bone the deer go geez yeah 55 it's like hitting a brick house I mean I'm sure you stop yeah there's no give with that thing and thankfully I've could I've been to riding schools like even the Gary cynic motocross school so I was up high and elbows up high so I flew like Superman I didn't get all tied up like but I mean I sailed for 20 20 yards Jesus Christ in the air 60 feet oh yeah yeah yeah Oh came down and hit directly flat and then slid and hit a tree so I knew the shoulder was jacked up but that one I had all kind of knee injuries from that one like I had this one thing called a adhesion so I went I was able to make it to work and they checked out my shoulder I said yeah you're jacked up we'll put you get your MRI tomorrow Hama Hama that night I go home and I wake up to go take a piss and uh I realize I've got this massive like bubble on my side massive and I thought man I might have internal bleeding just thing was gigantic was what I mean you know right on top of my pelvis so I just I set my alarm clock for like every 10 minutes just to see if she's still with it and then went in the next day and they sucked out a couple thousand milliliters of bloody by-product because it was the skin separating from the bone so I think that's what they call it an adhesion oh so a bunch of blood fills the gap yeah I was all of us orange 25 product crap nice yeah I've had some weird I'm sure injuries but but you're pieced back together again I can tell you know you do a lot of crazy working out with like I've seen a lot of shit you do with like cinder blocks that were you make do with what's around you well that so my work temp was pretty it's off the charts last year in the year before I traveled to a different state every week and most of them were jet-setting so lugging all my shit to the airport every week all my guns and this is for tactical training right so is this is this for private individuals military training how it's all on the most most of my courses are open enrollment so I have all walks of life I mean the demographic is extremely wide and so is the skill set disparity mm-hmm of these guys who come you know out of 14 guys who sign up for them would be cops three military the rest civilians and in that civilian group I mean they're from you know you got computer programmers you got surgeons you got lawyers you got you know strip club owners and I mean the demographic is pretty eclectic it's pretty wide mm-hmm and when I go to these places instead I used to like go to a la fitness or something you know I'm gonna have a fitness after work but I got tired of that you know just walking through trying to navigate my way through a endless maze of bench presses watching guys do concentration curls in the in the mirror so I started a range workouts where I'll plan it during the day and it became a thing where like fit guys in the class are watching me I go in hey bro what's the workout after after training uh so then we do with you on your Instagram yeah when the guys in the course will say hey can I do the workout with you after after training yeah yeah yep so you just find whatever's laying around tire yep cinder block yep anything dream you know if I have a wall I could do a lot with that let's say it's a 5 6 foot wall mm-hmm there's a lot you could do with that lot you could do with just a tree some cinder blocks you know and then everyone's small guys will bring like a 90 pound sandbag or a couple of kettlebells because now it's a thing I expect it yeah sir like all right we want to do a pat Mack workout after range day and you know kudos to those guys because that shit that's hard you know when you're all in the range all day working your ass off and specially in a blazing hot Sun and guys hang out to do a workout with me like bad kudos to you bro but one of the cool things about the Internet is that people find other people that want to push themselves yep and they find inspiration through guys like you and there's you know dozens of guys like you online that are like fun to follow and you get you go this guy's doing it I got to fucking get off my ass and go do it cuz sometimes people just need an example they need someone to look at and go this and it literally can change the way you live your life no doesn't see a guy who's doing what you're doing you like goddamn it he's fucking intense all the time he's getting after it look his beard I love that that's an Eagle Lake Texas probably three years ago what's the smoke is that exhaust fumes or gunshot no the owner I know what that he was he was smoking um it was a smoker oh he was making me oh nice yep yep yeah but those are that's those are hard workouts man yeah those swings in between the legs like that that's that's how you build the the real core strength if your back and you know your your whole the whole spinal column yeah keep it tight and strong you know it's it's it's funny you get even today I read reading some comments about whatever it is there's a lot of stupid people out there when it comes to like not understanding the right way to work out right and I want to tell these guys hey man two things one is if you do if you do what you've always done you're gonna get what you've always got number two I didn't go home last night and smoke a bunch of crack and dream his shit up I mean there's I've I've done a lot of freaking research a lot of there's a lot of time and effort you want into this and they'll say hey man you're gonna throw your back out doing that stuff no motherfucker that's that's building your back yeah you know work in that transverse plane is what guys neglect a lot see here here we go I'm gonna get on this freakin soapbox I swear to God go ahead go get on the bomb do a pocket most guys here with most guys work out they live in a what call a sagittal istic environment you know three planes of motion frontal sagittal transverse so they're in the sagittal world doing benchpress and concentration curls out of the three planes of motion I would say that transverse is most important additionally when we work out I would also argue with confidence that it's the plane of motion that is most neglected that transverse plane I like to tell guys that and the transverse plane lives life saving and ass-kicking there are four reasons why we should why we should exercise this is max opinion okay one self-preservation longevity good for your health stronger longer motion is lotion number two the ability to save your own life having that confidence knowing yep I could pull myself out of that burning coal or or over that wall or whatever number three more importantly to me is being Batman the ability to save somebody else's life so that's three reasons the last one kicking somebody's fucking ass so when I look at workout I look at those four things right they're not like cosmetics or anything Cosmetics is a cool byproducts do you workout right you're gonna look better you look better you feel better you're more confident you're more confident you perform better because confidence performance work hand in hand sure so I mean there's no freaking magic elixir to it you know it hard and it's an it's hard yeah people like to see there was like if you do bench press you see your chest puff up they see those results I always tell people if there's one exercise I would recommend like people who do jiu-jitsu Turkish getup right it's the least because last week it's the least romantic of all workouts nobody wants to do those goddamn things go to a go to a gym you could go to a hundred gyms if you're lucky you find one person doing Turkish getup yep every gym will have someone someone somewhere is doing bench press and someone's doing curls and lat pulldown machine and all that normal shit and yeah work it out it's kind of there it's it's like an anachronism you know they're working in a world like a muscle and fitness world still mm-hmm and that's fine working in isolation if that's your job there's three people who three types of people who should work out a concentration like doing a curl or someone you know a concentration curl a professional bodybuilder all right that's your Jo be man at your sport number two you recovering from surgery and atrophy so it's physical therapy number three yeah no fucking idea what you're doing or you're a model you try and look sex right - that's right yeah right so they fall on that same CAG trying to look bro yeah trying to yeah if you it's it's just not what you really need to actually with exercise is something that's gonna mimic what you would actually do in real life picking up things moving them around like farmer walks yep farmer walk very unglamorous carry a heavy ass kettlebell in one hand and just walk around for like a half a mile and your fucking forum would be dying your legs would be killing you your core is gonna be shaking it's amazing and I like the way you put it to carry on once you know those one-sided yeah people don't know that they try to do with two arms but with two arms it balances out and then it's really just a grip and a leg exercise with a little bit of lats and traps but really what you want to do is one 100-pounder on one hand carry that bitch everything else just kind of balance it out and then turn around put it on the left-hand hip what that's great we do um at my gym a lot of that where we load one side of the time one of the things I love to hear is a guy will say man I never see you doing the same thing yeah like well I pretty much don't because I don't want to fall into a rut of complacent adaptation you know so even guys who said you uh do you do like Olli lifts see yeah of course every once in a while I'll probably do a deadlift a standard deadlift once every two months but I'm doing variations of that like a shovel deadlift or a suitcase you know deadlifts I suck and a lot like you said are not glamorous yeah I'll throw those in a bomb but you do much cardio here's how it knocked out cardio is uh I have a formula with this I have a program combat stranger I had a book and website and all this and those your program something that people could sign up for oh yeah okay yeah they can buy the e-book what's the website Jaime Coppola combat strength training comm mat and the formula is work in working anaerobic chunks in circuit to near metabolic threshold to meet an aerobic goal and then like 30 35 minutes so that doesn't include warm-up you know so you're good whatever it is for me it's like bag work or something for warm-up just to make sure everything's loosey-goosey the older you are the more you have to warm up man damn don't Jack yourself up it's called Fitness not brokenness oh yeah people that's another thing that people don't like to do because it's not glamorous and because the people get lazy they don't want to do that work out whether the pre-workout they don't want to do all the skip and rope and all they'll just switch and stances and jumping jacks and all that stuff but you really need to break a sweat of real sweat before you actually start lifting weights and then even if you live weights or do anything like say if you're gonna do get kettlebells I'll start off with 35 pounds I'll do everything nice and light at first yeah I don't start off heavy nope yep that well that's all that's all it's a wisdom yes you know that's one fucked a bunch exactly challenge awesome yeah yep yeah chalk that one up to wisdom because you learn that yeah you know it's okay to put my big fat ego aside yeah I still have an ego but I'm not gonna get jacked up because I want to smoke these guys and in order to do that I can't be you know I can't have tweaks in my neck and right I can there's a there's some a bunch of guys who do these they do these workout competitions called train to hunt and what it's mostly for bowhunters where they have all these physical challenges like you do a bunch of stuff with sandbag and the idea is to Jack your heart rate up and then when you have to execute a shot you got to be in enough physical condition so you can bring your heart rate down pretty rapidly and it's all timed and they're competing love that yeah I love you that kind of stuff with tactical yeah I've got an entire youtube channel dedicated to that son nice oh yeah they're all very very tough like shots rifle pistol and prior to that I'm pushing a truck pulling it climbing a fast rope running with a sandbag you know it's like I call it shot impossible almost you know where that heart rate is slamming and your throat and now you've got to go into respiratory pause and take these 50 50 yard pistol shots mmm you know I'm doing pistol at 50 yards and thing ding-ding-ding but yeah I love that stuff and and that's where interval training really comes into play you know learning that to control that heart rate they're learning how to breathe the right way man that shut that shit is badass how big fan of all that yeah I'm - I've never done a tactical course I really want to take some lessons oh there's like I saw Keanu Reeves doing it for John when I was like that looks fun yeah I mean I've shot my guns at the range before and stuff like that I've hunted with rifles but with pistols I'd like to go to some sort of a need you love you'd love my courses um because I keep them just one of your things right here oh yeah yeah yeah that's uh oh dude there's no growth man that's a lot of rope that's a hundred feet of fat ass hemp rope with 270 pounds CMBS at the end of it and I forget what I do here but there's the yeah I got my steel at the end I forget I think I run up oh yeah there's three cones I see him now so that the forums and everything are just smoke jacked yeah there yeah plus music stuff YouTube if we oh this is uh yeah this was a Turner burn here just a simple Turner burn but that rope crushed my spirits there's tough tough piece YouTube videos that I've got one where I'm I fell in love with the idea I thought you know cause I do this at the gym where I I grab a kettlebell and I balance it on end mm-hmm your balance I down and it's so 55-pound carabao most people can't do that you know just balance a kettlebell well I'll walk on a balance beam with them I don't know stuff like that phenomenal yeah it's good stuff so I thought all right next YouTube video I'm gonna do the 55-pound camera balance this thing on and shoot strong hand and then balance and and shoot support head 50-yard fifty arm so I got out of the race on a balance yeah it's on YouTube yeah so I got out there and I got all my stuff ready got my bed in my truck got my gun laid out I throw that kettlebell up left hand first and pull the pistol up and I'm looking at the target and I am shaking like a dog shitting sands purrs oh god this was a bad idea oh my god and shot a clean shot to clean the first time and then I have to because I I do this like a west Stroud type of filming you know west route the survival man sur les Les Stroud yeah yeah so where I go and talk to the camera afterwards I was so happy when it rang again when it rang ding so I had this massive smile on my face I dropped the kettlebell I had to erase it and come over to the camera girl alright well that was a pretty good time you know there's the time upside down cannibals are great for shoulder stability yeah once again something that people don't work on in the gym stabilization my balance stabilization proprioception can aesthetic awareness because it because it ain't sexy and they're building Peaks on biceps and you know cutting their abs so we do a lot of like rubber band work holding it isometric you know and watch everything freakin shake just shaking you know when you put together these drills and you put together these programs do you just sit down and map it all out in your head do you think like okay how am I gonna emulate the kind of stress in a like a life-or-death gunfight your your heart reads jacked you might have to physically do something have to run from someone or climb over something is that how you do you create yeah you're talking about like the YouTube stuff where I do this yeah like physical thing with the shoot yeah I the first thing I do is I've I put it on my calendar just so I know that I'm going to make one and then I'll start thinking about it what haven't I done because I have to think also I have to think about the audience the audience that follows me on YouTube a lot of my gun guys so they want they want to know about the gun that I'm using MMS have to think about that and then I have to think all right what challenge can because I want guys to replicate it I want them to like put those little notes on the UT I did this and my time was a minute and 30 or whatever it was so I want him to be able to replicate him as well and wanna make them real with some real-world application in mind you know so front-loading a sandbag or getting in pulling something in and out of a car and doing that with a bunch of repetitions you know you when you're doing deadweight in and out of a car hmm you know 150 pounds pulling it in pushing it out pulling it back in pushing it out that'll smoke every freaking ounce of your being and it'll crush your spirits I know it's crazy right lieutenant a full-grown woman you'll be able to pick her up and put her in a car easy no hard try getting her out right especially if there's no you know you gotta think deadweight yeah you know what if this person is incapacitated they ain't helping you though is all I'm just full you know those limbs are moving everywhere and it is a pain in the dick yeah you're way better off with 150 pound barbell oh yeah waise yeah whatever yeah it's like all right that just stabilized on your shoulder pull it out yeah yeah so but I can have to keep those things in mind the other thing I want to do is I want to make him I kind of want to make it hard enough so not everybody could do it because I want to do something that my like industry competitors are not doing and I've turned this I've started a kind of a fad about ten years ago where more guys are doing this now they're putting like shoots up on interwebs you know with some physical activity prior to ordering mm-hmm which yeah good but uh yeah I'm pretty sure I uh you know I uh I made it cool okay well the more people doing it the better right right more cops to be the better yep yeah it's it's just such a smart thing to think of if you're if you really want to train the way you train and really want to think about you know like tactical situations and real world application I mean such a great way to go about doing it and it looks exciting and fun I mean I haven't done it but I'm sure it's good I talked a lot during like now during my courses I don't do this stuff you know I'm not because I have I'll have 60 year old women in it I'll have guys with Parkinson's even man come to my course I have guys real chairs yeah have a guy so how do you how do you stabilize a guy when they have Parkinson's that's good that's so I what I showed this guy a trick what was his name see if I could remember his name it doesn't matter but he was 77 years old and he said well I could either come to your course and train or lay on my couch and I was like something you know there was to that effect because he'd like to shoot I said bro anytime but I have to modify the course to him because he came alone zero right right so I would sit him on on a cooler and then I used you know furring strips are they hold up a target there's one by twos you know about five foot long I had him crisscross those and hold him and then two v-notch ah and put his rifle in that v-notch because he could set up pretty good with he couldn't get in the prone he can't stand shoot but sitting pretty good and you know when when guys like that are concentrating more you see that shake go away too mmm hey that's something we do at my gym - we train Parkinson's uh Tata box participations really it's a it's a it's a national program called Rocksteady boxing huh they come in three times a week where's your gym North Carolina what's it called so go there sparked expose as PA are like spar and then TC is it open - yeah yeah it's open it uh it's it's very fight centric it's an MMA gym so everything we do is very like fight centric with the width of physical work and the lifting and all that and then we have programs like there's we got we got some really good fighters man dude coach they're I mean they're like legit so we got really good fighters who do uh you know one-on-one coaching everything from Greco to BJJ to Tai box to kickboxing to standard boxing it's it's an it's a neat place it's it's small its warehouse it's very Spartan you know it's not sexy at all perfect yeah it's my favorite kind of freaking it's badass and so what do you do with these parkinson's people so the Rocksteady boxing folks they have a program they come in a couple times a week and they put them through a series of exercises you know a lot of it's just walking a straight line holding this and what you know loading one side and then once they're all warmed up they all kid up and you see these guys are rapping and everything you know they're so excited to get there and they put their raps on and and then they have as they work a series of bag drills you know a one-two lateral move the next bag is hooks you know left and right hooks and there's an uppercut bag and there's a you know the double end bag and granted they're not moving you know they're not moving much but they're moving and they get there and they love common there and some of them work up a sweat you know it's it's pretty it's pretty amazing seeing them get off their asses and get to a gym and I look I remember you put something out and I pegged you like a year ago oh it was on a podcast and you were you were getting pretty emotional about somebody not wanting to work out and I pained you and I said I think I mentioned that we got fucking Parkinson's people coming to my gym yeah well it's just when people make those excuses it just drives me crazy yeah cuz I've seen examples I've been very fortunate that I have good health but I've seen many examples and I've also been very fortunate that I never got out of shape I just kept working out my whole life but I've seen people that are fat as fuck 350 pounds just barely can get out get a well round and then they decide I'm gonna take control my fucking health and then they just just do it they just do it and even if you just got a walk around the block even if you walk up flights of stairs even if you just do a push-up even if you do uh sit up just do something man do some body weight squats do something it can be done yep it you know the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step and and I'll have guys I in my community who would say who will say yeah man up all your stuff I'm show out of shape and I don't have the time to snatch which is another excuse there's no such things I don't have the time get up an hour early now you have all the time in the world you get an hour workout I'll fuck you up in an hour right you come work out with me for one hour I will have you crying by the end of an hour that's plenty of time from warmup to cool down one hour we have done yep yeah if you're if you're what man and you man there's my friend I don't need more than that Keith Webber he has this extreme kettlebell cardio DVD it's it's available as a digital download though that I can't even do 40 minutes of this motherfuckers work out with a 145 pound kettlebell 40 minutes in my legs are shaking my arms are shaking I'm walking like like I blew both my fucking ankles out for the next couple of days it's ruthless you can get a lot done in 40 minutes yeah and there is this is a Sabbath right not yeah yeah that guy's not shredded at all that's a crazy shit - he brings a accountable that's all on the beach he just brings bells on the beach and just fucking gets after and you just follow along with them nice it's a great workout - because you're you're doing what he's doing so you know it's possible he's doing it right in front of your face right right yeah you know when it comes to I'll tell guys come to my gym once just once because all I need to do is bait the hook yeah get you feeling good yeah yeah and and I and they say well I'm afraid you're gonna smoke ass and nope cuz I run uh whether it's shooting or physical stuff I run I call performance based training good you know I got this it's recognizes that we all perform differently and performance as measured by doing what we can with what we have right blah so it gives them permission to work within their capability level not mine you don't need to replicate what I'm doing bro I'm we're gonna do these same movements but I'm gonna I'm gonna scale this to you to your needs you know and alright and and the other thing is I I don't want you to be incapacitated I don't want you to work out so hard that that you're not able to move for the next three days right I have another rule is that you could work out as hard as you want in the gym but when you walk out that door that says exit you got to be ready to kick somebody's ass I mean I don't like to work out to the point of being incapacity right right so there's a balancing act there and I've figured it out fuck that up many times oh man yeah no yeah I think that's why I figured it out because too many times I am for a whole weekend going home my god yeah my frickin ass my thighs my how do you do for recovery do you fuck around with cryotherapy or sauna nothing do nothing really no I know nothing how come I I don't know because I haven't really like needed it yeah you should just get a song on you Jim yep just that alone get a song in a fucking ice bath yeah I drink I think I drink beer for recovery that's that's a nightly ritual well I will not be able to function if I don't how many it is Oh usually about four but they're like good quality pints you know I'm not like chugalug in NASCAR soda by the case barley pops but like good quality uh IPA stouts Porter's you know that kind of thing you just live for it yeah I love it I'm a hobbyist man right and my hobbies that or bourbon so I that doesn't seem to go hand in hand a lot of people's eyes I know freaking kidding me it's like hey man I have a policy my wife having and I have a policy every night is Saturday night but every morning is Monday morning Wow I like it yeah so we go out almost every night we go out just because if I'm at home I'm gonna work mm-hmm I'm gonna work until I fall asleep so you know that clock hits 6:00 7:00 at night like all right let me go meet my wife she's getting off work we're gonna go have a couple pints have a big old bourbon or something like that and uh yep I smoke cigars dip thing is well that's numbing diet it's all about diet mm-hmm I mean my diets ridiculous we predominantly when I'm meal prep its collard greens spinach bell pepper and chicken that's it and then spice it up with you know salt pepper so don't look prep for the week you make but it doesn't I don't have a pot big enough to prep for the week so I prep for like two three days at a whack and just chow down and that's the other thing diet man you know there's dude what's the secret and diet eat food in food doesn't come in a bag or a box that's a product right shop at the periphery of a grocery store if you go into the guts all your going in there is for coffee olive oil salt mmm that's it yeah that's a good way of looking at that you say right stay on the outside that's where the meat and vegetables are yep beware of the inside just beware if you're going in there go with a purpose you know don't get sucked in because that and then the older you get the less you could prop the but your body can't process that crap right so diet for me get up in the morning it's habitual full quart of water since I wake up full full quart of water first thing our slam just don't even don't even set it down and then why is that what's the thought process behind I'm getting that down I'm getting it in no waste in time it's there for a reason I want to because you wake up dehydrated I just want a power slam that and get it all into me and then you know a clean I eat a clean breakfast like a couple boiled eggs and some bacon mmm and then throughout the day and people say well is there a certain amount just too many people follow too many like diets which good for them if you're following a diet kudos but like meal times and how many times a day I eat when I'm hungry and I don't eat too I'm full it's it's pretty freakin simple you don't eat till you're full right back off right you haven't what do you like 70% about that yeah and then but poor a portion of that is thinking well what if I got a sprint 400 yards you know or what if I got to kick somebody's ass right now right now and if I'm a hundred percent I mean it's gonna be shooting out of both ends so I die is freaking huge man--huge but it allows me to drink those beers at night you know it allows me to do stuff like that and then make sure I'm hitting it every day the you know the gym evil days I usually don't have time for seven days and I even if I did I probably wouldn't I'd probably take at least one day off maybe two but you know as well as I do that you are more in tuned when you get older to what your body's telling your brain your body when you get older says you know what back to fuck off today you don't need a shit and I listen to that man I do listen that too that's so important to listen to that there's those days where I might manage to feel a little off today I'm like am I being a pussy I don't think so Yeah right I'm feeling off and then all sudden I'll start my nose will start running I'll start coughing oh boo right yeah around me a second my god lucky I listened yep and then that cold to be gone a day or two yep versus if I just go run the hill right yeah I'm good to go sweat it out that shit is not real no people say sweat it out that is unless you're getting in a steam room or a sauna ain't sweating out shit you're you're twisting your body up and you're probably gonna make your immune system even weaker yep when you were talking about those Parkinson's folks when they come into your gym when they do that do they experience any benefit in terms of their function does it help them absolutely absolutely and some more than others depends I think it depends on how you know what's would stage they're in how long they've been there but absolutely we've got one guy who used to be a bow hunter and he can't anymore so we got him replicating that motion with rubber bands and you know he could barely do a small wand initially he gave it up because he thought you know what it's not working for me so he kind of gave up but once we started to work in the rubber bands he started seeing you know results this is a seven year old man with Parkinson's he's like crap man I'm gonna be able to drop my bow again because I'm doing these exercises you know and yeah absolutely with a lot of guys especially with their their balanced lateral movement that's one that I see a lot you know in the lateral movement they're making big improvements with lateral movement and yeah what helps it is weight training help them like what I think it's it's just getting getting that body moving you know and then with the with the boxing it's that hand and eye coordination to you know vision being visually acute you know to the spot that you're supposed to hit on that bag you know every time so it's a combination of the because the weights are very very minimal you know we don't want these guys to get jacked up and and the gal who runs it Laura's pretty she's pretty cognizant of that you know about not wanting them to get jacked up so their loads are very light when they do any kind of weight training but I'd always wonder because it is a neurological disorder yeah but uh you know what they benefit from it because they're getting out of the fucking house out of the hospital get into a gym to wrap it up they're motivated you know they're fired up to be there and you know they're not they're not it's obvious that they have Parkinsons you know they're not you know running around the ring like Roy Jones rather but they're they're fired up to be there and it's giving them purpose yeah yeah people need purpose you know yeah speaking of yet when you retired from the military was this some did you envision yourself doing something along these lines like teach and tactical style for oh man I went through some rough patches as most guys do right yeah man man it was whoo no I I morphed into Who I am only in like the past six or seven years I retired no five I got hired before I even retired by a corporation to do training stuff and I kind of fell I was almost falling into that rut of accepting mediocrity Plus what I didn't know is that uh I had depression I didn't know that I just no idea it which is common especially in like the SpecOps world you guys retire because you been there in in in units with guys with the same guys for a long long time and you've there's a level of intimacy there that can't be replicated with another human being and then when you retire you miss that camaraderie that connection so I had working for a corporation I was a had a really bad relationship I was living in the bonus room of my garage I'd lived there for five years mmm cuz I had ex who was a on chemistry you know prescription meds go Big Pharma and so the neuroreceptors were freakin gone I mean delusional and and it was it was real bad and then I started boozing with depression mmm and I it didn't even occur to me that dude you got a fucking problem man didn't even occur I guess which is common with a lot of guys but I had an epiphany a lot of things happened at one time my local cop saved my life they said bro you need to get the fuck out of there and a bunch of things happened all at once this was in 2013 I didn't want to leave because I had little kids and so I didn't want to I was I was gonna stay there and just wither wither away I mean I almost capitulated you know to darkness but I got up with her before I went to sleep one night well my kid is sleeping with me and I'm hammered and it's like 8:00 at night you know and uh and I had an epiphany I said you know what I can't I can't do this and I will not I remember saying to myself I won't I will not be defeated I will not be defeated and I put my running shoes by the side of my bed and some shorts set my alarm clock got up early next morning and went for a run a la Forrest Gump and I pound the pavement for about ten or twelve miles and I'm not a runner you know I like to run I like to sprint and when I came back from the run worked out in my driver for about an hour and my local cops came all happened the same time and they came and said hey bro get the fuck out kids be alright you need to do this and that and then I started kind of figuring out a Rhea Rhea valuating my path in life Oh back up a step I also got laid off from this corporation and you know with a guy in the military you don't you don't ever think about job security and when I retired I'm working for a corporation that was mostly were taught made up of retired military guys so you get laid off you like what the fuck can I get to do now what does that even mean getting laid off I don't what am I gonna do so all that shit happen at the same time I was like a it was like a this massive spiral of bad events and uh man I was able to I was able to rekindle my own my own my own fire because I recognized all right bro you still got an ember you still got this all you need to do is just nurture that Amber turn it into a flame turn that into a flame and then just start adding would add would add wood until it becomes just a perpetual blaze and which led me to this thing that I tell people now you know is that you got to keep the blaze alive um I've got that on t-shirts even because I like I like to kick people in the ass who are willing to sustain their own fire once they get that ass-kicking if they can't if they can't keep their fire going then it's not worth it's not worth it for me you know to keep kicking them in the ass but uh yeah so ever since uh that point in time you know getting laid off the depression the booze and I was able to rediscover me and rebrand and and pretty much start from scratch I mean I had to start Life all over again when I was 48 years old Wow yep the whole thing from scratch and I discovered like social media and all this stuff because I've met a gal and I'm married to her now and she's probably the best purse one of the best human beings I've ever met you know all-around human being so she was able to help me with that and said hey you need to do this you need to get this social media platform or that one and so it's it's it's detonated pretty well considering I bet on a short amount of time but apparently the message is resonating yeah so it's a genuine message that's why I picked up on it all right on yeah no but I love that you figured your shit out I love that it's my favorite thing when when I mean look everybody's prone to mistakes and prone to depression and people are prone to hitting rock bottom yep your life can go down a series of bad roads and you find yourself in a bad relationship or a bad job a bad situation in life and it's very very difficult at that moment to have faith and confidence that you can readjust reconsider and and re-engage and that's what you did that's awesome I love that I love those kind of stories a lot of them people get their shit together and and I think that that helps me help other people yeah for sure you know cuz I could I could relate yeah and I don't you know I don't sit down with them and and pat him on the shoulder and say hey bro you know I was there too or anything like that I don't even share with them but I empathize and that sometimes that's all it takes mm-hmm any empathize and um and you just give them just give just just that just a little bit of the right advice just a little bit you know too much well oftentimes people just need momentum they need one good day you need one today that's why I said to that one guy just come to the gym one day yeah if you like one good day we eat clean you drink a lot of water and you like you did you got that day you woke up you put your shoes on you went for a run you worked out your driveway you've got a good day yeah that's sometimes all you need to do and decide this is what I do from now on I have good days yeah tomorrow's gonna be another good day and then I'm gonna force myself into another good day and the next thing you know I've got some momentum right you got some momentum you could change everything yeah I've felt many times in my life I've felt like I could slip the wrong way and I just I see it I see the dark hole and I go fuck that and just go the other two would go the other way the problem isn't people fall into that dark hole they think that that defines them but it doesn't right it doesn't define you it's just you right now you could be totally different tomorrow you're a human being you can think you can adjust and there's so much inspiration it's one of the beautiful things about your Instagram page and many many other Instagram pages is that you can take if you curate your feed correctly and you don't follow a bunch of knuckleheads you can go to your Instagram or to whatever social media platform you like and you can go and check out a lot of cool shit oh man you feel good about it you get fired up and you want to do good with your life yep I am I love being inspired by other guys that I follow on social media maybe I'm a motivator but I like to be motivated too yeah me too so I love I've met a lot of really cool people on on those platforms you know like sitting across from you for example and it's not a it's not a because too many guys especially like my age are afraid of it you know their friend yeah say hey bro you don't have to you know you don't have to go crazy on it but you should you know at least check this out and check that out you don't have to follow thousands of things people say like emojis right what am I doing here 50 years old but you're right too about we are we are human beings and we are allowed to air yeah and as a matter of fact in most cases it is a biological requirement for us to force a jack shit up yeah I thought what we do all we needed to make sure is that it doesn't become a recurring theme that we learn from the past prepare for the future perform and live in the present yeah expand this we've been we've been blessed with a very very short existence on on this the planet that amazes me that it can you know nurture and sustain frickin life in a solar system that can do the same and I like to feel insignificant and small like looking up at the stars through a telescope it's like damn man I'm pretty good nothing I am nothing you like it's easy enough I can see the Andromeda galaxy yeah through my telescope and that's the closest one that we can see and there's billions of stars in that galaxy and guess what there are billions of galaxies just like that yeah I mean I am I'm so freakin ignition on this planet with these other several billion people because I mean just the fact that I am a human being you know that our strands of DNA wrapped in protein and thrown in with some you know with some amino acids it's mind-blowing that that um you know they're a thing yeah ya know I feel the same way all the time I it's so easy to get wrapped up in your own day-to-day existence and weird little dumb things and you you if there's only little dumb things in your life to those dumb things become huge when you have big things in your life it's easy to look at those dumb things in brush moth when you're really working hard at something and you have a lot of positive positive things going on in your life then then it's easier like what's one of the good things about really hard exercise is it's very difficult to do so when you go to a very difficult real or real difficult physical struggle the other little boy shit seems like nothing it just really see it gets exposed for what it really is yeah what it really is it just it seems like a big deal in the moment in the time but that's just a trap because your body needs something to think about your body's always worrying your brain is always focusing on danger you worry about threats and predators yeah and if there's no predators then it's fucking microaggressions then it's you know it's this guy looked at me funny at the office it's like this bitch is always parking in the spot I want you know like people get weird you get you start focusing on nonsense under my new shit yeah but I thinks I think that's one of the primary benefits of physical exercise is not just that it blows out all that excess energy that I think your body stores up and I always the way I was described as at a person's body's almost like a battery that's leaking energy like you got to purge it you gotta purge it of that excess energy because it has certain physical requirements then on top of that the physical difficulty of you know running a hard you know two to three miles in the mountains or wherever you're at or doing like you know crazy CrossFit workout or whatever the fuck you like to do taking a jiu-jitsu class that shit is so hard that all that other nonsense in your life gets it puts into perspective then from there then look up then look up at the whole stars and go man you're just lucky to be experiencing this right to be able to think about this to be this person that's living in the most amazing time ever for human beings may be spinning around on this ball flying through infinity it's nothing but gravy it provides you with with great with like centering balance you know yeah and yeah and man what else you said something that did you know we talked about that people focusing on the minutia oh shit you were saying how it's just it's a sticking point with me it's all is um how you know we human beings primal our primal thought we worry about ya know dangers and stuff like that but man it's amazing how how many people nowadays have relinquished that pride they're their primal defense mechanism you know of like awareness said hmm mobility all that they've like just give up their fat dumb lazy happy button put pushers flaccid and complacent yeah just walking around a forty five-degree syndrome yeah I'm on that bus today going just to go to the rental car place from LAX and everybody's on the phone which you know there's times you could be in the white but I look around I go well it looks like I'm on security right now you know gonna see this or that happened yeah there's a ton of people that are just staring at their phone all day long and not paying attention to their surroundings at all it's not that you need to all the time most of the time you don't but the time when you do boy that could change your life or the life of your loved ones yeah yeah and and mmin around the streets is not the time to do it you know there's a time to be in the white and you know when you know I'm talking about with the white like Cooper's color code white to black white is like zombie mode and that's you know me and my house and my range of panties watching TV or whatever right you know that's the time when your zombie and Opie I'd blow it loud to be in the white where black is you know you're fighting for your life right now it's horrible horrific terrifying but um you know in the streets gotta be at least in the yellow yeah you know just have your wits about you a little bit so let me take you back to when you decided to get your shit together again you decide to get your shit together again you begin the process yep and then how did you get to where you're at now well I am getting laid off was scary as hell but sometime you know when you're in crisis mode like that you you think most efficiently there's a there's a there's a there's a series of things that happen one is you know you get scared to death right laid off scared I think that was the first one scared and then angry and this is over a couple days you know and then focus when I got focused I built my company Tmax I mean I just thought of everything you know I just had one epiphany after us what am I going to call it you know Harlan let me just make up an acronym that sounds cool and it cover all the bases training marksmanship adventure concept security I covered everything team axe and then and then man should just admit I was so frickin fortune because shit fell into place for me I had guys who were who I trained for this corporation called the corporation and say hey we want uh you know Pat Mac to come train us again and they said well he's no longer here but we can have somebody else do it they were like no we don't want somebody else you know we want we don't care what it's called or what you're branding it we want this guy doing it so they were able to get in contact with me it was a big contract and then another one came up and then another one all in the same year his all tactical training yeah and it was all so that year was complete and then I had a bunch of different you know lessons learned like government contracts shit like sequestration remember at 2013 with anyway sequestration so government contracting and stuff like that it all went away you know there was a time and thirteen where I didn't worked for six months you know it's scary when you're working on your when you're doing everything for and by yourself all your own admin or if you're thinking like that it could be it's very exciting but scary shit yeah yeah it's like damn and you know I keep Jay I don't care how much stuff and I having to pipe on my key jam and more shit yeah yeah no but once uh so I had those government contracts then I just I just built momentum and then started learning alright let's get rid of this let's do more of this let's not do focus on that let's focus on this and it grew it grew into a into a very it's like self-fulfilling machine you know it's a it's it's it's it's run and running very well right now but it was not easy getting there I mean there was a lot of bumps and obstacles of the road but I tell guys at all time man any any any road worth traveling you're probably gonna have obstacles in it there's gonna be temptation like shortcuts you know nope stay on that road bro stay on that road go through those potholes go over those freakin bumps this road it's gonna suck but after a while it'll smooth out and sure enough you know my road smoothed out and the bumps are few and far between right now so yeah man I'm I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life probably right now you know 54 years old and it's like I've grown up but that's smart I mean that's if you're a person who's thinking and trying to do better with your life you should be at your best right now yep should be at your best at how you perceive things how you decide to approach things how you look at things so when you're doing these these tactical courses and you're traveling so much that that's very hard on your Bible that's probably one of the hardest things on your body all right all that travel yeah it'll especially so you know I travel with two big cases because I have a gun case in a gear case and you become a travel pro but it still sucks yeah you get up early drive an hour to the airport wait an hour to get your plane take that plane to this place and then you know another plane to this place get in your rental car go to travel with the guns - right yeah well only because it's different in every Airport yeah it's Alaska than used to guns like yeah yeah I'll ask a lying places yep but it's different in every Airport so there's no consistency even though you know I know what the webpage says I know what it says right and I don't they don't know what else I've no idea is that we travel with my bow I find that lax right depending upon who I talk to like some people I go yeah it's a bow what are you doing now my bow hunt they go okay all right it's fine other people like I don't think you can travel with this one I definitely can get you manager right let's go to the website Jesus Christ and you know give myself an extra hour just in case shit like that half and I do that I definitely I give that I I plan for that extra hour just in case I got a piss and moan right but some of them are real smooth you know airports are real smooth others a pain in the deck but people must look at you weird right yeah a little bit I mean they know me at my airport but they're also North Carolina right it's a different animal when you bring something like that to California people like California is not it's not this horrible Second Amendment heaven yeah but it's not as horrible what's the word York oh yeah yeah that you see I like New Jersey New York Connecticut yeah states like that oh Jesus freaky yea they have very strange gun laws there this is just because they've got so much violence they thought that that was the solution yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't know so do you what do you enjoy the most do you enjoy doing the social media stuff do you enjoy doing the tactical training like what do you enjoy doing the most um I like doing I like doing the workout stuff more than anything because I think with that I reach and help more people even if they could be it's a maze it's amazing it's it's like you know I have somebody I don't know how this has happened but I bet I have morphed into this guy who people rely on to motivate them and they tell me bro you're you're motivate in the hell out of me which fires me up is my buddy CJ says what motivates a motivator tell them your motivating them you know so so I love doing that stuff because it touches a lot of people regardless of their age or their physical ability and a lot of guys maybe you know bedridden with an illness or something like that it'll fire them up so I like doing that stuff I think next would be the shooting thing I mean I love it I love her any courses and meet new people I meet a dozen new people every week and from all walks of life and got all different reasons motivations for doing it yep and and guys you know they'll ask me during the classes said they say bro how do you stay motivated to do these and almost every week and I say cuz I get to meet guys like you bro I mean it's as simple as that yeah if you find enthusiastic people you catch and then that helps a lot yep so you know I like to fire people up but I like to get it in return do you find a lot of guys that are also retiring from the military they want to talk to you about this because they're trying to figure out their path a couple of them have hit me up and I am man open arms like let me show you whatever you want to know because I've figured this out so yep I'm your huckleberry it's not many of them but they're bad they'll be you know half dozen a year who will ping me hey I want to get into the training in history right like it's plenty of room for it every guy that I know that's either been SpecOps seal whatever they've been when they retire it's one of the hardest moments of their life yeah it's so hard for them to find some purpose and there's it's hard for them to find roots to just to really feel like they belong again because that life is so intense yeah because you have you know you have meaning yeah I know and it's in it's in it's selfless you're doing something bigger than yourself yeah and so yeah because you want once again if you're just in a if you just find it let's say a Jo be where you're working and maybe even working for the man there's no more there's no meaning there we're not do you're not a part of something bigger than yourself right so I always tell guys hey when whenever you get out when you've you separate especially if you've got you know 20-plus years and that's a long time you are going to be adversely affected no matter how badass you are upstairs you're going to be rest some degree yeah you know it could be a little depressed it could be a lot but if you find something and it could be working for a charity you know whatever if you find something that where you could with impunity go to sleep and look forward to the next day where you say man tomorrow's gonna be freakin awesome I can't wait because I got this project pending and I'm gonna help so many people be better people then if you could do that I mean fine that instead of just you know getting stuck in a rut you know instead of accepting mediocrity yeah but because that meaning but purposefulness and and and selfless being doing something selfless and being a part of something bigger than yourself is freaking huge do they prepare you at all when you're getting ready to retire they say good luck yep sayonara they just figure you're a badass and figure it wow you're making the choice cuz you know I could have stayed in another 10 years or what-have-you so you're doing it you're making that choice why did you decide to leave there was a you know kind of a defining moment I had to do some soul-searching it was all I had 22 years in I lost the couple buds at that moment and I had two little kitties out so I had to do some soul-searching and I thought well will there be will there be will there be any regret whatsoever and I thought man I pretty much I've done at all you know his followers like Special Ops goes I I am NOT gonna have any grits cuz I did that was a big thing you know will I regret this and I said to myself no I won't so you know I I decided to retire with 22 in and it was all special I was very fortunate my whole career was special ops the whole thing um but I did regret it after I'm sure didn't take long it was you know and it got worse every year that pass they got worse and worse as like man I should just well it's got to be so hard even for not just for you but for I mean not just for the soldiers but for the wives yeah like to know that the husband is constantly in these crazy situations overseas constantly in these very very dangerous environments yep the stress of that yeah I I think it takes a special kind I'm both sides you know and usually usually spouses have a pretty good support mechanism to with the units and other spouses and that kind of thing right so yeah usually they're pretty they're pretty tough they get used to it yeah it becomes a way of life and it becomes a normal right yep oh yeah still miss it I'm sure yeah well everyone I talked to does you know have you ever read um Sebastian youngers book tribe oh yeah yeah I just just recently I didn't I I listened to it oh yeah yeah freaking badass yeah I loved it yeah he's great reading it too it's a it's an excellent book yep and it doesn't explain in your eyes I thought he did a pretty good job with that whole thing yep yep absolutely yeah I thought he was pretty much spot-on I was north and south in my head as I was driving down i-95 listening to that book so it's safe to say that you went through this period post-military where you just were really just trying to find yourself again but then you caught it yeah and then you caught it and now you seem like you're in your glory oh hell yeah like I said I really enjoy your page man alright relax yeah it's tense yeah your oh it's and you're also kind of you're a badass but you're fun with it yeah alright good time yeah you know yeah I love doing it I love the both the doing the the YouTube channel and p.m. IG mm-hmm and I put thought you know I I put some thought into it and you might helped you with this stuff yeah she helped me set stuff up I don't know right here this stuff was so we got married we met in 30 like fall of 13 and then the first social media platform I had was Facebook because somebody's posing as me oh that's a lady so in order to report them I needed to get an account and then once I did I friend requested this guy who's post and posing as me in anyway what what I say why was he doing it I figured it out I did some detective work but he was posing as me because he wanted to bash somebody else in the gun industry and pose as somebody credible so this guy that he was bashing contacted me and said hey why are you saying this and I don't talk shit body right so like well I think you got the wrong guy and I said just call me up here's my hilarious yeah and we had a chitchat and he goes oh man I got some bad news for you you do have a Facebook account sent me a link and everything yeah but um so I started that lon I already had a couple YouTube videos up mmm but then um I just went full bore with it you know went went kind of batshit and then the IG was fun man when Rebecca my wife showed me that I was probably I think I think five five years into that and I figured it out you know what my audience wants you know I pay attention to you know that the analytics mm-hmm really yeah yeah only because um yeah because I want to write yeah because I want to give them what they want versus blue what do you get out of the analytics what does it job the the the age group the time of day you know those kind of things but also the amount of views and what's the other work the not views but um the reach so you know what's the it's the videos do the best and if they're short it's like I do a lot of around the combat strength training so I supplement my ebook with little workout snippets hey this is another example of a power thing blah blah blah so I'm putting information in there as well you know I jot down info so make sure you working transfers plain Hama Hama you know Raider force production no speed no power blah blah blah and this could be supplemented with a resistance band instead of a weight mm-hmm so I pay attention to that stuff because that's what people want that's where I get the most feedback guys like growth thank you so much for putting the sound like alright man so um hell you know I know for a fact that I'm helping people or if I put a maybe of course the fire out or talk about specific way to clean up and break down in 1911 mhm you know whatever it's when I put out information it resonates better and it seems that it's more palatable with the with the with the masses of the people who have following me because I get a lot and may I answer all those frickin comments do you really a lot of them I mean I spend how many followers you have on I G a hundred sixty K how the fuck can you possibly answer all those things a lot of them are just but you know hitting the like right and sometime that means a lot to people man it all up guys screenshot and Pat Mac just liked my comment you know but uh it's a couple hours I'll spend I think two hours a day is what I do on the associate like email mm-hmm then I could get to work you know I don't have to fuck with that anymore but you it's usually about that much well your page makes me want to take a tactical course yeah only wanted to do that where would they go they go to my website Tmax ink.com you ever you anyone ever out here in LA yeah I used to come out here all the time the only reason and it's not the gun thing just I'm getting travel-weary man I'm three-hour times don't smoke yeah never go to Australia no I've been invited to do courses there but there's a whole new another thing with training overseas it's you know it's a state department the same thing in high tar sand all that it's a pain in the dick I'm sure so I I'm not trying to blow these guys along here it is take a live CST course oh yeah the CST cool I don't do him live much anymore only because they they didn't they didn't sell in Phil will because people would I think they thought that it was gonna be a beatdown oh you're gonna go and kick the race but it's it's very it's a lot of information and a lot of feel and stuff out right you know so what is it what is a CST course what does that mean well it's basically replicating what I have in that ebook and people say bro put this book in hardcover it's 35 pages man it's not cost productive you know right yeah just download it and print it out would you oh my god what is the CSCS t course would replicate what i have in that book within a day's period okay so it's a good supplement for those who have the book because I do all the classrooms the whiteboard stuff you know you break the workweek down power day strength right speed and quickness hypertrophy skills and then I'll talk about you know eccentric concentric isometric transfers sagittal mm-hmm we're gonna learn all this stuff got NASM you know National Academy of Sports Medicine cuz I wanted to you know it's freaking piece of paper to me six months to get but um I wanted to I wanted to have a piece of paper to write yes and that was the closest thing that I found to what I was putting out and it it was pretty spot-on only mine's way cooler you know it's not like the lame you know health club versus got it right more tactical impractical right yep yeah yep so the class would it basically just encompass what's in the book in a one-day period and now it's more like tangible because see people aren't touching and feeling and seeing it you know these certain exercises first is seeing a picture of it right but there's a lot of good information in that in that book and then I supplement both my youtube channel and IG with all these other little snippets and there's hot man I put out a lot of information I mean a lot so people won't get bored because I don't want people get bored with the workout you know I want him to I'll do it it's teaching him how to cook and then showing them ingredients and now go cook your own meal and you know here's some other recipes throw these throw these ingredients into your into your pot so that's what I do with the social media platform is ice supplement that with you know whatever I'll come up with some dumbass name for some movement that I'm doing II but they're good functional safe low-impact movements that encourage you know that self-preservation longevity and fitness and not brokenness too many oh my god too many guys especially older guys you know doing herky-jerky stuff and and getting hurt in the gym especially when they take a long time off and you forget that their body's 56 not 26 yeah super common yeah so when you if people go to your is is a combat strength training calm so what's called for the CST but that's not for my courses that's right I'm like tactical stuff is T back sink okay is there a link to that from there yeah team X is my that's who I am so T Mac sink and then from there there's all of the server performance yeah you handsome bastard yeah man so this is all like it's got a lot of your videos up there it shows you what you're doing yup and it's got all the courses and it's kind of badass store - man whoo I got some booty on that store so Oh tools Oh get you some so when you're when you're putting all these different workouts together how much how much do they change do the like when you if someone goes to your website and wants to follow your course right the physical stuff yeah oh the the the core workout doesn't change that much the movements do so I break the workweek down into a pouch like Monday for instance power day then strength day speed and quickness hypertrophy skills and then there's a couple because people don't have five days you could lump for instance speed and power you can lump strengthen hypertrophy the so that the gist stays the same power day work in you know anaerobic chunks in circuits and here metabolic special to meet anaerobic go picky five good power exercises make sure that two of them are transverse plane and if they got the book they be able to that which could sustain him for just with that for let's say I don't know whatever months without getting bored but they definitely want to go to like some of the stuff on that I put on the interwebs to help sustain and keep the ideas fresh right because we don't want to fall into that once again that rut of complacent adaptation you know we're doing the same shit over and over and over day by day and too many guys do that right and it's it's not healthy I noticed you incorporate a lot of martial arts stuff to help you were doing some arm drags the other day yep yeah what do you do you just do this for like practical applications in a street fight scenario yes so yeah I got a big fan of different different fight and you doing all this stuff you do it with shoes on because are you gonna be in real life yeah most the time I mean I don't go into our fight room it's you because it's got mats and there it's nice so you know well we will we will we grapple and work even work bags I'm I'm barefooted but usually there's a lot of times I'm working out and these would have gone on to it's just an appendix carry under my teeth so the you keep it unloaded or correct so you know where it's right because it impedes your moving a little bit yep just to make sure that it doesn't impede my move right but just to know where it's at right okay so there's a place where you can keep where you can move yep just as well yeah and so this dude that you're working with he's a wrestler yeah he's good man Randy's good and what is what is he working with you on you just we're not this was this we're not the sharpest right here cuz this was after a power workout were smoked right we're smoked and all we were doing here is just control just stand up for control you know and I used to be a good wrestler but my game is off and because but that was decades and decades ago so Randy's getting in he's training for a a competition and Jitsu competition I think he's it's a it's a kind of a mixed wrestling jujitsu competition I think he's doing the wrestling I'm pretty sure so I said hey bro let's uh let's start mixing it up I want to get back into you know rolling some more because I'm bigger than here so it'll be good for him mm-hm because I'm bigger and stronger than he is so and then it'll be good for me too I'm Thomas that I just do a lot of fight training especially a boxing kickboxing little tentative on getting punched in the face anymore yeah I said for your head the generative spine mm-hmm well your neck did you generative spine so degenerative disc disease right you know this that's very controversial you know a lot of people say that it's a disease but then I talked to physiologist and they say well what it is is pressure on your discs because you're lifting a lot of weights or you're involved in something that presses down on you and then you dis degenerate it's not like a disease that's causing us to go away yeah that that disease air quotes almost always happens in people that are evolved with very strenuous physical exercise yep and so there's different ways you can kind of mitigate some of that stuff do you ever do spinal decompression No now I haven't done that one man there's a harness you goodbye all it's like 39 bucks hang from a door yes I can you pull that click click click click and it stretches sometimes just that alone give you a lot of relief I know I do have an inversion table and that's freaking great I have one of those too yeah those are great and then there's another machine called a reverse hyper that's fantastic for your lower back I'll show it to you outside right now we have one on the other in the gym area but dad also actively decompresses and then strengthens all those muscles around your back as well but these the stuff with the neck too there's another there's a bunch of different things you could do I mean I don't know if you do any neck exercises do you do you fuck with anything oh yeah yeah yeah yeah at least at least once a week and I've got a yeah I always told you try to work your neck manner supports come answer right right right I have to now you you said the it's disc degeneration so you don't want to get choked is that what it is you don't want to get your neck manipulated yeah because like my distal phalanges there's numbness there okay uh you know like sleeping I have to sleep like a corpse there's no rolling or anything just straight corpse so the numbness is indicates or something pressing on your right yeah no no that decompression device will help you along I try it it's cheap too like I said it's like 30 bucks or 39 bucks something like that but that's that sucker man I get in that thing a little bit it feels good just alleviates tension if you could do that every day for a few minutes you know that the inversion table all those things you can keep all that stuff healthy yeah I and it feels good I just don't want to get punched in the face yeah the bunch replace a lot I hear you man I'm not into it either assistant the brain is not designed to get right it was one of the things that I do like about jujitsu more than anything is that you can go hard right and you're not you know you're not hitting each other it's just there's a big difference so you can get a full 100% exertion right exercise workout in without you know risk of hurting each other especially if you go with a good guy yeah and like the guys I work with our pull man fight is way better than mine so they not a train yeah we're not gonna do not get so important so important you know cuz I've been I've been doing fight stuff for a long long time and I've been fortunate that there's always there was always somebody better looking out and say hey let's work this or work you know just weaken just making those tweaks yeah that's what's gonna ask you do you do you do any ground training do you do any - not enough not enough nope and and like I said my coaches are really good but I don't do enough of it I do I don't have a good I don't have a good reason and I just said that to him I just say hey guys I'd have to do more I've got to do more ground stuff they're like right on yeah yeah get in there man yep and it's humbling yeah we'd like to avoid a do you know I mean we I do it but not but not enough right yeah I'm very comfortable on my feet my like my level of confidence on you know being able to punch somebody's mouth loose without them even knowing what happened is it's pretty it's I got I'm pretty confident there you know with with with you know the the likelihood of who I'm gonna right hustle with that's the thing right yeah and and input and plus up you know I have moxie you know I I got a lot of attitude and that goes a long way you know having that that could spa that attitude sometimes it is equally important to have that I have a thing in my head that says I can be anybody anything it doesn't have to be true but that's what I hear in my head the problem with that is when it's obviously that's not true right then you're like fuck yeah now what and then then you get experience experiences so you get shortly after you need it yeah yeah it's it's it's interesting that you combine those things though that you have this gym where there's all this martial arts stuff and then the tactical stuff what do you do to chill out because it seems like everything is fucking Coco Coco Coco everything is lifting weights shooting and pulling ropes and shooting an arm drying and shooting what do you do to calm yourself I am hobby heavy hobby heavy well you show me your drawing yeah I do very talented I side draw a bird watch watch yep I bet a bird watcher since I was 10 years old really yeah Golf I go down this list guitar drums cook let me see I got so many freaking hobbies it's ridiculous but the good thing about most MS I could go to him and and it doesn't take me a lot of time or energy to invest in it fishing on big time fisherman outdoorsman woodsman type of thing I love that stuff I get into the Rocky Mountains at least once a year and do like privation training you know just on my own so what do you do when you do that just camp out there and live off the land yeah I'm trying to yep try try to sustain you know with what I have and what's available to me and it also you do that once a year yeah and it also includes a orienteering so you know one over 24,000 scale topographical map and so orienteer in and these are wilderness areas not like national parks or forest and then try to hunt a killer eat it you know along the way carry I carry enough food so I'm not gonna be miserable mm-hmm so I'm not gonna suffer how many days you doing you know well it it now that I'm retired not four to five anymore yep you like being a rucksack or something yep yep so I pack in yep whatever whenever I need and you know packing a ruck is uh it's a real it's a it's artwork and sure even if you've been in a military forever you know you you just never ever get that down to a perfect science right especially a weight yeah because I got weight you got in terrain you got you know the the situation may dictate to strip this and add that and then were you gonna put it and do you bring satellite phone or anything we do it or you do i up i bring up yeah i bring one of those the smart ones yep roll an ankle out there well plus I usually go to Montana like Bob Marshall so that's boasts the highest concentration of grizzle or 48 yeah so you're not on the top of Fuji manners hungries out there that's a fucking scary spot yeah well it's it's always usually pretty good unless you run into a female yeah with their cubs yeah that's that's when it gets super sketchy I just wrote it I just wrote about that that's not I write so I write for a ballistic magazine and combat handguns and I just wrote an article about that ballistic about what should be in your personal survival kit you know let's say you go on a day fishing trip in Alaska what should what do you have in that thing mmm you know in the event that you need to go into contingency planning mode that shit hits the fan you got to have something on you instead of just your your Orvis fly rod and a couple bead heads yeah it was a big debate with hunters as should you bring bear spray or should you bring a pistol yep especially both yeah smart that I need to anytime bear country I bring both I got them both on and I've talked to a lot of Griz hunters and I put that in that article too so that guy's you know I've done some research here but yeah so I'll bring I'll bring both have you had any encounters when you're out I've had almost every year really the closest one 15 yards man yeah that was the first time ever up there - and I'm smoked I'm at the end this is what I was do I started doing these when we were when I was active so bringing up unit guys and this one was 95 miles long we walk from a little spot on the map Oh Columbia falls south of Columbia Falls Montana to Lincoln the home of Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber reason yeah yeah that's where you live yeah so walk this stretch it's 95 miles right north to south and you gotta cross like three for mountain passes and smoker so this I think it was it was the fifth day because we had one more ro and one more rest overnight and on the fifth day I had a we would walk like lines adrift and stuff like that you know and if whenever I couldn't see 25 yards up ahead me I would you know clap my hands make some racket coming through mark you know that kind of thing yeah because it Grizz want nothing to do with you right you get in between their young their food source or you startle that's when you run into trouble right um so I did not want to stand and Here I am I'm and I've got six guys with me but they're lagging behind and I you know coming through and I look up ahead and this gigantic male stands up booze and the only thing that I could my only reaction was whoa I mean I was just blown think fifteen yards is less distance than you flew when you crash right here right flew in the air so you can fly in the air that's right yep Wow yep he took off boom he was gone chance lucky yeah yeah yeah because that's a lot that's a lot of animal yeah I tell you when you're standing like in the woods in the wild 50 yards 15 50 yards and when that thing stood up that's all I could I mean I had a gun and bear spray on me I wait for you think it's whoa and then when he took off my next thought was where's my camera oh Jesus well that's nature's cleanup crew right there anything the limps falls down fucks up yep that's what it's there for that's why there's a thousand pounds of them man it needs to keep beating yeah it's a it's a majestic animal yeah see one in the wild you you realize like wow like this is just nature has a system yep they know what they're doing when they want to get rid of a moose they send one of these motherfuckers in there yep really yeah so when you're doing these these things are you keeping a journal when you these trips for you by yourself um oh I use go by myself I usually have strap hangers and they're different every year and it's a lot of times just like this you know a couple guys talking saying oh man I'd like to do that with you or just send me an email and I'll send you the dates oh wow because one is securities and numbers right especially in Greece country yeah plus I like teaching stuff so yeah I'll have guys who I could teach like orienteering and you know field craft you know making a fire with some kind of that kind of thing and the right way to maybe to prep and cook a trout you know so you bring a rod with you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah small breakdown rods yep a bring a file I'll bring two I'll bring a tell us telescoping uh Ted cholera and a four piece like a five-way Orvis okay because it's my rod then yeah okay so I am for me that's sustenance because I'm not taking a lot of food plus I want to fish I wanted to be time off right I want a chill I don't want to just work my ass off when I'm on these so I'm out there ripping lips but I'm eating two of them in the morning and two at night and then it's a lot it's a lot of fun I've been doing these things now since 98 I think it's a great way to decompress too but yeah my the places I go to one of them it I will lose SELCO cell phone coverage an hour before I hit the end of the dirt road yep so and then you stop the caller you're at the end of the road now you're you know you're already in you're just at the edge of the wilderness area deep into a national forest right and then into the wilderness for you know however many days miles run another folks in you're out there very rarely the best you know I loved walking like on the 95 mile one and seeing nobody yeah nobody yep I mean those these places are remote the Frank church and yeah Idaho I'd walk the Wind River in Wyoming the the Frank church I walk from the town of salmon to McCall that one smoked me how far is that they did it on a scale things as a crow flies it's not that far I think it's 60 miles or something but it's straight up straight down the the most horrific and just terrifying terrain I mean especially if you're you know if your objective is to move from point A to point B and not just now back let me see how far I can go know when you got somebody picking you up at point B do you have to be there right oh man it's a freakin smoker yeah I've never been in the Frank church but my friend Ryan Callahan was living up there for a long time and school he says it's amazing up there it's also so it's so remote you know but yet it's so close to Boise oh yeah that far right yeah right yeah the grand scale themes things it's not it's not that fall all right but there's when you have these wilderness areas like I don't know let's say it's 500 million square acres or whatever is you know that's also encompassed by national parks and stuff yeah and you know national parks will have dirt roads and I'm and now have little scatterings of population here and there but those will nurseries there's nothing in those yeah they're just animals yeah there's yeah there's no dirt roads and it's such a complete ecosystem to have everything from wolves to Grizzlies to mule deer to elk it's all living up in there yeah and it's it's good they are cool I mean I love doing those too because you have to think there isn't there is an element of danger here that that can kill me and it's not just a big hungry you could get cut Josh or out there because nobody's coming to get you even if you got that beacon you know Forest Service and stuff they're probably busy servicing you know grandma broke a leg trying to take a picture of a bison in this National Park coming into that nashit that will do serie you know there's no HL Z's there it's nothing like that so and you'd I love that that element of danger especially since I retired you know I want to be cold tired hungry and maybe a little scared and I want that several times a year because uh that's you know it's primal right and I think most guys need that Taizo ya know I think so too dude you live in a fun life man yeah and I enjoy following right on appreciate it
