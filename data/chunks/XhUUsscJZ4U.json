becoming a man when he was raised by a woman who was SuperDuper famous and then you like choose it somewhere along the line to to change sex and become a man we think about that shit I think there are

know some people's brains fire incorrect but some people really probably their chemical makeup they should have been about a boy but their girl yeah there's no preconceived yeah they're auditory things that have doing the thyroid if you don't lucky if you don't want to go yeah exactly exactly if you don't want to go through a sex change man that's a goddamn commitment I gotta think you're really telling the truth you might not like you do not just like maybe y'all just go for it yeah I'm not a lot of a long time it's hacked off and they gonna grow me a cock they'll be eventually they'll be able to grow your cock right now they can nothing grow an ear on a mice though I work for I work for us transsexual pre-op transsexual oh I was at a law firm he worked the file room holy shit he only liked fucking straight men whoa what do I feel like very nice timing yeah he said even as a goat he like to face them so we have to put his legs half of them hello oh my god how did you get a straight man to fuck you I'm a woman why wouldn't they oh my god I'm gonna what I gotta fucking them in the ass are they fuck him hey fuck him in the ass and do they know they're fucking him no they just like no I know you're really you're a woman at your heart or something oh my god I have a friend who is gay and he says that gay guys suck is there all the top straight guys rather suffers their own toilet yeah he says it get straight guys to suck his dick yeah says they they act curious they're at a bar somewhere he'll tell them there that he's gay and then they'll be curious before you know they're blowing him he said it happens all the time I'm like that's not a fucking straight guy man you're saying you've got a straight guy to suck your dick you got a gay guy who's in the closet to blow you it's not really a straight guy you know you met him at a gay bar for sure there's certain people have degrees of gay in them you know what we talked about yesterday guys go this new girl - you're dating he's got you so excited you can fuck all the time it's like you connect to her and this this straight sex is like there's a vibe between the two of units like a powerful straight sex vibe I think some dudes can get do is to be gay like you might been really happy with being straight and having a wife and children and you know I'm having like some sort of a weird non exciting sex life unless you met the right gay guy along the way you turned your ass and made you be a super gay freakazoid which is very possible you know if you just I think it sort of the right person the right stage you like I'm not saying you because you couldn't and I'm not - yes you can but you could be on that fence I think those people are already like probably bisexual but hiding it yeah I think they know about it it's like that joke that I used to do about um about people there's somewhere out there there's someone who could talk some people in the suck in the deck and that is just that is just the way it is and it is it's a fact that some people can just be tricked and it doesn't necessarily mean they're gay and I think that's one of the reasons why so many people are afraid of gay people what they're afraid of it's being tricked by a superior intellect that happens to be homosexual and then actually know that guy shooting loads your asshole well it's terrifying for for retards it's dumb people oh it's hard harder to catch it turns out phonetic we have a perfectly ladies and gentlemen we need me no harm okay we're just out here trying to have a good time trying to learn and grow as humans mm-hmm we're doing it all together with Brian read families gentlemen yeah how much more something nothing this is a doctor close my bad professor mailing elimedia how are you don't you know information alien so Brian is midget video quickly changes into a repetitious Veronica Oh up there Georgie own pleasure how are you you're from ancient aliens yeah you never seen the shootout with the crazy I have not what I like they're rolling we got your plug out here for sure gets weird Dissidia don't you love something that's going on right now right Doug Benson my friend hello what the desert I have a feeling it's all our minds I have a feeling the whole alien experience there's all psychedelic chemicals including all the shit that was created but nobody can figure out what the pyramids are all these other crazy structures I think that you guys are down on the money and we talk about ancient civilizations there's talk about like graham hancock like shit that there was some super advanced civilization but I don't think they got it from I think they got out of the drugs and I think the drugs are the aliens and I think when you take those drugs you contact aliens and I'm not bullshit no no you take the NT bro I think your contact Millions I really fucker do after all raped many but in the best way ever when I think that like someone who saw through me and sees me for this really insignificant like style of creature you know really like mundane and really easy to solve and figure out it just exposed me and then expose me to infinite wisdom that was impossible to grasp but it did it all in some sort of language I think that is the alien I think the alien is psychedelic chemicals and we know that there's a great history of human use of psychedelic chemicals dating back thousands and thousands of years mushrooms draw on cave walls you know all the evidence of ritualistic use of cannabis contains thousands and thousands of years BC so if we know that they knew about all this shit we know that they knew about the aleena mascara brush you know and in the Amazon they've been doing ayahuasca for thousands and thousands of years they don't even know how long because they don't even write down they just always have done it that's the alien bro that's the alien the alien is these compounds and the aliens are real because these compounds allow you to get to this other place they allow you to communicate with something and that's why all these people are abducted in the middle of the night man they're dumped in the middle of the night essentially brain is producing DMT that's in your brain series of psychedelic chemicals and when your brain produces those chemicals it opens that gateway and you communicate with these fucking things we just want everything real to be someone said this I think was trans McKenna that people have a problem was something that's real that you can't hit with a hammer right and I think that's a real way of puttin it it's a real engine because farts are real as fuck dude you can't wrap your hands around them but you know they're real sound is real but we accept it because we're so used to it the idea of this invisible thing can could transmit music and harmony and and beautiful feelings and make you fucking pumped up and you're in your car sing it up and what the what if fuck is that is invisible shit an invisible shitting but it's coming from fucking satellites down to us we want to think that we've got the whole world figured out we want to think that we know what's real and what's here and that all the weakened sense is all that is there I say fuck that I say that's ridiculous and I say if you look at some shit that your own brain produces and this shit that your own brain produces it produces profound visions and incredible experiences I got to think that that shit is the Ale that's what it is it's not dudes and metal crafts that are coming from outer space it's a fucking fine that you mix with a leave and you boil it and this fire in the Amazon for fucking 10 hours and then you drink this shit and go on a ride with a flying circus fucking twist around you and they're all made out of light you know they teach you about the spirit world and your ancestors and that everyone's around you all the time always in forever they just move in and out a different frequency that's the Ale some fucking to stick up thing on your ass dude that's all everybody's crazy so all the people you're talking to show are fucking crazy I think I got a show that everyone's misunderstood and everyone's crazy and they've all had experiences but what you need to do is get him high on DMT then go gasps that's it that's it that's it show you a videotape and you smoke some shit with on board you understand what's happening here it's not here that's why you're never going to see them all that shit flying over London you're never going to see it so that's what I'm thinking about bailing unfortunately that kills the whole show yeah so let's keep speculate friends thank you all very much for coming out before I come up I got a bunch of good friends with me I got Doug Benson in the
