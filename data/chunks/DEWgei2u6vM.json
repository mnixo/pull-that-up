bring you in because they he's the hero if he brings in the celeb and then you get to bang the wife they probably headshots on the wall of all the other guys who fucked her she was not telling me to

coronavirus asian yeah some fucking rubber gloves used to wash dishes with like what what am I doing here what am i touching yeah yeah maybe a laser pointer just to fuck with him yeah they had well they used to have those I've never been to an actual sex club in LA but uh buddy mine has been to one and he said they'd you know you'd go into this room and all these like weird red lights red light bulbs and everybody's banging everybody you know yeah well give her watch those dancing bear videos no oh oh pull it up he's gonna get wood I can't it's called CFN cfnm clothes female naked male and it's so hot because it's the woman in charge and it's a bunch of dude strippers who come in with bare hats on like bare mats and they're in a speedo and they just start dancing eventually they're getting blown their fucking Li of a chicken from accounting and banging Deborah from sales and it's like kind of owe me do curling women getting railed by these studs great because they like it and they keep the masks on oh yeah you guys keep the mess oh well that's it just because it's a anonymous it's hotter it's just a fuck object oh right so the woman can like flip the switch and yes and detach and just enjoy the physical pleasure of it and it's like a bachelorette party or an office party or something and it's it's killer it's always in a like an office setting or something just she doesn't have to look in the eye of the the man and feel shame and weirdness yeah and when the women are turned on it's so much hotter you know because I always see all day is like dudes like come on let me fuck ya but when the woman's taken charge it's it's better you know you feel better about your what you're watching yeah they get jaded though I used to know some guys from martial arts they used to do male stripping and they get real jaded together really yeah a real weirded out by it after a while that makes sense women screaming at you yeah a lot of ladies look at the cheat on their man right right and maybe the first day it's fun but after a while you're like huh and then this is somebody's aunt the other thing comes is that guys want to hire them guys want to higher than the strip and then they have to make these decisions like okay it's funny when gay guys around a guy turns in like the woman mmm respect me yeah you know yeah the roles are reversed well it's a tall guys rise being a problem it's it's always good it's always guys being a problem you should see my DMS man it's just ball sex and grilling jerkin and gay dudes like hot dudes sometimes we're just like hey the things I would I would drain your asshole and listen man oh yeah I find it flattering why do you think they're going after you I think I got a Twinkie otter vibe you know otter that's one of those gay terms to get otter bear I knew about bear yeah there's a bunt the game oh you know them all as a whole like zoo what's an otters like a thin medium-sized guy like the little guy would be like a twink I don't know what Brad Williams would be he'd be like a like a Hershey's kiss or something koala bear there you go yeah he does have chlamydia but yes others have comitia oh yeah true story imagine that's where comitia came from somebody had a fucker koala bear well apparently we got aids from a monkey so maybe koala gave us Clem it'd do you know where that actually comes from it's not from some fucking a monkey there's a right knows of someone who hunted a monkey handjob no cut the monkey and cut his hand and got monkey blood in his hand while he was like butchering a monkey oh that makes more sense yeah cuz who's fuckin a monkey David Chappelle had a bit about a hundred percent infection rate hundred percent wild fucking that is insane while koalas have a hundred percent infection rate of chlamydia for two decades scientists have brought wild koalas into wildlife hospitals to treat their chlamydia can we get into I've avid chlamydia is six times in my life can we give them a penicillin shot well they'd have to go grab all of them well you know they're they're really in deep deep trouble because the wild fires in Australia they said that they're something like 80% of their habitats been destroyed the fuck is the fires over they're insane I did a benefit Sunday night with Monty Hoffman Armani Franklin rather Whitney Cummings and Jim Jeffries oh I did a benefit for the wildlife fires Jeffries must be getting his door knocked down with that shit oh I'm sure yeah well Monty Franklin's Australian as well uh-huh it was a double Australian double American card oh boy wild yeah it was a fun show but when you you see the devastation it's crazy seventy percent of Australia is covered in smoke Wow seventy percent and it's as big as the United States ah that's a bummer yeah it's crazy and they basically have no way of stopping it I mean unless the rains put it out or it all the way to the coast yeah it's a stupid question but what is the money gonna do you know I know it helps people for wildlife ah the money is all for wildlife too for a lot of them have been burned like they had a little bit of a presentation I'll you know I mean some of them they've rescued and they have to put them back into suitable habitat and that's that's the money's going to a while I mean you're not gonna fix the fucking the devastation by the fire now terms of like the the plants and the houses and stuff like that I mean you can only hope those people their homes burnt down had some sort of insurance but how much fucking insurance money is there yeah so many houses got wrecked yeah how many what is the number now how many houses have been burnt to the ground in Australia currently yeah because all you hear about is the animals yeah well it's a billion animals that's why a billion animals Wow so this will be in history books yeah oh yeah oh boy just think about a fucking billion animals are dead from a fire I mean that's insane yeah I like to change the ecosystem oh for sure though they ecosystem over there is weird anyway oh they got spiders that kill birds yeah there's a bunch of shit that's not supposed to be there - oh really yeah this is like so many of their animals are invasive species what about the Aborigines because they live in huts and shit right yeah I mean what I'll think about that they're fucked ye I don't think they live in huts for the most part I think a lot of them live in normal communities you probably did Crocodile Dundee that's all I know that narge Barker they have so many different languages the Aborigines do that they could go like 20 miles away and not have any idea what those guys over there saying yeah Wow most of those languages aren't even written down apparently really yeah my buddy Adam green trees from Australia and he runs a mining company and they hire a lot of the folks that are Aborigines and you know he's gotten to be very close with a lot of them and kind of gotten to know their culture and to understand their culture and it's really really strange like yesterday like they're scattered all over the country and so many of them have they call they call the mobs like the tribe as a mom mm-hmm and they have a different language then another mob that's like 30 miles away are they dangerous what do you like do they fight each other and stuff I don't know let's go question yeah I don't know guy went to Australia for the Melbourne comedy fest and I was bummed at how not different it was it's not that different from America yeah no Melbourne is real close right antastic food great food great plays great people that laugh lounge is awesome too yeah yeah good Club right Club Reaganomics over there too very into it yeah although they didn't like the dark stuff I noticed yeah well I think there's it there's so much excuse me there's so much that coffee man that tumeric is going right up my ass Laird Hamilton superfood oh yeah I'd love to watch him masturbate but yeah that those Compton audiences there were very tense when I got dark really I think is they have some real racial problems and reals like they're kind of behind the times a little bit on stuff so I think they're like hey look that shit's happening like we're not laughing at yet oh right right okay well you know in the 1950s just I mean not that long ago they were actually taking average no babies from the parents and trying to raise them yeah that's a good intent it should have probably asked first oh-ho they just took them I don't know I don't really I'm not that informed but some Australian people were trying to explain to me like how the relations are very very fucked up right yeah Wow so the Aborigines get their baby stolen by hongki's and I don't know in a weird way the moms got to kind of be like well it's a better life I don't think so yeah they get a TV she misses her mom yeah I guess you're right she misses her daughter I don't know man it's not good okay either way donate it's just chlamydia yeah what is uh so how many how many houses have been burnt down do they even know I probably don't know exactly I saw one thing that said in New South Wales alone there was 3,000 houses but another thing said that that was the number so I don't know if it's 3,000 total understand that that's not too bad area it could be worse yeah 3,000 I mean there were 600 last year just in Malibu oh shit I forgot about that damn yeah Oh the fires the water can fuck your fire can fuck yeah everything can fuck yeah that's crazy how long do we stop saying that's fire that's gonna be insensitive after a while yeah everything's gonna be inside well if we let people let the walk Brigade keep taking my words we'll be down - grunts and pointing at things because if you gotta if you keep progressing yeah something's gotta everything everything goes everything goes eventually and then even grunts and pointing at things will be offensive to people who are deaf we use sign language right now your culture appropriating from sign language people I was driving here on the highway and I thought man the the carpool lanes insensitive to lonely single people like what you'll have a friend I don't know a guy you get an electric vehicle you can ride in the carpool lane is that right yes there's a loophole for the losers out there oh it's one of the best reasons to have a Tesla yeah get that fucking left leg baby so many Tesla's in this town this is such a wacky backwards la-la land over Chipotle's got a fucking valet in LA yes I went twice today but I love Chipotle but it's wacky it's wacky man I mean it's so beautiful never cell but I went to Fox lot and it's all these good-looking girls with their shoes kicked off laying on a picnic table drinking a coffee I'm like you don't know what you got whore this amazing respecting any gratefulness and appreciation no they don't I should enjoy the day she's going on my phone is not working fast enough New York we're all up each other's asses around on my dick it's five degrees outside my apartments the size of Jay Moses all I'm fucked Wow and these gals are kicking their feet up whose jmo oh you I'm sorry if I was a new girl that I don't know about oh do it lady right my favorite video in New York is the rat that's killing the pigeon Jefferson ever saw that oh I saw a pizza rat yeah Pizza rat ate shit on pigeon killing rat the fucking rats killing a pigeon well that's like the woke brigade yeah very similar taking the pigeon down and and attacking and the pigeon tries to flood away and the rat fucking chasing I didn't know rats are predatory yeah I thought they were mostly just scavengers yeah I didn't know they would actually go after a live thing and attack it and kill it yeah desperation man was it was it in the subway area or is it on the street I think it was on the street cuz I don't think pigeons actually go into the subway a good point for the most part it might get fucked over and they never get out seen seen a few in an airport before oh here it is so here's this this pigeon and this rat is crazy bitch-ass pigeon though like come on flap it out they have some big fucking teeth these kunti rats you know they never got by the neck look at that they'll never stop growing rats teeth really yeah they have to keep that's why they're always known because they're partly it's filing them down give it a good Jesus I know many more animal facts then I obviously do remember that now that you bring that up look at this fucking thing and though the pigeon gets away at one point slightly right there oh yeah but look at them chase it down over here pigeons so damaged he can't get away totally can't fly oh so eventually he drags it through the hole in the fence and fucks it up that's hilarious when you go into their lair and the pigeon knows that he's like I can't get off the street okay it's mounting him it's got his back his head that's like khabib yeah very similar holy shit can't get away he's smashing you I said I just didn't know they killed things yeah I thought they only just ate stuff that was laying around but there's so much food in New York City they were just running around eating everything right they eat each other do know that oh really I do know that because I had a try are you I lived in Encino and I was renting this house in the house on a lot of rats and leave my garbage in the garage and you know put it out in the morning and I was seeing these rats someone set a trap not mice rats fucking rats big rats so I hear snap so I go out to check and there's a fat boy that's got his head crushed in this trap I mean he's dead as fuck so I'm like okay I'll just get in the morning I don't want over there right now yeah so I get up in the morning and the only thing that's left is the tail Oh everything they'd everything there was the feet in the tail though all the guts the body the spinal cord everything it was just like a stain and the tail rat tails are so disgusting that even rats any practice there's a lesson there you hear that rednecks yeah here's the move you get you poison a rat then get it in the trap then they eat the rat then they get poisoned that could be something yeah you could but the problem with poisoning rats is a lot of times it doesn't kill them immediately and then coyotes get it and then they get poisoned and then mountain lions till the poison coyotes or they kill the rats right so ours also get killed by rat poison it's real problem with owls because a lot of people leave rat poison outside their house and then the rats eat the poison they get weekend then owl comes in and eats them certainly life circle of life damn did you you lived in New York yes you had mice I'm sure oh yeah yeah I lived in New Rochelle though I never lived in the city I couldn't afford it's right next to the Bronx okay yeah that was my smash oh yeah mice are everywhere they're brutal and they really I'm so scared of them I know it's like a wussy thing but when they're running around I just jump up on the table yeah I can't handle it's brutal I have to call it like a masculine friend to help me mmm even when they're on the trap screaming I don't know what to do I take a broomstick I stick it to the sticky trap and then I go outside and put in the garbage can just while they're still alive yeah so you let them just suffocate out there yeah yeah that's on them you figure it out it's a weird system right the ecosystem of rats and mice and humans hmm it's a strange thing yeah there's a lot of them and they've killed us with the plague apparently that was all rats what's the fleas really filiz from I think Crimea came over on boats attached to rats and then the rats got ran through Europe and fucked everybody up cry me a river I love words did you ever see the Netflix documentary called rats oh my god you have to I don't know one who have to it's you you just go what first of all they all have diseases oh yeah all of them I mean you just don't come in contact with them but if they bit you like you're fucked most rats are fucked yeah I did all these tests on rats and different parts of the country too and New York City is I think they said it's either the number of rats is the same as the number of people that live in New York City or the biomass I'm not sure which one but both of them are equally terrifying yeah if it's the biomass it's actually more terrifying right because it means there's so many rats that's the same mass of bodies as your of humans but I don't think they really know I mean there's any fucking surveyors down there in the subway how do they know also if you measure the weight of all human beings and all ants it's even yeah I know that I love a fun fact that's a weird one right yeah answer freaky too man they said if an ant was our size it would be faster than a Ferrari whoa give it a goat whoa yeah Kalen at one point in time bryan callen wanted to be what is it what's the type of person who studies entomologist is that let phrases right etymology is words entomology is study of insects oh yeah and so he did some time in the jungle oh and they were they'd have to put turpentine all over the posts of these platforms that the tents would be on because there's so many ants on the jungle floor that you who said he was lying in bed you could hear the answer you could hear them walk in sync yeah and when they get on something there's so many of them yeah they just kill they kill elephants come on they climb up the elephant's body and go right into its ear and just start eating its brain man what can an elephant do take a goddamn thing you can do is really close to a giant river and it could jump in and try to drown those little cuts oh right brutal brutal it's a ways to go we've we've lived as human without had we survived primitively well we got lucky but then we got smart and when we got smart then we started overpopulating yes and we figured out all these different ways that nature was kind of keeping our bodies in check keeping our numbers in check mm-hmm you know like we like we have systems for rats and mice and all these different things to keep them in check well nature sort of had a way to keep humans and predators diseases starvation injury so you're saying we beat nature we beat nature which is probably why we're so fucked up mentally because we're not supposed to beat nature well we're a little too safe for sure for sure we're all contained in these buildings where the no predators can get us we all get doughy like little fucking human water balloons right and one cling of discomfort and we we have to fix it work on it bitch yeah we complain yeah we're getting our jaw shaved down to look prettier digging through rats in New York they don't know how many there are their system attitude of 250,000 and tens of millions but this is a new trap that was put out in Brooklyn this is a video of them I guess testing it it's an alcohol trap where they'd fall into this bucket of alcohol and they drowned and they heard the video that's why I'm showing if they open up these buckets touch these things I wouldn't trust it with just little rubber gloves on I know I know so there's just full of dead rats for something for fuel yes yeah burn them to heat your house might as well yeah why can't they look at them it's good size yeah decent size right like at least feed jungle or what do animals or something right like I did snake yeah right yeah you gotta use it Buffalo but you know the corona virus that Wuhan coronavirus rivers they think that came from snakes ah maybe that was that's what happened in China maybe they fed a fucking rat to a snake and right and you know Jed's a millionaire Jamie actually has a conspiracy theory about that you know make this up I know you say you have one I mean I'm not saying that's like you've been putting mine in my back pocket of conspiracy what is the conspiracy theory was that there's some sort of a bio weapons thing yeah I'm so glad I never got bitten by the conspiracy bug Ohio laughs oh look no interest of most dangerous pathogens on earth was done time well the Chinese have always got something cooking there ahead of us in a lot of ways every way maybe comedic li we got them yeah and we don't even know because we don't speak their language ah that's a good point maybe they're comedies like because of the language structure maybe they're comedies way better well they got more words and letters and characters but I've been over there to their comedy clubs in Shanghai and they weren't good China built a lab to study SARS in Ebola and Wuhan and the u.s. biosafety experts warned in 2017 that a virus could escape the facility that's become key and fighting the outbreak oh but wait a minute what is this article from The Daily Mail I just found the best headline in Daily Mail's a wee bit suspect glad yeah Lee bit suspect a little bit outrageous with their captions a little bit click bTW well everything's click baiting now they kind of have to be mad I mean that's how they make money sure but where's the integrity how do you sleep at night they sleep on a pile of money yeah the website for it Academy of Sciences large research infrastructures per user surface but not translated from Chinese oh I guess yeah Wow hmm Wuhan national biosafety laboratory look they have an award look we have an award when people stand by a war it's like look look we are better yeah like that's a weird picture right to people standing there holding an award yeah look what we won right I'm flossing I do you don't do corporate gigs anymore well I did one over the holidays because I had like seven of them they pay amazing I'd wear a tuxedo I did a pharmaceutical awards I got fired within 15 minutes hours such queefs over there it's a ballroom round Abel's tuxedo beautiful hotel in philly they got me a limo out there crazy money and I was supposed to you know like Ricky Gervais stole thing you know be an awards guy presented talk to him have a speech and I just did my clean act that you act I used to open for Seinfeld and a lady got offended and it happened to be the CEOs wife oh and she pitched him out and then he bitched me out and they fired me Wow yeah anyway I got paid when yeah but it's just disheartening you go hey you twats these jokes have worked on The Tonight Show what do you want yeah The Tonight Show is pretty - squeaky pre squeaky well how far like how far along where you said fifteen minutes in your act will you ramping up the offensiveness no well it I do fifteen minutes of jokes out of the gate like to open it and then you do the awards for the whole thing's like two and a half hours and I had a stack a car it's like try so but debe do wins her best whatever muscle relaxants so what did the guy say to you when he fired you he said my wife is offended how dare you it was offensive to women I did a joke about vibrators and he was like you got to get out of here like that's a woman I know I was the joke is how the vibra is better than me you know like I'm I think she was looking for something maybe they haven't fucked in six years you know that's it's always some deep-rooted thing and she's drinking and she's on adderall and she's laid off with his head do that I'll just fire him exactly and firing me is like a fun Power Move you know again look what I can do look at the power I wield right and then she tells all her friends you know I fired the commedia exactly what a piece of shit yes my Norman don't ever go to a show can't tell how many emails I got hey I thought you were funny when you're coming to helium I'm coming I couldn't laughs my boss you know when I was like god you idiots have some balls living in that world man that corporate world yeah like you're all drug dealers you sell drugs and you're mad at me for making a yucca MUP I don't get it we're all backwards priority wise like you make a coronavirus joke nobody cares you make a kobe joke and you're the devil but it's like way more people died with corona i'm not saying either one is fun person person you know the gues individual person plus is the cult of personality famous person well-loved right right and died with his daughter and they're dying it's like six other people there's like a lot of I guess you're right but it's not all fascinatingly cuz the your body knows immediately you know oh that was too far that's fine well what's in that something that Stalin said that one death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic oh well like that is that Stalin it was Stalin or someone in World War two I think it was Stalin but it's yeah we we get lost in numbers like yeah but someone says like the universe is 14 billion years old you like okay what is that yeah exactly I can't do that right that's in my head and it's just like yeah bunch of zeros also Kobe was here and China's a zillion miles away right now that's in your backyard kind of thing well here's a statistic you probably didn't know 50 people die every year in swimming pools oh just the United States that seems gotta be more than that no fifty and we're getting better five zero but every day well how about gun deaths I bet a swimming pool is more dangerous than a gun in the home oh yeah but I think 50 people die every day from guns said every year you mean every day I say every year 50 in LA alone yeah I need more coffee yeah every day Thank You Jamie fifty a day fifty a day in America's why don't hear another good one yeah hundred fifty people die every year because coconuts fall on their heads oh that's a cartoon that's classic you just picture that lesson coming up you know I think that's worldwide though yeah that's great I mean how do you do the funeral for that one you just go well what are you gonna do coconuts uh coconut man and well those really tall trees sure you know it's a big one in New York they AC falls on people Oh Jen's big one rice that happens all the time oh fuck man yeah oh my god and cows killed more people than sharks a year really sharks it's almost like black people where it's just sexier to talk about it you know but the cows are actually the ones killing more people cows kill more people than sharks give it a goog yeah the coconut thing might be an exaggerated no you shut your mouth shut your mouth there's a whole Wikipedia yeah I've gone through that yeah they don't really know some days people get better at it they were helmets they avoid the trees some years why not wear a helmet every day yeah well they're probably poor and they want to coconut yeah it's a good point if you're trying to climb a tree into coconut just nails you halfway down and then you fall that's a double whammy good point yeah splat it feels like a 70s arcade game you know if you're seeing those guys climb to trees fuck man those guys get up high two days and they're basically just clinging yeah and pulling themselves and clinging and pulling themselves right I saw a video of these guys in the Amazon climbing trees it's like what the fuck they were kids they were like twelve year old kids and were 200 feet in the air Wow just shimmy in their way up this tree like god damn unbelievable I wonder if they'll evolve differently cuz they it's a different muscles well you know what it is their feet are much stronger and they're they look different oh really see what happens when people walk barefoot like in the jungle oh yeah their feet spread out right fingers spread out like hands ah they feel it really weird man they splay out yeah our feet are like our feet are like they're in a cast yes my shoes all the time but their feet actually go out in directions it's like their big toes point left and right yeah and then everything else sort of goes out like when you spread your fingers behind me some jungle bare feet cuz it's it's creepy I was uh taught this by my friend Steve Rinella who went to Guyana and was hanging out with these people in the jungle and he was like you can't recognize their feet it's like what is going on with your feet like they're unrecognizable yeah because like it that's their feet look at that oh wow and that crazy it's crazy it looks like a webbed foot like a duck's this is the Amazon tribe that kills and eats monkeys well you should say all Amazon tribes that have access to monkeys because apparently they love bunkies uh-huh but yeah look at his feet man but let go to that one picture look look at that that is insane man Wow it's because they're always gripping the surface of the ground so they develop all this strength and and thickness like look how thick their toes are right doesn't that left-side monkey looks like it's got its dong it's like perfect positioning it's real weird right there look a lot like when you see primates other than that you know the primaries have that little thumb right you know what'd be interesting is to cut one of them open and then cut you open how much more shit you would have in you because you eat all this process I mean you eat still pre pretty well but they've never had caffeine they've never had a drop out but never had a cigarette never had a hamburger they would be just be pink I bet a lot of monkeys though oh it's all natural yeah yes step for the AIDS I don't think he got aids from those monkeys okay thank you Africa I think it's actually I think it's chimps more than monkeys it's so weird though the feet that's crazy yeah there was a great radio lab episode patient yeah it's awesome podcast but on patient zero where they were trying to figure out what who like how did HIV come from like who was the first person get it and they think they now narrowed it down to a farmer or a hunter rather that it killed because they help they do something called bushmeat and a lot of these really poor areas where they basically just shoot everything and like just chop it up and whatever you know whatever you can eat right whether it's a monkey or a giraffe or whatever the fuck you kill sure yeah those are tough people those naked and afraid's even I'm like I don't know if I could do it they get in afraid they can kiss my ass those people probably get all kinds of crazy fucking parasite yeah bug bites and food poisoning they eat berries and pond water and shit dick fish should swim up your dick hole you know that's real no yeah there's there's certain there certain especially in the Amazon if you urinate in the water in the Amazon there's certain little tiny fish they're actually attracted to the smell and the temperature of your urine and they'll fly up the old pee hole and make their way into your yeah can you pee it out while it's going up think you can look at that those are cock fish fish swims up your urine stream oh yeah little fucker can do or something yeah and look he's got teeth look at him on the left-hand side of the mouth he's just chewing away it looks like a dick he's trying to blow you from the inside you ever gonna hold Chinese torture where they get you hard they hammer a glass spike into your dong and then they break it so then you piss that's a Chinese torture that's what I heard how they get you hard ah ways you know you bring a lady in or a small boy you know you do what you got to do or a pile of money be exactly what a whirlwind you're in huh strange strange to watch it take place because it's so it's so obvious what it is it's I know they're using me to make him look bad that he supports me or that he used my endorsement right I had no idea they were gonna do that either the Bernie Sanders people just and all I said is I'm probably gonna vote for him I said I like tulsi gabbard I really love her or love him I love Andrew yang those are the people that I think like and here's here's a really important point I'm a fucking moron if you're basing who you're gonna vote for on president for president based on mine right like what I like I know I'm not I'm not that balls deep into this stuff yeah it's not it's not I'm not the guy very strange and this is a little out of left field but how much of this is based on your look if you weren't a muscular bald-headed white guy I don't know if this would be a bet this would be a different game what's easy to paint me as a douchebag right and also it's what's really funny is the thing that I said in the video was exactly what they did I said if you just take the worst aspects of someone take out everything else magnify it right and you know you could paint them out to be a real piece of shit core so I had 10 texts today but I said is that it's hard to do that with Bernie because he's really consistent guy he's the real deal he being out on the front lines in the sixties with the civil rights right getting changed yeah people and getting arrested yeah right he was um that doesn't mean he's gonna be a great present no don't worry I don't know what's required to be a president I really don't and I don't understand what's required to make sure the economy functions correctly and also I don't understand what's required to make the military function correctly no it's just guesswork I mean maybe we're better off with Trump maybe we're better off with someone else I don't know but what was fascinating to me was that these people like fuckin CNN printed something saying that I was homophobic and transphobic and there's a clip that they're using that's completely out of context that is the only look is first trans people of some trans people listening this I got nothing but love for you for everybody and in fact Eddie Izzard is one of my all-time favorite games I love visit and he's one of the most inspirational and brilliant people and I've ever met I love that guy and he's probably one of the most public trans people in the first most public celebrities to go trans I don't care no but this had to do with fighting this had to do it well this was what I was saying and the video that they're using is me saying you're a fucking man definitely shouldn't use those words but this is why I was upset there was a guy this person was a man for 30 years transitioned to become a woman for two years and then started fighting women in MMA and didn't tell them that she used to be a man ah and was smashing girls she literally broke this girl's skull like broke her face and was kind of bragging about it like she was you know she was hyping up her MMA career right yeah and then people found out that she was a trans woman and she used to be a man and she said that she didn't have to disclose that because it was a medical procedure nothing to do it wasn't their their business very shady I was like bullshit and now here's the thing if she disclosed it and everyone knew I'm 100% in favor of it you want to do that if you're a woman and it's your choice to fight a trans woman and see how you do and in fact a woman who eventually went and fought the UFC a girl named Ashley Evan Smith who's a really good fighter like you know UFC caliber fighter unlike this other woman who was the trans woman that trans woman is just really strong she wasn't the same calibers of world-class martial artists Ashlee evans-smith actually wound up beating her oh yeah yes and then she fought in the UFC afterwards aha can we see a photo of this girl it's not oh I couldn't tell masculine woman okay no well when he was a dude he looked like a guy right bro yeah and then when he became a woman he looked you know like oh yeah definitely you could say was a woman a dude lady but I you know I was like get the fuck out of here you're a fucking man and so they take it out he's so transphobic like not I'm not listen most people get hurt this has only to do with athletics that's it in terms of your gender identity and who you are what you want to do I don't care and specifically my wheelhouse which is fighting there is a gigantic physical advantage that men have in that in that particular sport well we all know that when a guy hits a girl in the street there's a different vibe than when a girl hits a guy that's the problems that's what the fights looked like a guy hitting a girl damn and he's you know also fighting people that aren't that skilled it's a low level MMA promotion mm-hmm you know and then when it came out there was all this outrage but what was really fascinating was how many people were mad at me but didn't have an equal amount of there was there weren't equally upset that this woman was deceptive well you can't doubt the fact that she was trans it's bad for the cause there are you mean supportive transgender people it's very bad for the cause if you have a transgender woman that doesn't disclose she's transgender and is beating the fuck out of biological women and here's the big well here's one of the big problems with it ultimately the ones who get fucked over our biological women in this whole race to be woke and including transgender women in female sports biological women are the ones getting fucked over these trans women are winning World Records and and becoming world champions and it's you know it is this it's where the rubber meets the road between pragmatic objective people that are analyzing the all of the facts and people who want to stick with a woke ideology they don't want to hear it on the other side so this is the big one that people are calling me out on the other one is like the homophobia one is like come on man look I have nothing but love for gay people nothing but love I love gay people but I make fun of them I make fun of me I make fun of my mom I'll make fun of you when you're here I'll make fun of you when you leave cher doesn't mean I don't love them all right like I was saying before one of my most popular memes online is in support of gay marriage and it was it says if you if you hate gay marriage it's because of one or two reasons either you're dumb or you're secretly worried that dicks are delicious and that has been shared fucking millions of times in fact I had a gay strongman in here I saw that yeah and he was a world strongest gay and he was talking about Rob care and he was talking about how hilarious he thought that was and he had seen that it's one of the first exposures that he had to me yeah well they're just looking for shit at pintia that's all its to it's to marginalize him and it's also people that don't want anyone who's not woke to represent anything on the left yes you're gonna be on the left there's a lot of people look at something first of all I should say this before I say anything about the blowback the positive side like the support that I've gotten from people because this has been overwhelming and really heartwarming from soulmates from great comics and scientists and people that have had on the podcast Psychology Today wrote an article about how the media is gaslighting you on me yeah like they're like they're trying to paint this guy out to be this monster like have I said stupid shit a hundred percent I've done 1400 Plus podcasts a lot of them high like a giant percentage of I said a bunch of stupid shit I couldn't even believe while saying it I'd like to say inappropriate words I do it all the time why because it's fun yes we're comics it might hurt some people yeah but some people like it I like I like saying words you're not supposed to say sometimes but it yeah it doesn't mean I'm homophobic or racist or sexist or misogynistic or transphobic these things aren't true I love everybody like literally if you're a nice person I love you yeah I'm cool with everybody the weird thing is they want it to be true why it's not even about the justice or helping people it's about nailing a guy down it feels more like vindictive and we want to hurt you then it does let's save the world it's more like if you go I'm actually not they go yeah whatever well there's a couple things going on one this podcast gotten way too big and it actually can influence elections oh that's real that's do you like that that's not good I don't think I wanna have anything to do with politics no but I'd rather talk to you okay talk to someone like you they never talk about this shit and have politicians on and I've never know whether or not they're full of shit or not I've never I don't know anything about politics I don't follow it people are obsessed it's taken a for too much time in your day it burns too many calories that people get so a passion about it it's all changing and it's all silly I would love if they revamp the system and made it so there was a like a Council of really smart people yes get to decide on things think-tank yeah it's the smartest people are not the most likeable and get them fed um given at least a micro dose of mushrooms before they make their decisions I mean Obama hated gay marriage but we all like him I was against it he was doing that for political reasons because he was trying to attract a certain amount of people that were on the right and it's it's a ploy right they have to play their hands carefully they're playing chess what he gave up all he could have swayed the leg I mean he was in charge of shit so he could make policies well Hillary Clinton would didn't believe in gay marriage till 2013 there you go but it's weird it's but it's not real it's there in their world what it is the world of politics they're giving up a pawn they're making a concession right and so what this is is take me down to make Bernie look bad because Bernie dared to post one of my videos in the meantime bernie is surged to number one in the polls oh is that right he's number one in the polls and number one for the first time in the betting polls uh-huh so it's like look I don't know if it's good or bad well it's like Chappelle everybody hates Chappelle he's the transphobic guy of the year whatever he's won the Grammy three years in a row for Best Comedy I'm and he just won the Mark Twain Award so it's like we talk a big game and we complain and bitch and moan but I think the the real shit's out there well even more more telling when Rotten Tomatoes only read 500 critics judge his special he had a zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes then when they let the general public do it jumped up to 99 percent yeah it's just fucking unheard of I know and why does anybody go this is weird right I mean we do it but you know the the people with the big voices and the loudest people are all going oh they never saw that shit well right now you are one of the last people yet and here's the other thing that those people that are of the other loudest people out there are all being employed by giant companies now if you're a part of a giant media company we don't even have to say any names you have to make arrangements with political parties and candid dates they will give you access to candidates but they will in exchange they would like you to run certain stories you would like you to cover things they would like you to not cover other things I mean you're seeing this anti Bernie Sanders push past the board Hillary Clinton just came out and said that she thinks is she nobody likes it I saw I said that why would you say that the campaign for you know what do you an eight-year-old exactly and she said that he's a career politician like hmm what does that mean were you involved in industry before did you manufacture televisions like what did you do what you were a lawyer for a little bit okay aren't you a career politician and your husband's clearly a career politician because crazy thing to say mm-hmm and then you know there's like a lot of people that are in support of Elizabeth Warren that we're trying to push the narrative that Bernie Sanders is sexist this helps that narrative come on because Elizabeth Warren was saying that she said that he had said to her that a woman could never be President did you ever see that in exchange with the two of them were on CNN I heard about it I try not to watch anything good for you but so this is what it's been for me just to watch all this play out but it was the first time I've seen you rattled by the way I've never you're usually cool as a cucumber right you look a little I just want to make sure that I say it the way I think it all right get it that's but that's why if I feel if I look rattled but thank you the positive thing has been the outpouring of support by so many so many people yeah overwhelming like and then the the support to negative is the ratio is incredible so it's it's awesome well the good news is everyone who knows you likes you all the people who are saying shit I've probably never met you or don't even listen to the pot but this is a but even listen to the podcast you don't know me that well but this is the part of the problem with human beings communicating through social media social media is the worst way like Twitter or something is the worst way to either know someone express a feeling or show any compassion mm-hmm and no one this is one of the reasons why cancel culture is so right right because this is the best way to cancel somebody through a tweet fuck you yeah look at how many comics did that with Louie yeah after the louis c.k thing went down there was a bunch of comics there like now's my chance right you've upped a lot and Tim Dylan posted this awesome Instagram post about that like recognizing that like this is a lot of these people that are virtually signaler these insanely mediocre untalented comedians that tends to be you know it's Evo wolf or Michael che and all exactly exactly when the the leaked audio came out people he's leaning into it he's he's you know he's all right now listen okay has always said the most inappropriate shit that's funny I know you guys don't even fans well when you tweet this the remorse is much smaller like canceling a guy through the computer you're not gonna feel as much guilt and shame and youngness you don't feel you don't feel as good keyboard you don't feel anything I'm hoping that social media will evolve to something that you the people that will somehow or another allow people to be more compassionate to each other and maybe will just understand how to use it better and understand hey maybe when everybody gets canceled everybody's like you can't drink and drive but you can drink and tweet yeah Elmo you know it's career suicide instead of you know auto nanos a justine sacco story no yes that's amazing she was on her way to Africa she was I think she took an ambien and she was Jenna yeah and she's like going to Africa I hope I don't get AIDS right just kidding on white lol that's a good tweet it's a good it's a joke a Marc Norman joke in a lot of ways thank you it is in a lot of ways right that's kind of like something that you would say as a joke I get I don't know if I'd go with the white angle but I like it what would you say instead of because white people do get AIDS so it definitely do make sense logically right but when you're on ambien and you're fucking liquored up o ambien may I have a couple minutes before the flight takes off ReCellular yeah yeah you misspelled a few things like I can't go back I know you try to get it's a fucking hectic when you try to get a tweet I run away it's true you know the whole flight you're waiting you don't buy the wire Cincinnati buy tickets at Marc Norman calm fuck fuck fuck I didn't spell Norman right right right where'd the whole world would change if Twitter gave you like 10 seconds of edit time yeah we changed the whole world Rosanna will be on the air yeah well at the end of the day with all the this shit it's my feelings about all this are it's it's interesting to see it's interesting to see the the hate brigade come my way and it's interesting it's it's very heartwarming to see support yeah it's also you know at the end of the day I've got a giant body of work look I only lied so much about where I am and what I've done you know when people watch the Elon Musk interview they're not like look at all the homophobia right it hates women in that any of you yeah nonsense like have I made inappropriate jokes yeah for sure I'm a comedian oh yeah when you and especially if you're drinking and you're smoking pot you're swinging right you know how it is well we're doing worse or hitches are coming your way a lot of them are high you're like I'm going in yeah when you don't hit the ball oh my god last ones here made eight jokes about fucking kids it's funny because it's so extreme like a racist joke it's like it's racism is stupid these people of theirs they're grasping at straws they got nothing it's not real racism it's a joke yeah Nazis Brown is racism exactly come on exactly and they just know that the word racism is gonna get some eyeballs it's gonna get some shit stirring up well that was the crazy thing about the CNN articles like they put in all the isms all the isms and all the OBS and like little odd on they're not applicable a history of these things you know that's there's a history of these things well there might be a history of jokes right but there's no history of actual homophobia actual transphobic other than me calling that guy a man who beat the fuck out of women but I understand why people weren't upset that that woman though who used to be a guy was doing that yeah that's a little harsh I mean her head got cracked Oh literally you're worrying about women no one cared about that woman nobody nobody wanted to interview that woman and say hey you okay well that's how deep in the shit like that's how deep in we are is it's it's I'd rather have her head split than me get cancelled and again I'm a hundred percent for anyone who knows that that's a transgender woman fighting that woman consensual yes and here's a perfect example of the UFC former UFC featherweight champion is her name is Jermaine Dye randomly and she's a fucking assassin yeah she's a beast I'm just a 10 time world Muay Thai champion I mean one of the most technical fighters in the sport she's super badass she fought a man oh yeah act him up is that right watch it online she kayoed him why she killed a man with a right hand she's a fucking killer man was he a fighter guys he knew how to fight I was Lincoln know that guys she knew better yeah she's a world champion me sure but look if she wanted to do that and he wanted to do that yeah I'm fine but if he pretended he was a girl you wouldn't try to fuck her up then I'd be like you're an asshole that's what this is it's just about deception I'm not I'm not against trans people I think when you're talking about trans athletics when Martina Navratilova okay who is outspoken lesbian who is a one of the greatest tennis players of all world you know of world-class tennis players world champion one of the greatest of all time not when he comes out No okay when she comes out and she did coming out against trans athletes I'm meeting with women the outpouring of hate that came really yes people are calling her transphobic in this net look this hasn't been settled right if you look at the actual facts the number of World Records a number of champions number of people that are now trans mmm it's getting weird yeah what is it the International Olympic weightlifting Federation one of those fucking the powerlifting Federation whatever judges that they recently came out and said we are not we're no longer allowing transgender well really yeah because they're breaking all the world records of what are they in trouble now I think it's justified I think that's one of the ones where people are like well yeah you're winning by 200 pounds ah you know it's like you're taking people and they lose some of their strength when they go through the transition they lose some of their strength and they go through estrogen therapy but there's goddammit there's a lot going on there there's tendon strength there's the size of the bones the hand strength the size of the hands there's the shape of the hips the shape of the shoulders there's more you can generate more power there's also a lifetime of having testosterone running through your body it's almost like a woman who's taking steroids her whole life and then quits when she's 30 right she's still gonna have giant advantages sure but how come in yet you don't see it the other way do you don't see or the woman becoming a man and then entering a man yeah category imagine a woman who transitions to becoming a man and then fighting an MMA right good luck good luck on Nate Diaz you know yeah well there's a woman who was a woman and then transitioned to a man who is now a boxer who is a spokesperson for I want to say Everlast or like a deed it's like a big company mm-hmm now has this transgender female to male boxer which again I'm all-in look I don't even think you have to say anything if that's the case there it is world's first transgender professional boxer is now the face of Everlast yeah now how many fights is this person have wait this was a woman was a woman okay but here's okay here's another problem with this ready in order to transition you have to take testosterone oh so now you're taken he was he as a woman Manuel was a USA national amateur boxing champion was invited to compete in the 2012 Olympic Trials however a shoulder injury during Olympic qualifying changed everything so how many fights and when well let's go back back back confusion a man in the name Manuel was recovering from the injury he decided well you can say he back then she was saying he a lot okay so you say he so much work because he was already a he when when he was recovering from the injury but that's when he was a girl but you let's keep using the same name but Manuel was recovering from the injury he decided to transition from female to male it proved to be the toughest fight of his life he was shunned has he had any fights as a male scroll up their battle against all odds when his way back to sport become the first person competing in a professional boxing match as a transgender fighter on December 8th 2018 Manuel climbed at the rain against Hugo Aguilar at a fantasy Spring Resort Casino in Indio California and came out a winner there you go six year journey got to be worth the wait congratulations to Manuel look I'm all for that too and in Mike Mike my take on that is there's only one issue oh that issue is Manuel to transition s to take testosterone so how much testosterone and what and who's monitoring it and how often are the tests because it if you have like especially some women particularly african-american women have dense bones they have really really good bone density yeah oftentimes rivaling European males may we should segregate racially lol they're just too good yeah I don't know about that people are so good at sports well Canelo Alvarez when the best boxers in the world the redhead you know oh he's good fucking awesome yeah he's really good now to golovkin pretty fucking awesome alright Russian what was that the mic the white Mike Tyson guy he had something well he was big Tommy Gunn Tommy Morrison wasn't he good he was good yeah a fighter yeah good fighter but he got fucked up by a lot of other like Ray Mercer did you see the brain Mercer knockout uh-uh worst knockout in the history the heavyweight division oh wow because he got caught in the ropes y'all caught the ropes and Ray Mercer who was an Olympic gold medals and a murderous puncher was fuckin smashing that's just his head no protection at all he's not putting his hands up I can't watch this and he was never the same again but he did go on a beat George Foreman beat George Foreman by decision beat Donovan razor ruddock by stoppage a guy went the distance with Mike Tyson there you go Tommy Gunn was a good fighter oh yeah well that's one for whitey one for whitey that's it just one there's a few like it we had a Marciano's at rocky and LaMotta was pretty good he beat Sugar Ray a few times yeah well Vasily lomachenko is probably one of the best pound-for-pound fighters on the planet earth today and he's another one who's Russian but Russians there are people there like whitey 2.0 yeah it's fucking hard people man they are which shows you it's not really about the skin it's about your environment that's a lot of it in the genes sure means yeah there's certain people in all I mean you know there's body styles right there's endomorph ectomorph and mesomorph and you know there's certain people that have advantages you know based on the amount of fast twitch muscle fibers the size of their fists different sports you know there's different sort of benef it's two different body types and different sports yeah yeah but you know with versus ping-pong I think it's just really popular over there right oh no they're great I think it's Chinese but I don't wanna get in trouble but but I think it's because it's really popular right ah maybe I don't think there's a physical advantage I don't know they just seem to have a knack for that pong they have a lot of killed or pool players over there really well that's all metrics it's all physics you know and they're stable very popular ah it's very popular over there pool is it's huge in the Philippines really oh my gosh I can't take some of the greatest players of all time come from the Philippines I didn't know that yeah as guy named Efrain Reyes I got a signed photograph of him out there in the wall and it was by the pool table the hot asian lady with the black hair long oh yeah Jeanette Lee it was great she's a beast you watch the children they're all available yeah I could do it three days on YouTube with those trick shots oh dude I wind down at the end of the night every night watching pool really yeah because I used to be hard to find pool matches on television right you know it's hard ESPN doesn't have them it's like you never it's like I put I'd said it in my DVR look for a billiards uh-huh you know cuz I used to play a lot like like all day long when I lived in New York tournaments I was more obsessed with pool than I was with almost anything really yeah yeah I was like if there was money in professional pool I probably would have quit doing stand-up what yes would you ever get no like a pool grift like a like a bar brouhaha oh I get hustled yeah then you like snap the the stick and go come on motherfucker most most that's nonsense I don't know money Artie Lange's got some stories dork please hanging out with dirt bags I mean I've had like guys yell at me and stuff like that but not because I was beaten Emory I was never that good did you I went I went to real pool halls oh there's a West End billiards I know yeah I've seen it mr. damn go to Amsterdam every time I work yeah all right I play with professionals like I used to play a lot of tournaments with professionals but there was never any like you never had the guy with a pretender like I had a gimp no none of that that's all moving no no I mean hey guys try to hustle me one of my best friends my friend Johnny B I met him because he tried to hustle me but I could just tell talk I knew I wasn't very I was just starting out yeah and he was really good he's like come on let's play a game you know give you a spot when I get the fuck and he's like oh you're too smart trick you hmm we came buddies but yeah I was never good enough to hustle and I was never good enough to beat the really good players but I was obsessed with it yeah um what's my point oh so I every night when I wind down the way I wind down I could watch pool now so it's it's even when it's crazy it's like not that crazy right it's a good winder because if you watch like street fights you're all keyed up Oh watch those ah you know what I hate most in anything street fights is when the dudes heads bounce off the concrete brutal brutal there's one this is Puerto Rican dude and this other guy and the guy doesn't know how to fight in the Puerto Rican dude does and you can see they're standing in front of each other yeah he just crack and the guy and you see him like sideways his head bounces up and his girlfriend goes get in the car puppy he jumps in the car it takes off oh my god see they think it's a movie and then the real life kicks in Oh some well some people are they're just fronting and they think right gonna get away with it and then the other guy is actually a boxer right and that was the case here that guy he threw an educated punch like he knew what he was doing and he caught that guy right on the jaw and he went out his head and the bounce there's a fuckin this thing that kills it's like dude I grew up in Louisiana and these like corn-fed white guys with polo shirts and Doc Martens and short short blue shorts with the woven belt they would get these brawls these big white motherfuckers and they would just like kick him in the face when they're down like a sucker he just be outside the bar like I just watch the guy get his jaw broken none on a Friday night at you know 1:00 in the morning and he just go back in the bar I mean it was horrific horrific they slamming people in the car is Annie I'm in the face how many people have died in barfing I know I know terrible ya know the jaw gets wire you see the guy the next week he's got that neck brace you know brutal ya follow for what cuz somebody bumped in here they just build your beer well just people looking for fights and then they get a little bit of boozing them and you know they're mad because their girlfriends fuck it some new guy fucking bitch I don't have that in me I don't have that anger like a ventilations I'm not bragging I like to booze it up I like to smash some gash and have a good time do some shrooms and you know eat a lady out but I can't imagine wanting to kick a guy in the face while he's on the ground No is that not good that's a rage maybe he was beaten or he's deep deeply closeted or something's going on there well it's like some men grow up getting their asses kicked I guess grow up getting abused it's one of the one of the things that I would notice in high school the kids that would want to fight all the time they were getting abused at home ah there's a lot of that right and they don't have as much guilt about it they'll just smash your face exactly I would be like Oh someone's been doing that to them whether it's their older brother or right where they're getting bullied and so they bully people back you know that old expression hurt people hurt people yeah yeah and that's you know when people like to hurt be that was the thing that I hated the most about fighting was when I would knock someone out yes it would weird me out I get it man I would like try to celebrate I would just try out try to like and then after a while I started not celebrating I would just walk away yeah but like that's actually probably better move anyway it looks cooler cuz I would just smash somebody I would kick them and then they would go down like that dudes not getting up I'm just gonna walk away like this always happens kind of always happened yeah like get MMA when they do knock the guy down and they walk away they don't even hammer fisting well it's a thing it's like when guys do do that they're letting you know like I know rice is this is the end yeah yeah I don't have to follow this up right because there's a feeling that you get when you hit someone you see their eyes roll back like you know no but some guys are so savage they don't give a fuck even after the guy's dead like the most famous one to me was Dan Henderson knocked out Michael Bisping it was so clear that he was out and Dan Henderson flew through the air and smashed him with a punch on the way down then he made that silhouette his logo so Google Dan Harrison's look because it's one look they had like this epic shit talking session and then actually Michael Bisping went on to beat Dan Henderson to rematch which was huge for the for the title I like when they have a shit talking because I feel weird when they tap gloves and then try to murder each other look at that belief that is literally is his silhouette when he was you know I mean you can't it's hard to say it's a cheap shot because he don't he is he knocked him well the key knew the guy was out but you're kind of supposed to keep punching until the referee pulls you already wasn't in the right place to pull him off damn but that's kind of crazy that that's his Pogo horse Dan Henderson is a fucking savage Ickes he's the last person do you want to piss off yeah that's too much I'd be like Cosby having a logo of like a lady sleeping look at that not sure why Michael Bisping doesn't like my logo he isn't even in it he's a fucking world champion that's that's the kind of mentality that you have to have to be the kind mean he was a I think he was a 2 Division champion in Pride I think he won that yeah I know he did he won the 85 pound title and the 205 pound title m-m-m-monster yeah one of the greats and he was a woman no he is now though the whole thing is cookies and they he's a vain now he's on a woman okay perfect I like ave that's easy babies it's in it weird now that like the nicest thing you can say about a person is I don't agree with everything they say but I still like them it's like I hate that we have to do that that's so narcissistic I disagree with some of the things I gotta let everybody know that yeah I hate that cages like a guy I wonder if narcissism if you could track narcissism on a chart I wonder if it's ramped up because it's so faux are you kidding of course what do you mean but right it is like something that you feed right I mean it is a psychological condition that you also probably can treat like I don't know say if you have far in yeah but if you have narcissism and you get humbled by life you take some take some ELLs in your life and yeah what you need do you need everybody does and yeah you also maybe you grow older and wiser and you realized this is stupid to beat making duck faces on a stick and you know that whoever seen this image there's a fucking photos one of my favorite photos a candy for there's a girl on a lounge chair with her ass up in the air and she's holding a selfie stick and a honey guy's taking a picture of her taking this picture that's fucking ridiculous it is she's literally got her ass straight up in the air she's got this selfie stick and she's on a lounge chair by the side of the pool and he got it and I think like the captions like 2019 be like it's true I mean back in the day to get on TV that's classic still loving our generation that's what it is come on okay it's barstool sports has it up might look at that that is so crazy I bet she nailed that photo though the dicks that must have come into her DM like a sleepy river filled with lumber just rolling towards her the logging camp yeah just a fucking a lumber boat overturned well like in the 80s or 90s to get on a camera you had to walk by like a TV store I remember you'd be like oh shit I bought it remember we would look out and that was like a big deal but now it's just in your pocket now it's so easy then you can put out into the world and anybody be on YouTube anybody can have an Instagram your whole life people just storing everything now it's like it's too easy it's me me me your voice is counted it sucks yeah that's the thing two opinions are counted from the time you're 12 on write your opinion if you if you have a twelve-year-old moron and he writes a tweet yeah it looks just like a scholar the same fuck the words are spelled with use auto correct so it corrects the word right like you fucking idiot that could be from a 12 year old or could be from a 50 year old guy who works at Stanford right right and it's written so you just kind of buy it yeah this guy's thoughts yes yes I know it's terrifying man what's also interesting a louis c.k a funny thought on this that really resonated he was like it's when people say thing on things on twitter it's just talk right it's written down so everyone's like look look look look what he said like people say crazy shit all the time chorus and where used to say fuck that guy yeah he was right fuck that guy on Twitter look it's written it's official written yeah it's like people have said things about people for since the beginning of time and then why'd you say that amendment I'm sorry fucking drunk and those mad my girlfriend broke up with me yeah shit and people get over it but if it's written and then people retweet oh yeah I remember when you said this about you exactly delete it but I got a photo of it yeah how many times you talk shit about a comic and then you walk in the grid when he's sitting there you were just talking but it wasn't written now it's not official now it's on paper well it's you know look most of us deserve to have some shit said about us every now and again yeah yeah but the loudest people are the ones who have a lot of shit and they yell at you before you find their shit oh that's what's always wrong you'll find out well every green when I go to there's all this shit on Twitter then I go in the green we go we don't agree with that right and I go now come on it's crazy then you go back to your bullshit life on I know a guy who's like an animal activist he kicks his dog yeah it's like I go to his apartment his dog like hey get out of there he kicks it in the ribs you like no guy are you gonna yell peas and you're like what you're the activist dude you know you're PETA bitch dick I know but then the online it's set we all are fucked we are all selfish we're all shitty we're all cunts we're all cowards deep down we have all that but on Twitter you can be a superhero yeah well we're all primates yeah it's all got some weird monkey energy inside of us and you know it's sometimes it comes out wrong especially because you're different all the time right different depending upon the kind of stress you're under with another bleep you just got fired right so so many variables that people don't want to take any consideration yeah yeah and you want to look good you want to look cool it's like makeup Twitter is makeup dude Twitter is make up your Romo t-shirt bro you're right you just nailed it I think it is like that it's like you're pretending you're something that you know you're dressing it up and some people go so far as Twitter for them as plastic surgery where they're just giving in I know like I'm hooked on this right well I don't know if you know this but a lot of ladies they they take the Photoshop to the photos and they like make their butt bigger and their waist smaller in the legs thinner right so my wife will go out with her friends and one of her friends is basically a magician she'll take a photo and just start fucking with things and make make girls heads bigger another girl bigger arms make me secure I make her way smaller they do weird shit yeah they do like a little subtle things like I make this bitch's nose a little bigger they do weird shit to each other well then they call each other you got to take that picture down I'll fix it I'll fix your nose right so the change in your nose and put it back up like it's cartooning it's like I'm doing cartoons you're making cartoons right that's not even a person anymore it's funny because like a lot of guys you know we're shallow and material Ike we call it visual we're very visual and and women always help men or so pig they're pigs all they care about is tits and like no no you care - don't act like it's just us right you want a few you have 18 filters on your face because you want to look good Rogers us you're you're shallow as well well I had a bit that I did in my last special about watching Fox News and about how Bill O'Reilly was sitting right next to megyn kelly and then I go and they're right next to each other so I assume they're in the same climate but Bill O'Reilly was dressed like it was chilly out right he had a shirt and a jacket and a tie I go megyn kelly was wearing something that was best to be described as a vagina curtain and it wasn't a good curtain either I go is like one of those curtains sits over grandma's kitchen sinks kind of flutter in the breeze all right you don't see the yard yeah I'm like her vaginas right there and it's cut low so you got me some of her tits right like you see it you see it just now many sleeves on like there's so much skin yeah but a man if a man wore a sleeveless skirt to an office he would be fired well we're gross is that sexism what is that probably I mean by definition it is but we don't give a shit it's like I'm a girl it's a ton of cleavage you go wow it's a lot of cleavage I go whoa easy creep like you have the cleavage right I'm the weirdo for calling it I was showing it everywhere yeah if a guy has yoga pants on in a giant hog where kielbasa in his pants yeah are you allowed to say anything to him you go hey you got to go home and change what if you're straight and he's straight and you go bro nice dick yeah just a compliment that's cool hey you're not trying to hit on them I know then they get blurred with the men and women stuff because we're the same but then you we have different rules so it's all very confusing well girl can say girl your ass looks amazing right and no one cares what girls could say that - girl sure and gay guys can say it - girls oh yeah they could say had the girls yeah yeah yeah the gay guy girl relationship is a special one it is special because it's girls they could be around guys but they're around guys who fuck guys right so they feel safe yeah yeah it's all rape that just comes down to the rape threat oh yeah right there's no theft there's no threat exactly and there's no threat of deception right there's guys not interested in you right he's not pretending he wants to fuck or he doesn't want to fuck you when he actually does so you don't really know like like how many girls have those fucking Creepo friends that have just been lurking in Jerry waiting on the shore for the boat to come into the dock gotta be tough to be a gal for that one it's got to be tough to be that guy Wow that too but hoping she gets fat hoping things go wrong hoping she gets fat he might pull out maybe not he might d-doc but I probably just get her back in shape again once he gets her I think if we knew how much girls wanted to be found attractive they'd be a little embarrassed I think if we knew how important that was because girls are very secretive women sorry women like I'm a big fan of the ladies blah blah blah but I think a lot of the things that they are thinking if that was out they would be embarrassed you know cuz they're they got some stuff going on in that noggin that we don't know about well it's like there's so much currency in being yes yeah woman it's like being a celebrity man right right like if Chris Rock shows up anywhere people like oh shit it's Chris Rock Cheryl on in Chris Rock hey come on you come in the restaurant we got a seat for you get the forgot seat Chris Rock's gonna sit here do you would you like a drink would you look at this would ya that you want something for free we'll give you gifts like you know it's like this is celebrity well a woman who's really hot yeah has almost the same treatment like come on in right drink I'll get your train course Hey ladies what are you doing later afterparty love to have you come yeah now they get invited like their course yeah it's different a really attractive woman is like like a superhero yeah have superpowers and men fall apart like if women I think they know that power there but they don't logical but they don't experience it they don't experience it from the perspective of a male oh if they knew how fucking juiced up we were when you see a beautiful one with the leg and the skirt the kleva it's insanity I wish I could feel that for one second insanity feel how horny and crazy and like you're irrational you're not thinking rationally no you stumble over your words you say stupid shit you don't really mean only closest thing is you know when like sometimes you're about to bang a gal and like you're about to put it in and she's all ready to go you go I'm gonna hang back and she's like what the fuck that's the closest women will get to knowing how horny we are when do you do that well we've done that with girlfriends and stuff you know like she's laying there huh you tease your girlfriend for fun yeah you like more than I can't get up yet she's you know soaking wet blankets ruined and you know the candles lit and yeah yeah and she's got a little glass of sweat from the first time I went down on her and made her jizz and now she's ready for the the medium-sized dong to penetrate and if you could bottle that that feeling that women have right then when they they call you the f-word like I've had women say horrible things because they're so worked up the gay f-word yo yeah just like what do you say come on I don't want to say it cuz you know who knows but you want you cancelled exactly but if you could bottle that you and Lee were alone you say of course yes yes yes but people can't see intent they can't see new odds these cuts yeah they can look I grew up in a black neighborhood there was a big difference from when one guy would go fuck you white boy to fuck you white boy there's intent of course both are racist I guess they're both there you know evil or mean but I knew what one group meant I know what another group well it's like same words it's like the word retarded yes if you use that with you you could use that word and everyone laughs or you can use that word in you're a monster where I use that word a little kid that has a disease like Down syndrome or something you're a monster or you know with your friend and he's like we're my fucking keys where are my fucking keys like hey dude they're in your hand retard of course of course that's that's the bummer of all that is everybody knows that everybody knows that in they're playing games they're playing games they're like well they're playing games and they're trying to eliminate your ability to express yourself with nuance because they're trying to pretend that these words can't mean different things yeah they always have meant always so they're taking away that but you're not gonna fix anybody you're not gonna die right you're not gonna make sick people better exactly you're not gonna do anything different yes language is complex there's a lot of emotions are complex and the scenarios in which you're using those language right that's why I don't get why would you want to be on that bad snitch kunti tattletale side of all this cuz they want to be woke because there's a lot of fear in being against woken us that's what it is coming after you but you're a good human I'm a decent douche like we I feel like we have good bones and we want to help people like your you would probably stop a bully if he was picking on a weaker person oh for sure so that's to me that's more important than nitpicking through the alternative word they don't see that you know and also here's another problem with when it comes to people like you or me we are in this weird place where we're talking and literally right now millions of people are listening that is strange right and no one thinks that's fair including me and you yeah it's not normal so people that are listening there's a certain percentage then we're like fuck that guy why is he talking why do you get to try right you know and so you say anything that deviates from the standard like the what like if you have to if you have to comply 100% if you don't want to be shit on you have to comply 100% and then if you carry they come after it is scary and it's a bummer who wants to live like that well nobody does but here's the thing when you don't comply so many people like thank you of course there's so many there's a I think more more people are happy it's just the voices that are upset at you all right you're not being woke are the louder ones right they're more into it because they're retarded way to tie it all up there it's a weird thing it's a weird thing we're doing with language it's very very weird my friend a good point black guy by the way and he would say like it's got to be weird in 10 years when this kind of all dissipates and some ladies in a job interview and she's like I'd love to work here and the the guys like says here in 2016 you wrote men are scum what did you mean by that I'm a man and she's made like oh it was a different time you know emotions were high and Harvey Weinstein he's like yeah but that's hurtful like yeah I'm a man you're saying it's kind of quite a generalization you know like that's so mean it's always a big scandal about that just a couple not even a couple years ago maybe a year ago or so there's a woman who got hired by the New York Times they were going through our tweets and a lot of it was like anti white men tweets yeah she said that it was she was doing it ironically and she was also doing it to respond to people that were tweeting hate hateful things that are on it and also she was young like a lot of times you're you're tweeting stuff when you're young and you're trolling and you don't even know what you're doing yeah yeah and that's a great tweet the other day about how you like there's that big white male rage is like a big funny thing going around right now it's a guy he'll rage yeah white male rage like the Joker oh and everything works it's funny cuz you know there's a lot of white male rage out there so it works but it's also weird that we've kind of funneled you're not allowed to be mean any other group and talk about it like black people ever age Asians have rage but you can white male it to death yeah which is like as a comic you're like well now it's kind of hack because you're just doing that every time and be there's other rages so why wouldn't you wanna but you're so worried about being appropriate that you have to just stick with this one that everybody you I don't know it feels very easy woke culture know if you know this but it's impossible to be racist against white people you know that because white people was PowerPlus but something is racism uh-huh why people are always in power so you can't be racist against white people it's nonsense it feels very condescending didn't ground people to my god won't ever talk about you you're perfect let's let's ruin this honky over here well that they're loud and boring the people that do that they're loud and boring and out of them there's a lot of them well there's also a lot of 20 year olds out there look if you want me when I was 20 I would be loud and fucking boring really annoying that's the other thing is like a Shane Gillis peel go can you believe he said that I'm like what you said this thing ten years ago but I've evolved well maybe yeah well well not only that you got to understand that he's talking shit and back then he didn't think anybody was listening ah you're talking shit when you're talking shit you just trying to make your friends laugh right you know yeah who's trying to say inappropriate things that you're not supposed to say to make his friends laugh sure that's what you do man that's what you do it doesn't mean you mean those things yeah that's what white whale male rages that hashtag is an appropriate shit to make the people laugh but because there's so much content out there and all of us are putting out so much content and find these instances where you're just talking shit and if you just isolate those you can pretend that that defines a person right it doesn't right but it doesn't because you never use the good shit exactly you're defined by a giant chunk of whoever you are like all the things you do you know you have your weak spots and you have your strong points you're defined by a lot of things that's like when I saw that CNN thing it was like like that's not why the show is popular you're pretending that this show has gotten all these downloads because it's like this white transphobic hate platform yes not true that's not true yeah I mean I'm not even like speaking for myself like just looking at it objectively that doesn't make any sense yeah but if you say that you could change you can shift of glory people and so that's what they were trying to do but all it really does is a road people's confidence in your ability to describe things ah yeah you lose your genuine card you gotta trust that guy you know what they did to Genki ogre it was the young turks he's a political commentator he was talking that this is one of the most egregious ones I've ever seen ever he was talking about to David Duke on the phone right and David Duke saying I'm not racist you know David Duke fucking yeah so he goes oh of course you're not racist so they use that as a quote saying that he said to David Duke oh of course you're not racist Wow and they tried to say that he was you know coddling David Duke that's a lot of spin but it's not spin it's it's deceptive it's a lie let's and then they made a retraction but it's too late and not only that like why why do you want to do that bullets because he's running for Congress mmm so jancuga right now is running for Congress yeah foreign so they tried to do that to him in the same way it's like this weird thing they have this year these relationships with politicians and political parties and they don't want people like him in because he's one of those take the money out of politics ah he's got this thing's Wolf Pack where they're trying to take money out of politics the same thing that Bernie Sanders is doing interesting I see a pattern here well I mean look that's where they're bread's buttered they wanna they wanna they want more butter they want more bread but it's funny because like an you know when I was a kid you hear about the 60s and Nixon and all this corruption you're like oh that's the 60s but it just keeps going it's a different kind of corruption it's it's sanctioned corruption it's legal corruption you're allowed to do it these relationships it's not illegal you should you know you should have to there's one of the things they do that's really sneaky is they hire these media companies to do organized campaigns so if you see a bunch of people tweeting mean shit about a candidate a lot of times you go and you see well who's tweeting this they have one fuckin follower of course and they've only been posting for like a week and most of the stuff they're posting is against this one candidate yeah they have these dummy accounts so either it's a person who that's the only time they've signed up for Twitter and they just want to shit on Bernie Sanders yeah or it's a this sort of contrived collection of people where or I mean fake people look like one person has like 50 accounts right or one you know media company you know a media organizing company that is like literally hired to do a campaign to try to push a narrative and so they just fill the mentions up with these BOTS essentially saying a bunch of different things that are negative about a candidate or negative about a person or negative about whatever about anything yeah you know and this is one of the ways that they sort of try to shift the zeitgeist and when they can't control that when they don't have to control the narrative then they start panicking and then they pull out the heavy guns yeah and they start asking you know these news stories whether it's a newspaper or you know an online publication to write inflammatory things about you yeah yeah that's that's essentially how they try to shift opinion on things and it's not illegal right right but it's fucking super Sneaky and really sleazy it's funny how they do the it's not a legal loophole kind of because it's still wrong and mean and hurtful and a lie but when it machen it was a comic right imagine if you say look aren't you filming a special tonight Marc yes I am two shows dynasty typewriter I don't know when this comes out sorry sold out right yeah sold out baby I'll show you fucks can't get in yeah so imagine if this special comes out and you you tweet a link to it and then underneath it you use 50 dummy accounts talking about how fucking amazing that special right and then people find out about it yeah and they go Jesus Christ mark Normand what the fuck is wrong with you what do you mean they would say that to you like if you had 50 dummy accounts politicians do that's what corporations it's a lot of people do that to try to shift opinion alright and they're doing it through Twitter you know what this solution that is stay the fuck off Twitter well how long till it's illegal if I was like it's getting dangerous out there doing stuff like that sort of should be illegal mmm doing it like having like it's basically what the internet research agency in Russia was doing when they were having all these fake accounts and they were tweeting all I mean they were they were doing all kinds of different things like they were pretending that it was black women against Hillary Clinton Russians like no that's black women we can't vote for this bitch yeah like and then there were also Whitey's are like on the side of the black women they were even organized this stuff I had a woman in here her name was Renee to Resta and she spent an incredible amount of time analyzing this stuff and it has all this data and like hundreds of thousands of posts and millions of interactions and all these different like really can shift the narrative on things and it's all this fucking troll farm in Russia where people getting high hired to pretend like Muslims and Texas separatists they put together these organizations across the street from each other yeah so the Texas separatists and this Muslim group and they're both organized by these fake internet research agency people that are working in Russia and they put their their their fucking protests right across the street from each other look at that and so they're fighting with each other that's a they must be having a blast watching that shit go down well also they're funny that's what's really right their memes memes they make are really funny like they made some fucking killer memes yeah legitimately hilarious and she was talking about she's like I'm telling you I was laughing really hard and a lot of these memes yeah yeah oh man what a kooky world were living in and I I don't even want to dive into it because it bothers me it's weird but I think it's important to talk about I can't talk about like this on a podcast because it let's people know like oh that's what's happening when you gray and so you know what else people do they have these accounts that they use for a long period of time as a fake account so they'll even put fake photographs up a little bit of cartoon fixture up and then they'll use it to talk about random shit right they'll tweet about star wars and the weather and oh my god global warming is real can you believe this they'll put retweet interesting articles and they just do this to try to give it the illusion that it's a real person yeah and they'll have 80 of those yeah and this is all a company so if like if you have a media corporation that is the design and the company with it what they do is they make these media campaigns on social media they organize campaigns to push a narrative they'll have these things just like a company would have assets right they have these accounts they'll have fake accounts and it's not illegal what do you call that gig that seems like a pretty good gig just making fake Twitter accounts and then you know having fun little jovial nice quips and so maybe a campaign you mean that business if you wanted to do that Wow it's not illegal right now sure sure but maybe we should just get rid of Twitter I mean I like it because I write jokes and I like to get feedback on jokes and whatever but it seems like it's doing more harm than good well it's doing good and it's doing harm where it does really good is in like I mean Arab Spring you know a lot of the stuff that happens overseas like these people one of the only ways they can get the news out because the news is locked down in their country one of the only ways they can get the news out is through social media and sometimes sometimes even through a virtual private network right and you know they have to use a VPN a VPN rather to go and rings or soap of all time that's the one that you can cut into the Irish Spring one I always wanted to cut into that commercial cutting soap is fun like that's how people learn to carve wood sometimes they use soap as like a little practice but yeah um I don't understand body wash do you do body wash why I don't trust it come on man I don't do cologne either well cologne is weird that's that's deep-end weird I don't get guys who do cologne what is body wash is it so the liquid but is it soap it's soap you you usually put on a loofah oh I'm not opposed to it I like the black bar yeah give me the bar do you know different like ethnicities like oh you white people are weird yes go ahead go ahead cut up my black friends get mad at me cuz I don't have a washcloth yeah a lot of uh not just black but Latinos as well oh is that right Latino if they like washcloths and white people are disgusting we just use soap and then you know your wife goes in later and she uses a shelf and you're fuckin kids using the soap oh yeah hey hey what are we doing here I mean I got that soap up my ass and everything bumpin uglies yeah but it's also a weird one you're showering with a lady ever remember you showering with your girlfriend one who's new yeah and fuckin in the shower and then you gotta wash your ass it was always a weird moment that's a weird moment yeah when you if you try to have sex in the shower like who gets the water I'm cold over here especially New York right also the water will ruin the the the Lube if you will natural the natural ooh yes yeah it gets it all rinses it away a little too much friction so you're trying to slide down a slide and your ass cheek keeps hitting the plastic all right you want to pull your shorts down a little bit so you can shower sex is the worst yeah it's like a good idea I think are used to have a bit about it it's a good idea on paper right but in practice it's not really the best move yeah you losing libido there cuz you're what 6152 ah put on testosterone I take testosterone placement so I'm not losing shit you still horny all the time okay yeah I have my testosterone levels are basically like what they should be if I was thirty right basically the same I feel I got crazy with it I'm still horny but now that I'm with a lady you know I don't I like glad because I don't have the energy to do the small talk bang but then more little shit out of bullshit do it it's brutal yeah that's the hard part to me well that's the part about being single is the yeah it's not necessarily deceptive but you are definitely putting on a little bit of an act of course polishing up the old turd yeah yeah just like you just thinking like how long how long how long how long for the underwear cutoff yeah can we fuck and the girls they're not dumb they know that they're gone alright he wants the fuck now but I'm like get more food out of them and drinks and knows the most depressing thing about being single after you came you'd be like what did I do oh yeah I gotta get out of my life what happened yeah I went on a real tear and that was every morning was just like oh I got to make some changes will you start thinking that you really are into this person and come make me like no makes you realize biology is a mother fart like it knows what it's doing deceptive oh yeah yeah well Brett Weinstein was explaining it to me he's a biologist knew explaining to me the there's different strategies for mating that biology is set up for us and there's two different like types of women that are attractive to men he was like there's beautiful and then there's hot uh-huh and there's a difference and what beautiful is someone who has good genetics she seems like she has a pleasant demeanor you like her personality I want to be around her and then there's hot or it's kind of slutty hot porn star the reason why you like that is because the idea is that you can mate with them quickly you can spread your DNA but you don't have to make any commitment you can write a write so literally these strategies are set up by nature so when you see a girl with a little tiny skirt and big giant tits stuffed into this like fucking crazy cleavage like and like little short little thing and her belly showing she's like you know there's not a whole lot of game here right and get right to it yeah and then if you shoot one in there and make a baby it's like you're you can spread those genes very quickly so throughout humanity like throughout like the evolution of the human animal that has probably been a strategy that evolved so like women that like maybe their personality sucks or maybe they're abused so they don't have high self-esteem so they feel like the best way to definitely get attention without making sure that they that a man works for it yeah because they don't feel like they're valuable enough right uh-huh so they'll wear like skimpy clothes and they'll slide it up why do you think it is that a lady is so bummed out after the like if you want to leave because you pretend that you're so into her and you think you're so into her and then as soon as you come she's like oh he's gonna hate me now he wants to leave cuz that feeling like when you come if you don't if you're not really into a girl and you got tricked by your own dick yeah and then after you orgasm like what the fuck that feeling which every guy knows I know it's natural II don't know what I don't understand you of Cour well that's why it's annoying women go men are such pigs like this how I'm wired like you can't sure that's like me going hey you're bleeding weirdo like no that's just how your body's made it's how my body's made one can sympathize ten they want more no we actually think we won't do we do think it yeah until you come and I'm like oh I've been in love all night I'm like this is the best woman on earth and then it just all the interest shoots out of it well but how about this ladies and this is gonna be controversial but look I hang out with you we're not fucking yeah why don't you bring it like give me some knock knocks or something like give me some joke give me some jokes give me something to work with yeah like all you showed me was like I chased you for five hours all night you know trying to win you over trying to be funny trying to be interesting why don't you spin it now why don't you win me over right right right you're kind of in a way you're kind of saying like sex is my only thing no but there's a lot of funny interesting cool ladies out there so yeah but you know there's a lot of boring dudes too so with your a lot of people boring people is yeah there's a lot of people that are born male and female could imagine being a girl and having some boring ass fucking dude trying to stick gotta be brutal oh yeah everywhere you go and then saying hey you know you should post my little make you hate that move is that everywhere oh maybe must have guys do do that they make us look bad really dumb guy and a dumber girl yeah maybe it would work oh I'm sorry sometimes I'm self-conscious about my smile oh you got a beautiful smile you things huh yeah okay thanks yelling those two are made for each other yeah you guys deserve looking the audience there really should both go into the woods and get eaten by wolves that's what should happen right in the real like if if we really were trying to make a better human race there would be more variables isn't there be more more traps that's true that's true but we got to be nice you know well we should be nice we should be nice but sometimes I think it's just genes like sometimes sometimes people just have knucklehead genes well yeah sometimes I see people you know you're walking down the sidewalk and seen in somebody's living room and they're 8,000 pounds they're watching two and a half minute a bowl of Cheetos in a beer you're like you're kind of a waste of life like no offense you deserve life you have a right to live but I'm out here trying to write jokes and I'm driving from gig to gig I'm doing pods I'm going gay whatever it is at least I'm trying something least I have a little ambition you're moving yes experiencing life yeah even if you send a tweet out at least like you put something into the world even though it could be horrible but like this guy I'm just like you're just waiting to die you just counting the minutes till you go there's something about like and then they have kids and they're like now you brought even more shit into the world okay you're alright but like you know you see you're a dad of nine or whatever and then have 80 kids 80 kids that's a lot of testosterone it's putting in you but yeah so you probably teach your kids like hey make some with your life yeah well they can only use electronics for a certain amount of time good for you they you know and they they're involved in activities they play sports they do things I think you gotta do stuff with them too and also they have to see that you're doing yes yeah parent like one of the things that kids get out of you is that they see you live by example yes that's important totally and and then on the flip side though I get selfish and I go well it's a good thing this fat cunt is sitting in a Barcalounger all night because now I get to go do some with my life and he's not in my way that and you also feel better you know right I come home from a hard day of getting after it yeah see that fat slob sitting for the TV laughing really hard at Big Bang Theory yeah okay buddy I'm fucking better than you you hate to say it but that's why I like sometimes I think us being were under six foot and that a bummer when you love to be six foot I don't know man I kind of something about me being short has helped me be more ambitious that's what I'm saying benefit it's probably benefit to it right right that's you want it that's why I like it sounds bad but ugly people are funny it's a lot of ugly fun and you got a break they did some study where kids are more trust ugly people less so it's not just being shallow it's kind of innate oh yeah well imagine being a woman who has terrible genetics and Chan's probably someone listening to right now and it's not a goddamn thing you can do about it it's not your fault you got a giant Fred Flintstone head chair and make your way through this life with the football players body oh yeah I got some moles on you you got everything wrong yeah it's falling out yeah yeah stubby fingers had jowls you know Turkey and weird elbows and it's out there just trying to get after it yeah and nobody wants it yeah that's why I love an ugly lady who's horny because that's my favorite I love that I'm not saying to bang I mean I have but I love an ugly horny lady because she's I feel like we have a lot in common I have a buddy mine and his favorite is a girl with kind of a Mugsy face but a killer Bob oh those gals go to work that hits a nerve in a guy because he like it's attainable and she's probably like God like normal self esteems she's not entitled she's at the gym every day all day doing squats yeah it's the same with meathead boring guys who are like I got to get some traps cuz I got no skills that ended in a talking wise yeah just find some dingbat chick and shoot those fucking loads into her yeah you hope that the all those groups meet like you dumb work yeah an asteroid yeah over there yeah it's I mean but some things bats have kids and those kids go goddamn my parents are true but I'm gonna do something with my life that's a good point that happens a lot I know a lot of really fucking smart people of idiots for parents that's a good point yeah thank God for those people I think that's you know that whole expression like hard times make hard man or men make easy times easy times make weak men I'm hard I'm hard I think there's something like that like fucked up parents make interesting kids sometimes not all the time not all the time yeah it's not like a pedophile where if I touch your kid he'll be a pedophile that's a weird way isn't that creates like vampires yeah that's a weird that's that's apparently a big one with priests this thing about how many priests who molest kids were actually molested by priests and it's like it's very high that is wild horrible yeah you think like I'd go the other way yeah you would think you learned some horrible thing happened you you don't ever want that to happen to someone else but it just shows how fucking crazy kid fucking gets into a kid's psyche like it messes you up breaks everything yeah cuz you're in this you know and also you've like lost your trust and adults and then you're a lot of girls when they get molested when they're young they become hyper sexualized and they they try to use their sex to get attention like deep into their lives sure like a lot of porn stars I think we're a lot of porn sidled yeah yeah yes but then there's also the the Oprah's of the world the Michael Jackson the Tyler Perry these people were all diddled hmm and look at them they use their their diddle anger into greatness sure yeah yeah it's not standard no it's not like everybody who you got a chance last it yeah it's like when you get bullied you can channel your rage into like getting better at something have you seen do you watch TV at all oh yeah he wants the outsider on HP I keep hearing how great it is joel is told me was amazing i watch episode 4 last night fucking-a that shows good is it horror I don't like horror it is hard yeah but it's it's it's I don't want to give away too much it's a mystery it's Jason Biggs everything amazing he's amazing he's amazing in Ozark this is like that but like it's I don't want to give away too much it's horror mystery alright it's fucking good man I'll check it out I mean there's not a moment in that show so far but I've been like what it's Stephen King right yeah he's a beast Stephen how many books is that guy really fun in fact what in the fuck Stephen King grew up poor in Maine and his dad did the old cigarette move and never came back going out for a pack of smokes fatty and I'll see you in hell never came back look at him greatness you got a channel it folks have you ever read Stephen King on writing no tastic book oh I'd like to fantastic it's all his process for writing and like him like all the different things he's gone through while he was writing and you know a lot of the books he wrote like amazing ones yeah like Cujo he doesn't even remember writing it Wow just fucked up on coke and booze is that right yeah yeah just finding like fucking an empty case in his writing room yeah coke everywhere and just like this amazing book that makes me like him more I didn't take it I think Carrie was the first one that he sold it was a carrier Christine Carrie Carrie Carrie is the first one who sold they just right out of the bat they're like holy fuck was this guy doing and he was just boozing and smoking and smoking a ton of cigarettes too that's apparently he said that was one of the big bombers when he quit smoking cigarettes is that cigarettes apparently positively affect it juices yeah yeah juices apiece Isner oh right right that the firing of the neurons yeah I've had a cigarette before I go on stage before oh yeah yeah yeah you know cliff used to smoke cigarettes now he just does the vape thing and one time I was like give me one of those let me try it yeah before when I was like oh get juiced up and then I did with Chappelle when Shep Ellen Island a couple of marinas yeah but that's that's one of the reasons why it fires up your brain uh-huh in a very unusual way and I think probably more so for someone who doesn't smoke of course because you're not chasing the dragon you just get in the rush with the gum work or is it happy to sing tried the gum it didn't do much for me cigars work that's too much smoking cigars every now and then and halfway through I always go I got to stop you almost throw up yeah you almost throw up and it just it gets me cloudy a little bit I'm my anxiety goes up for me definitely it's your anxiety like you you smoke weed a lot I'm such a lightweight when it comes to the the ganja I just think all the negative goes up and the bad goes down or the good goes down yeah you know any demons I hate myself no one likes you you're gay whatever it is so it all escalates well these good things none of those things are true so just smoke more weed just deal with life but I can't live it eats me alive it's too strong the voices are too powerful yeah that's voices I like them they teach you things like you things that are fucking with you they teach you like but I can't win I can't beat them mmm like when I'm hungover oh my god it's not just physical pain it's like yeah I can't the phone rings I'm like I can't do it I can't it's horrible yeah I gotta work on that well maybe not you know everybody's different like some people have a really adverse reaction to coffee caffeine fucks them up yeah some people just can't drink coffee oh I love cup and some people can't smoke weed it's like we're all so different yeah I have friends one drink and they get fucking gerbil eyes and they're off to the races where they are yeah gone and now you know Mike's gone and this is a fucking shell that looks like Mike with fucking shark eyes just running around with no soul it's like their soul leaves for their ears oh it's so under estimated or under whatever because we hunt for drinks and I'm like I notice I'm knocking a mailbox off at the car with a baseball bat I don't feel any guilt about it but it give you a sober you'd be like shit if somebody's coming we're gonna get caught we're gonna get on film oh dude especially if you're doing many shots come on pussy one more more let's do it yeah and you're you know eight nine drinks in you're like you're gone you know anymore it's also crazy to think from 13 to 31 I was drunk the whole time 13 Oh New Orleans man we just right after it early and it was just part of the culture your dad would hand you a Miller High Life you know and shut up and drink this really yeah it was fun time I mean I lost my virginity to a prostitute I lived and grew up eight blocks from the French Quarter with the public school it was bananas out there yeah we talked about you're transgender a nanny that was taking care of you two got that right eating up people for taking your bike yeah I tried to sell him pitching all this shit nobody nobody wants it God really I've pitched your whores out of a job and he was really good on the other one he was good yeah he's a beast he got in trouble with the real transgender people I heard I most trans people I've met are pretty cool and like they don't want to be coddled so much you know we think Oh easy uh you know what's weird out it we're not really helpful to midgets have you noticed then I don't think you're supposed to say that emo uh what do you call them people smaller people little people sorry I mean I'm friends with a couple littles but how do you shorten little people lp's yeah help ease all right and we're standard play yeah they're little but yeah they're all good eggs and they don't get any help like no one's shortening anything like nothing on earth is designed for them and sure we don't like toilets are still tall right and they gotta jump up there right bones we help with the toilet and I'm saying that's great we accommodate but why don't we ever help them and that's strange what do you think there's more oh there's got to be more midge not anymore becoming really chic yeah but but midge you can't pick right well I don't have trans you can't fake it you can't fake a midge mmm it's image it's a name yeah it's it's tricky though it's like call it's like calling a white guy with a backwards baseball hat a wigger right like I don't know if you that sounds too much like bigger the poof yeah you could jump high you know we the Pooh is all about an acid trip no they said about everything a ride come on go on the ride yeah something bride yeah the ride at Disneyland does like the worst ride of all time it's basically an acid trip hmm I remember one of the times I did it I went through Disneyland high as fuck and I was on the rise like oh this is Winnie the Pooh's he's on acid uh-huh there's all these visuals and everything becomes psychedelic and the colors are weird really yes if you had a video of the Winnie the Pooh right no I'm telling you Alice in Wonderland I'll get are those mushrooms as talking cats and shit no something happens during the ride and you go like when he goes in the way the Pooh goes into dreamland oh I don't nobody goes into dreamland it's you're basically on acid you're going to an acid trip just yet I was like he's mellow he's got he's eating honey he's got no pants mmm doesn't feel acity well watch this see who do to do Disneyworld Disneyland Disneyland she's out here so yeah you go through everything's normal and then not really this is just pretty these lights and yeah you're on this little fucking thing and you're in the little roller coaster ride and though here's Winnie alright floating around with a balloon it's kind of a cool ride you know what is great kind of nice my daughters were really young I like this oh so pretty very pretty going through and there's a or and then there's that other pig the fabulous piglet and so then you go through a bunch of shit happens and give me a little fast-forward here because it's gonna be boring is the worst trip ever that LSD honey in that like the way I think that's well there's that Nepal honey that's psychedelic honey maybe that's what it does give me a little fast-forward it is a little trippy so that's it that's the trip so right there so what happens before that trip find out what happens right before that Jamie something happens yeah see cuz he's floating watch so we need the Pooh is sitting there and then all sudden he floats out of his head and look I'm floating all right like he's fucking tripping balls and then as the thing goes it goes black and then you see Winnie floating and then boom you're in psychedelic land everything is weird and whacked-out yeah and there's jack-in-the-box heads with big tongues and everything is neon psychedelic colors and the world's melting and it's honey and honey spelled phonetically correctly I see it now it's got a little would say fear and loathing it's DMT this is like a DMT trip that's what it's like all these psychedelic things you're seeing this is about as close to creating some sort of a psychedelic hallucinogenic trip right you know kids ride as you can get away without getting arrested see I thought you meant the actual cartoon and story no no no but this I see yeah it's like something there's they're doing something oh yeah why is he tripping balls you're a millionaire and this way you spend your time remaining busy I didn't show it to yet there's a VR I don't think it's a game but I think it's like what VR experience if they have multiple of those but it's so ayahuasca trip Oh bring it on JMO it's interesting that you saying this is that Terence Mckenna actually predicted that you could recreate in the future with virtual reality a psychedelic trip and it would have the same exact effect as a psychedelic trip because it would be able to show you the same visuals you know remember I don't know if you remember this but there used to be you know what phone phreaking was to remember phone phreaking there was a way that you could use a public pay phone and you had a device that would make a noise because a public pay phone right you'd press a button like beep beep beep beep EB BB BIA well you would hold a thing up to the phone and it would go it would send a signal through sound and the phone would just open up for you so you could use it oh no core and you get no quarter and you just start calling people oh it was done somehow another through sound like you would mimic the sound the phone would make ordinarily uh-huh so it tricked whatever was on the other end that was waiting for the signal that was correct things is this it here wow this is exciting because I've always wanted to do it have you done it I've done DMT I have not done ayahuasca but this looks a lot like the MT you've done DMT you never mentioned it yeah oh wow cool yeah they're eventually going to be able to nail this no exactly like what you'd experience right VR is gonna be dangerous man that's gonna take over a lot of shit have you done any of the VR experiences that you can go through now in a warehouse no I've done the goggles and you feel like you're in a whatever Church or a forest or something and it's pretty damn convincing we have a one of those oculus things right out here that's attached to an iPad it's pretty cool but there's a thing in Woodland Hills called sandbox never a couple of them somewhere else besides Woodland Hills but one of them is only a few miles from here and you put these VR goggles on and when you get the goggles on you go into this house and you fight zombies mm-hmm and I mean dude he'll fucking freak you out because it's all dark the zombies are running at you oh so you you they dress you that's just a fat kid in basketball so so this is reality and zombie so this is you running through this like this is this is what it looks like to anybody watching but what you see is these crazy fucking zombies running at you and these giant pus-filled monsters it's fuckin ski I guess they're not showing you the video but it's pretty dope yeah I mean it's like it's a heartbeat thing like you you your heart rate Jack Wow cuz it feels like they're really coming at you and you wearing a haptic feedback vest while actually you feel it like chest imagine the fun areas that's what they look like woah so embarrassing when they show the other one oh yeah serious see that so the zombies are running at you they're in your face like really quick laughs yeah it freaks you out man kind of funny that's basically what Twitter is you think you're changing the world you think you're doing all the shit and it's just you in a basement nothing's really nothing's really now available Deadwood mansion that's cool it's fucking dope very exciting I'm a fan yeah give that to the school shooters you know just a classroom setting and they can just shoot it up so they won't shoot up a real one has the same feeling of chaos but if we could get their actual teacher and their actual classmates I feel like that'd be a nice way to get that out of your system it'd be a little better than what they're doing now sure sure sure maybe with pedophiles - you could have a kid in there and let them get it over with right imagine if they did that if they said the best way to treat pedophiles is to have virtual children that you can rape people be like wait what I mean it sounds crazy but it's a victimless crime it's like when you give the heroin addicts there are free needles or a methadone or that too but people go what are you giving them drugs you go well it's better than them dying on AIDS II heroin needles right so or you know overdosing give them heroin there's places in the world where they give them like a distributed amount of heroin and it's pure yeah actually they're not giving them anything that's spiked or it's got some fentanyl in it on paper you go what are you crazy giving them heroin but it's it's better it's almost like the first guy to think of gangrene do you hear about that guy in World War two ever as getting gangrene so he said fuck that he cut his arm open stabbed one of the dead guys and put a little bit of gangrene in his wound and I was like what are you nuts and he's like I'll get immune to it he worked really it worked so now you're gonna help me I'm getting um what a fucking crazy asshole oh but I mean look around he's his dead bodies everywhere he's got no hope he's walking in the gunfire Wow yeah might have been World War one but it was some World War II war fucking Savage from Iowa some yeah farmer savage but but brilliant guy in a way ways thinking outside the box I love a different kind of thinking you know that's why I like comedy because you see something like noir McDonald's got that great bit about my dad had a heart attack and died and the guys in a better place he's on the floor you know it's like I like that kind of oh yeah you're right yeah you're not wrong but yeah yeah I don't know I like that stuff yeah I do too men I mean comedy is like like we all have these particularly for people that were working in these jobs like we were talking before when you do these corporate gigs for those people comedies kind of extra important because their whole brain is programmed to this fake way of thinking and talking all day sing it sister and I think that's it's cathartic you go now some guys to some horrible thing and you're like ah all my field veterans that I know that dude were I don't have a few friends that do work in you know like office environments they fucking love comedy love it they need it yes it's like it gives you the assholes like you and me just saying things that they could never say but we're different than that I think we're a little built differently you know we couldn't do I couldn't do that office gig I was a janitor for years just because I didn't want to talk to anybody it was a better job than clerical bullshit I don't to be in a cubicle my car driving by myself throwing the papers out the window that's a great gig yeah I was a great gig for a comic I always say if I wasn't a comic I'd be a FedEx guy or UPS guy that would be my gig you're outdoors you got no door on the fucking van yeah sure whatever you want whatever you want yeah yeah it phones in it's great actually it's a great gig right everybody mine is a mailman oh well that's a little Boston same thing he had a route he wouldn't put headphones on listen to music the problem mailman's you gotta hit every single house the package guy everybody loves a package right also I'm sure there's some horny housewife who you can pump in on look at Brown do for you bitch so yeah some milfy Millfield lady in lingerie oh I'll sign that you want to come inside okay oh yeah that's that's yeah how many ladies ladies can do that though this is a girl who's if a guy is at the door and you know the guy looks good and she looks good it's almost a hundred percent of the time she can get that guy to fuck him I know what a privilege almost 100 percent of the time she can get that guy to fucker and I think that's why I think it's a big part of why women aren't as aggressive because they don't have to be of course so well it's not it's not their nature I mean right the male the testosterone the Conqueror you know if you took fucking away from women for six months that would be interesting to see how much they'd want to fuck hmm not that women aren't horny obviously they get horny but it's a different kind of it's a safe horny guys will walk into a glory hole and put their dick through it I don't think it ladies putting her vag up to a wall that is the weirdest toilet porn yes the glory hole porn I'm a big fan whereas a girl just sitting in a fucking refrigerator box yeah sticks his hog through a hole she's like oh yeah what's the ultimate fantasy it's but it's weird I can't get a girl to bar to fuck me but if I put my dick through this hole and I don't know who's on the other side it could be LBJ Oh BJ I just fell backwards into that one yeah but yeah anybody could be anybody Rosa Lara you just deal with it sure no that just feels good you pretended someone hot yeah and also you hope the wall is not too thick right cuz you want to get as much maximum maximum dong shaft rights you know that's why the refrigerator box is a good move perfect love a box you can have like a real wall no you know it's sheetrock cutting down on your two inches oh yeah well not only that the fucking chalky shaft yeah you mentioned you get sheetrock scrapes on your hard I've been there j-mo you got along nice and smooth and eroded by then well the rest when you rub in areas reduce dicks rubbed up against koala bears will midia that's why you've read the clamed never come on you're lucky we're a hot piece I got lucky all right ever got it you got it many times how many I think I've gotten it for how come it's not like gangrene we're just your body gets added to it you get it you get rid of it real quick well I could ride it just ride it out and then maybe you'd be immune to it maybe but I don't wanna go to someone else oh but you've got a fuck no matter what right yeah I just wear the kana but then the booze kicks in you guys fucking take it off fun fact and ladies won't admit to this but there's a lot of skanks out there doing this just take it off take it off oh yeah they don't come clean on that but that's a big thing ladies dude that I don't get feels better for them does it supposedly I've never had a guy fuck me in my vagina with or without a condom women are so secretive why don't they tell us shit I get shamed man but I but man up or balls be shamed and live your life I think the shame that women experience is fucking really frustrating my guess is when guys shame women it's mean and guys shaming women about being sluts that shit doesn't work on men it's right non exist n girls you piece of shit oh yeah what am I gonna do but they could make it not work just go ahead blow me fuck you I don't care it's not in their wheelhouse why not because up because genetics because the way the world has been sort of the world of human beings has been evolved I'm clearly talking like a scientist but look at the N word the N word was flipped now it's a positive yeah so you slut yeah I don't well they've tried okay Andrew Amber Rose has a slut walk in LA she's still there she give up on that good for her it is it might be next week coming up soon fourth one I think really fast and walk number four imagine if he gets like slut walk 40 and she's like strapped everything down and tying everything together right waddling out there yeah she's very sexy huh oh yeah Kirby Kirby Kirby late plus the confidence you have to have the where that haircut no the short hair yeah that's that's a girl no she's hot and you gotta have a pretty face oh yeah you know to pull the short hair but yeah but the slut thing the prom what the celeb thing and nobody wants to say it is I don't care if you're a slut I say be promiscuous go nuts hoe it up but they feel guilty well they feel guilty I think because of biology for the same reason that Eric Weinstein was telling me that there's different mating strategies that people have for a female to just hoe it up all the time she's not going to have a man that's their time child washing craig and vulnerable i think this is what biology is interesting sort of setup right right well that's fascinating I think that's why I like that clock tick thing is real you know a biological clock yeah baby if we or it's gonna be retarded if we don't fuck now and have a kid but there's also different countries that have different feelings about sex like a lot of Latin American countries they're very very open sexually and very very it's different the women too yeah yeah women too they have just a different attitude about it Australia different parts of the world they're freer and open about sex good good even in Canada I think that it's different than in America why are we it's a yeah you know like like Chris Brown to me what he did was worse than what louis c.k did but louis ck's a sexual component which makes everything way worse in America like I'd rather be jerked off Don jerk off on and punch in the face wait even jerk off on them lobbies in front of whatever it was yeah so it's like why are we so focused on that let's it's now the Chris Brown thing happened now the Chris Brown thing happened before this whole me to think ah so it's a timing yeah for sure for sure there's a lot of people that snuck through that sort of time period right you know aren't you glad you never raped anybody yes man I mean I don't want to say I'm glad you'll have that a on your conscience and be on your record and also aren't you glad you never got raped sure that's a big I've fucked people unconsenting tell it held down and banged have you fucked people in consensual oh you know you gotta talk about it you got a gal and she's like come on you're like I'm good just like come on you're like all right oh so you didn't really consent but you made her so you made it sound like she didn't consent but you really didn't consent no I didn't but that's norm I think everyone you're ugly wife or you're ugly husband but if a girl wants to fuck you and she like talks in it and you feel bad afterwards no one's gonna feel sorry for you right but if a guy does that to a girl sure a girl to do it people will come down hard on you it's weird how that works cuz like I get the dicks and DMS all day long again all that shit no one cares nobody cares then I go what if this bothered me people go oh you're a guy I fuck you you know when you come you just do you know Whitney I do a little bit not well do I like her ask her about the dm's that she chose him to us it's really get a book I said you should write a book about dick pics that people send you cuz it's not not a dozen it's doesn't really dozens man is she's always got like weird dicks coming her way to like curvy when a group text she'll show us the dicks and like what the fuck Wow weird weird hook Dixon yeah do they like does she like it now yes is one it's just guys just send pictures they do it to every girl look there is probably a fucking gigantic population of creepy dudes out there yeah dick pics well here's another one I was hooking up with his girl years ago I met in Arizona and she was like send me a dick pic I was like alright sent to the dick pic 8 5 i will say five years goes by i get a tweet hey is this mark your dick it's added me and it was it was my sheets my shoes were in it my desk was in the background and i was like that's not mine and I was like it spooked me so she sent you that or someone else to some random guy like Minnesota she's this you're dizzy text it to some guy and I just didn't know for Combe put it on Twitter I gave it a favorite and I moved on you're not interesting out Twitter let's just show dicks to Twitter lets you show hardcore porn hardcore porn hardcore porn which is fun sometimes you in the airport like yeah fuck it it's crazy I'll look at this for a minute yeah I mean you could ask fucking coming everybody everything you name it baby isn't that weird that mean it's a gigantic platform to into well hardcore porn Instagram does not know game is show nipple oh wow you can't show anything girls get kicked off an Instagram for having like transparent it's oh really yeah you can't even show nipple isn't it amazing when you see how many beautiful sexy stunning women are on Instagram you could go through for our it's right it's probably our best resource you talk about oil and all this shit I think the hot women in America it's up there it's pretty good it's better so there's a lot of photoshop out there talking about these ladies doing cartoon work on their pictures killed my dream man in the dream also it's weird this is some guys daughter and some mom's daughter yep yep that's but then she hits 24 she's on her own I guess so look whatever age you nervous here that picture yeah you have to be but I'm also look I think girls like boys and boys like girls I want everybody to be happy you know yeah I would hope that they are this case too I would hope that you know they could find someone who's nice to them and I would hope that you know yeah yeah they won't don't get bullshitted but I mean remember you you were a fucking poon hound back in the forties you know you know you know what it's like radio though that's true imagine if you live in like like legitimately living like a thousand years ago like what they probably didn't even understand what how you got pregnant yeah you know a diseases killed you you got syphilis everybody died your hair fell out your nose rotted off your face yeah they would have crazy diseases and no cure that's probably why the Bible steps in you know it's like hey don't eat pork porks kill anybody let's say no need pork on Friday or whatever it is abstinence too they're trying to preserve you right venereal diseases right yeah and that's why being a virgin was so good you know if you're not you get thrown in the volcano yeah yeah I was reading this book about the Wild West and they're talking about all the people that are get that had syphilis mmm it's just they just all went to whore houses and they're right that's sick oh and while we're so lucky to be alive in this time we're gonna killed it on Twitter those guys had to ride a horse without a saddle but imagine when it's like a hundred years from now they're gonna be looking at this poor idiots they didn't have virtual reality no that's true live in the real world and drive cars everywhere yeah ignorance is bliss man yeah yeah you don't know I mean back in the Wild West days they were just happy they figured out the horse that's true like oh my god so glad we had horses yeah yeah yes it didn't have horses right right walk everywhere fuck out of here do that Donner Pass the fact that that happened is bananas not that long ago man I know I know and it didn't just happen once there was a couple other instances of people trying to make it across and froze to death out there damn but the movies in 4098 are gonna be so much more boring where we get to watch the revenant some guys chasing Native Americans killing a bear he's fighting on a river but this the movie in that year it's gonna be a bunch of dudes podcasting it's gonna suck because we don't have any struggle so what is the conflict for a movie what if they'll ever have a podcasting movie oh it's gonna happen podcast getting crazy webcast changed and we're like we've had Angry Birds do you remember Christian Slater had that was that radio up the volume yes Kevin Smith had one Kevin Smith - yeah we're uh Waris walrus remember I don't know if you saw this it came out maybe three podcasting he played a podcaster was gonna get an interview and like the guy kidnapped him and turned him into a walrus you ever saw that movie yeah well I saw red-state though then I saw the best movies that was crazy it was crazy he made me see that movie without telling me anything oh he goes I don't want to tell you shit I don't tell me anything just have a seat bad PR for Republicans Kasich that's right that's right tusk yeah crazy movie though I was like Jesus I didn't see that coming at all I was gonna be like a funny movie I didn't know he had a venom yeah did you just hear about you know comic books and hockey jerseys oh jesus don't show you just spoiler alert it was that dr. Phil son of a bitch and then you showed it to me something like this what if I was gonna watch that tonight like I wonder how this turns out I wonder what it looks like you know what else is kooky is the fact that where our attention spans are getting so short we like a YouTube video to be four seconds all we do is check the time but then the movies are getting longer yeah that weird is weird so our podcasts yeah Omar had that statement he was like how come our attention span is either seven seconds right right exactly with the Irishman once upon a time in Hollywood these are all three hour plus did you like the Irishman I haven't seen it yet well you gotta watch it in chunks which is shitty long I love Scorsese and I liked it it's not as best by far but I liked it why are you watching chunks because it's old so long yeah but if you're one of those guys who just can sit there for four hours you could do it but it's it's like a novel you got to really take it in how many hours is it three and change I think mmm that took a break about two hours and I got like 20 minutes you know what's around man I got some problems with it but it's a good movie yeah when you go to see it when you go to the movie theaters when was the last time you went to the movie theater you saw a three plus hour movie I went two nights ago but it wasn't three and a half there was like a legit three I remember that a Tarantino movie they did the double feature they had like Oh grind house yeah but those are two movies right yeah well once upon a time in Hollywood that was pretty fucking long to raise on yeah I watched that twice and I loved it that dude he's a hero in it right he really is he's doing it right he's got only nine movies he's gonna make ten movies and he's gonna retire yeah allegedly he's going to TV they're gonna back up the fucking Brinks truck but thank you he's slipped through there's some guy out there who's just as brilliant as him who hasn't gotten a shot yet maybe but here's the thing he's grandfathered in to hears because his movies are so fucked up like once upon a time and Hailu hollywood spoiler alert there's some scenes where he's taking his chicks head and smashing it like it's great whoa like I don't know if a new filmmaker could get away with that today interesting I don't know because some of that shit's disturbing it's very disturbing yeah and I think he's so grandfathered in with the hyper violent ultra violent movies well it goes to show if you sell tickets nobody gives a fellow but he gives a fuck your Megan money but with him there's no risk like if it's a Quentin Tarantino movie he's never missed once right did Django hateful eight pulp fiction you keep going down the list all his fucking movies Reservoir Dogs yeah they're all killer moon and they're all goriias shit and darkus yes he had one bad movie a bad Tarantino movie some are better than others but the nah but all great like hateful eight I even liked I loved that movie yeah what was did Django was fucking fantastic Django is fun and you get to realize Leonardo DiCaprio can act as fuck is amazing man like you see him in a lot of these movies and you know what the problem leaner DiCaprio is first of all was beautiful I don't like that he's getting uglier though let's move in at a touch good a little chubby chubby yeah yeah - sure but then the other part is climate change is real that kind of shit when people like accept Awards and the climate change is real like hey hey you're not here for that all right we all know it's real come on man you're not fixing the world by holding your trophy for pretending but that's the points you gotta go okay we want a bin now I know yeah okay he's in the good bin he flies private of course he flies private you can't say climate change is real on fire private well you can say it but it's like syphilis is real but you won't wear a condom oh yeah are you what are you doing to protect yourself in that problem hmm penicillin hmm hmm I just don't like that's why I love Ricky Gervais sir speech oh that was fun it's amazing that was great it's amazing well it would just suck to be one of the people who get pissed about that like man what a shitty life yeah I want to find those people and bookmark them Yeah right checking on them anytime anything goes wrong I love it I'm friends with Ricky now I can say that I love them we exchanged niceties on Twitter oh really yeah which mental have met the world oh that's beautiful hey tell me about your experiences with Seinfeld since we since we did the last podcast you did like I did some gigs you tell me he had a great fucking time great time he's the coolest guy I mean he helped me out by giving these gigs open form at the beacon and he's a cool do cuz he goes I want one green room and you go whoa I don't bother you new guys no no I want to hang how cool is that that's very quick and zillionaire legend comedy guy wants to hang with my dumb ass well I think that's one of the things that a lot of comics miss when they get really big yeah you know and you know when you're Jerry Seinfeld it's like all the rest of us are in this place rights legend another NFL he's but that's how we see him he still sees himself as this Long Island nobody look she's so cool and also why he's still funny yes you know and he's like he's like I'm worried I'm not relevant anymore like what do you mean relevant or show comes on eight times a day got communes and cars you're touring everywhere you're fine hilarious to think that he's not relevant I know it's like Dave Attell team until I'm a hack I suck I'm an old hack like you're brilliant you're one of the best ever ever that's why he's so funny though he's not blowing himself Larry David Larry David I suck him in the way nobody likes me like driving a Prius you're my hero yeah yeah but every time you looked in the mirror he's a bald nope you know bald nothing worth a half a billion dollars I know and he's changed good he's changed my life he's changed the world with his comedy and he can't they won't sink in I love that yeah well that's why they're so good that's good I think if you start really believing you're something special you're fucking doomed you're doomed you're doomed because then you're not gonna be you you're gonna be some like yeah I'm fuckin oh I'll just go out there and be awesome right and I've seen that before and it's ugly it's another really and guys they think they're the shit now and then they don't try that hard yep and they don't work at it yep and think they can just go out there and talk to people and people are just happy to see them right that lasts for about three minutes right it's like what is happening here confidence is a killer man it can be it can be but it's not confidence through hard work and discipline like knowing that you're ready but even then he stuffed have a little edge yes exactly exactly like those some of the great fighters were all bullied or something that's something behind them where they just have that extra flame oh yes I mean almost all of them will tell you some of them will hide it but almost all of them will tell you that they're terrified yes that was I heard a cowboy was talking about like how he flips out before every mind he's in his head I'm like oh good that's how I am before a special or a late night or whatever yeah and you feel better like okay I'm not a wuss yeah any good set anything that's important those butterflies gonna be fluttering around your Adrenaline's gonna be pumping like holy fuck you're right Chappell talks about it she tells me I get nervous and if you watch the interviews he's hunched over he's weird and he's not this cocky savant you know smoking I mean he is he's brilliant but he's not that guy I think he's just mastered that look he know works hard but he's calm because he's done so many sets right and he's so good I mean he's he kills 99.99% of the time but when we work together we did a couple arenas together we were both like alright here we go really yeah I mean you get you know like right before we go on stage he was about to go up there about - he looked at me goes not a whole lot of motherfuckers get to do this and fucking murdered but great is this feeling that you get before a show if you don't have that yeah and everybody's scared of that feeling right because that feeling is like god I don't feel like to be uncomfortable I just can't wait - I'm so confident but you will never be that because you are then you won't be free exactly it's a catch-twenty eight it's brutal and they always say do something every day that scares you and we do every day I mean how many people why do you get up so much because I'm scared of it and I don't want it to overwhelm me I want to be able to control the fear a little also if you're building your act it's almost imperative that you go up every day oh it's almost yeah yeah I shouldn't say almost there's bits that grow the more you do them like you have a new tag like oh my god that's how many times you've done a special and then a week later you come up with a line like I was in there it's the worst bits were never done there's no they're never done but then they are then they're over done you're right right no are you overcook it yeah and then you'll hate this back anyway and that's a problem if you try to record you know Tom Segura had an excellent strategy for that you know we were talking about it and he said he records quick yeah prolific he's super prolific but he also says that what he does is like some bits he'll get bored with them and he just won't use them so like months at a time and it'll replace him with new bits and then he'll come back to them when he's about to film so it feels fresh I couldn't do that I need all the time I have my jokes are too short that's impressive yeah we have non sequiturs you have a lot of nods yeah just so boom boom boom and I'm such a pussy that I need laughs at silence I'm not going like I see Bill burr working shit out and like the crowds like where's he going with this yeah and then you see him two weeks later that's murdering right to me I'm like I gotta get more of that I gotta get more the ability to just sit in it eat the dicks yeah and don't get me wrong I bomb quite a bit but I'm on purpose exactly Chris Rock used to do that all at the ending that he would walk in there and just fucking just try just practice shit what else what else yeah I don't even tell the audience hey don't get too excited right you know you would just go up there and fucking make it happen well the audience can be such queefs sometimes they're like hey this is Mina and you're like yeah but I'm going somewhere you dumbass I'm working this out and it's gonna be beautiful stop step it on the the buds of the roses because it'll be a bud one day don't don't step on it yet but people are so quick to negate well one of the good things about the Comedy Store is they know that we're working try and talk about it so much on podcast they know that and I've had people come out to me and go dude I saw that before months ago and I just saw it again it's amazing that's the best come to life yeah I go yeah it's talked four months ago right he was like I didn't think it was gonna be very good of course no but I got a bit of a beef with with these bigger name guys doing that they go I go to the clubs to work it out like well they still paid yeah there's no real people who want a show so I get a little wishy-washy with that I like to sandwich bits in between proven debts to move you got to try them out but sometimes I open with a man yeah yes I come out of the gate with a new bit that works too cuz the the fear of it makes you come up with us yeah and you would also like you like really go over it in your head or actually you got all the fucking eyes dotted and the t's crossed yeah that's the key fear is there so why not twist it and use it the way they have the newspapers spin you got to spin your your emotions exactly exactly and get something out of it exactly so you're filming tonight yeah and two shows two shows I've been doing this hour forever and I'm getting to the point where I go back to San Francisco I go back to Denver and they go so I got to put it down right I don't let people down with the same material and it's killer it's tight it ends big it starts big it's it's dark it's edgy whatever you want to call it and I can't sell it nobody wants to buy it so fuck it I'll do it myself how is nobody buying your special well you got to have a hook now I feel like if you're a cracker you know you got to be depressed you got to be molested you got to be half-jew or something you got to be in a wheelchair we need a good hurtful derogatory term for white men we need yeah well ironically it's straight white male yeah but it doesn't work it doesn't hurt right you call me a straight Mike now Mike yeah yeah nothing yeah yes but you know there's words there's certain words sure but I will say this when you grow up in a neighborhood and you're the minority getting called a white boy or hog it hurts okay so when you grew up and you were a minority is effective yes what is it effective today still not really but it is dick it is you're a black kid and you grew up in a white neighborhood yeah and you hear that shit all the time and it hurts and then you grow up and then you're no longer in that fucked up environment yeah someone calls it to you again still hurts right no way because you're still a minority yes white boy doesn't work anymore no but if somebody calls you white boy you're like well I guess you're mad at me it doesn't hurt but that's the problem it's just the intent like why do you want to hurt me that's what stings not the actual word like what's it what's your beef but there's a sting to the n-word there's no pork in Co reached or any other word yeah yeah yeah no other word cunt no no other word nothing maybe the F oh no no I don't think so because they were enslaved well not only that didn't have dual meaning like that that word also has a meaning that you say to your friends in a joking way and nobody gets upset at all right and you can say it's a heterosexual people right joke around about it it means different things I would never call you the n-word and in the laundry room exactly unless you were packing that's exactly yeah this guy's a real black yeah it's um it's like you know the real problem is actual racism yes if there was no racism then no one would give a fuck what words you used and it would all be fun cuz if you had a derogatory term towards people who wouldn't even work right well did you see that tweet about how the alt rooms the audience is all white and then the club shows its diverse even though we're saying the fucked up shit mmm that's a great point I forgot I should give the guy credit but I forgot who said it I did I said that UCB about 10 years ago what is that right I don't they don't pay well that's the whole different bad Amer crazy that's crazy you're selling out every night you're a packed house and you don't pay the comics what are you selling are you selling something that I don't know about is the name UCB is that still on sense yes nonsense the name UCB exists because of guys like Patton Sarah silver Louie and all the maggots right right I mean look they got their hustle I'm not trying to knock it and it's working I'm not alone The Comedy Store pays ya know pays well and it's a fucking great show every night yeah improv pays these clubs pay you know right right I mean I don't want all the money I just like you gotta give me something and I give it to the bartender and I get me the door guy and I give it to the guy who parks the cars there you go I spread it around right great you got it like you can't take all the money yeah yeah yeah it's like what what are you selling I know a fucked-up business it's relying on people being suckers it's very strange you're relying on comics being suckers because you're getting stage time so what I can get stage time anywhere what you say you I get stage time and a lot of you can now but any while coming up come to see you all right pay money to see you and you wouldn't get any of that money what's that about that is very strange nonsense right straight up your own sense yes you filled the room up and you killed where's the money oh you bought a new house and then they'll buy a new building and then these guys are driving Ferraris to work or whatever I don't have to drive Ferraris they'd probably drive Honda's and they'd take them home then they'd Ferrari ah ha ha ha oh so those audiences aren't as good which is weird to like I'm working for free and yeah that's very precious vibe in there where you say like my roommates gay and they're like wait you said gay hold on let me dissect is like now you're not even think about the joke anymore you're just so busy worrying about these terms well it's probably a lot of young kids to very young riding that woke pony pony so what are you gonna do you gonna YouTube it I got you know try to shop it around me Amazon yeah they know they got a lot you gotta have a favor Geoffrey so what the fuck yeah muttering Norman trust me killers yeah tweeted out this I'm 100% tweeted I appreciate it listen once you film it I think once you film it people get a look at it I bet you'll sell it yeah I just want eyeballs on it that's all I will definitely get that you're done right and if you put it on YouTube I'll tweet the fire I appreciate your your good again hundred percent you're a good egg - oh hey thanks but yeah I just I you know you start doing comedy and you feel like you're getting somewhere and then you try to sell a special that's been worked out for years and it's tight as a drum and everybody goes this is a great thing why won't I flex you're not what we're looking for right it's all branding now we want branding we gotta fit a certain quota which I guess I get do you know I'm all about spreading the love and diverse and having hooking people up but it should be if it's funny it's funny but I am stand-up comedy's always been a meritocracy and I think it should stay that way and there's plenty of funny women there's plenty of funny everything of course fill in the blank you know especially now I mean you get the Asians there was like one funny Asian or one famous Asian I should say was Margit show and now it's like Ronny Chang Ali Wong Ronny Chang's fucking hilarious in the news fish yes very he's good man yeah and he's angry yeah angry and tight and relatable like the topics fuckin tight shit really good man he had that great bit about the internet about how then like one it's gonna be like smoking in 20 years like I can't believe you let your kids look at the internet or you look at either way you're pregnant yeah that's a great angle yeah there's a lot of good comedy right now there's a lot of bad comedy there's a lot of yeah but there's more good cause there's ever been before of course of course I don't think I've ever know I've known a time where there's this many like straight-up assassin yeah why do you think that is the Internet yeah more platforms for people you know look at guys like Schultz who's literally become one of the biggest comics in the world just through putting his own stuff online and for the same reason because they didn't want to buy his shit sure sure but he's filming a new one and that is getting picked up by someone yeah listen the world is open for great content right and he takes advantage of all the platforms he's really good at putting funny videos on all those fashion videos and it does I mean he orchestrates them and coordinates them and I think he'll go down in history as some kind of marketing guru he's a genius impressive great comic on top of that which you usually don't get you're gonna get a really good marketer who kind of sucks as a comic or you get a guy like a towel genius yeah marking himself at all no can barely uh sell a DVD and he doesn't change his clothes is the same thing it's a black jacket it's like he wears the same shit yeah he always says I look like an unemployed umpire he's been fucking brilliant he's amazing but he's the worst marketer of all time when I hear that he can't sell tickets in Swords I'm like what are you talking about well I almost want him to call me every time he's got a gig and I'll tweet it but people want a cartoon when you really break it down like I know guys who are funnier than you know fluffy but fluffy sells out arenas because they like him that's not very personable there's dad yes he's very likeable I think the problem that tells that he doesn't market himself well that's and no one else does either that's all it is but I think the bumping mics things change that helped that helped them because Jeff Ross is such a personable guy and the two of them together it's Reyes right it's fun and it's a really big necklace show yeah it's great at it but I can do a hundred of those oh you do them together never ends but I just think people need to know it's gotta be like we're animals you got to go oh the fat guy oh the dumb guy family guy right yeah fluffy oh yeah yeah I like that guy yeah well I'm sure big guy yeah yeah you want it's gonna be bite-sized nugget of who you are I know you're into cars yeah I'm doing Matt's show tomorrow Matt Farah I love it gravity hungover oh I'd be hurtin that's good early - nice I'll probably legally drunk Fluffy's in two cars he is but he's into Volkswagen buses bro he's got like 30 of them that's a weird choice they're crazy he's got a warehouse filled with Volkswagen buses I like him but they're all like customized really yeah it's crazy like I never would have guessed like someone told me he's a car guy um he's got a bunch of other cars yeah cuz he's rich but he's got a warehouse filled with these fucking Volkswagen buses what a weird but look at this they're dope - and they like mint condition yeah it's like a sneaker collection just got different color look at that and all these Volkswagen posters on the wall any pretty badass but how weird is that that he kept buying them like after you and he's like yeah I'm good it's weird that's the thing that grabs him you know he's like he probably is more than 30 I mean wow he cook on that video can you click on that video well we can't we can't play it anyway 6:00 p.m. by the way you do it alright one day one day tomorrow you're at you're gonna do Matt Farah show you around tomorrow night oh yeah come to the store I didn't want to bug anybody come to store I'll
