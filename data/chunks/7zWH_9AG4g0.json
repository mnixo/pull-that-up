the girag an experience we didn't talk about this the last time and this is something that key was controversial after our podcast because during the manhood training camp your dad died the Rebbe how hard was that man to go through my dad I had like a weird relationship my dad and I had like a falling out probably 10 or 12 years ago and spoke in 10 years and he came to one of my fights when I've won glory 10 with arts and Levin and was one of the biggest things that Vinnie helped me work on I found out my dad had cancer and like my reaction when my brother and sister told me it was like fucking like I don't care like it we really didn't care he doesn't that much that uh Wow that I was just hated him like we had like a really bad issues and when I started talking to Vinnie you know I mentioned yeah my dad had cancer and I didn't know how I felt about it because part of me like carried you know at some point and Vinnie did something like I called a timeline therapy and we had a UH this is not always fun I'm talking about what uh we he asked me all of these scenarios like think of a time in your life when you were really proud and then think of a time when you were really upset like all these different emotions and he didn't know what he was what it was about or what was gonna happen he's just trying it on me and every one of the things that he talked about was my dad like every one of those times was a time with my dad and he did like the you know the whole session or whatever him at the end of it I just had no more resentment or anger toward my dad and it was really weird and it was like this chip on my shoulder like my whole life and at one point for a long time I used to think about my dad before I would fight when I was fighting professionally like I would use not necessarily like I'm fighting my dad would like to shove it up his ass like look what I'm gonna do you know and I realized that like that anger that I had and I used to tap into all the time was actually like holding me back and was almost like a handicap and yeah when I when he helped me forgive my dad I was able to go to Florida you know he's got stage-four cancer he's gonna die and I had a relationship with my dad for the last year before he died that I hadn't had in 10 years and I was from that Vinny helped me do that well that's gotta have a big impact on the way you raise your own sons yeah for sure like knowing the resentment that you had towards your father the anger and the bad relationship like never wanting it to get to that place yeah it was it was weird it was a you know Vinny didn't know that he was that that was even gonna be the result that you he was just like I want to try this time I'm there everything on you and yeah I went from like could completely hating him to like just confirm completely not like half-ass forgiving him to like waiting for that apology like there was no apology that was no talking about it it was like completely starting over and yeah we had like a really good relationship for that last year before he died and I knew that he was he was battling cancer my brother started treating him he was Stage four I mean it was the doctors like you know your dad's gonna die he had cancer and as long as cancer and his brain cancer in his chest at cancer in his neck he had like this giant mass I was neck and my brother started treating him with CBD oil and allegedly I was shipping it to him from here into Florida wherever I thought oh it wasn't very good allegedly allegedly if there was fiction for facial original purposes and we were giving him CBD oil for about no no I guess seven months brother mm-hmm and after he wasn't going to chemo he just didn't want to do it he was like really stubborn stubborn guy wouldn't do that and they they tested him they did like a graph or whatever to see where the cancer had grown or whatever over a period of time and they were shocked that 90% of the cancer had died that there was 90% in the cancer was dead and 10% of the cancer that was still alive was like completely surrounded in dead cells so that they couldn't get even medicine to it and I couldn't grow and you know I was just gonna he was gonna have to live with it you know but it was completely surrounded by dead yourselves and the only thing possibly they could have done it was the CBD oil because he was doing nothing else correctly he was like you know they had him on so many narcotics and pain pills and stuff that he was he's a asshole to be around was really hard it was like constantly unlike this drug thing and he wouldn't eat he wanted to eat was like chocolate cake and ice cream you know like would music really are bad for cancer were lies it we're like trying to get him the right supplements in and you know it was a tough situation but the the CBD oil was was beating the cancer and the cancer wasn't what killed him he actually died from Mike starvation or malnourished meant from not doing what we would beg him to do really well 90% of cancer was dead CBD oil people it really works it's working right now for my friend's mom my friend's mom has stage 4 cancer in her brain I allegedly got him some CBD oil and he he got it to his mom within less than two months her cancer had shrunk by 30% she had been doing chemo and they were saying that her immune system was so devastated by the chemo that the chemo is probably going to kill her quicker than the cancer was and they'd recommended her stopping chemo and he was just in full desperation mode my friends real super straightedge he just he's just you know mr. Republican American doesn't you know thinks Obama's a Muslim that kind of guy yeah and never would want to have anything to do with CBD oil or anything cannabis I I got it to him and now his mom can sleep she's eating she sleeps at night she isn't that pain anymore her tumor shrinking the doctors are astounded if those stories you hear so many of them it's almost like they seem like anecdotal fairy tales because until it's it happens to someone you actually know and care about then you go and then you start getting angry like this is what these goddamn assholes that are making laws in this country and fighting against as the lobbyists and the people that are working for the pharmaceutical companies that are actively trying to suppress this information you are keeping one of the best ways to heal these people you're keeping it illegal and it's a fucking horrible crime and they won't even tell you about it which is atrociously my dad is there giving my brother the talk that my dad is is gonna die and it's terminal and you know all this stuff for you know weeks and weeks and weeks he's going to the doctor and finally my brother is like hey so you know what about you know medical marijuana is that something that and they're like oh yeah we can prescribe him marinol but we just can't you know there's no question that the cannabis are THC whatever it is cannabis helps fight cancer but we can't we can't refer you have to ask we can't just offer to you and then they gave him that the prescription for marinol which is like the government pharmaceutical form of the pill which is probably way weaker than weight we girl than we were giving him yeah not nothing is good so yeah like we got the call I got the call from my dad or my brother that my dad had passed away it was three weeks before the Melvin man off fight and I flew home to to Florida to you know kind of with my brother and sister and figure out the situation what we were going to do and my brother picked me up from the airport and we went to you know straight to the bar to you know have it out about my dad and when we got back to his house my uncle was had called and you know we just assumed that my uncle was calling do you know give us is sorry too sorry about your dad and we ain't my sister answers the phone and my uncle was hysterical and I guess my cousin Cody who was 23 I was very close with his huge fan of mine had fallen off a balcony on their vacation and died the same night and so it was was a ton of stuff to deal with that last you know two weeks for my fight and again I talked to penny and you know he helped me stay focused on what I needed to do to handle business in that fight and finish Sherman can't thank him enough for that stuff that's gotta be unbelievably difficult to do both of those things unbelievably difficult to deal with while you're trying to focus on especially fighting a guy like man oh yes scary fuck you know every every post anybody tags you and it's like no a man office I like really no it's like fuck is stuff you know it just drains you haven't I tried coming back and I got two weeks left for the fight and I'm trying to you know try to stay focused and you know I can run it at a good clip and I run six miles you know regularly and like I'd be like half a mile in and just be exhausted because all of this mental stuff just wears on you and you know I had this internal battle of myself you know should I pull out of the fight should not pull out of the fight and I talked to penny I was like you know I just I don't know what to do and he was like he's just a dick actually he was like he was like your dad and her cousin died and I was like yes and he's like and that that's sad and I'm like yes and he's like and you're never gonna see them again and I'm like yeah man I'm never see him again he's like an and that's not fair and I was like fake yeah motherfucker is not fair and he's like you know he says all the shit and he's like now what and I was like what do you mean he's like what are you gonna do now and I was like he's like are you gonna not ever fight again you gotta not to carry your family you know let this stop you from everything you've ever wanted to do it was like no and he's like well then turn off that app and wait until after you fight handle your business you know whether you're religious or not at some level somewhere you think your cousin and your father what would they want and it's like well I talked to both of them about the fight they were both excited about the fight I knew what they were gonna want so I just kind of turned off that emotion until after the fight and when I knocked out Melvin there's like this this was this moment right after like the referee stops it I like fucking explode and there's a good Bellator post the picture all the time but like at that moment was like all of that emotion that I had turned off like came back right at that moment and you know after the fight I was thinking about them stuff and it was really cool wow wow that's intense Wow but there's that's an iconic photo too that the photo of you right after you knocked Mountain it's a pretty intense photo that was a crazy fight too man it was a big one it was a big one for Nolan was a wild motherfucker dude win lose draw that fucking your urine for some chaos with that guy that crazy those all those guys from that mics jam Badr Hari am cocon there's so many of those guys just fuckin ferocious yeah that's their that style out of that gym I mean that's why we're all there it is right there yeah that was that moment right there well we're running out of time man so let's end it with that that's a fucking perfect picture to wrap this podcast up with that's that's intense with Melvin down behind you you need that you got it on your Jim get that up on the walk there I got put up on the wall and should fucking for sure be up at the yard
