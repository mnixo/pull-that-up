of vag outline everything you can see the slice yeah they had grandma panties back then Oh guess who doesn't care me are you a panties guy what do you mean you know like girls with dogs like granny panties like and girlfriend nothing yeah say it somebody's got health so they were moonshiners with a heart of gold never got any pussy and they were beautiful men beautiful men and their hot cousin it was a show where no one fucked it was the most ridiculous world it was way more ridiculous than the fact that they were shooting arrows with lightning with dynamite of the end of it and they didn't have guns because they did time for fucking running moonshine but the man should let him do what they do down here in Hazzard County we got our own rules yeah that was nobody nobody fucked yeah you think fucking Boss Hogg would have had a slew of hookers she should have that's show now in reality like this is what it would be like well let's think about her she's the only hot girl on the show ever look one of the grossest women of all time that's his wife how dare you yeah fucking her he would have been fucking her Uncle Jesse would have fucked everybody was fucked up lead his scooter Boss Hogg definitely well it's hot definitely he woulda had her on the payroll she was riding right next to him that Cadillac with the bull horns in the front of it but she came on to the other guy oh she was always coming on because his gaze fuck and he was comfortable by this Jesus was strong in his life that's why Cletus didn't one a minute when I was a kid my dad was rich and he would carry like $15,000 around his wallet yeah crazy shoes and like bones he wore who wore a lot of like stupid looking silk shirts shit he looked like some kind of decadent Roman Emperor and he always had like his house to do dads cool he was cool what did he do for a living he was pretty much a con man whoa really where he started us a diploma mill called LaSalle University degree yeah did you yeah shit I don't believe you but no no they need to start he started a fake University no you know I mean it kind of you could say in some like ways maybe it was fake or maybe it was just a precursor to things like Phoenix a University of Phoenix that just you know but his real problem wasn't the school they never the government never went after him and said you're running a scam school the government went after him first for you know committing mail fraud and for tax evasion was the big one because he didn't feel like he had to pay any taxes I felt otherwise so he ended up in jail for you know three or four years over well actually was sentenced to five years but then he claimed to be a drug addict even though he wasn't never did drugs and they gave him some time off his sentence from enrolling in a drug treatment program that's awesome he was always looking for the angles I wish I had that ability like my dad is he still around no he's dead as your mom still around yes when you talk to your mom about him like like how long were they together uh you know I think about maybe eight or nine years Wow what it must be like to be a woman and to have a child with a crazy man who was running around just scamming people and hustling well you know I mean it wasn't like he was really scamming people he was actually helping people to scam employers and they know the degree is fucking bogus right that's a good point actually so they were and actually was crazy because when it was exposed there was like congressman and you know that got their degree like CEOs of major companies that all had degrees from LaSalle University super successful even with fake degrees yeah that's hilarious well you know I mean degrees are bullshit anyway well they certainly are not the only limiting factor in someone's competency yeah I mean especially not for like business or something yeah no science maybe that's a different story oh for sure medicine yeah you want a real doctor I don't want you know a doctor with a LaSalle medical degree with an incomplete idea I don't I don't think he issued medical degrees though hmm well either way that's not the most egregious example of someone being a con person that's no no I mean there's probably way worse things but you know I mean yeah but he was an interesting guy though yeah there he is Robocop Wow he had a dope outfit too the new Robocop I never saw I wasn't really into the new outfit did you if it just didn't this is the new one oh did you watch the new one no I didn't know I think that is the new one I met that dude yeah yeah see why why doesn't he have his hands covered I'm gonna chop your hands okay we can have your hands covered how come your mouth isn't covered either I'll shoot you right in the mouth if I'd the weak spots yeah you don't want to have an exposed mouth hole yeah why would you ever have exposed mouth yeah well face yeah asshole faith is like ready to be shot because I'm assuming there's a brain back there right you had skin so there's you know let me shoot the right through your eyeballs in your brain so stupid you know like he's got like a regular human mouth why would you have that when everything else is protected yeah I can't project you know have some sort of a speaker on the outside there's so many veins and important arteries they run around the neck I was gonna no teeth didn't get shot in the face with a cannon yeah anyone in Detroit do you know nobody was like the best place to put it don't today it is yeah right no one seems to have seen this movie it must have been a robo flop he
