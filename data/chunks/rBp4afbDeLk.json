keep this about a fist away okay and we're live Douglas first of all thanks for joining me appreciate it great pleasure to be with you looking forward to talking to you you've become an example to me or your conversation with Sam Harris become an example to me of how squirrely things have gotten lately with the way people interpret conversations about ideas right because of this Jamie pull that thing up this is a tweet that someone sent out and he got a strike a community guideline strike just for listening just for putting you on his playlist a conversation between sam harris and you and he this man or i don't know if it's a man I just assumed I'm a problem I'm part of the problem part of the patriarchy PT r kc c x on twitter that is his screen name his or her Orser screen name on twitter and got a Community Guidelines strike for just putting this now I brought this up to I was having dinner with some friends one of them we used to work at Google and someone who's there was a highly ranked person at YouTube I brought this up and the exact quote was that was because it's hate speech and I said you said that so flippantly I go please tell me the contents of the conversation do you know what they talked about I go how did you say that she was what I'm sure if someone marked it as a community guideline that or as a strike a community strike what is it call the Community Guidelines Frank yeah that they must be hate speech I'm like do you understand this is Douglas Murray and Sam Harris a bet I bet that's not what the conversation was about I I bet it wasn't - I'm trying to think what we did talk about now it's making me nervous I mean but I know that I know it definitely wasn't hate speech by any sane definition of those words that you this sort of thing is very disturbing - very sermon and you noted happening with other people yes and that's disturbing enough is more disturbing of course when it happens to you but it's lil I mean I know Sam Harris a bit not a hateful person my most sort of yogic calm list out west coast of America friend and I'm pretty amazed that anyone at Google or anywhere else would think that anything that could come out of his mouth with hate street hate speech unless you decided that hate speech is just anything you'd personally don't like or that words don't matter anymore well that's what I'm concerned about I'm concerned that there's an agenda that people who work in these we don't even have to name the organizations but in certain organizations are extremely left-leaning and I mean it's probably better than being extremely right-leaning sure it really is it's probably better than them being white supremacist white nationalist hate groups is probably far better that they're radical lefties but it becomes a problem when you're doing things like that because things like that limit free speech and they limit the free discussion of ideas I don't I didn't listen to your your conversation i I think I listened to a little bit of it but I didn't listen to enough of it to know whether or not you guys started screaming out the N word halfway in I'm sure I'd remember I'm sure I'm sure you would I should've heard about rushing more at this moment I had another thing that I talked about with this same person I brought up Jordan Pederson and you know that there's there's issues with every time he's on podcast the podcast get flagged for D monetization and and the exact words were he's a troublemaker and I'm like what in the fuck are you talking about like are you listening to his conversations he is very articulate and he's extremely careful going over these ideas that I think we should all be discussing so to call this hate speech or to call someone a troublemaker it to me it's symbol simplified or symbolizes what were what we're dealing with today this is a very strange time when it comes to communication and the people that regulate and distribute our communication it is and whenever I've had a chance to speak with people in that kind of world in that sort of role the question I always want to ask my other things is do you know where this is going to lead do you know what its gonna do if you keep breaking down definitions and terms and words do you know what happens for instance down the road if if you keep on saying that Sam Harris and Douglas Murray having a conversation about something is hate speech do you know what relief that's going to give other people down the road about what they're going to be able to get away with hmm this is what's being created all the time at the moment it seems to me this this idea that you you police the discussion along incredibly narrow lines that happened to surround your own comfort zone and call everything outside it not just stuff I don't agree with or things that I would argue with or debate with but hate speech it's just I think very very dangerous down the road you can see exactly the trail that bit of gunpowder goes to I can where do you think it goes I think he goes to a point where people become cynical about any any claims made about anyone and the likelihood is that if 99 times you've seen Sam Harris Douglas Mary Joe Rogan Jordan Peterson whoever called hate speech then the hundredth time that somebody uses the term hate speech might be on somebody who is engaging in hate speech and all your defenses are gonna be down you've got nothing you're very likely to become a very unlikely sorry to become skeptical and think I'm really gonna dig down this let's don't have time we don't have time to find out every single thought and word that someone has uttered or thought and so it seems very likely to me that down the road very very bad people are able to get through the gates because we kept on making the erroneous claims frivolously for our own short-term gain and for our own short-term comfort and we'll end up basically bringing the gates down completely I agree with you and I think there's been a lot of discussion lately as well that I agree with were when you make these ridiculous claims about conversations you you empower you actually empower radical people who oppose left-wing ideology yeah they get more extreme you empower the extremists because they know that you are incorrect they have evidence of it they see your ridiculous behavior and the other really disturbing aspect of it is these are the people that are distributing speech right I mean think about how many discussions are viewed daily on YouTube it's stunning ya know there are there's so much I mean we're at the beginning of this aren't we because I mean there's a long way for this to run yeah long way for the censorship to run too long you can't help thinking among other things that the people trying to make the rules at the moment have no idea of the fact that these debates have happened before right well have not bothered to look into them and seemed to think that history started with them and I just wish that among other things with social media people realized we have been through this several times before at least and and the lessons are pretty clear they are not that you can limit speech in order to attain political Nirvana for instance nor are they that you can simply use they say for short-term gain accusations you know to be wrong right in order to further a short-term political goal we know all this we've been through it printing press we went through it with John Stuart Mill we went through it with Milton I just wish these people had any idea of the fact that history started before their parents conceived them well it's such the the whole culture of tech today is such a progressive thought bubble it's it's an echo chamber and it's very very hot like I said it's better that they're really progressive and open minded and left-wing and radical right-wing I think it's better yeah no I agree I mean if by radical what right-wing you mean you know yes yeah of course although these people have all as I say all the ability to create those people right with any power did empower them which is something you don't want actual racists and Nazis to have legitimate grievance claims and you don't want them to be able to disguise themselves of something they're not so I said I had a friend who a lot of friends involved in the Northern Ireland conflict many years ago in the UK and all that many years ago one writer had a beautiful phrase about where you got for stage where everyone was killing everyone he said you also got the stage where truth was whatever you were having yourself and we're not far away from that that place where I say what you call is hate speech you say what I say is hate speech let's call the whole thing off we're not very far away from there actually yeah it's it's very strange that this this echo chamber is being so reinforced and that very few people are stepping out and saying well wait let's take a look at this objectively you know the people that do do that are signaled out as being racist or sexist or homophobic or transphobic Blanc whatever is convenient yeah and if it is not surprising that more people don't want to stick their heads around perfect because I mean if you had a normal job you worked in a normal office or shop or something you you really would don't want this coming towards you right I mean this this can tear apart and tear down people who spend a lifetime demonstrating they are not nothing that they're being accused of so if nobody knows anything about you you have no particular persona out there you have no particular back record you don't want this thing coming to tear your life down right because recovering from that accusation is almost impossible and would take you forever it is basically impossible and all that you do along the way is to keep reminding people of the charge yes true and if you were to ever win on a technicality like everyone would have forgotten yeah oh yeah that's the that's the racist that's the rapist I mean I here was pro rape isn't yeah I remember him it's so simple but it's I feel like we're in some strange adolescent stage of communication and there's been a bunch of talk lately there's there were some something that I treated earlier today some new technology that they believe where AI is going to allow people to literally see other people's thoughts right and I am I mean I am forever optimistic but also terrified and my feeling is that our transition from language here this new AI system can see what you are thinking which is just what the hell does that mean I'm I'm concerned but also optimistic I feel like we're in this transitionary period from regular communication to written communication to written communication online right to speech online video online where there's this instant access to all this and these ideas are being debated and tossed around like beach balls in real-time and ideas are being distorted people's positions are being distorted for other people's gains and that there is this willful misuse of the truth yes that something is going to come along that's going to combat that but at what price I mean I can't see what would come along to do it other than people rebelling against it their own free will as it were doesn't seem like that's happening though it seems like there's there's a few people that are wrecked like yourself and there's many others that are recognizing the problem with this just people talking about the problem of it online but for the most part the mass of people are engaged in this and it's also its idea sport there's idea sport going on where their side they want their side to score sure well that's almost all politics in your country at any rate yeah at the moment is how can we make sure that the other side trips up on this I thought this I've written this all through the me to era that in in your country and in mine people basically are willing to go for somebody who was a opponent who does something very minimal and they're willing to defend somebody on their own site who does something bigger yes and you can see it all the time it's just there are different standards that apply it to your own side than apply to the other and people don't seem to be hiding it very much anymore not at all and they really don't have the ability to hide it no we had a case recently in the UK where somebody who was a great hero to the left all sorts of complicated reasons was is accused of some fairly um very serious groping accusations when how this and exactly the left-wing MPs who had been claiming that somebody who'd sent out a tweet about a woman's breasts in 2009 should never hold any role in public said that this person who just happened to be a friend and an icon of theirs was a changed man and we have to recognize his 18 months ago now my favorite video on this was there was a guy who is some religious Christian man on television and he was talking about Trump and he was talking about who Trump was before he became president he goes but I don't know about you but I found Jesus and I did not have a past but praise Jesus and he's saying this in everyone's channel he whoever he was before he found Jesus right as if Trump got into office was like you know what I'm a new man I found Jesus I got the Jesus past all that stuff that I did the last 70 years some people fear - that is there was a Janis Malcolm Muggeridge a very distinguished figure in the media and some years ago but who it was often noted that his he converted to Catholicism and he a mutual friend once said that it was noticeable that Malcolm Muggeridge always attacked a vice immediately after he had become incapable of it himself when it was clear the Margaret didn't have as much sex as he did fairly often in his youth sex was a big problem it's a giant problem and need to let everybody know yeah virtually signaling to the highest degree let everybody know this is awful all that pleasure and flesh stop it I wouldn't have it I had a lot of it but I won't have it anymore not in my bedroom it's just I don't know man I'm just I'm hopeful I'm hopeful that we're gonna work through this but I'm also disturbed because no one's at the wheel there's no there's no particular logical human being that's out at the wheel that has a real rational sort of a solution for all of these issues it's just chaos and infighting that the problem is again it comes back to thing about the truth being whatever you're having yourself we don't have anyone that we might mutually agree on as some kind of vampire yeah I mean that's that's becoming that's becoming part of the problem who I mean I very suspicious of any umpire put forward but but oh where would you roughly look for one I like to think that truth still matters but you know when you discover that a lot of people don't seem to particularly care for it or willing to sacrifice it as I say for some other purpose including winning a goal it's hard to see how you could adjudicate in this era but just one other thought was in it which is a lot of this has to do with whether or not the online world can forgive this seems to me to be a really central thing one of the one of the things that came up the case I said recently about this 2009 case or somebody in Britain who tweeted about a woman's breasts among other things was he mistook Twitter for a conversation with friends and I mean he's in public office no no journalists okay and but was was going to get a public office anyhow but the point is is that you know we don't really know what the rules of that are I mean like what if you were a bit of a dick ten years ago like that right on a medium that people were still finding their way on and now you are genuinely and moved on kids right and and yet the the breast tweet is always with you I mean it's it's a sort of dystopian nightmare that you'd always be stuck with your worst joke right you'd be stuck with your lowest so a crassest moment this came up recently with Bill Maher right Bill Maher there was something that he wrote I think in 1989 right which is insane I mean 29 years ago he wrote something and people used it recently against him and 29 I don't know how old Billy is I don't think Bill is even 60 so we're talking about something that he wrote when he was in his 20s he was a struggling stand-up comedian the the that's very good for this isn't it sometimes you can you can you can dig up everyone everyone's made everyone screwed up from you you know apart from yourself it's we had somebody a recently in in Britain who who ever wanted to go for suddenly and and they found an article he had written about saying he didn't agree with Holocaust denial laws he said he just thought it was a bad idea for free speech you know when the when the internet was for a second trying to find out other stuff about him they found an article which said I'm a Holocaust denier so you know prosecute me sort of think which he isn't the Holocaust tonight it's just nobody bothered to read beneath the headline and so suddenly in the middle of the thing where everyone was telling about his life they also said Andy's a Holocaust denier that was like something he wrote 15 years ago and it wasn't even something you wrote it's a headline of something and yeah never again nobody cares get on to the next victim everyone's are not see you know it it's almost like people I mean it's obviously the case of living glass houses and throwing tons of rocks but it's almost like everyone is just trying to throw as many rocks as they can before rocks start coming their way because they know it's inevitable well I I thought I thought until fairly recently finding error was to prove everyone else was a racist Nazi misogynistic transferred and then you win you somehow coronations yeah everyone say you're the person who's good but now yes it seems everyone is aware that it's it's it's Mexican gunfight yeah I have a friend of mine who'd been on this podcast before back when he was a radical left his name's Jamie kill Steen and he's a stand-up comedian and he was a real radical social justice warrior male feminist lefty and they turned on him radical what did they do horribly well they found out he was trying to have sex with girls that can another one and it was all it was just having sex it was it he mean he mean he didn't rape anybody and grope anybody he just you know he threw some passes right and and and Amina unless passes are 100% successful yes yeah oh yeah the same exact pass could be your future wife right right and this one just fell 15 yards short no room error but he he took a long time off of social media and a long time off of performing and he came on he's really brave about it he talked about who he used to be and he said he was in this frantic state where he was just constantly attacking people just attacking people and then checking his Twitter I see who responded to that attack and where people are on his side you know are people agreeing with him as he getting those social justice points that he wanted and he was really honest about the feeling that he got that anxiety that I think a lot of people engage in on a daily basis a lot of if you go to people I there's a quite a few people that I follow that seem to just always be in conflict and I just go to watch I'll just go to their page almost like I'm watching a fistfight in a backyard right and they're just it seems like this is their addicted to this constant seesaw of emotions in this interaction it clearly is it releases the necessary chemical in their brain they get they get upset when they step away from for a bit I don't engage in any of that that bit of it because I've seen certainly a lot of the most mediocre minds of my generation brought low by this yeah I mean there are some people who I admired until I followed them on social media and and now I just think you know you're the shouty angry person who is like a drunk at closing time desperately flailing around your fists are looking for somebody to fight with yeah and and to what end you know I mean yes the other another experience I had I've had in recent years that led me to not want to engage in this is is walking around in various events in sort of breakout things you people who are you know people I've admired in the past all saying things like do you see that as you see I flamed X on Twitter I do see what I eat about that person I I think these used to be serious people ya know some these used to be serious people engaged in serious things and here they are engaged in these four flailing fistfights and often often let's face it on things which if you didn't do it like that seeking out the fight are the sort of thing that would allow for normal human interaction I mean how many disagreements do we have with people in our personal lives all the time if we wanted to right you didn't vote this way that way I mean some people would mind about that but you know I I know you thinks like differently for me on this particular issue you don't say let's have that out now once and for all um you found ways to live with people's difference and different opinions and I mean you're not gonna get everyone exactly in line I mean that we all knew that before the age of social media and now it seems to be the only aim what do you think that is I mean think it's what we were discussing earlier that it's idea sport and then you just get caught up and like someone volleyed your way and so you have to smash that tennis ball back their way it is something like that I mean I I can't say I haven't felt the vicarious pleasure of some of that myself the old Chinese proverb about sitting by the river watching the bodies of your enemies float by I had a big sense of that the other day when somebody I deeply dislike came a cropper on social media at the same time as somebody else I deeply disliked was being held by the French police on serious charges and I thought that was a I felt like the Chinese proverb they're that's alright and so I can I can see why people feel it sure and of course people who they could never normally get to who they've got to write I mean I think that's I think that's the big the big thing of you know look I poked that you know one in the ass yeah I never engaged on social media for precisely that reason am i that reason to my father's that you would never I would never want somebody to know they could get to me even if they even if you just block them there's many people who take pride even in their heading they say I am blind on Twitter by all these people and and actually I do sometimes read what people say is send to me and I've never blocked anyone because I sort of think you should mind if you put your ideas out that you might as well be as open as possible to receiving them back some time ago when I got into a row with the with the Turkish president about about something I got all these Turkish sort of accounts saying he said there's one guy just repeatedly sent me pornography of animals having sex it's very it was very hardcore and and so I used to go down the feet there that guy and I didn't even block him actually because I sort of thought well somewhere in Turkey it's a really angry man desperately finding horse pornography to send it to me and in a way I felt so sorry for him that that was how his life had come ugh you know the end his life had come to at this stage that I I couldn't even block him and also he'd be like I'm the donkey porn guy who got blocked by dog value he'd get a certain faith what was his motivation for sending you this stuff he I had it was because well the short story is a cover years ago the Pataki's president tried to get the German Chancellor to imprison a German comic for a very rude poem he'd read on air on German television that was insulting about the Turkish president and the German authorities actually started a case against the comedian for insulting the Turkish president Edwin and I decided to launch a an offensive poetry competition to offend the Turkish president and there was a thousand pounds cash prize and it sort of took off and in the end the now foreign secretary entered and won what yes really great yes it was really good because at at the same time that the Germans were looking at imprisoning a comedian the the now foreign section of the UK was guilty of precisely the same alleged crime I II mean he wasn't a crime it couldn't be a crime a couple other people did a wonderful Dutch comedian friend Hans Johnson sort of did a similar thing a time he decided to do an interview live on Dutch television the explaining how much he hated everyone because he still owed him money from the blowjob he'd given Edwin in a sauna and the Dutch authorities were looking at actually looking at they were asked if they would prosecute him but anyhow but but this was this was I have great time with this of course and I wrote a limerick explaining how abusive I wanted people to be about Edwin that it was necessary to be highly defamatory and you wouldn't get away with it if you just called him a wanker or something so I wrote the opening verse and invited the world to contribute which they did and it became among other things the highest paid poetry competition in the world if like me you wrote a limerick for just five lines this is 200 pounds of light I mean no no poetry magazine can pay for such such such work so anyhow on the base of that I became very very unpopular in Turkey and there were many and many pieces talking about how this gay atheist terrible Edwyn hater in Britain was exactly what we were up against so him any poems oh my god Wow so the German government was actually considering yes prosecuting this guy how far did they take it he was taking over questioning I know he had to retain lawyers fairly sure they did only drop it in the end because of the international attention that was paid to it there was this you see there was this law on the books that still settle as a majesty law about defending foreign rulers and he had he had done it for such an important reason as well which was to say you know we in Germany should have the right to be read about ever particularly erred on who you know from was promoted from heir to Prime Minister now to president wants to be sought on you know I mean he he's a very bad man locked up more journalists per capita I think than any other country in the world other than China which I don't think we can get the stats on a very very evil I think man who is led his country backwards in the last 20 years and is in the process of trying to destroy a wonderful country and if you can't be rude about him if you can't pretend that he sleeps with animals which is what the German comedian started with then somewhere down the line you might be able to say anything about the imprisoned journalists either and so on and since also by the way people don't seem to spend much time worrying about the Turkish journalists at 1:00 in prisons the least they paid attention when I said that he and Angela Merkel got up to really filthy filthy acts in well obviously the worst case of retaliation for humor is probably Charlie Hebdo right I mean which is a yeah terrible and unfortunately many people weren't defending the murder but we're talking the murderers I mean I think how many I think was eleven people murder police and the police officer they but they were saying that instead of concentrating on the murder which was done completely out of this reinforcing their rules of their ideology and in retaliation for any mocking of that ideology instead of that they were talking about how racist Charlie Hebdo was yeah there was a lot of that in fact my friend Jamie kill Steen was a part of that right he was on television back in his super social justice warrior days talking about that don't you wish among other things people said no I'm not talking about something if they don't know about it yeah you know my guess was that until until the murders I mean an infinitely small number of people knew about Charlie Hebdo outside of France right I found myself in the wake of that in studios with people who I know had just googled Charlie Hebdo the day before I know that they'd just gone to Wikipedia and groan and read an English version of a claim about what that magazine was about goes back first thing but my point about the journalist and the Holocaust denial thing that just route around a bunch of people being killed this doesn't seem to vindicate my side's ideology therefore let me find what I can do to defame them and oh good somebody that Sharlee up doe once did this cartoon that was off-color and I can't understand what the the words are beneath it but I'll claim it's racist I mean people were actually doing that yeah there actually there were there was a there was one cartoon that was used against Charlie Hebdo after the massacre that was a joke against the frontier now and the claims they were making about a black woman in Sarkozy government but because they were the joke in the if you didn't speak French it wasn't clear it apparently but and if you knew nothing about recent French history you knew nothing about the socio Sarkozy administration and and up and the Minister in question these people just went to it and said racist cartoon hmm not noticing that the cartoon was actually a joke about racists but they didn't they didn't bother to find that out and I thought that I thought that whole thing among many many other things was deeply worrying from that point of view because it means that in the immediate aftermath of something that should be so damn clear a bunch of people can just try to reframe the narrative yeah and and change the history of a publication yeah claim it is just something different and and a lot of people of course that was very that was very convenient because after all if charlie hebdo's staff actually were these racists then you know you didn't need to too much about them all ye had been silent on the issues they'd spoken up about yeah the narrative had then been that these people had been mocking this disenfranchised marginalized group right in society and that they had it coming yeah in some very strange way and it's boy part of me struggle with that because I was like is this some people just have contrarian instincts everybody's going left they just go I don't like it and they want to go the other way there's so many people that have that instinct and then there's as you said before this headline mentality they read the headline and don't look any further into it even if it's a headline about a headline right it's theirs that's all they need they're armed with enough facts they slam their laptop down and start debating yeah and and in that cases in many others totally lose sight of the only thing that matters the only thing that matters in that case being is it ever right to make apologies for people walking into an office and gunning down people of an opinion you don't like the other side which has to be of course no has to be has to be no yes and yet in these moments so we had 120 years before with the Rushdie affair the Satanic Verses affair in these moments you discover that you don't have the Allies on your side you thought you did in the wake of the Rushdie affair in 89 it was people from the right and the left in Britain who started making excuses for the Ayatollah you know we had the the chief rabbi then of the UK Jacobus to his to to his shame said both mr. Rushdie and the Ayatollah have offended people's feelings as if Salman Rushdie had in you know called on all novelists to go to Tehran assassinate the Ayatollah if they had a chance you had somebody like a right-wing conservative minister Jeffrey Howe who said that said that a bush he had done had really offended Britain he'd been rude about Britain as if I'd had anything to do with anything there one there was one famous case of a conservative Pierre who said about Rushdie that he it wouldn't bother him if a group of young Muslims took mr. Rushdie into an alleyway and taught him some manners see and you had that from the left as well Bernie granted Labour MP famously said at that point that burning books wasn't a problem for him and that was when they were burning the Satanic Verses in Bradford so so you get these weird coalition's of people who suddenly turn out not to get the point not to get the point not want to defend and then of course you get the cowards who say things like well it wasn't my sort of novel you know I I didn't think the novel was all that good i Midnight's Children I could cope with but versus he'd lost me with a plot as if that means that then you can call for the death of the author rather than just give it a bad review how is he now Salman Rushdie he's still in hiding I know he does a lot of interviews now and it seems to be more relaxed yes he seems to be I don't know the the specifics he there was an assurance I think given some years ago in the labour year a Labour government that with Tehran that they would not actively encourage the murder of Rushdie anymore how nice how nice of them that's a freezing of relations unfreezing relations but but you know the point I want to make was that that's again we've all we've been through these things we know how it plays out with the Charlie Hebdo events the murder of the staff and the contributors to that magazine we knew in the median aftermath what was going on and that that there were people who just wanted to make excuses and you still hear that everywhere I mean I I've heard it on every single free speech debate in my adult life I remember the diversity debate I was growing up and I remember in every one of the things in recent years from the Danish cartoons to the jewel Medina scandal publisher in london's firebomb for publishing a novel that was actually amazingly fawning about Muhammad - Sharlee Abdul and since you you just get these this strange group of people from brightened left some believers some non-believers who always just come up with his bullshit bullshit arguments and and say things like well I didn't find the cartoon very funny or I never I never took that magazine seriously I didn't think it was right when they did this and it's just they just don't for some reason have the fortitude to just save you anything that matters and them in the wake of that which is know do you think that's because Islam is unique in their approach to anything that goes outside the lines of what they feel is oh absolutely acceptable I mean in terms of like they will murder you if you drama ha this is this is this is what's been described as the internalization of the fatwa mmm if if I'm sure you've had this experience man it's actually worse now that the presumption is worse than the actual reality I have quite often people say to me now I'd like to write this piece about X but I don't know if I can because you know yes death sentence and actually I always say what are you talking about right it fortunately so far I haven't given that advice and the person's then being in any way under any actual danger let alone being killed right but and I think I might feel differently if that was the case but but that's but there is a an overcompensation occurring at the moment and it goes far far within the within the boundaries of what actually could plausibly get you into any trouble whether or not the trouble is you know legitimate to get into or not so that now yeah I've had many journalists in recent years particularly since charlie updates will sidle up to me and say well and and then I'm talked about for like very basic reporting and things they're not people saying hey I decided to draw a great big cartoon of Mohammed with a great big dick and you know having sex with the Pope or some you know it's not that it's never that it's never people saying I'm really just so keen to draw Mohammed today Douglas what did I do it never is that it's always something way way way down mmm I'm thinking of even like saying something critical of certain regimes so so the internalization on the fatwa since 1989 which has been exacerbated now by the killings of Charlie Hebdo and elsewhere and the attacks on those you know as Posten and EMA means that we are in this period where where people have really hyper hyper sensitive and they really shouldn't be because it really isn't that bad it's not as bad as they think but this is you know you can do so much work if you if you say to people I've got Kalashnikovs on my side I mean the extent and people in free societies I gather really really loathe to admit this but it's the classic bounce it's the classic sort of a mob trick you know knocking on someone's door I'm very disappointed in you but my friend here my huge friend is is really angry and I'm just holding him back you can do an amazing amount of work if you're willing to pull that kind of trick and if you can persuade people and it's actually the case that there are people you're holding back then you can make enormous inroads like that especially when there's actual evidence that people have been murdered and happened absolutely one of the more fascinating things about Charlie Hebdo to me was the refusal of any of the mainstream media to show any of the cartoons yes you had to go online and I felt like this was a they gave up the reins of information to the Internet hoon it was it was a real transitionary moment in our culture yes everyone went online to see what they yeah a place to go apart from your parents you know I mean they were still under the impression that these must be you know incredibly pornographic cartoons that were really really viciously attacking somebody but know most be anyone young can could find this out themselves and you're right that they gave up the other space to the net and they all they all had again these sort of rubbish GI arguments of their own about it I tried in Britain to get the press to do it at one go and a couple of days after the massacre and got pretty close that if everyone's there I am Spartacus tactic if everyone did it at once then okay but it would make it easier and the argument you always get about that is and it's a very persuasive argument is that the editor of the mayor of the magazine or newspaper might get protection so on but you know a girl from the typing pool sort of thing mm-hmm and which is what happened actually in some of the Satanic Verses killings and stabbings and things you know acts in norwegian translators japanese translate you know it is people who under no security protocol could possibly end up all getting protected and and on the basis of fearing that the boss who almost always says now one of the more uniquely American responses to the Charlie Hebdo attack was they had a drama Hamid contest in Texas yes I followed that yeah that was fascinating and some guys showed up and started shooting at the building and they were killed almost immediately yes which is because they're in Texas and that's just not the place to fuck around true although I mean it's worth mentioning I mean the the the editor of Charlie Hebdo had police protection mm-hmm Harris and they just I mean I suppose they're not worth dwelling on but I've been there they the the the the battle trained people who were sent from Yemen yeah who carry out that operation we just were better prepared than the French authorities realized well very few people are really ready to militarize cartoonist officers yes and that's really almost what you would have to do you would have to have you know Navy SEALs of bulletproof vests yes and they locked and loaded and then let's face it I mean the whole thing then you do start to question you know like well is this cartoon that funny right yeah and that's what they actually have done it Charlie if they have them they did a little while ago say look we're not gonna keep doing this well didn't they have Muhammed making out with someone like almost immediately and yeah immediately after that's right yeah but after about a year or so they they stopped they said they didn't want to do Muhammad again and and and you can't blame them I mean this is the thing isn't it you I'm sure you have this experience but in these sort of times I always get people on the apart from the Turkish donkey porn guy other people on Twitter send me things that you know well why don't you draw Muhammad right sort of stuff sure and first of all I mean I'm not a cartoonist but secondly the the way in which this is always presented is amazing because it's always fun like Xena Warrior Princess 1293 you don't have the guts to draw Mohammed Murray and you know like well well you don't even know where the guts have your own name on Twitter mate so but but there's there's a bit of aching a lot happens in those cases I don't want to draw a Mohammed I don't want to piss people off by drawing the cartoon but what I do want to point out is that you if you if you don't defend people's rights to draw things without getting murdered yes and you're living in an insane society yeah and and there's a another thing which is we all know what comes next I mean my point about this has always been think of something smaller than a cartoon to do right okay I mean I've still reserve the right to be amazed we call something a cartoon crisis and keep it for straight face right I hope you know we're gonna have to militarize in Garland Texas because there's a cartoon crisis but you know natural progression can easily be you are you're not allowed to draw the cartoon then from there you're not allowed to speak of drawing right and then from there you have to show that you have a very certain idea in your head of what is good and what is bad so you have to show that by verbalizing something so you're forced to force to verbalize something and and let's face it it's not as if it's just the cartoon that's the problem is it I mean it's a novel it's a short oh and so forth it's anything and that's one of my big beefs about this is that I don't want to not say what I think is true and even if that does offend you know one point three or four billion people as is often said and interns that are not entirely unthreatening if if Charlie Abdul or somebody else can't draw a cartoon of Mohammed then then I know that exactly in tandem with that is somebody saying and you Douglas or you Joe you anyone else can't say what you find in the texts or what you think about this religion and you can join the rest of the society in being brave and you know going to the Book of Mormon on a Friday night for a laugh and it is a laugh but don't you dare think of applying to Islam the same kind of speech you would apply to Mormonism right and and that that I that I won't do I just I just won't join in on that and despite there being you know a price to pay for that but I just won't not say what I think is true in these matters are you aware of what they did with South Park yes South Park South Park it got very crazy where they not only could not draw Muhammad they couldn't draw Muhammad in a bear suit so then they hadn't have Mohammed in a bear suit in an armored car so you couldn't even see him but it was implied that Muhammad was inside the armored car in a bear suit and still but they did my hommies voice didn't they Muhammad like went yeah they you think I said that was like as long as you joke about the voice of Muhammad you okay but don't you dare show him it's fucking insane but it's really weird as well because because again they all make presumptions it's just not true it's not true that nobody ever drew by Hamid it's not true there are illustrations in books that are still on sale of very old illustrations of Muhammad through throughout his lamech history that's before they knew better bro didn't know better they got a new note from Muhammad Muhammad like look I don't like these fucking drawings me and not yeah come on people they don't show my best side and but but this is this is this is a very strange position to be in because South Park ends up yes holding the line then South Park yes I really like you know fatwa against South Park well I didn't see that headline coming and again everyone internalizes and everyone thinks well you know IIIi don't mire them in their Mormon work but I won't not sure it follow them in their Mohammed work so and then the whole coach it tilts it and that's that's I think where we are at the moment on this and I I've just you know the cartoon will never be funny enough the joke will never be funny enough a novel never be good enough and so on and and then in the end the speech will never be worth speaking enough I a little while ago had to make very clear experience this I read about on the radio in Britain where I was in discussion with a modern cleric who's a sort of reformist figure and Meyer in some ways who in a discussion about something said well you know also Mohammed Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was was he took criticism in his early he took criticism very very well he never minded people criticizing him I like that's absolute crap that is real crap I mean whatever else you say he Muhammad not really good on this on the criticism of himself bit and I gave an example of a female poet s who he had killed because she criticized him and this guy went absolutely apeshit and refused to continue and so on and because you gave an actual because I gave historical example from his own religious texts and and in the end it was a pre-recording day and the end the BBC were like it was can you find another way of trying to make the same point and you know and that was what we had to do I mean I mean another way of making the same point yet rather than pointing out the historical exact same that showed that Muhammad did have a female poet killed yes you just what other way would there be to make that point that is hard but that's the ultimate way to make that exactly which is by pointing to the texts and the facts but you know I can think of no other situation in which somebody has veto rights like that yeah in a normal discussion and it's because they were terrified of the retaliation yes I mean I knew everyone in the production box was like oh no what's Douglass done so how can we stop it affecting us what was his clerics response to that he yeah he just he went yeah they're a bit nuts and wouldn't continue unless I you know wouldn't say that and so what did he deny that it was in the tent oh yeah yeah I said I was making it up and has a liar I'm used to that but that that's a crazy thing for him to say when someone can just read the text yeah but they have they're banking on nobody doing that well no this day and age don't bank on that yeah this is this is one the releasing things isn't it because although it's true you can like suppress a lot of this you know we do live in an age when basically anyone can google and find texts and they can destroy a time did a billion people of read I'm not sure they've read it but yeah well possess it they don't know how many people you think read it how many really think read the Bible like if you had a like gasps there are number of Christians in this country there are those tests on that they'd sometimes to the human society invaded a few years ago asking very basic questions and self professed Christians about their knowledge of the texts and very few my favorite is self professed Christians with religious tattoos like hey man you got to read the whole book like you are literally showing on your skin right that you didn't read the whole book didn't pay attention don't do that yeah this is Leviticus is in Leviticus that's got the implications against writing like you know if you read a little bitty there's a heck of a lot you can't do if you if you go down where are two pieces of different cloth yes exactly yeah Leviticus is a wonderful book it's going it's very good for the mohair what Leviticus wasn't the one which was the book where the guy called upon the she-bear to kill children who were mocking his baldness do you know about that one my favorite special on bald guy this guy was getting mocked by children fucking kids and God called upon a she-bear to come down and tear apart these children who were making fun of his bald head here uh-ohhh lash and the two bear two kings yeah look at that Wow went up to pass if you were going to intervene in human affairs for anything this would be the time that's got a step in Jung kid young kids came out from the city and mocked him and said to him go up you bald head go up you bald head which is very mild and when he looked behind him and saw them he cursed them in the name of the Lord all caps then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up 42 lads of their number and he went from there to Mount Carmel it's like you know deal it's over got it done and that's that's yeah that's my favorite reading from Scripture was the one at the end of one of the books that come which one it was I was a chorus when I was young I always made me laugh there was a this did the destruction of the city of Nineveh it really in it finish is I think not any faces chapter of the whole book it says you know and and lo in that in that city were forty thousand human souls that were destroyed and had also some cattle cattle just by disassociation some cattle bad cows there are bad cows some of those cows too but no the rather bald-headed one that's very that's that's a yeah that's a heck of a time to you know to tread into human descent even an insult you know all dead no your bald head is just an accurate description the I mean that is not an insult if you like you ugly sloppy bald-headed loser okay yeah then maybe God need to step in and see some wolves to attack you and vitamin D specify that they're female yeah yeah why is it female 32 number yeah 42 kids two bears for those of subhead those are some bitch-ass kids need to learn how to run that doesn't even make sense how the fuck those bears even catch all 42 of those kids what kind of kids are they raising over there in Bethel they're well they're all sitting around waiting their turn yeah I mean trying out cuss words til one causes the Bears to calm down you shaggy bear that didn't work you Shaggy's mangy dirty stinky bear head yeah there's so many of those stories that are so strange but I've been I bet I bet that that most if we were to go to the the people who say that their questions in the polls and ask him about we don't even need to go the baldhead bear right I'll catch them it is they don't except though most people don't even bother reading that cuz it's just it's almost too crazy yeah but but but yeah the very very little knowledge even about very basic things you know even Commandments and so on all right so that's the case with the religion that America and Britain is known best with Christianity so there's no reason to assume that that's not the case with Islam as well isn't that just the case with people I mean it seems to be the same thing that we're talking about with headlines someone reads the headlines they don't bother reading into it and then they accuse someone or something it's almost like with religion I'm a Christian and I'm a Christian man oh really please tell me about the Bible right it's um there's something better I've often thought this is one of the reasons why there's it's possible to get a certain fanaticism going within Muslim communities on some issues to do with mass for me is I think is to do with a realization of this you said that this was the case about our prophet I didn't know there I he did what I had this all my life with with arguing with Muslims about things the they very rarely know for the problems in their own tradition and when you bring them up what he did what like the Christians with the bald ben and and this causes a really serious problem for them because they are told from the cradle that that they are following a religion founded by the most perfect man imaginable and if you discover that if you it's like you know no there's no description of Helen of Troy in the ancient texts why does nobody describe Helen of Troy why didn't nobody say did you know she was a sort of this beautiful blonde ringlets order it's because it actually catches on as a theme because everyone makes Helen of Troy their most beautiful woman if you start to describe you me like I'm not into redheads everyone would Helen of Troy becomes a person upon you whom you put all of those things and in the same way Mohammed becomes if you say is the perfect human being the people will just throughout their lives put the kind of things they think are perfect on to Mohammed you must be very kind very generous very caregiving and so on so that if you then say well what about when he then did this I think it just causes an extra hurt this is something they'll have to get over of course because I mean we can't go away and not rather identify these for these issues but it causes in the short term an enormous enormous pain I have a an example I gave recently in a book of them somebody I spent some time with couple years ago an extraordinary man called Morten storm he was a Danish bikers a big in a biker gang and in Denmark went to prison and in prison about 2000 or so he converted not just to Islam he converted to al-qaeda basically he's not a not a common person in any way and he ended up being the main go-to person for so our Lackey was a head of al-qaeda in Yemen and in fact was asked to give him up get a wife our Lackey to supplement his wife collection and a Morten storm a lot of things ended up falling out with al Qaeda and ended up working for the CIA and Danish intelligence and ended up helping lead them to our Lackey who was then droned by Obama in 2011 or so anyhow I once said to MotorStorm what was the moment that made you get out of al-qaeda and he has such a fascinating answer he because he came out of al-qaeda and Islam at the same moment he says what was happening was he was sitting in his he was waiting for a package when I'll kind of drop off to get then from him to our Lackey and the the person carrying the package was late and then really late and he was sitting in his apartment somewhere in Germany I think at that point and he was so pissed off about this and he had a laptop that was there on the table and he thought basically how can i express my pissed-off Ness with my al-qaeda colleagues for wasting my time like this so much and he went to Google and he typed in contradictions in Islam and began to read that was how he got out Wow that's what did him in some just late he just started reading again they told me this they never told me that I never knew that and that was so as I say he's a very very uncommon but but I think that might be happening quite a lot more than we know people just googling things finding stuff out for ourselves it's the most dangerous religion to leave because they kill apostates they do yeah so what's how is he dealing with that well he lives in hiding I mean wow yeah yeah fancy may he read a book agent storm two years ago one of the weirdest conversation that I ever saw anybody have with someone who was a believer was Dawkins I think it was yeah was having a conversation with someone in the asked him point-blank whether or not he believed that Mohammed split the moon oh yes I think I know this was with a very close enemy of mine called Mehdi Hassan who worked for Al Jazeera and who Richard Dawkins did a interview with and I think he that's why he fluffed something earlier on Dork is he didn't take him on then he took him on on this that's wrong and I think that Sam said yes yes yes and then it led to this terrible problem which is a really interesting interesting problem of our era which is then dorking said I can't believe that somebody or said afterwards I can't believe that somebody could be a working journalist and believe that you know Mohammed Sloot a meal and a half human horse right and of course I mean I there's a interesting point there yeah but of course we do quite rightly allow people to believe bizarre and insane thing well sure exactly and if we started saying you can't have public office of working journalism if you profess to be of this particular faith then we wouldn't get any way we wouldn't have anyone left and how does the story go Mohammed flew to the moon on a half human horse yeah and split the moon with a sword as I would yeah I counted they could have then been attacked by female bears but I can't no I can't yes he it's the night journey which is central and how the moon get glued back together again is it back together it looks like it is I haven't looked close maybe I need to pay more attention it's just the the fact that a per mile I believe this was a few years ago let's just say it was 2010 that this interview or that this debate took place yes he was around then eight years ago that someone would be comfortable saying oh that they believe that oh you see I got into a little trouble Richard Dawkins got a bit annoyed about me because I took the mickey out of him for dodging the one earlier in that what was the earlier one he a great admirer of it as everyone is sure but he he knows exactly where the cliff edge is hmm and in that interview he he was asked on al-jazeera by this interviewer he read out the bit from The God Delusion about you know as a great bit of rhetoric about the most the God who smokes God is something like the most appalling narcissistic murderous blob of our character in all of fiction is a terrific piece of writing and the interviewer says the Dawkins do you do you stand by that as a description of the Christian God Dawkins says yes this is you stand by it does the description of the Jewish God says yes and then he says and would you say the same thing about the Muslim God and I just knew exactly what's happening at Richard Dawkins says um about the Muslim God I didn't know so much which he as I say he thinks I shouldn't rip him on this and the thing was what I noticed was just I just I know I completely felt he's been a very brave and brilliant writer and thinker on these matters and nobody's done more in some ways but he I knew exactly what was happening he was staring right over the cliff edge and somebody was behind him nudging yeah and that if he had have said as it were live on al Jazeera oh yes Allah you know the total bastard then I don't know maybe yes maybe you're then in real trouble you know and so he stepped back from the brink there and I rather crudely perhaps took the mickey out of him afters for it I said that it was just that Richard Dawkins was demonstrating a survival instinct of his species but I I feel bad about it but it is true it is true but we've all been there to some extent and what was his response to that though to my general criticism he well he basically I think he did take it on board in a way so complex reasons but I know I know he was also annoyed that I was where I think he felt that I was doing that to him then you do it right right and that is very common in that I've had that a lot in my life of in this particular area of people trying to egg me over why don't you say that mmm of course and and you know that they're the people who'll be a million miles behind me oh yeah they would their ears plugged yeah I behind a wall I was a very I was a very very visual aid of it somebody who etches is a terrific reformer in Islam that now and another cleric who once described me he went to fight for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan and you know 30 years ago now and described to me he's not very fighting li-like person but described how he did actually sort of really rile them up to sort of run over and get at the Soviets and he's like you know we're all agreed yes we'll go yes and I go and he guys guys and everyone else stayed in the trench and I've always thought this is exactly the experience of anyone in this area what grabbed eyes is that there's inherent danger and this criticism even that's the discussion right now I'm sure that people right now firing up their webcams and writing blogs and tweeting and getting upset about it yeah it's any rational discussion of that particular subject you could kind of get away I mean I get criticism from Christians but it's not scary right yes that is um that's that is a big difference of the timing isn't it right this is this is something it's just so important about the new ones that almost never gets added in but of course we all just assumed it so we don't think it's worth saying but we are aware that any religion or thought like this could be this dangerous at different phases yes you know we might under wanted to be in Spain in certain points in the last millennium sure we might not have wanted to be a Catholic descent to at certain points or Protestant dissenters others and so on and so forth we all know that yes it's just that at the moment that's pretty question and and quiet and of course it's less quiet here than it is in my country one can't imagine the Anglican Church becoming militant about anything at any point soon you do have some angrier types of Christian here than we have in my country so it's easy for me to think they're slightly less risky at some point in the future than than you might but but it's just that we do recognize this could happen elsewhere as well it's just at the moment it's it's it's not the Quakers they they really don't send me a death threat from one year to the next right rather nice people there's an inherent danger of a retaliation from people who are more radical Christian that if this continues and if you see it more and more of more and more attacks from people of Muslim faith yes you could possibly see a retaliation from people especially in this country like after 9/11 there was an extreme amount of hate for Muslims and irrational hate mostly which nothing directed at Sikhs yes well there was a lot of that out of ignorance they just didn't they didn't I mean that was the most disturbing because Sikhs are pretty interesting people and the fact that they just instantaneously with no information at all no understanding out of complete ignorance yeah attack them I I have a I second no one in my gloominess about some of the things that we're going to go through in Britain and Europe and their coming years but I recently had a reason to even more gloomy about one aspect of it relating to this which is this we had three big bad terrorist attacks last year in the UK including the Manchester Arena bomb 22 young people were blown up on a Monday night for going to hear ariana grande and after the third of those attacks which was on London Bridge went three people who actually known the authorities as they generally are slashed people's throats on the street and ran to borough market as people were drinking and stabbed people while shouting this is for Allah after the third of those attacks it was a fella is this really just gonna keep happening what are we gonna do about it and what can we do and after the Manchester one in particular there was this kind of thing of everyone saying apart John Lennon's Imagine there was this hit don't Lee don't look back in anger and these themes that say we weren't meant to think anything other than that we weren't meant to be angry enemy and then then just terrible thing happened from another direction outside Finsbury Park mosque which the muscular very troubled and bad history in London a guy from Wales in a van drives into the crowds as they're milling around outside the mosque kills one man and injures a number of others that guy by the way just show how complex all this can get is he was tried and guilty last month in the courts in the UK he he had been his office he very mentally deranged and had a history of mental illness and all that sort of thing as very often people do in these situations but he he had watched the BBC drama called three girls which is the first time the BBC had really addressed the issue of the Rotherham Rochdale rape gangs that happened in the last decade in the UK which is still a saw that's going on where about 1,500 girls in one town alone were basically abused by gangs of Muslim mainly Pakistani men and it's a very very ugly business partly because it was so awful that nobody there that nobody at the State at the police level and the arts wanted to look into it and they are now in the governing choir so they they didn't be looking to excel worried about being called racist and there's a Lama phobic and so on the press did a lot of not being interested in this as well eventually after all these years the BBC makes a documentary called three girls about three of the girls who suffered from these rape gangs and then a man in Wales sees it and gets so enraged people say at the local pub he was railing against the bloody limbs and all this sort of thing and then he hires a van and drives in to have a crowd of people outside a mask and you have this awful feeling that the BBC didn't want to deal with the issue that the program was about for years because it was so awful and ugly and sounded like something made up by some kind of nativist racist you know it's had everything and then they do and then it turns out remember the public sees it and drives a van into a crowd yeah I mean you know this this sort of couldn't get more complex and wait so and I thought after that okay maybe maybe the maybe the BBC were right maybe they shouldn't maybe they should cover up the gang rape for 1500 girls maybe the public can't cope with it maybe they will get into vans now as it happens I know the British public I think fairly well and I think that that guy in well is a very very unusual figure I don't think it's very common I don't think everyone's going to do that I don't think we're all like that wicked Madeleine but I don't know I mean I don't know for sure everywhere I don't know what the I don't know what happened in this country with various other countries if there were three attacks like that in quick succession I don't know but this is this is really it is going to get complex it's already complex and the response to it's complex to how do you how do you if you if you are a journalist if you are television channel how do you report on this do you think about the responsibility of alerting someone to these actual real atrocities that's going to force them to react on innocent people that did nothing in front of this mosque that the fact that these people in this mosque or somehow or another connected to these people that did these horrible crimes just by virtue of the fact they're in the same religion that's insane - yeah it's all insane I mean it seems to me the only the only way through it is to say first of all I mean I don't I I really American press all the time I think that it's it's worse than the British press in in in that self-appointed role of believing its task is to stand between the public and the facts you know and sort of negotiate between the to see what they think the public can cope with or shouldn't know and and feed them that the American press seems to me to be rife with that that temptation as ours is but it seems to be the only way around this is to not not give in to that and to try just to publish the facts when they happen because it's just obviously seems to be much work we always know in political scandal what's worst to cover up it's always the cover-up right and that that may be the case with all this maybe maybe the the argument for just the papers explaining stuff that's happened is maybe that's maybe that's all they can do and that it I could just say to them it'd be a lot worse if you bottle this up because otherwise people will get the idea that there is some conspiracy to cover over certain stories and and they'll be on to something in fact if you think about the millions of people that must have seen that the story on the rape of fifteen hundred the fact that only one person responded that way right it's a pretty extraordinary in and of itself yes yes III would have and I would have thought on some of this I mean you know I don't know again I mean there are there are lots of examples one could use but when something bad happens like the Manchester Arena attack I'm amazed in a way that people are so decent I mean I'm so pleased they are but they we really we don't go out looking for people to attack you know that the public certainly Britain I can that happy saying I think it's a monomeric the public we're not really lynch mobs waiting to be got going again but the expectation that we are is the only possibility of creating us in such a way it's only by treating us as if we can't deal with ugly things that go on that you could see the situations where you've again to see the situation in which that all goes wrong in that different way yeah I mean I don't envy their position especially trying to pick up the ball from here yes with all the history and all the terrible things especially in England with so many attacks over such a relatively short period of time where there was a very small hist before yeah it seemed like this immediate eruption of all these issues yes and I mean the country in some ways I wrote about my latest but most is France where yes you the book comes out in translation there in a couple of months time very interested to see what happens because France had of even I mean we mention Charlie I've David that eighteen months or so it had was just I mean again we'd all sort of disappears now every day's got bad news of some kind but you know to have a major Western capital city with 130 people killed in an evening with multiple suicide bombings and people being gunned down from mopeds as they're sitting outside a bar and you know another group of people going into a rock concert and and you know going through the disabled section shooting everyone one by one in the disabled section and gunning everyone else down and catch him in the lavatories and shooting him in there I mean that that happened in one night alone in Paris the Parisians didn't become you know they didn't become wicked terrible people anything but they have I think these I think that the a lot of these terrible events have happened they actually what happens is they sink down to a lower level of our consciousness so that we what actually happens is we we we get over the immediate thing quite fast but that something that the foundational level changes I had a case nobody really wanted to linger on but there was one in in November in the UK on Oxford Street where because of course everyone does after these attacks they always say you know we will not be changed everyone tries to sort of channel the spirit of Churchill and all that sort of thing I in Churchill hear me roar and and so on and and actually the the facts are otherwise in November on Oxford Street there was a wall we know is that there were two men who may have had some disagreement on the platform of a tube Trevor tube platform whatever happened it was misunderstood by crowds and it developed into a stampede out of the tube station then all the way down Oxford Street people were locked and barricaded into the big department stores a pop singer got Olly Murs tweeted out his million followers you know there are shots of being fired I'm in the back room of the store H&M and there's something and other people claim that a truck had gone down Oxford and mowing people down they've seen bodies the police said it was a major terrorist event they were on top of an and the the press were all you know running stories turned out nothing happened nothing happened the next day two men handed themselves into a local police station saying they thought they might have been responsible for it but they were let off without any charge what I'm saying is they thought they might have been responsible for it because they had been in an argument that they'd had an argument maybe they were they they won't say we're responsible healthy but like they were asking for information and they will let go but my point is is that is that we can simultaneously say we will not be cowed and also actually be at the stage where if you just hear a bang yeah everyone goes running you you don't want to be the last person to figure out what's going on so as soon as something you think is happening people in this day and age when there's just this recent history of horrible things happening over and over again in Orlando here I mean there's just so many of them just instantaneously want to react and then like in the Vegas shooting one of the things that was very confusing about the big Vegas shooting is people would go into casinos they would flee from the concert into casinos and then talk about a shooter and then people would say there's an active shooter at Tropicana there's an advocate always happens there's always that's why I never believe immediate aftermath there's always a claim of other shooters there's always a claim of something that turns out not everywhere they were there were claiming their shooters all over the city but there was no actual shooting in these other casinos who was just reports of active shooters that's and by the way if you're interested I there's a fascinating thing about why this happens and I wrote a book some years ago about Bloody Sunday a terrible event in Northern Ireland in 1972 and one of the things I went through all the tests many of everyone who one of the most interesting things was the number of people whose memories were just totally different from what we know happened and you know one of the conclusions I came to was that there's a book by a Harvard professor but they called the seven sins of memory about this but one of the things that clearly happens is after any very traumatic event or very terrible event where people are effectively in the situation of a war zone when they were just shopping or a concert a moment before is that our memories immediately become even more suggestible than they are already and the most obvious thing of suggestibility in these situations is that the situation was was worse around you and you came off better than you did and that's almost always the case the shots that were quite quite a bit away were very close you you you have to your memory without knowing it we all do it our memory tells us we behave better than we did and that the threat was worse because this is our over one of our ways of coping I think mm-hmm but but it's a terrible thing obviously with the I mean with these school shootings and things that are going on here at the moment I mean this is obviously one of the things I watched your podcasts the other day where you were discussing this for the latest one with the Florida and and I think you know in a way bafflement going on in this society about this is understandable yeah the I mean it's the unimaginable horror of being involved in that situation your mind is just not prepared to cope with that I mean maybe if you are a soldier and if you experienced combat exactly and you know how to stay calm and a firefight because you've been at a bunch of them but for the average person I mean it's one of the reasons why I witnessed testimony it's one of the worst pieces of evidence you could ever get including I mean about it about basically everything about fistfights you know anything oh yeah now we all have examples in our lives of seeing you know friends who've been through the same thing we know that they've burned through the same thing and yet they have two totally different right so of course you know what happened I mean that's that's a real problem but now you have this thing here where I mean some ways even worse than we do of the search to notch it up for your own political science yeah or against the enemy yeah same thing with a Twitter the Twitter pointment that I mean this this obscene glee that goes on after any terrorist attack in Europe but I think also here as well the attempt is to immediately call it for the other side or for your side or whatever and to try to use terrible events as a way to justify whatever your own team is yes I have I find it amazing with a gun debate here and I would find it amazing coming from a different society on it but the wages will not shit up for one side or the other in it and it's you've got a real problem on it I've been watching a lot of it from the perspective of the gun owners NRA members and the people that want to defend the idea of having guns even of arming teachers and you're looking at their perspective on it and their perspective on it is all about their rights all about the Constitution all about the bill of rights all about protecting the second Amendment all about its gun ownership being taken away gun ownership under attack the NRA under attack they're coming after our guns and this is this constant battle of ideas it's on Twitter not addressing the actual issue I mean I'm sorry no it's watching this thing harming teachers yeah that's insane I mean this Samuel Jackson had a great quote about it but you mean it's you know he put it on Twitter like someone tell a motherfucker who's never been in a gun fight the problems of arming a bunch of teachers right yes somebody said someone's been in a gun fight please tell ya motherfuckers somebody said somebody said anyone who thinks is a good idea giving teachers guns is clearly never seen one try to use an overhead projector ah yeah there's there's Samuel Jackson look at that three hundred and six thousand likes so you know was an effective tweet check the number it was only yeah you got three tweets it can't be true nobody likes yeah I I thought there was a very pertinent one a few years ago in New York on fifth when somebody shot their colleague and outside the office they came back his disgruntled worker shot the colleague and locally there was some policemen around the corner and they came out and started firing at the guy who'd done it ended up wounding about 11 pedestrian well you would I mean I'm not saying by the way we have we have our own problems but I mean this is a big problem for American what I kind of more guns and we have people I mean I completely understand why the Amendment exists and I think it's a very good idea for the time and I think it's a very understandable idea to hold on to it now but but why can't people say for instance I mean we all have abstract ideas we have to hold on to but we and we all in our countries have like weird things that other people don't understand that I think it's odd to have a hereditary constitutional monarch for instance and right it is weird it's a great way to put it it's strange and if you were starting from now you might not do that but but clearly with the gun ownership thing it is we are willing to take bad things happening quite often because we want to hold on to the Second Amendment well the second amendments been around forever the bad things happening quite often is really from Columbine on I mean there was a few of them before there was the Austin Texas but Tower shootings but it seems to me I mean again I mean just it's such an obvious point and I don't it sound like it's not he Britt his saying something about America that's not at all welcome but it seems obvious that you just you could do a lot more damage with a semi-automatic rifle than you can with a knife and most people we see this in the terrorism as well there are really committed terrorists who don't commit acts of violence unless they can get hold of a the means to do it because we often think well why don't you just like go out with a knife some people do but most people actually want to go out in that way and what they see as being a blaze of glory right so they like stopping them having the means of getting that very easily seems to me very obvious but that isn't to say that I mean of course I think you made a point near the dam it's like saying if you say everyone who has a gun is part of promises and see not because it's like saying everyone who's got a truck is about the problem right but there is there are obviously two things one is the psychological and whatever the social issues are that caused this to keep happening and that that is obviously very very important to try to get to the root of but you can get to the root of that or try to get through to that and also recognize that people having access to some of the weapons they have access to in this country must be a part of the problem it has to be and there also the idea that you should just be able to go out and buy a gun without really understanding how a gun works at all yeah and which is exactly how you do it I got my first handgun license in 1994 that's when I bought my first handgun I just went and bought a handgun I did a background check on me that's it I mean I went to the range they showed me what the safety is pointed this put the earphones on make sure you don't blow your is out bang bang bang and then you leave with a gun I mean once your background checks clear they find out you're not a criminal there's not much to it there's a there's a giant problem with that if you want to drive an automobile you have to show that you understand the laws you have to understand you have to sit with an expert was to sit there a driving instructor they have to go through it with you they have to watch your movements they have to watch you make turns they have to wouldn't wouldn't you imagine that it would be a good idea to have some sort of a clinical evaluation of a person that's gonna gonna buy a gun and here's another thing there was an article recently that was saying contrary to popular belief most school shootings are not committed by people who are mentally ill well that's a fucking stupid thing to say you know why because if you're you're committing a school shooting but you're mentally ill okay period then on top of that what they're ignoring conveniently and this is another headline thing psychiatric medications right these people are almost entirely on some form of psychiatric medication whether it is anti-anxiety pills whether it's antidepressants whether they're they're all I'm not saying that correlation equals causation I'm not saying that but to say that or not this is just a bullshit this is clickbait headlines they're mentally ill 100 percent 100 percent of them are mentally ill there's there's a conservative commentator in the UK called Peter Hitchens who always makes a point after Islamist terrorist attacks in Europe that there's a large number of them as well as other types of attack who seem to be on some kind of medication yes and my point is always I'm very very happy to have that conversation I think we need to have that conversation and we also have to have the other parts of it as well yes you're right to say yeah I can't see why we can't have all of this it's the same thing that we were talking about earlier it's these idea sports right these Wars people don't want to give up their idea they don't want to give up any ground whatsoever on their second Amendment rights whether it's owning a 50 caliber fucking tank gun or whether it's having a gun for home safety or for hunting they don't want to give up anything and they feel like it's a slippery slope the people that I follow online that are tweeting about this on a regular basis if you can go to a lot of them like they're making videos about it Dana lash and Colin it is actually its name is it's not Collins Co Lyon Co Lyon noir noi are he's very very vocal about and i'm reading all the stuff it's like all anyone's taking into account is that this idea that they're coming after your rights right and and emphasizing the idea of a good person with a gun that can protect people in these terrible situations which can happen as well but with what we have to address that's not we're talking about we have to address how the fuck do these crazy people get guns why why are so many people on mental health medications yeah well that's a huge huge I can't understand we always have this sort of wanting to have the conversation about it but there's very little done on it that's one thing I'm very struck with we we have in all our countries I miss slipped into a very weird attitude towards this type of medication yes very weird very just very accepting of something that radically alters the way your mind works I and macaws there's not an incentive drug companies obviously don't have an incentive quite the to look into it but it's another example of the the set of a set of things we should be thinking about at the moment and looking at which we just don't why don't we because it's sort of shut down because we shut it down ourselves I I think it's just such a range of issues this is the case with and it's always the same thing it's always that if you address the question difficult as it might be you are attacking an individual who might suffer from it yeah who might be upset by us addressing the question I mean I have a lot of suspicions about all sorts of things I'm a very you know skeptical person as it were about things that I'm told so I'd like to look into intending I'm amazed at the number of things in our societies that we just don't discuss and they're all the things that we ought to be discussing issues like mental health issues issues that have to do with the social presumptions that are going on left right in the center at the moment where you're not meant to discuss things that have Puffs anything else very very interesting and very important and I just see it everywhere this might by the way so this is a slightly strange segue to make but there was a fascinating one in in Britain a couple of days ago a slightly lighter subject but there was not that much like that but there's a diver in the UK called Tom Daley who married a screenwriter from Hollywood called Dustin Lance Black and it was announced a couple of weeks ago on Valentine's Day that they were having a baby and there was a photograph of them holding a scan they sent out on their Twitter of two men who married who have ultrasounds gear and all of the papers and the BBC and Evan also report is saying Dustin and Tom are having a baby and I mean I'm gay and I'm I don't think I'm homophobic but I look this as a thing how someone else involved I mean you know there's a joke yeah gays a kind of Tim doesn't mean we can't keep trying but I just glued his eyes although nothing in the articles about this tells me anything I would like to know like I know that they didn't just have a roll around and woke up in the morning and one of them was preggers I know that and I know that there has to be a woman involved at some point we know this but we are meant just like adapt okay great cool and it's almost as if it's set up so that somebody says wait isn't isn't isn't a woman isn't there a uterus so that then everyone goes biggert right and and of course somebody did somebody from the Daily Mail wrote a column saying come on to Dad's isn't a new normal sort of thing and of course then everyone piled in on that and all these advertisers withdrew their advertising literally literally until the day before yesterday it was possible to say I don't think you guys can just like have sex and make a child literally that was okay until the day before yesterday and it's not okay today so what will not be okay tomorrow and I just think I think and I wrote about it and and maybe a couple other people ended up doing it too but I think that's really interesting like a lot of this answer I think it's really interesting about this that you are the things that seem very obvious to us are all the things you're not meant to write about almost as if they're like booby traps where you need to go off yeah and and I just think why don't more people pile on in right um because we could have a heck of a time and we might well people don't want to pile in on anything revolve involving gender or sexuality it's too scary it's a landmine field joe they just name it is then walk in especially as you said earlier people with regular jobs yeah if you get called out for being a racist or a homophobe or anything along those lines you're doomed sure it's some manat case anyone who does have a voice as a writer or speaker whatever broadcaster I think has a disproportionate duty to do so right to do so I mean there's no point in just repeating those same new lies there's a disproportionate duty to try to break them down yeah I come I'm one of my favorite quotes that one from HL Mencken who says you know that history was always progressed by jolly fellows heaving dead cats into sanctuaries and going roistering down the highways of the world and I just I I I wish that there were more dead cat heavers it's not a bad job you can make a living sometimes and and it's it's it's one of the only things worth doing if if we're all going to be told lies and expect it to go along with them whether it's about terrorism or gay parenting or mental health or anything else whole set of them it's a really target-rich environment it is and I think there's more people doing that now than ever before but it's more people like you and I who can kind of get away with it yeah I don't know what why do you think you get away with it me yeah cuz you can't take me seriously right I'm a cage fighting commentator and a dirty comedian writing nobody's listening to me and taking me seriously in that regard yeah book sort of it's I just first of all I'm a kind person I think that helps like I'm not a mean person right when I'm saying these things I'm saying these things from I'm going what what the fuck is this like here was one that I thought was really fascinating and this is one of the great example of how strange we get on subjects Caitlyn Jenner when when Caitlyn Jenner transitioned that was the primary thing that people talk about oh my god she's a woman now and it was right after she had been spacing out behind the wheel slammed into a woman and pushed her into traffic and a head-on collision and the woman died and that was almost just completely forgotten yes completely forgotten yes not only that she doesn't believe in gay man right like what your you have the wrong spokesperson I mean you could not have a more wrong spokesperson yeah but yet ESPN and glamour Woman of the Year and these all these different things and athlete of the year yes wearing dresses and fabulous and glam and let's get your chin shaved down right because that's who you really are who you really are is not this person there now you got to you got to shave your chin down it's it's it's big it goes right that thing about the almost as if you're being dead yes you better discuss it I said this to Sam Harris I got him into trouble just on his podcast by saying this and he didn't attack me apparently he got a whole load of transfer of accusations because of me but I said to him I thought what was happening was that we were being asked not only to agree that Caitlyn Bruce Jenner to become Caitlyn general the Caitlyn Jenner was a woman but that but that you had to find her yes Jenny you were just and and I find those those ones are just there was one the other is a bit like that they gave her it's like I dare you you just you just try pretending pretending that Tom and dusting can't happen and and it was the same with those a little while ago there's a boy in Britain who was I kind of whether he he wanted to turn up to school in a dress he's like nine years old and I think there was a row I kind of where the school said yes or no it was a big thing and then it became her way in on the behalf of the nine-year-old trans kid lots of questions to ask there yeah and and then it became the the nine-year-old kid was a was was a became a model for a fashion shoot and then it's like find the nine-year-old boy who said he's a girl attractive and say it's beautiful how much more do you want to push people like no they're rewarding they're like like isn't she lovely right what are you doing to us I what are you trying to make us agree to what what's the cause of all of us you must have been talking about this like what this is this bizarre illogical conversation that falls into these very convenient yeah well cut grooves that you're really not allowed to slide the ideas arrived what's causing this I think it's so many things I one is one is that it's possible this is what happens when the economics goes wrong I've got a feeling the economics I mean is that if people's if people aren't saying like wait it increases in their living senses I mean my generation I know I'm 38 by just above this generation but the generations ever so slightly below me is becoming aware that France it won't get on the property ladder at all maybe property ladder meaning owning a home owning a home the things that their parents generation got not easily by any means but it wasn't the wasn't easy for boomers but that that somehow they're going to have it harder than their parents generation or might not enjoy the living standards that their parents generation enjoyed might be certainly in Western Europe coming home it might be occurring to them what do you do in those search situations you've got to have other things to to get worth from if for instance you're not going to own a home until you're 40 and at that point if you're a woman at your career you need to have children but you can't afford to take the time off work and you might not be able to start a family and then you're trying to start a family in your 40s and it's harder very hard and a whole set of other things like that that are definitely delayed for new generation I think that it's possible I not saying certainly it's it's possible it seems to me that that generation might discover new gods and might want to enforce the new rules just as avidly as the old gods and and there is an element of that going like I can't understand why otherwise every time I talk about the things we talked about there they would just continuously be this very angry reaction not oh that's interesting you know I never thought I know I think probably like you now I mean it's quite hard to shock me it ought to upset me you know that's interesting you know why do you think that but so why do I always get this like we've got to stop him other than that these are new Commandments that we're breaking hmm and and white so and I mean they're all sort of connected aren't they these things yeah they're all attempts to but they're all attempts to something like purity which disturbs me we're sort of if we could just get everything in a row you know you even hear that thing get in your lane yeah that's Oh get in your lane Oh do you think you are what's my lane I think I've said it a few times you know but I mean but only people that needed to stay in their Lane New York I'm different New York Times yes as we disap Lane over okay no I'm reading your times the plane oh and and there's a there's a question as you know agony aren't we call it what do you call self help whatever advice column hmm this woman says she was on the on the train a couple days ago and there was a man who came on with his girlfriend he was being really abusive to her and it just kept happening and he was really it was kind of nasty brawler violence situation she doesn't know what to do other people the care they'll move away isn't and she's and of course you can see what's coming the culmination of it is she says she gets off the train and she wonders whether she should have said something but she says conscious of her white privilege and these people were people of color hmm and I am reading this I'm thinking what you now now if you saw a man of different skin pigmentation from you abusing a woman of different skin pigmentation from you the right thing is not to defend the woman that seems like a just a real justification for being a coward yes but but but I tend the advice was you know you did sort of the right thing maybe you should have spoken to an official certainly but there was no kind of so all this stuff all this weird get in your lane no you know notes your privilege you know way up your privilege I mean that's a good way to make society have a nervous breakdown wake up you're privileged you know it's privileged scorecards I mean my god I am but but all of these things seem to it's almost as if people think if we get the the the lanes correct everything will be sorted and here's a problem is that that first of all the means of doing this are just hideous I mean hideous they accentuate racial difference they accentuate sexual and gender difference they accentuate everything else and the destination is horrible it is not the Nirvana they think that they're creating mmm so this is a really good moment to try to look at some of this and to talk about it and to think about as widely and as freely as we can and yet and yet the effort is to do the opposite I think your honor something with the idea that this radical progressive very restrictive line of communication ideology that we're experiencing we're talking about it's coming from a lot of people that don't have a religion yes they're atheists or they're at the very least agnostics modern progressives very rarely religious yes and this mouse before somebody who's non-belief like myself this is a painful thing to look at but again we have to think about it but that's isn't that an interesting thing as well because you think of yourself as being on a team with these other atheists or agnostics see I don't but you don't but I'm saying as an atheist yourself you have to look at it that way you've already lumped yourself in with them yes III had speaking of camps in the US a while ago and I spoke to a guy who's really really clever skewed and he was a free thinker he said he said the afters we were talking he said you know he'd had some hideous experience at a local free thinker Society you know where everyone's like get in your lane and he was like I thought that being among free thinkers like the rest would all be good they no no no they they're free thinkers turn out to be just as able to be blindfolded if you know on certain things down when you imagine is of course self proclaimed freethinkers would be even more inclined to adopt a rigid ideology they're proclaiming themselves to be a free thinker and and it's possible this comes from that you know the the old Jaguar sensors you know that the sensor knows everything that the people are really into and I spoke once to a band who was on the British Board of Film classification he said all day watching really hardcore pornography deciding what could be legalized so that's you must have a very dark view of humanity it wasn't justice scalia's interpretation of pornography I don't know how to describe it but I'll know it when I see it right exactly like why aren't you our fucking judge and it may be it but it may be that these people but a lot of conservatives have this thing that one becomes rigid about something because you've seen into the abyss because you don't know you might and behave in a certain very terrible way and so you you you want to pull back from that chaos you want to pull other people back as well it seems to me that a lot of so-called free thinkers self designated free fingers may well have these glimpses and may well think I don't know what's holding this together and therefore might precisely for that reason be disproportionately rigid on almost any new ideology that came along get in lane yeah yeah I like this idea that this is almost like a substitution for religion it's almost like there's an inherent need that we have because human beings have operated under these patterns for so long we can't have this yeah yeah it's it's interesting because the more you like we found ways to mock it right and one of the ways to mock it and I think that that's important and that mockery although it seems trivial what it does do is let people know how ridiculous other people feel those ideas are and then it makes them really they don't like being mocked the term social justice warrior is wonderful for that because it just makes you look like such a fucking fool you know social justice warrior yes like that I was a colleague of mine a spectator in London called a-rod little wrote a few years any any man who says he's a feminist clearly just as seeking a shag for sure well I mean it's one thing to want equality but to proudly state that you're a feminist is it's almost yeah I have joked around about it like I see what you're doing yeah you don't run fast you can't pick things up there was must he liked to fuck I get it somebody said is very faulty in Britain they said they described himself as an anti-racist party and some comedian who said it actually makes makes you think they might be racist we like saying you're an anti pedophilia children's agency that's hilarious that's so true it's so true it's a it's virtue signaling to the highest degree it's like you you're putting up your flag of moral superiority standing on your high ground but it is it is it obviously means a great deal to these people but yeah but then the question is just how to how to invite them not to think like that I think mockery mockery is one of the best ways because it just lets them know that other people think it's preposterous so it's not achieving the desired result the desired result is oh look at this amazing person there's incredible progressive ways of thinking not like oh look at this transparent fuck who's just trying to get laid that's that's how a lot of us see it yeah they don't see that we see it that way and some of them I mean it's in a lot of ways a lot of our behavior is its experimental you know I mean people are experimenting with various different ways of gaining social preference points well this is this is why I was saying if people aren't believers there are things they can learn from religion and from tradition mm-hmm and I've always thought that the I've always thought there's one central insight to the judeo-christian tradition which I wish that the social justice warriors bore in mind and that is that's the guy Navid n' and and and the the or can't recall the Crooked Timber of humanity mm-hmm just just to recognize the central truth which is in that tradition and in others that that we're not born in this situation of Rousseau e'en perfection or goodness quite quite otherwise we are we are this very very contorted being which is part which is capable of incredible greatness and beauty and kindness and forgiveness and also capable of their opposites and that's and that it's not it's not that you are one and other people are the other but all of us all of us both all the time and so there never is a victory and there never is a win rather than trying to deal with and restrain your own worst impulses in the life that you have and honestly express all the issues that arrive while you're trying to do that absolutely and and trying to tell the truth where you see it and and giving voice to it and trying to I mean you know this is just it's just you so clear to me that that if people if people could realize this is a central problem of the thing that you and I and others all faces the the desire to claim that the that somebody who disagrees on an issue isn't just of a disagreeing mind but evil hmm and that in any you know we have in Britain we are wracked at the moment still by 18 months after a single vote on a single matter of governance we are still wracked by really unpleasant politic from brexit yeah and I suspect it's it's not I hate the overlap of the two but it's probably something like the Trump events here but again and again you come back to the same thing which is just instead of thinking one side is entirely right and the other entirely I didn't say you give up on objective fact or anything I've been just consider that your opponent might be approaching this with an honest mode I might have honest reasons for disagreeing with you and in the absence of that and with media just endlessly feeding us whatever wood is we know our own side happens to think in the absence of that I just see our trenches in both our countries just being dug deeper and deeper until until there's just no hope of being able to even shout over the top and be heard and one can only get to that stage if if as I say you recognize that it's it's it's not a constant fight against Nazis and you know I mean it's by the way and also never to forget that the Nazis didn't seem like the Nazis to a lot of people when the Nazis were being with Nazis but it's just it's just not as easy as that no it's not you know but it's it's an easy way to demonize the other side yeah it's an easy way to prop up your side it's a it's a cheap trick it is but came back to where we started what if the cheap trick ends up having some terrible consequence hmm of making all of our defenses go down you know well the both of you that I mean we started the conversation off with that Community Guidelines strike good lord yeah this is this really is a very very strange time very strange always was Douglas thank you very much I really really enjoyed this conversation I really appreciate it and your book that is out now is death of Europe it's called immigration identity Islam and it's variable if you can find any book shops left minutes um you gotta get it online you can get it online as well there's a few Barnes and Nobles out there all right thank you Douglas Murray ladies and gentlemen great pleasure thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
