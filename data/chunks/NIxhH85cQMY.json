three two one this is your unveiling you know people know that people know yep that's it first of all Tatiana so this is I should have chosen an easier name right at no one can get it's titania titania because she's named after the queen of the fairies in Midsummer Night's Dream tell everybody your real name my real name is Andrew Doyle do you have an issue with people now knowing that tatianna or - Tanya - Tanya yeah she totally eclipsed me I don't like I'm basically not alive anymore it's all about her you know well I can't remember how I found out about you on Twitter but just laughing really hard it's something that you wrote that was so close you you do such a good job of like blurring the line between outrageously woke and satire yeah it's that thing of trying to who you are who's the girl Ronnie throw there okay yeah so the girl is a composite of four different women well that's good put together because I was worried about you know I don't wanna get sued oh for sure yeah so it's not a real human but you know Medical intersectional was Natalie selfless and brave by my walk but also I love that she's dead pan because it means that she sort of look every time I post some it's like there's this PO faced woman staring at you daring you yes don't you dare so challenge me she could be mean in a way that I'm not well that's kind of funny you end up inhabited this character who just isn't like you and I do I do end up thinking like her and then I even I've even dreamt as her and that sounds like a lie but I have so that's pretty scary I have you know she'll have to go eventually cuz I can't like I can't deal with that kind of there's a psychosis isn't it well she's so big now you have 420 thousand followers it's weird cuz happen really quickly I guess it's because there's a whole cohort of people out there who just sick of this the whole eight yeah you know and I well it's partly that but also partly because people still fall for her all the time people constantly think it's real you know all the time when I have retweet you one of my favorite things to do is read people getting upset at you like that is ridiculous you think that that's why Trump was winning and right never ceases to amaze me how angry people get on Twitter with with you know even legitimate with legitimate causes it's like but I watch that and I think it's fun because I can satirize the left and the the sort of the most liberal side of things through her but then I can argue with the right-wing Trump supporters and stuff and I can mock them as well right so you get to have a go at the extremes yeah I mean and yeah I I'm so shocked that people still think she's real though like even after all this time Oh dad it's not shocking you're close enough there's plenty of people and I'll point you did a few of them that I follow I follow some people where I just bookmarked them so I don't they don't know that I follow them yeah and just some of them are so goddamn fucking crazy and yet I keep getting told this is like a straw man these people don't really exist yeah they do I even wants today Jimmy there's a tweet by rosanna arquette who's really really woke rizona okay yeah I think so she did a tweet about how ashamed she wasn't being white and they loved her that was her I think it was her and then I just cut and pasted that tweet and put it on my tab in is one of the Arquette's yeah but I did the same tweet I literally cut and paste it as tatin because I thought like this is and some people got it that I just taken this other viral tree and some people got the point I was making but it yeah it's close to some of them are nuts yes like like frightening Li so to to a point that it's it's a cult flight behavior it's like it's it's like I think that the basic principles of you know standing up against racism sexism homophobia all that stuff is great yes I think the the woke movement isn't that it's a kind of weird cultish pseudo religious thing that is beyond that so that you're no longer allowed to make mistakes you can't be redeemed there's no there's no it's it's it's it's got all those hallmarks yes you know it's like when they are early Christians used to burn people out of love you know it's that it's that thing and that's why we get this kind of counselor culture stuff and I guess that's why I wanted and maybe that's why it's popular because people have sick of treading around on eggshells worried about being misinterpreted or even worried about fucking up I'm making mistake I mean what's wrong with saying something that's every now and then maybe you do say the wrong thing and it should be fine if you're a human being but part of it is also that things are written down right right and then when things are written down you can see them over and over again if you made a mistake it just said something in normal human conversation which is how we're supposed to communicate and how we normally communicate yeah it just comes and goes ya know but when it's written down then it becomes something different but it's more than that isn't it because it's it I'll give you an example so there was a guy who was the editor of a cookery magazine in the UK and a vegan freelance journalist emailed him say I'd love to do a thing about vegans and he replied and made some joke about yeah you can do something about will force-feed the meat and we'll make them eat each other and all stupid flippant thing rather than saying I was really offended by that can we talk about it I don't think that's appropriate for you to email freelance journalist she screenshot the thing put it on Twitter made a thing of it and he had to step down so I think that's the difference is where is like saying to someone look calling out a mistake or calling someone out for something they've done that you perceive to be bad that's that's all well and good but when you're using it to advertise how virtuous you are and and how you you're able to take someone down for the mistake that they made that troubles me because then it's no longer about really about the issue well I think what we're dealing with when when you're talking about what culture and I love that you made this comparison to radical religion because I think they're the same patterns I think human beings have patterns that they follow and you could say that you're not religious but you follow these extremely rigid ideologies that don't allow for any variation whatsoever you they force 100% compliance and if you're not 100% in compliant they will attack you and you can't be woken up one of the things you find a religion is people will especially in the more radical dangerous and scary religions they'll turn on each other oh you turn on each other for not being pious enough yeah all the time yeah that happens in what culture oh it was scariest things that happens to these woke people is when the woke people attack them oh yeah I'm will it happen with JK Rowling yes and we joke around and because she defended it was a British case it was the woman who was fired from her job because she posted some tweet saying that she didn't believe that sex was a mute characteristic she we said there are men and women and you can't change and now that's her opinion and she's entitled to have it but the the judge in the UK ruled that no it's that's not a legitimate opinion to hold and you can be fired for that right so JK Rowling's simply said no that's not fair that's it's her opinion and they went for her yeah even though she's like she's so worker she keeps retrospectively deciding that her characters are gay and all sort of stuff like that and you know the Dumbledore's gay and she got she got bigger after her they went after her before that as well because in the fantastic beasts sequel with Dumbledore as a young man there's not much overt homosexuality and so the LGBTQ community was saying why isn't it more I mean what do they want like double penetration what do they want was that like they want to full-on wizard gay sex scene uh-huh and she got she got the brunt of that you know it's like this doesn't and I hate that so I don't think you don't need validation by seeing Wizards making out well unless that's your vision I mean if her vision was I mean she if she wanted some radical sexual aspect to her story I don't think it was but if she wanted it no it wasn't yeah she wants right wheel it porn that's fine I mean if that's shit look I mean it doesn't even necessarily have to be porn but I'm I don't think you should ever try to alter someone's artistic vision yeah when someone is a genius like JK Rowling I mean think about that stuff that she's created yeah Harry Potter look the Harry Potter series speaks for itself just in the sheer popularity of it for someone to step in and say you're doing it wrong when it comes to gay sex everything else is great already all right yeah you're red you're a fucking genius with everything but geisha also I don't like it's not it's not her responsibility to be the ambassador for gay sex and also you know I don't I think it's really patronizing to gay people to say that they need to see this yeah but it that is now like a standard thing in art and movies and stuff so like you saw that with Tarantino with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and he someone asked him a journalist was saying you know like what why doesn't the female care what doesn't Margot Robbie's character talk more well he's made an artistic decision he hasn't thought let's just the female character I don't care about that code so let's let's have a silent most the time he's making a point about sort of restoring Sharon Tate to an iconic kind of status that she was too denied by the Manson family it's a very interesting artistic decision and if you watch film like that and you go away and all you can think is oh the women didn't speak enough there was enough diversity then you're not engaging with the artwork you know right like we we had it in the BBC I did a review of Game of Thrones by series by series where they judged each episode as good or bad on the percentage points of how much female characters speak so don't do reviews anymore that just have a pie chart like it's it's it's it's weird to me that's that's it's almost a completely understanding what the creative endeavor is all about sure art I mean look did Salman Luiz do a disservice by not having Brad Pitt talk more well exactly that's a good example yeah yeah it's crazy no was a great movie because it was a great movie it's just an artistic vision doesn't have to adhere to these ideas of of inclusiveness and diversity it just doesn't an artistic vision is supposedly if you write about a bunch of Asian kids that want to be hip-hop artists you have no obligation to have white people and right you have no obligation to have anyone else in it you could have look you can have a movie with one character through the whole movie yeah no obligation of course it's a it's an artistic vision that I've been thinking about this a lot because I think this gets to the heart of what is the problem with the woke culture and what they're the the foundation of their belief system is and it's to do with this idea of will you hear it all the time power structures in society you know that there's that there's this kind of yeah and that's why they think there needs to be more representation and things like that in these films because they think that influences culture and influences people and maintains and sustains power and everything like that yeah so that's why there that's why they're doing it and I think it's just a false premise ultimately it is a false premise and the people that are doing it and the people that are perpetuating this false premise are not doing good work that's another part of the problem if you want to be a woke artist good fucking luck good fucking luck yeah because your stuffs probably gonna suck because you're thinking about that more than you're thinking about the singular artistic vision that you might have you're trying to put it through the filter of intersectionality and all these different very Able's that you have to take any consideration of how you're gonna be criticized and what you're gonna like as soon as you compromise yourself yeah in any endeavor you you you open up the door for mediocrity and it doesn't sell well like people and I think that's simply because people hate being patronized you know that's like that expression go get walk go bro yeah yeah yeah exactly I mean when I saw that last Star Wars film and you've got the lesbian kiss like a two-second of lesbian kiss and I and I I know what they do and I don't care about that sort of stuff you know by all means make a full lesbian Star Wars film like it I don't I don't know about that but you feel hectored like you feel like someone's standing over your shoulder saying you see that that is what you're supposed to support you're all Homer photos but that that's good right that's what they're basically saying they're saying you're all bad people they're just human beings they don't trust society and they're rabid they're rabid about their their their need for compliance everyone must comply there's a crazy one that I I'll send it to send it to a bunch of people about them calling for Captain Marvel to step down right okay why because we find it for your ho because it's it's so fucking ridiculous they want Captain Marvel to step down and be replaced by a gay woman of color right yeah because I don't mean is that how the comic book was originally the original comic book of gay woman well so no I I'm not a comic book fan but I know that they see something that's particularly affected comic books in terms of Thor element okay we need brie Larson to step down from her role to prove she's an ally of social justice and ensure a gay woman of color plays the role let Monica the original female and all caps black Captain Marvel instead of whitewashing characters for the benefit of the straight white men running Disney first of all Disney is run by a woman this should be clarified up I'm almost positive the CEO of Entertainment Disney's a woman is that right that pretty sure that's true yeah they still got Walt on ice there haven't they he's still yeah they haven't had hey is that no but they'll the entertainment CEO of there's someone who runs the film division Whitney Cummings is explaining to me about how ridiculous it is but isn't bring nice and whoever makes the decision isn't brie Larson super woke like she's got a reputation of being incredibly woke now walk enough if you're white but she was when he said that she wanted to ban male journalists from a press junkets and from maybe it box you know I don't think either way you I don't think you can that reminds me of when a you know Camille Palio the academic go back to that she tries to ban mail right brie Larson made a speech about how she wants she felt that there were too many male critics assessing her work and she wanted to actually implement some kind of strategy to prevent that from happening yet it was all over the press so she's she's about as workers against nothing I work enough she needs to step down because if you really woke you'll step down and show that you're an ally for social justice and give up those millions of dollars to some other person but by the way well you know tell the studio that you're gonna do that like they're not gonna fucking just decide oh you want us to cast a black gay woman let's do that and does it matter which black gay woman a you know there's a have to be somebody can act that gayest blackest ever imagine fine because if you have like a half black and kind of gay like pansexual yeah then that that's a part of the patriarchy right that's okay that's a problem isn't it it's like when Obama fucks up people blame it on his white side you know it's like no because he's 50% white he's 50% problematic you can never have the kind of purity and the example is given with Camille paler because she's an academic it was asked to step down by her own students and they said you need to report to the faculty you need to replace her with a queer woman of color like who why does a woman have to be queer why if you want a woman of color like you see this is the thing it never ends you can't be woken up and once it gets too queer woman of color and they've got one of those ago you know what you should make room for a transgender and what if the queer woman of color is really bad at her job - my bad it doesn't matter adapt you need to help her right okay I understand the society has fucked her over and that's why she's not as good as Camille Paglia was so again it gets back to one of those fundamental premises that they don't believe in objective truth they think objectively this is a postmodern thing right believe in it's also these people that you're talking about they haven't built these structures that they want to tear down right right they're not a part of the construction of these enormous film studios enormous entertaining entertainment empires yeah that's you know so they want to step in to something that not only have they not built but they're not capable of building right because they're wrapped up in this fucking wacky ideology that doesn't allow you to be creative so how do we get out of it like that's a good question that's why I brought you know well I've got ideas yeah I've got a few ideas right because because I think I think we're reaching a kind of tipping point like I say like there's so many people who were really sick of it you know and you can't argue with a social justice activist you can't because they don't believe they think that any knowledge that you think you have is based on your background and your men that and the power structures and right sort of stuff right so they - in Olympics it's exactly so none of it is authentic enough and it really foxes them though when they end up like talk to a queer woman of color so who agrees with me and then it fucks up their entire position you know really annoys them it's a but then yeah so you can't argue with them I thought maybe satire would be a good approach that you know because if they're not would prepare to listen to reason you can mock them right right I thought that would be good but they just makes them really angry you know I've had so much venom for mocking this this book but of course when you mock the priests they get angry yes that's that that's the point yes and they don't feel like you have any right to make fun which is for me as a comedian one of the most offensive things a person might say it also makes you want to do it more yeah it's that's what it's about yeah we're where are them the mockery police yeah we come in and mark when things are fucked up but then because they believe in the power structure is what they're saying is you're punching down down yeah are you punching down but but arguably with woke people you're not punching down you know no that's always been my okay see how because for one thing I think you can punch down if you want sure you know who gets to say but I think the the the woke people have incredible power and they're bullies and they're bullies they pile up together you go after you they'll do it for days on end and attack Twitter and attack you and write articles about you have experienced it yeah but it's you know you just treat preaching to the choir yeah you're preaching to them and this whole idea that you can't punch down in comedy is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life look Sam Kinison who's one of the greatest comics of all time one of his best bits is about starving babies in Africa you can't punch any lower no did you ever see that oh I didn't I remember Kennison talking about how comedy attacks that was something he you know this is style for sure I mean everybody's comedy is different yeah comedy does whatever it is that it's funny whether you are Steven Wright who's an absurdist yeah or whether you're Sam Kinison who attacks yeah both brilliant but Kinnison had a bit about those commercials where you would see Sally Fields on TV like Save the Children yeah yeah these children survive on just a dollar a day if you could just send money and he goes you sitting there eating your food you cooked yourself and this starving kids on TV to get all bummed out and you're like hey why don't you feed him you're standing right next to him and he has this whole bit it just occurred to us we just drove 5,000 miles with the food we realized it wouldn't be world hunger a few people would move where the food is you live in a fucking desert and he has this whole crazy bit and it's like one of those bits that he did in 1986 and I mean at the time there was nothing like it yeah you know like in this fucking rabid former preacher genius comedian is punching down as far as you can yeah except you know like he's off he obviously doesn't think it's funny that baby stuff but this is that literal-minded thing yeah that means that that sort of stuff can't work anymore yes because well it can work actually it does work you know I see comics do that sort of stuff all the time but they're they're not gonna get very far television a or all that kind well for now yeah can if you go on YouTube yeah there's a lot of comics that are bypassing the well Netflix gives you a lot of leeway but only if you're famous yeah you get away with a lot of shit if you're famous like Chappelle can basically get away with a lot of shit you have never told never Netflix has never told me what to do right um but I know they do if you're name you know I know I've had friends that they've they've told to cut bits out like Joey Diaz had a hilarious me to bit about Terry Crews yeah about you know Terry Crews who's a fucking super athlete you know and some guy grabbed his dick and he me to this guy for grabbing his tags some drunken agent yeah whatever it was you know in a joke way grand I don't know what happened I've no idea what happened yeah but Joey had this hilarious bit about it and they wouldn't let him do it right they're like that's your you're making fun of sexual assault victims like but I do you think in any world that Terry Crews who is a fucking tank of a man was actually scared of this guy like this is come on this is not a victim in the sense of like a helpless person right I get the fact that this guy was an agent maybe had some power over his career but the way Joey said it was a positive was talking about all the positive attributes of Terry Crews putting his spin on yes and what was this for this was for a teenagers for Netflix and they actually stepped in and said they didn't want the backlash didn't want to deal with the bullshit so wondered about that because I like when I was watching the comedy at the store the other day here and I just thought it feels different here like if there's like live comedy here people do go for whatever times because they more we go for it because we realized this is the last stand right this is like the Ghost Dance for wild comedy cuz we did I get the impression in the UK it's not you know the gigs I've been playing there isn't that quality about it as you need Ricky Gervais to be there all the time right there's only one of him he's so rich and and he doesn't have a boss and he can do whatever he wants and you know it's those it's those younger comics right who are coming up and they self-censor because they're worried about what they're going to say you know that's that's basically what it is I mean I had an argument with a young comic and and she said to me you know you don't understand because I go up to comics I have to go up to comics every night after their set and explain to them why they shouldn't tell these jokes and why they that you know this was a serious conversation I thought this isn't for you and she was a karmic yeah stand up yeah this was a this was a comic in a group so I used to run this like workshop for young young stand-ups and I can't do it anymore because one of them can play this is serious right so like one of them complain to the boss that there's a very famous Theatre in London and one of them complained and said that the one of the jokes I'd tweeted as titania made her feel unsafe and then therefore I was told I couldn't I couldn't do this course anymore because I developed an unsafe environment oh you made them feel unsafe yeah by a joke dangerous that wasn't even mine it was to time he was a character must have been a great joke he's really a fucking great yeah yeah it's so good you made someone feel unsafe yeah they were laughing so hard yeah they're like I could die yeah I could die from laughter but that's that conflation of words and violence isn't at this idea that that is a problem and I think what really scares me about that is I think I believe it it's disingenuous do you think it's it's clearly disingenuous but it's the the orthodoxy right like this is this is what they're pushing somebody they're pushing that words or violence and that you can be violent with words so that's interesting because I I think you're probably right in a lot of cases you know when they say like if they see a certain image or something it makes them feel like they've been physically attacked only hear a certain phrase or whatever and they support each other in this nonsense but then I see some of them by balling their eyes out crying and shaking and I think that's an authentic emotion right so maybe it's a disingenuous in some cases but maybe some people have actually and this would scare me more that some people to actually convince themselves that it is a kind of form of fun I'm sure that's true as well I'm sure that's true as well and I think there's this is again parallels really crazy religious people right right yeah there's people that will cut off fingers for you know slights and against their religion they'll flog themselves they'll do I mean people do horrendous things to themselves as punishment right so then it comes if we are gonna go with the the religious motif it comes about Saudi radicalizing people from this belief system it seems like this is a part of being a human that there are pathways that people go down like he like to just to get away from that he has one of any dictator right the horrific dictator when someone gets into a position of power over someone whether it's a CEO of a company yeah before the meat to movement it's out of control I was trying to fuck all of his and toys and treats people like shit sexually harasses everybody goddamnit that it seems like an archetype right it's like if this this archetype seems to almost be unavoidable with certain types of human beings so well I think you get that with the woke thing and that the structure of woke Ness is just it is just a scaffolding for this sort of antiquated not not antiquated excuse me um this ancient system of behavior this religious system and it slides right into that I don't think it's a coincidence that most woke people a fist s-- because this is their alternative for radical religion I think that's probably right there you know Tom Holland wrote is a historian he wrote a book recently called Dominion he makes this case that with the absence of Christianity in comes woken us that it was just just follows from the other in a kind of because they have the similar need to Priscilla ties to convert yeah the similar intolerance of anyone who might not perceive the world in the way that you do you know so it has all the same hallmarks but also that makes me nervous about it because it's it's not then about persuading someone out of it because you can't persuade someone that God doesn't exist right it's based on faith is based on something that's intangible yes and and particularly when those same people have such power in the major institutions right you know I've always said the work group people of are the minority you know most people are sick of it most people have fucked off with it yeah but they seem to occupy all these major roles in television in the arts in media in journalism in the law you know and and therefore they have disproportionate clouds yes academia is a big academia smack that's where the problem started right and then you convert children to think that way yeah you get an impressionable 17-year old who's a freshman and yeah college and they find this and it resonates with them and also they can develop social clout by adhering to this religion the same way a radical you know will fill in the blank with whatever Christian whatever whatever sect of religion you would like to compare it to it's very similar you yeah the more pious you are the more adherent you are to the dogma to this rigid ideology the more clout you get and and worse than that in universities because you won't pass the course if you know you and what's interesting is is not a kind of underhand thing on the part of the of the scholars who are now activists right they are open about this yes they say quite explicitly you know we are activists as well as scholars which means they're pushing a political agenda which it will of course it didn't used to be other a khadeem used to be about objectivity and presenting different ideas and and getting to the truth but they already know the truth yes and they're gonna they're gonna ensure that you didn't even get on the course if you didn't sort of basically it's a time it's the same sort of pattern that you see in dictators hmm there a dictator in terms of intellectual pursuits right there dictating to these children how you must think and behave and they're because of their position of power because of their education their grasp of the English language the fact that they speak so eloquently and passionately about this they're incredibly convincing in current charismatic a lot of them and it's it's effective yes and that's why so many people come from that and so overwhelmingly left-leaning yeah hugely exactly it's a real problem on the Left yeah it's really weird to me that I've suddenly most of my friends now were rightly thing that's come out of nowhere I wouldn't have expected that at all well shift over the last few years and it's the reason why Trump is in office yeah 100% it is this is why when people tell me you the culture wars like a sideshow it doesn't matter I'm like it wins and loses elections this stuff you know like it's not a sideshow it's really isn't like you know when what was it the other day was a little Elizabeth Warren saying that she's going to get a trans stood people like a 15 year old to veto her one of her appointees right so the Secretary of Education some CS something like that but it was a nine year old I was a nine year I thought was like fifteen year old Oh pull that up I mean either way that's not good right now either way it's not good it's madness it's and most people think that's madness and most people think it's weird like in the UK Jeremy Corbyn started announcing his pronoun yes let me tell you I don't know if you know what Jeremy Corbyn looks like no one's confused about his pronoun no one has ever been confused got a fucking beard women cannot be it's what you saying oh you know they also can have penises and men can have their periods yeah but jeremy corbyn's never identified as a woman as far as i'm is so dumb you know it doesn't fit with all so that old-school socialist because he's proper old-school lefty socialist the work stuff doesn't fit well people it doesn't work it feels weird you know well the old-school lefty socialist is more about compassion and spreading its income equality its money yes all about money you see this is it what what this this is actually one of the reasons why I wanted to totally go oh here we go oh no that said this was the round of applause that the nine-year-old transgender child got so the child stood up and said oh I'm a nine yard and and and Elizabeth Warren sort of instigated this big round of applause that right there was something else this week that was it was a fifteen-year-old it was it was a someone that she'd decided yeah shoes yes should choose I think it was a Secretary of Education but I might be wrong what is it secretary it's a quote from this yeah so it which I you know what is it do you find the quote here we goes out the wrong story though so oh it is a wrong story this is the one from October the second education in vote believes in public education believe yeah but no she was gonna veto she was gonna give the transgender student veto power yeah and help see if she see if you can find that I mean like the one thing I wouldn't give a fifteen-year-old transer otherwise any kind of political no and definitely not a nine-year-old I mean any kid goddamnit when you're fifteen you don't know what the fuck is going on you only been alive for a few months exactly you really have no idea what's happening I mean your frontal lobes aren't developed are they did it at 25 yes let's raise the voting age yes make it thirty the world then the real problem would be war Bill Maher talked about this story yeah on his most recent episode of his show yeah and so it got up in the news again yeah there was a legitimate news story about Elizabeth Warren talking about that quote it says that Warren indicated she wants Jacob to help her pick her okay you know they just sort of repeated it and get a headline I mean I get I get why that advertises her you know commitment to inclusivity and diversity 99% of people are thinking I don't care about that why don't you talk about the fact that I can't afford anything you know and and that's why if you are truly left-leaning and if you truly care about getting a left-leaning government in power you don't need to can make about class again because this is one of the reasons why I'd like to Tanya I'm honored her to be posh and rich you know because they're so rich these peoples predominantly they've they've got so much money and they said you have real problems this is not what you concentrate on like you're not worried about manspreading like it's serious like who worries about that so like that someone on the poverty line doesn't care about this stuff they don't care about being represented by the skin colour of like you know some poor working-class mother who can't afford anything isn't gonna care that Hillary Clinton's in the White House she's not gonna thing over that's okay then I'm represented that's great well some of them would someone like it because it'll make them feel like a woman can get by I get that and get through that's the aspirational message that it sends I think that's fine but you're still stuck on the poverty line with nothing you know at least like poor black Americans didn't do very well under Obama this stuff is tokenism when what you should be doing sort of directing at inequality and it's but it's a it's a big problem both here and in the UK you know we we've got a left movement I mean we saw it with brexit you know like Brett the reason why so many working-class people voted a bit for BRICS and indeed voted against labour in the last election it's because they're not being they're not no one's looking out for their interests right then worried about other things like like like you say manspreading mansplaining like a toxic masculinity mansplain hilarious ask was just explaining if you're a man if you correct someone and they're incorrect and you're a man but what are their rounds bleeding well then you're still mansplaining well that's not happy we can't live like that I can't I can't live like that I can't um where does it go does it become a religious war are we in a holy war for wellness I know but I don't have to I don't have to check the contents of someone's underwear every time I have a discussion with them you know I don't like I don't want to make those judgments on that well you need to understand and check yourself because the contents of someone's underwear does not mean that that's the gender in which they are day doesn't you piece of shit I know I already fucked it up that's it well I don't know I don't know gonna cancel yourself now you should but I've already been canceled probably I don't know that might be a good example that might be good a good idea maybe titania gets canceled maybe I should find a way to camp out yes because she probably messes up sometimes well once we will find out too titania is actually a man yeah well you know what I'll do it because I just it's funny you mentioned the the transgender child cuz I've just written a book as her as aimed at children right because of that have you seen this we've seen this is the woke children's books right yes I made a joke about one feminist baby and she's got a bullhorn feminist baby but a bit a bullhorn as a feminist need a bullhorn oh yeah Jesus Christ she's screaming about issues she's a baby yeah but she needs to be heard don't silence the truth look at that feminist babe I enter a voice her voice is in a born right there we go mee-mah if she's a feminist why is she wearing fucking makeup when she's a baby that's just rude yeah that's rude because that's the goddamn patriarchy that's socializing young babies to be sex objects to Christ even know what a boy or a girl is how many of these are baby these look like they're aimed very much at very young kids as well like so yeah like well it's name it's aimed at the mothers and fathers very young kids who want to let everybody know their work and they probably only pull them out when people come over the house I mean but this is this is you scraping the surfaces so one of the big selling books was good night stories for rebel girls which like each chapters about a major feminist icon that's aimed at young kids there's one called see is for consent that's aimed at very young kids there's one called the little girl who gave zero fucks right this is this sort of you know it's funny I look at this stuff I think this is such flagrant indoctrination you're not even hiding it anymore right if there's nothing subtle about this you know yeah so like I thought so I've written a book as titania and she's trying to it's called my first little book of intersectional activism right because she can't get it right she talks to kids like they're just sociologists or something she can't get the right which is which is fun and she says to them you know your parents hate you you know you should get you should ditch them like I think that's the way to do it well that's what every called yeah exactly one of the things that cults do one of the hallmarks of cults as they try to separate you from your parents yeah or if you get the kids young then you can you can get their minds eventually so maybe that's is that the solution trying to trying to make sure it doesn't get I don't know young maybe I don't know if there is a solution I think there are patterns that always exist and religions pop up like why Christianity why Mormonism why Islam why you know what what causes these patterns these ideological patterns what causes them what causes them to take hold what causes them to their followers to become rabid I don't know what it is but they exist and they exist they have existed throughout history there's the literally hundreds of them is it a need for purpose is it a need to feel that you are the one person in the tree it's it's certainly there's instincts that we all have to be a part of a group and to be accepted as a part of a group and one of the ways that you show that you're a part of that group is by rigidly adhering to the doctrine well here's one way that we might legitimately tackle this I'm gonna say something very optimistic now if more people on the Left can turn against woke yeah I think this will really help I think once they realize that it is undermining all the things they stand for yeah right it's getting Trump into power it's getting it's getting the Tories into power in the you know it's a it isn't it's dividing us up racially in terms of our sexual demographics it's pushing for further segregation it it actually does all the things that the social justice movement claims that they don't want to do and that they want to fight and if more people on the Left sort of turn and the other thing here's the other thing they all think we live in this world full of Nazis and fascists yeah and and these evil crypto-fascist around every corner right and by making that claim you are really helping the genuine neo-nazis out there because you're saying look your mainstream you it's giving them much more power and attention than they deserve I think it's a read I think it's a really bad idea it's almost like you're acting as their PR you know yeah you're almost making it more acceptable to be an answer because you're calling everyone or not you're also crying wolf right so because you're crying wolf when when someone sees an act like Charlottesville was a big wake-up call for a lot of people because I call you fuck those are real Nazis yeah Nazis are real like there's still Nazi Nazis like with the swastika tattoos and everything the tiki torches those fucking guys yeah that was a wake-up call for a lot of folks because they there's many people that never encounter people like that cools because it many of them right but I thought but they here everybody's a Nazi they here this is a Nazi that's a Nazi I mean it would you know Christina Hoff Sommers yeah gives speeches places and they pull the fire alarm on her they call her a Nazi she's a feminist how was she and like even remotely I mean it's insane but she criticizes other feminists for being preposterous and when she does that people decide that she has not told the line she's not rigidly adhering to the ideology she's not woken after the attacker but now she's what you would think of as maybe a centrist feminist but that's historically illiterate if you think that that's fascism then you don't know what fascism is and also it's really offensive to people who had to live through fascistic regimes to say that Christina Hoff Sommers is a fucking fashion it is but I don't think they care what you know what the previous definition of fascism is I I think I think we've got to stand by that definition we've got we've got a route in Georgia real definition you know like if you if you want to say that Jordan Peterson is a fascist as some people do even though he there isn't someone who is more on record whose opposition to tyranny is more on record and more studied in it 40 years of this stuff and it's all online yeah should you wish to check it out but that involves an a degree of research and actual knowing what you taught it's pointed out as one of the more problematic guests that I have on really when people point to the fact that I'm some sort of an alt right gateway they point to Jordan Peterson it's so ridiculous what is this gateway businesses well like did you see the alternative influence network thing yes yeah were you on that yeah I was on you're on that sure I said to her I tweeted to her I said hey what did I say I said Barbara Walters interviewed Castro does that make her a communist right and she said and she screenshot it and said he's favorably comparing himself to Barbara Jesus he can't win it doesn't make any sense that six degrees of separation stat that have that flowchart nonsense like it's conspiratorial but that's that was a mainstream publication wasn't it that wasn't some rogue I mean it's sure but look who the only people that are taking it seriously are the people that are woke I mean it's regular people or not gonna take that seriously they don't give us that six degrees of separation shit is not guilt by association is nuts oh it's crazy especially talking to people that like me that interview literally hundreds and hundreds of people yeah it's crazy does it bother you when people throw those smears at your jus just completely ignore it and it bothers me less every day right interesting I've developed this sort of antivenom to it I've experienced it so many times I just get rid of set but when people call me an arts because that's like the opposite of what I stand for a genuinely yeah but now it's it's that thing of you see someone be called a Nazi or a racist even or a homophobe and you think I don't that probably isn't right yes I think right and that means if you do actually ever have to use those words like those awful people in charlottesville where you you should reserve that word so that we can identify those people in our myths because they do exist they are dangerous but there's not many of them and but if if the word has become so it doesn't mean that anymore it's this thing called concept creep you know whether we the idea that word just spreads and spreads to that anyone with the slightest point of political disagreement can suddenly be branded as neo-fascist that's the McCarthyism right all about yeah and fine find all the demons in your neighborhood yeah everyone's bad everyone's evil everyone turns on each other I mean this is what North Korea does with North Korea has it so brilliant is everyone tattles on everyone else yeah cool and they're all running around scared and this is what the woke people are doing every no one can be woken off martina navratilova yeah no and after her yeah she's a lesbian no but she's not woke enough because she doesn't want trans women to compete in sports and dominate and win World Records so she shouldn't be part of that community anymore we've got a rope on with the whole acronym thing the lgbtqia+ or whatever it is at the moment because if it's but I love it I wanted to get longer what is it nice it's lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer intersexual asexual yeah I'm gonna plus the plus is whatever fucker we forgotten basic aliens they whatever whatever isn't there yeah and who the fuck knows I mean I I see that as for a star there's massive internal contradictions within that yeah like we're seeing this at the moment with sort of lesbian lesbians versus trans people and gay rights versus trans rights women's rights versus you know that's not a coherent it's not like those people are all the same it's a weird gang it's it's a gang that doesn't get on with itself right exactly also that's my name chappelle's bit about that was really good with the other bits or the teas in the back and the other stuff it's it's they don't get on with each other and then and then if you're not ideologically pure they'll cast you out they'll even say you're not gay like with Peter Thiel yeah you know when it when he said at the Republican convention that he was supporting the Trump yes and and The Advocate the gay magazine The Advocate was saying well he may sleep with men but he's not gay doesn't get to be gay in oh god that's the gay press for you mean this yes the advocate the out magazine is a really funny article an out magazine which was criticizing the the new it film you know the clown the the killer clown right the second chapter starts with a gay bashing at the start and he eats a gay man's heart in the opening scene of that though Oh spoiler sorry about I was gonna watch it and out magazine said Oh Pennywise the clown isn't the gay Ally we thought he was and this was an authentic only it's a psychopathic clown isn't a long that eats kids arms yes sewer he was your ally I love the gay press the gay press make me laugh so much there's one in the UK called pink news right and if you want to laugh at something just look at there they did a thing recently I'm not making this up this was like two weeks ago the Pakistani government have announced that they're going to pay for people to transition they're gonna pay for their surgery right you know why yes they fucking hate gay people and they're right so they're gonna pay for it and because they only will allow men to have sex with men for men transitioned right okay so this is not Pro gay stunt yeah the pink News did a video saying yet Pakistan said yes to trans rights this is a really empowering thing I'm like they they hate you that like this is it's it's it's genuinely nuts so I wonder whether we should just get rid of the letters or just scrap it like think they should keep adding more really and to make up a bunch of different names get it so it's so preposterous that even woke people like Jesus Christ was 30 letters yeah we have letters aren't even real symbols they'll have to get two different alphabets the princes symbol oh yeah that could be that can i yeah I mean look it's it's in unknown territory right now yeah and it really is where we're completely off the deep end and with this incredible ability to communicate that we have today because of social media yeah we can spread these ideas we can you know um people can hop on board and other mentally ill people can you know decide that you are absolutely correct and we do need to add some Z's and X's and other shit to that thing as you say as a joke and then one day a joke it'll happen I think everything's a joke but it's not a joke I mean it's it can happen it does have I mean I the number of times I've tweeted something to take the piss and then it's happened a few months later I know I'm not like it's pretty much all the time now oh yeah the one I often mention because I just I still can't get over it was when titania tweeted about Mary Poppins you know the the mm-hmm there's a scene in Mary Poppins but she has chimney soot on her face yeah and so titania tweets and this is blackface this is so racist six months later the New York Times published an article saying exactly that saying Mary promise is racist because a black face because she had sword in her face really when you find it it's it's um it's uh it's New York Times and it's um Mary Poppins and nannies shameful flirting with blackface that's the headline of the article right why I'm not making it up and they use the screenshot of her with chimneys on pretty much similar to the screenshot I'd taken six months before right it's not black fur it's not racist right it's changed so much six months like things have shifted so bizarre look at this Mary Poppins this is a major publication is god damned hilarious but this isn't even like some like wrongful flirting with blackface that's the New York Times who wrote that who's that person who's that I don't know who that person is but Oh Voldemort right let the one unit that's what say the name oh yeah you can't say Voldemort you just did right Jesus Christ that is so goddamn crazy this happens well that we had it in the UK I don't if this story got broke over here you know the new music musical Cats the film of cats the Andrew Lloyd Webber thing right yes is that no I didn't see one of the mixed-race actors plays a white cat and there were articles about how they've whitewashed this black actor but they've also turned her into a cat it's not a you know what I mean it's not a racist her name but you're saying yeah you know it's like stop trying to write this is it like if you're going to why not just this is why I get the left on board why not just reserve the accusation of racism for actual races well I think just that thinks of the walk left the same way they think of antifa that they are on the fringe but they're doing good work like they're not me I don't think that way but at least they're attacking those right wing pieces of shit that I hate I say even though they're crazy and ridiculous not the crazy and ridiculous but they're not coming after me okay they're coming after people that I disagree with so they don't find it a problem but it'd be one thing if I mean I don't support violence anyway but it'd be one thing of anti-fur we're going after actual fascists when they've just pepper-spraying someone with a maggot hat or or you know or going after Andy no you know it's okay great enemies or a pristine off summer or Christina for summers then it's difficult to take them serious and they're wearing masks and hitting people would buy crisps and all they're in craziness and you know it's and they're the compassionate ones right so this is this is the incoherence of that is if you if you set yourself as this kind of moral arbiter and you're doing everything in virtue but you're hitting someone with a bike lock rather than engaging them in conversation then what how do you even talk to that how do you even address that you know yeah you you really can't right though they're what they're willing to do is they're willing to attack people that they disagree with they're willing to shut down discussion they're willing to like if someone wants to come and speak and that person happens to be right-wing yeah they feel completely 100 percent justified and shutting down the speech hitting fire alarms telling people they don't feel safe yeah attacking people that are trying to come into the venue screaming at old people I mean we've seen all the stuff that happens yeah and Tifa this is a serious problem that I think is gonna get worse here very quickly right because up until now like I've always thought you guys are in a really great position you've got your First Amendment you know certain people will always be able to say whatever they want in this country you know but you're seeing the cracks in that ideal very very clearly and some people are calling for hate speech laws so that the First Amendment isn't apply to what they call hate speech right and that would be the rather than just I mean yeah you've got people setting on fire alarms literally stopping people from speaking right away but I think there are people who are moving towards legislating against certain forms of speech well it's very important that this be taught and that people understand that the answer to bad speech is good speech yeah just no more of it always been the answer to get to people that have opposing ideas and have them talk and have one person who has the better ideas who's more articulate and understands it and understands the consequences of these evil ideas and lays it out so that everybody watching can go oh yeah I see now I learned but as soon as you stop it you know if they say we want ben shapiro to debate our person let's all go together that's great yeah do that do that that's how to do it so why would you want if you claim to be opposed to all these horrible ideas why would you want those ideas to be left unchallenged and that doesn't make sense to me right what you what you should you should be celebrating the idea that these people are going to get a platform and be debated and be and be repudiate they're worried that that person's gonna indoctrinate someone and they think that they're absolutely right and that person is absolutely wrong and this is the argument for deep platforming people from Twitter and YouTube and all these different social media platforms it's not as stupid as that then out of them are but do you think I don't believe that someone's gonna hear someone making a fascist speech and they suddenly become fascist by Osmos let me pause you there okay how do how does someone join the not-see party well I mean do you mean the historical nuts you know the ones around today I mean who the hell knows but I mean there's certain or honest but more okay fine who get indoctrinated and that's what we're doing with protecting morons we're nerfing the world but the fact is there are so few of those people there are so few people who are that stupid that's why there aren't many neo-nazis you think that's true it really I have more faith in humanity I think I think most people are pretty keyed up you know or a smart man yeah and I understand why you would think that but I think there are a lot of extremely gullible but you know many people believe the earth is flat you're aware that I I wonder whether those people are joking when I hear that arguments really you had conversations with in real life okay well let's take okay so let's take that point that there are an awful lot GP people out there okay so what is I informed guy bought was calm uninformed and unprepared incidence of they don't have the skills to handle any sort of scenario argument let's say I'm wrong and my optimism about humanity is wrongheaded okay so that and I'm willing to accept that right so that's I'm wrong about that what is better what's the best way to deal with those people is it to say we're going to no platform all the people are going to indoctrinate them we get so they never get to hear that but we live in a world with the Internet where people can go on on their various chat rooms and they can and there they can go into those areas and they can hear those ideas unchallenged so they don't hear the opposing view right so surely if if there are all these swathe of gormless people out there though that's the environment which is going to radicalize them not not a stage at some University where they agree with you but they want to deep platform people that would bring those people over to those web sites where they would get indoctrinated right so they want to deep platform people off of social media so that those people who have these problematic ideas can't drag someone over to Stormfront or write whatever radical you know website or but we know we know from the history of censorship that it never works right never works it always drives people towards thrilling you know so but but that doesn't matter people are stupid just because you say you know it and we do know it it doesn't mean people are gonna think that way and operate that way that requires restraint it requires foresight it requires some sort of an objective understanding of history I don't give an example so in the UK there was a far-right party for the British National Party which does technically still exist but nope you know there's like ten people in it and the leader that part there was a moment where they were winning millions of votes right because there were a lot of people who were disenfranchised particularly working-class areas and they were desperate for some kind of and the head of that party Nick Griffin went on to our main political discussion program is called question time BBC one prime time and he was humiliated and as soon as that happened the BNP were over within a matter of months hmm it exposed to those normal people the ludicrous and absurd nature of his viewpoint and that I think is a really heartening idea that actually if you if you hear more from these people they are self discrediting right but but if you if you ban them you're almost given them a kind of glamour a kind of martyrdom status that they don't deserve and and and that I think attracts a lot of people to their worldview hmm that's there's definitely something to be said for that yeah there's definitely something we said I mean like I'm not in favor of banning these people yeah but I'm not also I'm also not in favor of these people being able to espouse hate speech everywhere they go and to be able to indoctrinate people as well so like I don't know what the actual well do you trust well I would put it as my view I do not trust the state to decide what constitutes hate speech yeah no I I don't believe that I mean in the UK they've proven that they're not capable of doing it same as Canada right okay exactly absolutely clearly so so in that case I'm for abolishing the idea of hate speech as a pract we have I don't know how much you know about the UK with this right we have a thing where the police will investigate you for non crime if it's offensive right on crime so there's a website the government's website and hate crime has a paragraph on non crime hate incidents okay and what they specifically say is if you've heard some if someone said something that's offensive to you and you believe that the person said something because of you you were one of the protected characteristics because of race gender sexuality disability whatever then you report that to the police and it gets logged in the hate crime statistics as a hate crime even though there's no crime okay I'll give you a very specific example this is a famous case in the UK at the moment man called Harry Miller he was a docker from Humberside and the police here e tweeted a poem that was perceived to be transferred and people were upset about the but he didn't even write the poem he just retweeted the poem the police investigated his retweet and they and he said to them have I broken the law they said this isn't a crime this is a non crime hate incident and the actual phrase the police officer used I'm not joking was we have to check you're thinking right whoa now that's sinister what what and then when the police were homicide police were challenged on this but in the media it turns out this is standard practice in the police dude isn't just one rogue police officer going a bit mad this is standard practice that the commissioning guidelines from the College of policing actually stipulate that this is what you're meant to do this is now finally been challenged in the courts but no one stood up to this stuff you know this is a phrase check your think check your thinking by a police officer no less yeah like the Polli who's qualified to check your thinking well you should be it's crazy it should be difficult it's well yeah quite I mean the college of policing who teach the police what what what the police officer actually said is he said well we've had a workshop and what you don't understand is that babies are sometimes born with a different with a male brain when they've got a female body I mean literally he was trying to lecture him on this stuff and well that might be true but that doesn't mean that the police should be able to tell you that you can't retweet something that you agree with right and we have you know we have people in our country who have been do you know how many people are arrested in the UK I'll just ask how many people do you think are arrested every year in the UK for offensive comments they post it online what would you guess mm-hmm just as it's not a trick I'm just interested to know what you would assume rested for offensive comments online yeah I say three hundred three thousand every year right now wow that's not including all the many thousands of non Cripe non crime hate incidents that are logged on right so three thousand people arrested and what is it some of them will be horrible by the way I'm being clear about some of those comments will be horrible nasty racist awful right a lot of them are between like rival football gangs and stuff like that but some of them are jokes one guy served three months in prison for a joke about Madeleine McCann and it was a joke that he cut and pasted from some website put it on his own Facebook Perryman in prison for that so so right what was the joke I don't know I don't it's good mothers laughing for three months exactly who that everything worth it right now he's a felon right yeah record the famous one in the UK the moment is the countdown killer case yes nuts I do know that one yeah and and because I stood explain it to people that don't know those services there's a guy called countdown killers real name's Marcus Macon and he's a youtuber and he created his dog sorry his girlfriend's dog is his cute little pug dog right and his girlfriend was all he's always going on about how adorable the dog was so he made he trained the dog to jump about enthusiastically whenever it heard the phrase gassed the Jews and he trained it to do a little Nazi salute whenever it heard Zieg Heil right now those phrases out of that context are unpleasant you can see why someone would be offended by that right but the joke was that this cute little dog is doing is behaving this vicious in fact the joke is predicated on the idea that there's nothing worse than a Nazi well also the joke is predicated on the fact that we all know the dog has no idea what it's doing quite exactly yeah so that's that's what that's him doing the z-car there so but that's butt of the dog now QT now look I accept that people can be effect like I you know I might be offended by I'm offended by all sorts of things and that's fine but no three million people saw that video before YouTube took it down you know and a three million people not one complaint no one complained the police actually went to the Scottish Council of Jewish communities and said do you find this offensive and understandably they said yes and the police are great now we can prosecute this guy two year investigation found guilty in a court of law ultimately find 800 pounds that was what happen but he's got a criminal record now for whatever you think about the joke right it's it's a it is clearly meant to be funny I mean not only that cybercrime intelligence unit investigated all of his tweets emails his entire background to find any remote connection to a fascist group or a far-right group nothing they found nothing so there's no evidence so basically they prosecco we now have someone who has been prosecuted because the judge believes that he knows what secretly going on what his secret intention is and the the actual phrasing of the law that under which he prosecuted is that it is deemed grossly offensive which is a very subjective idea something that is grossly well particularly when the fact that you have 3000 different view only three million different views right and no complaints no complaints right that's that's crazy and I know the guy because III defended him at the time and then of course people send the I'm a Nazi apologist cuz I you know that's what which is utterly utterly ludicrous but I know the gonna he's he's a nice guy he's not at all I've seen him in yet what you guys are talking about this I found a story that happened last week this is a tweet that I've kind of gone through it to verified a little bit unless it's a hundred percent accurate okay this guy got a job interview and I guess he signed up and they found this on his on their own he said he did not give them as information they sent him three hundred fifty one pages of every tweet he ever liked it had the word fuck in it Wow he said I had to get a background check for my job and it turns out the report is a three hundred plus page PDF of every single tweet I've ever liked liked with the word fuck in it enjoy your dystopian BS like there's a bunch of showing it but I looked at the company that does this hold on go back sorry what does it say update I came home to a package containing a printout of all 351 pages of it obviously the dystopia cares about wasting paper here's like a for instance that what it looked like and if I use this to justify not giving him the job is that the I don't know okay and he liked this tweet merry Christmas to the toddler I saw running across Trader Joe's with a giant bottle of peppermint vodka and mom running after him like no no no no no no no only it's a flag type bad flag reason alcohol yeah post type liked yeah so they they changed what he was saying right he's he's making a joke about a toddler that he saw running across Trader Joe's with a giant bottle of peppermint vodka that it did taken from its mom and the mom was like no no give me that give me that giving that so they flagged it because the there was alcohol in it the baby had a bottle of alcohol there's nothing offensive about that so ever I actually don't understand why that would be an issue because they want you to be scared as fuck they want to be able to control your thinking and they don't want you to ever do anything that could come back to hurt the company in any way and and and mess with their bottom line I mean that is crazy they even liking a tweet yeah just writing the truth like making it crazy like things by mistake sometimes crazy thumbs I just say the wrong thing you know here's another one to this day this is still the most in all caps big dick energy I've ever seen in a video I don't know what that is a guy that like called his dad when he was more about to win once the world be a millionaire right like celebrate that I know the answer I'm gonna win right okay so he called his dad tells dad that he's gonna win because he knew who's gonna win now look at this flag reason language bigotry sexism what's the bigotry in the sexism there I don't understand it I don't see any bigotry Oh bigotry and protects sexism that he's a man and he's showing big dick energy because he's big dick energy is an expression and it's an expression for someone who is super confident and the idea that you you say well it must have a big dick that's the joke sexist no it's a joke it's an internet meme big dick energy is an internet meme and that this is flag type bad language bigotry sexist right here's the best part post type liked he just liked it like you saw I was like hah because it is a big dick energy move but to find you down call your dad and say I'm about to win a million dad surprise big dick energy yes no it's not a phrase that we commonly use it's in the UK we're too refined for that okay that's vulgar yeah is vulgar but it's a new American thing over the last wave four years or so like two maybe two years it's having a big dick sexist then is that the I guess that's what they're saying and it's bigotries the hilarious part I'm well scour that motherfucker forever and try to find some bigotry there you know a gentleman's name if you want to read this folks you want to read along with his internet name is km l flat-4 kfr and say km LEF ra NC on Twitter Bruce Bruce Almighty hilarious so he's a funny guy bye the way they don't know what bigotry means I'm really sick of this word being thrown around right it's a real problem right there I mean he should be able to sue for that one because there's nothing bigotry about that a big bigotry is the dictionary definition of bigotry is an intolerance to those with different opinions yes and and more often than not sorry that I didn't mean to patronize you but it's just that whenever I hear the word being used it's always by bigots who can't tolerate your opinion so you're a bigot you you don't agree with everything I say and therefore you're a bigger that make you just undermined your whole fuck that's gross but liking tweets I mean it's but it's bad enough that people sort of troll through everything you have a road biking but liking them and what's crazy about that is this is a company that's doing this so there's a company that they hired that's willing to do this and the company labeled it bigotry so is the company woke is this the company fam'ly the smartest way to screen toxic workplace behavior no they'll be they'll fam'ly is a talent screening software okay so it's software that's part of the problem to help identify problematic behavior among potential hires and current employees by analyzing publicly available online information out boy would I have a hard time getting a job I just looked up said that another company used this company to get that information so I background check yeah a company 3 P company and saying like that's really sinister well it seems like it's just software it's just like yeah this is a talent screening software so it's basically they just scan you to make sure that you pass their purity test which no one will knowing with any sense of humor I mean if that guy the big dick energy guy that gets you flagged you're a bad person because you thought that that guy who knew he's gonna win a million dollar so he called his dad I mean that's that's funny is that anyone I like there is no way that there's anyone on the planet who couldn't become sort of you had unlimited access to their private no way texts yes wait and I but that's part of why people want to cancel people because they know it could come back at them and there's a certain thrill like one of the things you find about people like here's one right whenever you see a homophobic preacher almost guarantee that guy's gay oh yeah almost guarantee you know these sinners and there homosexuality getting together and layin with man and you could see the boner just developing in their pants it's that's what these people I love that and then they always get they always get caught with a rent boy doing crystal meth or something like that people who just have just alpha even if you if you're adhering to this woke ideology and you're part of the cult if you just have a few fucked up sketchy things in their past you know that they could get you and so let's just stay on the offensive stay on the offensive but then the same with my elephant anyone who identifies as male feminist a nerd person and the number times like you know they're a wandering hound predator it's like anybody who identifies as a male feminist should be flagged yes they should flag them and then just go through their stuff like what why so you see it strategic you see I've got a hundred percent I know guys who are creepers who identifies male feminists so that they could get women to think that they're whoa and they're a part of the good squad right good guys it's just it's a transparent ploy by sneaky men to try to fuck that's all it is it's the most obvious it's like the dumbest magic trick ever like you could see them stuff the handkerchief their sleeve it's so stupid but you and I feminists used to just mean someone who believes in equality of the sexes which is pretty much everyone right so it's but it's a problem in in the word right bird has feminine in it you should be an egalitarian you can be an overall open-minded person who believes in the individual and you don't want to separate anyone yeah whether it's by race or gender or sexual orientation or anything yeah into any groups you love people and you want everyone to have equal opportunity you want everybody have equal treat so you would get rid of the what feminists do you think no I don't know I would never get rid of it because I think it's empower empowering for some people that have grown up in suppressive environments and to be able to establish yourself as someone who's resisting something that you've fought against I'll give you if you grew up in a horrible environment like maybe your dad beat your mom and you were told you're a piece of shit because you're a woman and then you finally get in with this group that tells you no as a feminist you you're you're empowered you're you're a powerful woman and yeah I don't want to get rid of any labels but I would I would be on board with that Tony if I thought that modern-day feminism has anything to do with empowerment but I don't think it is I I think it's do with women a weak women are victims women need special protection I think it's the opposite of empowerment in a lot of feminist views in a lot of feminist views well I try not to generalize in but my issues with men they call themselves feminists okay okay you know I just don't buy it I'd have never met one everyone I've met as a creeper if either a creeper or the most ultimate beta male well most women don't even identify as feminists they most women don't know mmm that I have met there yes so they're so obviously compromised right okay and you know or it's men that I have these really powerful women like it's theirs that's a lot of it it's like men who have this like really powerful girlfriend yeah and you know they're kind of weak yeah there's a lot of that you know I always I have a joke show me a man who claims to be a feminist who can pick up heavy shit and run fast they don't exist right okay I'll try and prove you wrong on that well it's probably a guy who really likes to fuck yeah it's like he can fuck in a regular way but he's just like he's trying to like cover all the bases so you know what I'm gonna be a fucking feminist too bro get them all so it does make sense to me but again I try not to imagine what's going on in people's heads and them but you're right so many of them do it just happens all the time so many of them let you say with the gay preaches it's just so you preachers classic why would you why would you care why you so angry about gay people why do you care also some of them of really camp and effeminate yeah and he's just saying okay I know it's clearly I had a bit about it that there's only two types of people that hate gay marriage either you're dumb or you're secretly worried that dicks are delicious right exactly and that's what you get from those people you get this weird thing where you're you're trying to throw people off the trail yeah the people like huh it's like if you show up at a you know and hit run car accident you're like wow who did this yeah this is crazy I would never do this I can't even believe someone would do this I mean I'll tell you what I would never do it if you're looking for people it wouldn't be very it's like the criminal joining the vigilante gasps it's it's it's it's an old trick absolutely well cops always say that when someone's an arsonist they're almost always at the scene of the crime yeah they always show up to watch their handiwork well I'm gonna think about this more than cause I mean you're you're sort of putting into my mind now this idea that there's a lot of the work people are doing it in order to cover their own tracks and well they're like a self preservation kinda there's you know definitely that but I think it's also they don't want any of that smoke they don't want any of it coming they see how vicious it is horrible it is like yes late I'm friends with a guy who used to be woken now it's not his name is Jaime kill Steen and I still got to fucking call out man they went after him that'll do it oh my god and in in a small way you know in comparison of the way some people have gotten it yeah but he recognized like how crazy it is he also recognized that his own patterns were so problematic like he was tweeting mean things to people and call him a sexist pig and a piece of shit in homophobic and he was doing it to get that love and they would check his Twitter like obsessively oh yeah yeah couldn't even he was walking down the street he kept pulling his phone out of his pocket see how people are responding to his tweet yeah and it becomes an addiction and this is crazy how it does people have that thing where they feel the vibration in their pocket and there is no vibration it's like it's like they aren't even vibrating it's like there's a term for this so it's like I took all of my social media apps and this was hugely beneficial and I put them all on the back page of my phone and I put them in a folder that says addict right to remind yourself you have your sin so if I want to fuck around I want to go on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram I don't really go on Facebook but if I want to go on one of those I have to go into the attic folder yeah and remind yourself yeah so I don't go in that I mean I'm getting better at it that's great it does bring out the worst in people and it brings out the worst in me like I find the same thing as well one we're layman beings you know and you can't it I I wanted the extent to which social media has sort of escalated everything in the real world as well you know because because people we haven't got a dolt discussing stuff anymore we've got children throwing mud you know that's what's basically happening well you and I are discussing things it's just it's harder to find someone who could just sit down and talk to you but there's a bunch of people that are waking up to it yeah there's a lot of people that are getting flip phones too yeah there's a lot of people that are realizing like this is a this is a bad addiction yeah no no I can see doc it's no I've considered getting a flip phone or maybe a phone with no apps on it at all you know that's not a bad idea - well I deleted Twitter for a week and then I got so much work done yeah I was so productive it was really great but it's just I get trapped in those cycles of stupid conversations where someone's arguing with figment of their imagination they've decided that you believe something that you just don't believe and they're telling you what you believe and you're well you have the luxury of a character as well yeah but I used to before I was outed when did you get out it that was when the book came that was March last year and I was gutted I didn't do it right how did you it was the Sunday Times in in London oh oh you know what so the journalist had done this really interesting investigative journalism stuff like a Rosamund Irwin her name was and she'd um she'd read loads of my political articles cuz I write these articles for spike magazine and she'd read the advance copy of the book and she'd seen that some of the quotations match up and then she emailed me saying I think you're titania McGrath can you can you confirm or deny this and I fudged it you know I'm a mile back I didn't lie but I sort of fudged she phoned friends of mine to ask whether it was me she and I hadn't told any rat you out and told him in fact what was great some of my friends were following titania and I didn't know it's me what was a bit bad was a couple of times when I slag come off as her as a joke and they didn't know as me anyway I loved being in the closet you know and all of you thought about creating a new character I've got a couple of hope I can build them up but like there was a real it was like I loved like just being a character and then the thing is because the outing happened the week of the book they look deliberate it looked like I'd sort of cynically trying to cool down it well it was a big publicity thing right but help book sales yeah I know but I didn't I still didn't want it because now you know what the big difference is now is that everyone who hates her and by the way like the social justice activist their venom for this character is off the fucking scale they you know I don't expect them to find it funny I get that then I'm not going to find it funny right but the anger is is just unbelievable so now it goes to me right so now whenever she tweets something that they find offensive they they go for me on do they call you by name yeah or they reply with my name you know and that I get screenshot sent back can be saying this is homophobic or whatever and I'm like none of it is none of it is I is never minorities with her the target is her there's you know the the the goal posts have been moved so far away from reality yeah that there's no logic to any of it no you know someone called me homophobic because I said I had an old tweet this from 2012 right yeah they dug up a bunch of tweets about me this week okay any one of them from 2012 said call me romantic but I love it when I see gay couples that are so comfortable that they can kiss in public I saw this yes because then someone said that you were fetishizing gay people by come on that's hilarious that was a that was a legitimate tweet I was probably high I saw because that's when I feel like warm and fuzzy and I saw a gay couple make out I think that was what it was amused eight fucking years ago it's hard to remember but that's quite sweet so you may as well over in fucking fags Peggy may as well wait as well like but I was legitimately you know you know it's it's weird man it's weird the whole thing is very weird but they could just call you homophobic for that it's just so well that's the other thing we could do is like is well I hate using the phrase call out but how about we start calling out people who misuse those words right yeah maybe if you're homophobic you hate gay people yeah not you don't you like you you think it's nice that they can kiss openly in public it's so it says there's no logic to it but that's a thing it's like you're arguing with someone who's there the very it's like the idea that if you leave Islam if you you could be killed right right this is what happens to accommodate yeah right yeah that is crazy yeah right the if you leave you it's so terrifying that someone could kill you but that is the same kind of religious thinking religious crazed ideology adherence to the dogma yeah no matter what that would allow someone to think that I could be homophobic by saying that I think it's great when gay guys are so comfortable they kiss in public it's because they know you are in your mind they do this incredible mind-reading that's what it's all about they're all psychos did you know that they're always like they don't care about rial they don't get out that's true yeah there's no need for reality in their world if they've decided that you're a bigot then they can use anything and everything against you including pro-gay tweets at sprout yeah you can they can use it exactly they think I can use a pro-gay tweet to prove that you're homophobic it's amazing but it's kind of good because it's so crazy that logical left-leaning people read that and they go what the fuck they do and they go come on man and you know it's been positive for me yeah in a lot of ways that they're so over the top that you know like about gay friends go did I know you're homophobic I'm like I don't know either I mean oh I know but they know you know maybe this is why they always turn most severely on people from the left who question this stuff they really do cuz they expect it from the right I think - yeah especially if you look like you should be on the right and you're on the left which I definitely do right you know it's like there's you mean you could try to figure it out but I think it all boils down to adherence adherence strict adherence and compliance to the dogma and if you don't if you're not willing to comply 100% with the ideology they'll attack you said you just like Martina Navratilova but that's why I think left and right is no longer helpful I know I think I think it's about that's why there are all these weird alliances going on there I mean I did this event recently with Peter Bogosian who I know you've spoken and James Lindsay and we were given these talks at this event in London and we were sitting there at lunch and there was like the head of the Atheist Society sit next to this evangelical Christian pastor from America and there was like there were people of no faith in all faiths and left and right and it's like but we all believe in Liberty like ultimately we all care about freedom and individual freedom and that's that that's the new fault line it's not left against right it's people who believe in in Liberty for the individual or people who want more authority to control you and that's that's the real conflict well if the right really wanted to bring more people over what they would do is establish like universally across the board an appreciation for gay people appreciation for gay marriage and appreciation for the need to take impoverished communities and bring them up yeah an appreciation for welfare an appreciation for you know raising the minimum wage yeah if they just started a few things like that good lord the amount of people that would jump off that fucking ship that sinking ship of liberal ideas yeah because it's just it's infested with rats it's infested with rats that are a hole in the very hull of the ship that happened in the UK was the Conservative government that pushed through gay marriage because actually because actually it's quite conservative but yes you know dead government out of your life yeah yeah seven it should be well maybe that's what they maybe that's what they need to do but I think what definitely if you if you support the left you need to try and dissuade the Democrats and the and the Labour Party from going woke because they alienate all of their major do and they don't even realize they're doing it but the problem is in this country there's no room for a third party right who don't appreciate it or believe in it now you guys have you don't have the option daily maybe they kind of do like Gary Johnson ran last year and some people voted for him but what's really happened in this country previously historically is that when someone charismatic came along that's an independent they really just take votes away from the Democrats yes vote right yeah the Republicans are pretty rigid well actually here's a example against that though is Ross Perot he actually took votes away from the Republican and that's why Bill Clinton got in office right Bill Clinton actually won when Herbert Walker Bush was in his first term so he only did one term and then Bill Clinton won and when Herbert Walker Bush was going for re-election and the reason why run but he won rather is cuz Ross Perot who is this eccentric billionaire do you remember him no I know I'm sorry I remember prosper yeah yeah he was an eccentric billionaire independently yes independent and he got on TV and bought an entire half hour of primetime television right to show people how they're getting fucked by the Federal Reserve and taxes and he was explaining I had a pad here take it on look over there see what I'm gonna do they take it here and I get it and he was doing all this shit here but it's like what the fuck and I remember everybody was all in the wall I voted for him I'm pretty sure yeah it's hard to remember you worried about playing the boat or than that we've been 21 but he I'm alright I think I mean there isn't that much between the Democrats in the paraffins is it and there's you don't have a real sort of left-wing right-wing option that they've pretty similar on a lot depends on who you're talking to you know if you if there's there's a giant difference between Ted Cruz and Bernie sander right there's a giant difference there's some a lot of it is people are concerned with abortion rights a giant one and people are concerned with a Republican putting someone in the Supreme Court that is going to limit a woman's right to choose such social issues that's really nice those are big ones and those are also big ones those pro-life people they you know they will not vote for someone who's not pro-life and so if you get to a position where you're our Republican you pretty much have to be pro-life right if you want want the group that is a sticking point yeah because they they you know and this is there's no judgement here but this is their their position is that you're killing a baby yeah right and they're like I don't give a fuck about anything else you can't kill a goddamn baby right and so they're like okay okay okay and so many Republicans that maybe even have had abortions and I'll be open about that they have to hide it this is why I think someone like Sanders is is a genuine left-wing option and why someone like Elizabeth Warren or someone who's pushing the woke thing it will never be that would be like electoral hemlock I think it will just absolutely not work but see is they don't see that how do you not see it because they're full of shit but how do they not see it happen like Hillary Clinton was targeting all the various demographics and she said she was splitting the elektra up and south and it didn't work well how can they not see that this never would have you ever known someone who's just a real liar like a pathological liar yeah up a pass they make up things they don't know that other people can't tell or that other people can tell rather that they're not normal they're not they're not acting normal I don't seem genuine okay there's certain there's certain aspects of people that it's hard to tell but there's some people just don't seem genuine and political people in particular like when people are running for political office that's when that shit really stands out yeah it's over and over and over again you see them doing these speeches and over and over and over again you see them talking about things and some people can sense it and some people can't but they can't tell when you're a liar you can't tell other people see you right because you're lying like I know a guy I'm gonna be nice here no name names no never he's gay as fuck but he doesn't think everybody knows it he's some point right he's gay everyone that I know knows he's gay and this we all wish you know but he's got a family he's got like a wife and kids and we're all speculating like how does this guy get his rocks off yeah crazy but it's just one of those things like the the man is a homosexual I'm pretty sure I mean if I had a bad I'm fucking pushing all my chips right okay right and because of that he acts and this really strange because he's living this kind of live a life he acts in a strange way and I don't think he realizes that people know and you think a lot of these people go into politics a lot of these thoughts that kind of sociopathic oh yeah there's mad there's something about them and so they have this fake earnestness to them right and that fake earnestness will work it will work if you're talking to 10,000 people if you're talking to 10,000 people about the way we can come together as a country and we can take America back yeah there's no connection I always put that down to them having to follow a party line or their slogan izing you know they're throwing slow yeah there's also that I can't this is why I'd never be a politician I couldn't I couldn't bear not to just say what I think you can't be a politician know for sure but think when someone's trying to be woke what they're doing is they're just has nothing to do with being genuine if someone's a woke politician unless that's who they really are Oh see I think and Rasheeda to leave me I think they mean what they say well she is also you know she's named 30 29 year-old right she's idealistic and she's got these thoughts of the future and and she's you know democratic socialist there was an article in spectator this week about this is like that that there aren't really woke people they're just sort of that they're just sort of acting this out I wish that were true but I don't think it is I don't think it was and I think Trump's being very smart whenever he whenever he sort of brings people like Ellen OMA into the limelight focuses on AOC and focus on though because it it means that you start thinking Democrat is woke yes you know it sends that sort of message ice and we know it just never it never works right that's why I despair with the labor part in the way the Labor Party went like it's just you know I I want to see a proper opposition I'm gonna see a proper left wing part that cares about class issues that cares about money that cares about the poverty line social mobility you know not you know whether you're and whatever yeah microaggressions or whatever you know compassion for people that are trying to get by in this life not social justice issues yeah not nonsense yeah exactly and that's the way most people feel that you know that really is but I think it's also we this is a symptom of a very simple not not simple excuse me a society where it's pretty easy to get by yeah there's it's not we're not dealing with World War two right okay it would be impossible to be woke if we're being invaded by the knots of course these would not be priorities right but no exactly but it would never take hold it takes hold in this incredibly safe environment if you need pain kurz work which shows the progression of society becoming safer and safer do you know the resistance that he gets to these ideas yeah where people call them some sort of a piece of shit and enabler and horrible things they say to him for just talking about science and statistics and showing the trends yeah that we live in probably one of the greatest times to be alive ever yeah but that's also why people are finding things to complain about finding things that are issues finding things to rally for finding things these main causes I think the way that people speak at the moment is that the UK and the u.s. at the moment the most bigoted racist homophobic societies they've ever been and then they're the opposite of that they're the most tolerant they've ever been and what's weird about that is the statistics by bear it out yes so all of that all of the studies show that the UK Great Britain is the most tolerant major European country even the EU zone research into this shows that the tolerance towards immigration for instance in the UK has become so much more improved since the brexit fro so we are up there you know we're and yet and for some reason as things get better and better and better and society gets more progressive and more tolerant claims of bigotry and racism get more and more escalated and they and that's oh that's that is I think something we could challenge like firstly let's get the left to be left again and and fuck all the woke nonsense but also remind people that they're not oppressed when they say they are like if someone claims to be oppressed that's a very specific extreme thing right it's not just well I sense there's some unconscious bias in the world or or maybe that actor should have been a different color or like oppression is something very different someone's asking you for your papers when you're turning every corner someone's not letting right you a proper approach approach is what dictators do is what tyrants do it's what they do in North Korea where you fuck up though they'll arrest your whole family and put your whole family in prison ironically leaning towards woke nurse actually starts to create a pression like you see that guy who got his fucking Twitter check yeah yeah for liking funny me and so how is it the case that those sort of tactics I'm not saying that they that that's an authoritarian company but those tactics are straight from the authority of a person all right sir so it how is it that they can't see the hypocrisy of that that they can't see that what this is where this is leading I think they probably had no idea it was gonna be that extreme when they first implemented it and they just wanted to keep problematic people out of their office right if you're a person who is like say if you're hiring someone and you find out you know a few weeks after they're on the job that they have you know some really horrific posts on Twitter yeah and people have found that before I remember there was a story there was a man who got outed and he had a reddit account yes reddit account was horrific okay but this is your talk about genuine so that's the kind of neo-nazi horrible oh no it was neo-nazi I think it was like pedophilia okay talking about petrich it was a lot of it was joking around and stuff but he was just responsible for awful shit and so the internet people like fuck this guy let's find out what the fuck he is so they found out who he is and then they let his boss know and they sent copies of all the shit that he had written on Reddit and he got fired for it right that's but that's different but but these sorts of initiatives that are set up you can't trust them to make those important distinctions between something that is very serious right and something that could obviously end up with all sorts of issues you're an employer the last thing you want is one of those guys slipping through your radar where you don't know that this guy's working that's true okay but I still get really uncomfortable the idea of trolling through everyone's in history I do as well a lot of these people that are saying these things they do it for sport yeah they don't really mean that you know they're not really Nazis like there's a lot of people that do that Pepe the Frog meme yes anything they do it because it makes other people feel uncomfortable so they think it's funny so I he feels bad man he's a Nazi I only realized this properly when I did meet that countdown killer guy because he showed me the discord server you know the chat room they all go into and it was I was like oh I can't deal with this stuff like some of the stuff that was in there as I can't but what I could clearly see is it's like big kids it's like big teenagers they're just one-upmanship they're just trying to outgrow each other right and so it's like you know the khaki stand flag yes so the khaki stand flag which isn't a satire of of identity politician of identitarian you know and then they modeled it on the Nazi flag to take the piss yeah right but of course if you don't know that world and you're not from that one you see that flag you think oh my god that's a Nazi flag yes they're just copying it yes and so if you don't know if you don't immerse yourself in that world like I'm from Anaheim announced from outsider's perspective it took someone to show me for me to sort of get it Jordan had to show it to me oh did he Jordan had explained the whole thing to me and you know and Jordan has taken so much heat because he posed for a photograph with these guys that had him hold up the flag of the khaki Stan and he thought it was funny because he thinks that these sort of these memes yeah that it's it's he's he's interested in the fact that people interpret them so severely yes and so extreme or they jump to the worst possibility yes they assume the worst of everyone well it's because of the small percentage well are actually not see frog that's what I was going to say that the counter-argument to that is well couldn't genuine fascist use this as cover that's the that's the counter-argument that people use so one thing that dangler told me is that what happens is they'll spot these new action neo-nazis coming into the server and they'll get you know they'll deal with them you know they sort them out themselves they've got him way of sort of discerning it and then that's the typical argument yeah that humor and well that's a great way also if you wanted to break up a group you infiltrate and act like a Nazi right that kekaa stand flag and then all sudden everyone's a Nazi is associated with that frog yeah I mean that is a that's a classic government move I think it's I think it's incumbent on people to try and understand the culture that they're criticizing you know yes like my friend Steven Knight who does he's an interviewer and he went and interviewed a bunch of people on a March with the khaki Stan flag and was asking them about their views and whether they're racing when he spoke to them it's quite clear that they just don't that they're part of this internet culture and they think it's funny and they think it's trolling and all of that sort of stuff and yes and once you realize that if you have a generous interpretation of that then then you understand that this isn't this isn't this horrible right but but but people use this as evidence you have this rising fascism they use they use people joking about fascism as evidence of the rise in fascism those two things just don't and why would you why would you want to live in a world where there are fascists every why would you want to believe that I don't understand that like the people who proclaim to be anti-racist I've never seen anyone more excited to find racism there that they love racism they can't wait to find it under every stone in every corner well that's how they justify their actions right so it just exact I think gives them purpose gives them something to do well it's also like we were talking about with world people that they can't you can't be woken up because once they found all the other people that aren't following the doctor and then they turn on each other they will absolutely yeah well III god no one's gone through my tweets yeah and no as far as I'm aware I'm fucking putting this out there now but no-one's done that to me yeah and so and I'm like what did I say now I'm good acting myself is there jokes there must be of course I mean I've been on Twitter since 2007 I've said so much stupid shit and I used to use it differently to I used to use Twitter like I would post things that I thought people would react to a silly way and I would just retweet things and not even say anything like what let's see how have you know people freak out about should get someone to go back over it really yeah that's the best attitude yeah good luck exactly go waste your life going through my tweets some people I know they do this thing where they they self destruct the tweets after seven days you know so that oh really yeah they do that I did that with titania for a bit when in the early days she was getting mass reported and I thought like she kept getting banned like she'd had can you talk about her like she's a real person I do that's how I know I bit the role because I have to think of her as something other do you think that when you do that when you inhabit her do you think that you understand and appreciate the way these people think and do you think that it's attractive and in some way yeah like I know about it because I used to study this stuff hmmm so I used to I used to teach and I used to I did a thesis which was about post structuralism and pass about post monitors and a lot about Foucault and all the origins of this stuff so I'm familiar with it and I'm familiar with the language and I'm afeeling minute familiar with the ideas and of course all of my friends I've always been on the left so I know this I know what this is all about and it's fun to try it to think in the way that they think and and because that's how I come up with the jokes is I think is what's the most extreme way I could take this this obvious thought how can i push it as far as using their mindset not my mindset right and that's it's it's kind of a fun thing to do it's kind of interesting I would imagine to be very fun I find people that believe what they believe very strongly to be extremely attractive yeah and attractive I don't mean like I'm sexually attracted them I mean attractive like mmm like this is weak like I watch a lot of fundamentalist religious videos yeah because I really get fascinated by people that are all in I totally agree I love watching those Westboro Baptist Church music videos they're hilarious they're really funny they're like it's I watch that I think God you you believe this I mean like this is this is crazy to an extreme extent but they again they're sincere and they are sincere but I like it with all religions I've watched it with multiple different religions with yet Islam and Christianity and Mormonism I've watched a lot of videos where people really really really believe and then the other people really believe tuned there's something attractive about that and I think it's and I better watch it to try to understand it right because yeah my parents are my stepdad and my mom basically atheists I was raised by atheists and before that I was Catholic so I was Catholic tells like first grade and then from then on you know when my mom married my stepdad was all no there was no religion in the household right and out so I've always been kind of fascinated by people that have this intense belief in something yeah and particularly something that's really not logical like if you laid the tenants out like we make a Mac okay and turn daughter into one I mean I come from a Catholic family as well you know and I think my mother was a postulant nun so it's a very well yeah Irish just felt so heavy pretty heavy yeah yeah I recently steal pictures of her in the habit you know it's a scary thing to see but yeah I mean the belief that you have the faith that you have is irrational by its own definition but that's not a threat if you have if you have that genuine part that part of the joy of faith I think is that you were believing it in spite of in spite of rational thought right yeah the joy of believing in something that you and I think there's something about that where you like the fact that other people also aren't questioning it right like when you see people at church one of the things they like I believe this is that they like the fact that you're not questioning either good Lords gonna look after us am yes yeah is Tom and they they like this sort of simple really in the box kind of thinking from you because if I know that you think like that I can kind of predict how you're going to at least behave most of the time and don't we all have a it's much more fun isn't it to read someone who agrees with you and someone who's challenging you because because challenging I think takes its effort right now it's exhausting so I but I think what you've identified there applies to all ideologies whether it's political or religious you know I think no it's this with with ideologues is that when I talk to someone who say someone says something really woke say someone says like I think the movie Dunkirk should have had more people of color which was a common criticism at the time once they've said something that's that woke I'd know every other opinion they have on everything else they never surprised me because because they've got a series of things that they believe and that's the same with the religious person someone says I'm a Catholic well I know where you believe about substantiation or whatever you know and that means that you're not thinking for yourself in yeah they have this predetermined pattern of behavior yeah which is why ideology scares me full stop which is why I don't mind saying conservatives are right about some things left wingers are right about other things and and and having the discussion and accepting that I'm probably wrong about an awful lot of stuff as well like that to me is is better than saying I know all the answers as like a Marxist wood or a woke person wood or a Catholic wood or whatever what we need to do is create an ideology of open-mindedness but that wouldn't be an ideology right of course we wouldn't think but they always we'll say that so the anti walk thing they say is an ideology in of itself mm-hmm to be open that's like saying that a theism is a religion it's not it's not the same thing well some atheists do act like religious people though weird well they absolutely know for sure that nothing happens to you when you die and you don't know that but the burden of proof is on those who claim that it does surely like well yes if you want to say that you know for sure that you go to heaven and you ride around the clouds and Peter's there with a book and there's a harp and gods there and yes yeah the burden of proof is on you yeah but if you want to say that absolutely nothing happens to you when you die you're sure I say okay have you died yeah you've never died so how do you know right you don't okay you gotta say you don't know because if you soon as you say you know something that I know you can't know then I know you're bullshitting and you might be bullshitting about something that is logical like atheism right it's logical that there probably is in a guy in the clouds of the harp because it doesn't seem to make much sense but you don't know what the fuck happens when you die that is a fair point and and Richard Dawkins address that point in his book The God Delusion because he says he is actually a de facto atheist insofar as he there's a room for agnosticism they're like nah no point naught naught 1 % he will acknowledge the possibility that there might be an afterlife was also never done psychedelic drugs and I talked to him about that has he not no I didn't he's worried about it and I'm like come on bro you're dying you know like he's worried about the impact of it well he's worried about the effect on his body and why okay I'm like people listen just take a small dose of mushrooms and I guarantee you'll have a very different perspective on reality itself you'll have visions and you might be lowered into the into the religious well yeah I don't think it'll lure you into religion unless you live in thousands of years ago before science but it would give you the idea that there is perhaps something available there's levels of consciousness there's things available to regular human beings that take in these molecules right and that people have been doing this and this has been the source of religious experiences for thousands and thousands of years yeah books written about it I'm sure you know I mean I could say to myself quite spiritual person I'm you know I think that's that's fine I think there's a tainted word though why what's wrong with that because people spiritual is like like whenever people say you know that they're I'm spiritual like that's one of those words that like makes me think you're into crystals and no I'm not into Krita no I don't mean I don't mean but in America spiritual is like it's it's sort of tainted by yoga people how I say yeah yeah we can and they say namaste okay you know I don't mean that is wrong with that either I know it's it's people that they go with that I mean I mean that there's something numinous about humanity and about life and about existence and I mean that there's something wondrous about it and there's something that is it is beyond the mere animal oh greed yeah that's all that's all I mean by that yeah I think so too and you know and that's I'm deeply deeply distrustful of people that are cruel yeah me too yeah absolutely was one of the reasons I don't like the wou clock because I I think pretty much everything I do is driven by a hatred of bullying yeah I hate bullying I hated it when I was a kid I hated it when I was one right everybody you know I know I didn't hate when I was one but I hated it subsequently when I got bullied but you know that thing of like bullying people is just the most myth it's childish if the way children behave when they're trying to seek dominance over other people yeah and anyone who claims that anyone who bullies someone so viciously and claims to be the good guy I can't bear that right that to me is the most yes I agree and they feel justified in their bullying which is fascinating well it's that thing that Steven Weinberg said about you know in order for good people to do bad things it takes a form of religion and that's I think that's I think what we see it's all going back to what we're talking about earlier it is these patterns of behavior that we have seen since the beginning of time so that means we've solved it I think we can work out it's about dee dee radicalizing yeah it's acknowledging it at least in ideology but then you're faced with the criticism that you're setting up a new ideology to combat that ideology so it's about it's about you probably are unless yeah okay unless you say it's about open-mindedness I think you have to be very strong to exist without a real clear ideology if you have you got very strong well you have guiding principles yeah and you have a and there are I do believe some universal but to never submit to Dogma never submit you should guard against it and and and and above all be willing to listen to people you don't agree with above you I think can do that the people that were coerced by the Nazis to join the party because they got into a chat room yeah there's a problem there and I think you know I had a joke about people then I was explaining something to my daughter when she was asking me why people certain white people believe things and I say some people have big ears some people have small ears right well some people have brains that are made out of dog shit right and that's just how it goes and there's not much you can do about those folks unless is that not just a failure of Education you know it's a little bit of a fare failure of Education so in some instances it's definitely that but in some instances some people are dull they're just not very bright but if we had a society where people were socialized well you know because I think being an economist a dull absolutely depends on being socialized effectively as a child yeah but you know there's some people have you ever been to a comedy hypnotism show what's I didn't know that exists yeah yeah it's really there was a big thing back in Massachusetts when I started doing stand-up in Boston there was a guy named Frank Santos and he was a famous hypnotist great guy yeah and Frank was the best he was a genius at it and he would get people on stage like who wants to be hypnotized he wants me he did a show that was a weekly at stitches comedy club in Boston yeah all comics like myself would all go to watch because it was guaranteed hilarious so we would go to the comedy club and we would sit in the back and watch Frank Santos bring he would bring like ten people onstage and he would hypnotize them in front of everybody and some people he couldn't hypnotize and I don't mean hypnotized like sit you down because I've been hypnotized before where they sit you down like my friend Vinnie Sherman who's a hypnotist who works with fighters and listen like a mental coach and he basically gets you into a calm state starts introducing ideas to you this is not like that Frank would do this publicly in front of people and he could get a certain percentage of people to just go with suggestion and he'd be like you right now are having sex with Madonna you on top of Madonna you can't even believe it oh my god you're so happy you're gonna come in your pants and he would do that in the guy we go oh like they would come in their pants and it was actually a jacket yes they were jacket okay and they didn't know what happened and then he would go you're gonna go to sleep now and he would tell him go to sleep and they would just just drop their head and he would know when they were bullshitting and he would know where they were not bullshit and I had long conversations with him about this I'm like how do you do this and he had been hypnotizing people forever to keep talking he was a legitimate hypnotist but he's like some people are just really susceptible is it is it partly performative though in those situations is it that some of them are thinking there's an audience there I'd better do what I'm told or even even I have clean data but you know knew when they were not under okay dude it was crazy it's crazy to what end it's not you and it's not him and it's not me there's certain people the people that would join the cult there's certain people say you're talking about suggestible people who are instinctively suggestible right the like the hale-bopp comet cult remember that the Heaven's Gate cult they cut their balls off and wore purple Nikes and they waited for the cut and they all killed themselves right in the comet was coming do you remember that I actually just does ring a bell yeah but who the fuck would do that who would do that people with really dull minds there's certain people look some people are tall some people are short some people's brains don't work well alright but even I think this is a this is something where we don't agree I said low because I think ultimately what you do even if you do identify that even if you say in the in society there are these people who suggestible just stupid let's call it what it is yeah dar minded low IQ they still have every right to live in our society and be treated well and all the rest of it so sure so um but and I don't think we should just change all our laws and traditions in the way we do think because some people are going to react like idiots and some people are going to you know I just think I'm with you as a person because I'm not saying that we should I'm just saying it's going to be always going to be a problem but that's that's a great a good way of approaching it's to acknowledge that it's always gonna be a problems because this is often the argument used for censorship isn't it's like that if you put out a film that is particularly violent of course most people aren't going to react to it but some will yes well fine some will but that but that those same people could be triggered by absolutely anything it right it could be an angry word that a relative said it could be a news item that they saw because we still have to live in the world as it exists and not try and absolutely total everyone and try and prevent any possibility of transgression I have 100% agree with you and I'm on your side but I'm saying even if you do your best yeah who's going to be a certain amount of people that are just not going the education is not gonna see you in the the evaluation of things on an objective level is never gonna work that's cuz you're dealing with human beings and that's that's why when when when the social justice movement think that they can attain this utopia they think they can wipe out prejudice right think that right I think that what you can do is you can try and limit it as much as possible and confront it where it exists but but it is delusional to think that you're gonna get rid of malevolence and human and human factor and oftentimes they suffer from their own prejudice you know did you see the thing with Don Lemon on CNN ideas - guys where they started mocking Trump supporters and and pretending they're stupid and using a southern accent I'm like you guys that's gonna be adorable my prejudice yeah yeah exactly and you're pretending it's funny yes is even more offensive as a comedian you know that shit ain't funny and Don Lemon like ha and then afterwards even worse he says he didn't realize that people were being mocked and he didn't hear all of it yeah he said he he what he was laughing over them speaking or somebody said he didn't hear the whole realize that they were saying things that were offensive I'm sorry I would never mock it because some forms of prejudice are okay and some are right you know Zach the one I really love about the social justice law but maybe this is just a British thing but they're all really ageist they've got a real problem with old people right and then white people Oh white people right well then well there's that form of prejudice I think it's because it brexit because it's disproportionately older people's oh yeah so they're like oh I don't care about all people and in fact you even have like the left-leaning papers like The Guardian and the independence sort of talking like well they're all gonna die off soon and then we can have another vote yeah but that's not how it works it's like old people die from then there are no more old people like people get older people change their minds it was Rick but it was also really toxic it was this thing of like you know they've fucked up the future for the young and they're all you know it was really ugly yeah and if for some reason these people who claim that immutable characteristics must be protected doesn't matter if you're old they'll go for you if you're old or you know let you say straight white male straight away and see the old faith in ourselves yeah yeah but I don't know how you can see that as anything is hypocritical well to make that point you your logical and you're intelligent your objective of course you can't but their work you know I mean it's they might as well be in that Heaven's Gate cult that's the same thing well I think I wonder if a lot of it is coming from the media it's coming from the press is coming from there we've got I don't know what it's like I mean we saw that asked from the New York Times we've got stuff like that we've got this paper The Guardian and the independent they are pushing this stuff hardcore itself every single day you know it's a lot of heat clicks - yeah oh they so if actually shall I give you this example do you know that I trolled the independent the newspaper No right so I wanted to test as an experiment right whether they would publish something really stupidly woke just because it's woke right so I submitted an article like James Lindsay and right yeah like that on a smaller scale you know but I I thought I wrote an article arguing that comedians ought to be prosecuted for hate speech right that mentioning a few comics mention and it was so obviously a hoax and so obviously stupid and I made up a name and I sent in and they got back to me that this is brilliant we love this this is amazing they were really loving it and they published it it's still online and what's he wear how could we find right it's hold the name is Liam if you search Liam Evans desert your name yeah and I must my fate Liam Evans independent and the headline is something like it's something to do with comedy if you search that it'll come I hate speech hate speech or how many of these online names so here it is right as a comedy aficionado I'm appalled at discussing jokes creeping back into the industry and look at a neighbor look at the tagline comedians crying free speech isn't good enough hate crime laws should apply to all of us now the thing about this article if you take the fourth letter of every sentence it spells out to Tonya McGrath wrote this you gullible hacks and this is a mainstream oh my god that's hilarious the mainstream newspaper it's a it's one of our major it's amazing that you were able to encode that well it also shows that they did fuck all editing they said they just took it because they loved what it was saying was the point isn't to try and fool people who'll be mean to people or anything it's it's exposing this thing that the media will if the woke media if it furthers their agenda they'll publish anything by someone who wasn't even known he had no online presence this guy it's just they agreed with the sentiment and so they published it in their paper you just be a random so random random person sends it in and they're like brilliant yeah they just agree and they put it in a national paper that was the independence you know it's it's um I can't believe haven't taken it down yet well I only I only sort of revealed it a couple months ago in this speech I gave it was the one where I was with Peter and James Lindsay and it went online but I suppose not many people know about it but that yeah they probably take it down now they're you know fucking because I actually think raise your standards you know yeah so you don't if stop feeding us this this ideological bullshit I think there's an issue too with online journalism that these people are basically fighting for their own survival there's not a lot of money in it it's hard to get clicks you have to have clickbait titles you have to attack people for things like in order to get like real engagement yeah you have to kind of give in to a certain amount of madness it's not depressing that's the same reason why the most extreme ideas on Twitter get more retweets they get rewarded don't know with likes and retweets in everything girl it's like the whole but that shouldn't I have a real old-fashioned view of the media I want to hold them to high standards mm-hm and I don't want them to be going for clickbait and saying the most extreme things I know I think you're right and I think they do it for that reason you know I just wish they wouldn't I mean to save that for some like The Huffington Post doing stuff like women are evil that was one headline women are evil and you know stuff like BuzzFeed does it as well you just think but but when it comes to sort of reputable for publications like the New York Times and you know by The Washington Post why are they pushing this I think they're struggling so you think it's just about money I think that's a viable way to generate clicks and clicks is what generates income and I think there's a real issue if you I know guys who are journalists and women as well who will tell you that their articles do not get a certain amount of engagement yeah they're in trouble you know they can't just can't rent things that everything has to be something that is engaging it has to be it has to be attractive but Facebook's algorithm does right yeah I mean one of the things that Facebook's algorithm does is it's sort of in some way encourages people to be upset about things because it shows you a lot of things that you engage with and a lot of times people tend to engage with things that they're upset by yeah so whether it's abortion or second-amendment or whatever the subject is right if you haven't engaged with that and you you you respond a lot you start and that's what they're going to show you over and over and over again and it's really more of a symptom of what human beings are attracted to a lot of times we're attractive things that upset us but that's gonna spiral further and further out of control I mean what are you logical but no but the culture war is being moated is engineered by by by all of this stuff out there and and that's the argument against Facebook right the culture war has been engineered by algorithms yeah and although I'm really torn on this actually cuz I'm so I'm so against censorship in all its you know I really am but I want I want if journalists and commentators had high standards and were just being honest first and foremost and they had integrity and they weren't just after clicks then we then half of this and half of this stuff would go away I feel some of it would go away my question is they weren't doing this 15 years ago No so what will they be doing 15 years from now well will this wear out will this dry up so that's the question is it are we gonna reach a tipping point right that's the question right because every time I think we're nearly at the tipping point they double down and it gets worse right so you know after Trump's election for instance right almost immediately you had the women's March and I didn't really know what that was about like it was it was some people are marching for feminism some people marching for environmental issues some people much it was really incoherent yes a lot of them addressed in the pink pussy hats and and giant vagina costumes instead I thought what what are you protesting here are you saying that unit and and a lot of them had banners saying not my president right so they're protesting against democracy then in that case the same thing in the UK when when we just had our general election was a big March with loads people with balancing not my Prime Minister Boris Johnson not work well he is your Prime Minister because we had a democratic Monday and that's how this works right so I think what are you prep but seriously what is the point of that protest like I think they're just showing unity is showing that they're all together in their anger about this and that in the future they're gonna be a combined force and they're gonna make sure that this doesn't happen again I think there's a better way to do it without generating so much resentment right I think I think there's a there's a more sophisticated approach which is to say that democracy is sustained on the principle of the loser's consent with any any democracy is going to have a substantial proportion of the population who did not vote for the leader of that sure and and and and you have to have that and the best ways to is through a cogent persuasion and sensible discussion and of the issues not dressing up as a vagina that's just my yeah no I agree with you in many ways but I also think for them is also fun to get together with a bunch of like-minded people and you know and then there's the the men who joined in hey girls I'm with you okay I'm bored with but the Marches after Boris Johnson's election weren't about fun they were that was an explosion of Rage I didn't see that but it is weird to me that he looks like Trump that's like your version of Trump I think he's he's not the same it's not the same he's the same wacky here and yeah and he's got that reputation of saying what he thinks and all the rest of it so that there's similarities but I don't think they're comparable Boris I don't support Boris but he's very smart and he's voting yeah he's a smart guy and he's um you know I've never voted for that his party we're ignorant to your country over here yeah I was at a platform well so he's in the Conservative Party we only pay attention to the Queen and the king really the prince and whatever prince is in trouble because he was banging chicks on fuck island Oh Prince Andrew Prince who's leaving but you paid to do that you're more interesting the family that they have no power in our country and you know I mean you you stole Harry from us then yes you got him back and you turned him woke you turned him really working then just as you walk oh my god president yeah yeah so so Megan marklars completely mr. 100% and bare mind he used to be the one I used to go sort of parties and do drugs and identity drugs actually should qualify the she made him walk um yeah he's a super woke now hmm well it's gonna move to Canada it's a good place to be woke that's why but they're also saying that he can't moved Canada because if you're a royal from England I'm supposed to have a primary residence in Canada because it's part of the Commonwealth or something yes the ideas like you can't come in there and take over because if you did he's lost his title now why are you grandma that says a lot she was pissed off oh she just said no you can't have your title you got to pay for your cottage all that money you took from the taxpayers you've got to pay for college by the way it's a big estates but they call it Frogmore cottage but it's funny to me that you guys over here more interested in in some sort of outmoded anarchic anarchic archaic institutions like the royal family and not so there isn't really an awareness of our political situation we know brexit bad brexit bad but bricks it's not bad that's all we hear you hit brick cracks it bad and but why racist right okay so bad but that can I say this because I know brick see probably bores people but the problem with the whole brexit thing is people thought it was about right at race people thought it was like you voted for the EU if you were a good person and voted against if you're a bad person correct it wasn't that no no he'll rely to you've been lied to it was a most people voted because they wanted the idea in fact the polls straight after the vote said that the number one reason why people voted bricks it is they wanted the laws to govern their country to be made within their country which strikes me as a very reasonable proposition right if you if you're a Democrat you want to be able to vote out the people in power you can't vote out those bureaucrats and Brussels you can't do it that's the principle it's not because we want to go back to some pre-war nostalgic or white country this is a complete lie and it's just experientially unsound I mean I don't meet anyone like that you know but that's the way it's been spun you know what and also by the way if you're left-wing and you're supporting the EU which is this neoliberal trading bloc that is really pro corporate ruthlessly so then I don't know how you can even call yourself left-wing to be honest so what is the anger in the streets in England it's because of the mother this goes back to what we're saying about the press so we had six months of debate on the brexit issue before people voted so people really knew what they were voting for they knew what these issues were about but the media was constantly spinning and saying if you vote leave you're a racist and if you vote to remain in the EU you're one of the good guys that was the narrative they were spending from the start and people would and you know what it did it did that thing of generating resentment did anybody step out that that's logical and objective to say hey yeah you can you can look at this at a different way but those voices got drowned out by the utter swill that was being spilt out all the time right and I'm not denying that there are some racists in the UK and that some of them might vote Italy there were probably some racists who remain whatever but there's such a minority and when you've got a media class constantly saying to you you're you all you poor working-class people you're scum you're racist you hate you know whatever then they're gonna go in that voting booth and they're gonna they're gonna say fuck you and they're gonna vote out and that's what happened and it was a big backlash against being patronized people hated it you know and it's that I you know I hate that narrative that we live in a racist country when be absent and that bricks it is used as evidence but I see it as comparable I think it's very different to the Trump election but I see it the one thing that I think is comparable is that the premise right if you've got all these sort of woke activists who say that they believe that we live in this fascist country and that they believe a fascist would vote for Trump and then when Trump wins they use that as evidence for the premise that they set up right and that's why they double down because they say well he won so therefore we were right all along with we're a country full of fascists like yeah but your premise wasn't right so that and that's how you that's how we need to break that's it that's that sort of cycle of doubling down on the the same bullshit and and and guaranteeing Trump another term by doing so by the way I'm pretty sure probably it really depends on how many people get behind Bernie right okay they're not Bernie actually gets through the DNC does not want Bernie right so there's and there's they didn't last time did they no they they don't like budget or whatever it's really fascinating I don't know what it is because I'm not that well versed because he's a socialist is it I don't I think they have a zero control over how that's part of the issue as well well you know in the UK we the comparable figure is Jeremy Corbyn he's full-on socialist left-wing but he by the way hates the EU that's the other complicated thing I think it's also corporate money who won't take anything right because but us associates principle yes right yeah and I think the resistance is the rest of them want that money it is like the word socialist over here there's a proper dirty word like yes really because you've had this history of I remember that stuff about the fear of socialized medicine he was here that sort of thing like you know we've got an NHS that works pretty well we've got a National Health Service that works so you know and you also have independent doctors too right so if you have a lot of money you could get yeah you can get your name yeah you can yeah that's right if you know if you're if you're one of the minute you know if you're poor though the difference is you can get treated you can get treated like if you if you get if you're poor here and you haven't got health insurance don't you just die if you get so there's Medicaid is that my prejudice yes yeah I mean there there are some systems that are in place but they're not good I got it did not ideal and a lot of people get saddled down with horrible medical debt if they do get injured well I think that I've got an American friend who had a very serious illness in England and he the NHS were brilliant and it was like these people didn't though this is amazing you know didn't have to pay for any of it you know it's it's I think that something really beautiful about that I love our niche and I know people criticize it and say obviously there's gonna be mistakes with such a big institution like that and there's going to be bureaucrats and all the rest of it but it's it's a really wonderful thing that anyone can get treated and they're not going to have a big bill at the end of it I really love that we're conditioned to think that anything that involves anything socialist or anything free anything that's paid for by the government where someone can't make the ultimate amount of profit right it D incentivizes them from being very good I would say right when we think about a doctor we want a doctor that is pushing really hard to be the best doctor so he can get a Ferrari in a big house because that guy's gonna kick ass that's without an American the mindset that's the capitalist mindset isn't it particularly the American mind said I know it's not just capitalism it's exceptionalism and it's like wanting to be number one I want hey who'd you get to do your knee Oh God dr. Gettleman he's the fucking best right no he does the Lakers that guy does the Patriots he's the fucking man yeah he fix his knees I go to him you know and so everybody wants to go and you recommend do you know a good shoulder doctor oh yeah dr. Goldberg he's the man he does the fucking boxers he did Floyd Mayweather like that kind of shit it's alien to me like that you know a shoulder doctor I would you know you just go to the NHS and they give you the doctor they give it I think I'm not against incentive the idea of incentives and people like striving to make their lives better and everything like I think that's absolutely fine but but like if Anthony Joshua say if Anthony Joshua needs shoulder surgery you know he's not going NHS if you if you're rich you'll go to drive it for a good reason right not be a better doctor no no no I attending shoulder specialist yeah I tell you Anthony John or his shoulders are everything right he's a puncher that's his whole thing I start punches if he blows his shoulders out he's fucked it isn't the case that the the NHS has substandard doctor it isn't the case and the reason for that is it's a vocational thing so most doctors feel obliged I feel an obligation a moral obligation to work for the NHS and they do so for many years doctors a great people life you if you go into that profession it's because you want to help people isn't it not because you want the Ferrari I think it in America that's because you want the floor okay I think they're brilliant people it's a very difficult thing to achieve yeah like to be a doctor a physician in fact it's very hard of course it's a lot of work and you deserve to be paired well absolutely but i but i but i also think it is it is a comes from a moral place it comes from a place of good and ideally the ass ideally you definitely would think that yeah right but i and i think our NHS proves that i mean doctors earn a reasonable and they're not poor right I think they can have nice nice things you know it's it's yes it's not I imagine I mean I'm speaking out of ignorance here I don't know how the NHS is portrayed over here how our health service is portrayed over here but did you see it's like this scary communist thing where oh yeah they leave I can force him some people's abdomens and shit and they don't forget to stitch people up what I'm sure that happens real human right will make mistakes there look I have friends that have experienced socialized medicine in Canada in particular and had some really bad results I can also that is one of the things that people can't you experience bad results on the privates it's 100% right and have and I know friends over here that have but our prejudice is ha I told you hmm I told you it's all socialized medicine but meanwhile I also have friends that mock us for having to pay for things when you got to go to the doctor or pay for things if you get ill or if you get injured yeah you're so stupid why do you have to pay for that that's crazy yeah well there's a great video where a man in the UK is walking around asking people in England what do you think it costs to do this in America well I think we've no idea give birth it's crazy yeah it's a lot people like Oh hundred dollars like ten thousand dollars ten thousand like people go crazy but also don't you think like if there's a cash incentive for doctors and medicine and the pharmaceutical industry that there's something really dangerous about that that's why you've got people who you know whenever an insurance claim comes in you've got these lawyers who are hired to try and undermine the claim and says I'll find some pre-existing condition from years ago so and leave you to die because the because the incentive is all about money not about humanity and that's not the real scary accusations or unnecessary surgeries right and I have been suggested to have unnecessary surgery personally right and I have avoided it and and become very healthy without the surgery you see I yeah it's because people wanna make more money out of you well I think it's also because they're if they have a hammer they want to hit a nail right you know like this is what I do you need a surgery in your neck out on us on a small on a small level I experienced that when I went to a private dentist to say what do I need done and he told me basically that my whole mouth was rotten and was dying and it would cost that it wasn't true I went to an NHS dentist I know you just got a couple of issues there we'll sort it out a bit today wait twenty quid or something and that's a real problem in America as well but this other dentist but obviously wanted to make as much money out of me as possible that's so dark you know a dark that someone would be willing to do that some guy got arrested recently because he was pulling teeth that he didn't have to pull oh come on yeah it's so fucked up so fuck that I'm gonna do that so that's the downside of the cash incentive for bad people but again that falls in the face of your narrative that people that getting a doctor to get into medicine or good people well they're not always good people they're not always good people okay I'm willing to concede that point especially but but and then maybe it's maybe there are good people they do it in a national health care system but they're not what if if they are compromised and it becomes a part you know an issue of making money yeah then they might compromise so I think I've worked out a common thread in our discussion which is that I tend to think that most people are generally good and I don't think you do am i right I think I admit that right when people are good I fly it's great when people you see that as an aberration from the norm right I don't think it's an aberration but I take into consideration the fact that some people suck right I'm willing to do that as well but I think - humanity on the whole is underrated and that we get there oh yeah for sure there's no way we'd be able to live yeah think about how often you go to the movie theater or a restaurant or a bar and you're surrounded by people and no one doesn't anything bad yeah look I live in the public eye right and I do everything like I do so many things in front of large groups of people yeah many trust the great yeah most people are great I do comedy and I'm always in front of live groups of people 99.99999 percent of people are awesome you know even my hecklers they're good people they just get a little drawn are they they're not in the UK they're annoying they're annoying here too but they're just drunk because you can't live any other way can you you can't leave it any other way but to trust humanity into trust because you trust that people are essentially good and and that's why I think ultimately these things will be subverted and end you know like the work movement like I think we have a problem in America as well with education being so fucking insanely expensive and insurance for doctors being so insanely expensive that you get these doctors in this position where they're they're they're really over the barrel okay have so much debt and so they are incentivized to try to do these unnecessary surgery okay that's a very good point yeah I mean I know absolutely nothing about your education system I should just put that out there it's so expensive right and you don't it's not that expensive in England I think not not comparable really but how much would it cost to do a degree here say for instance if you want to be a lawyer or something that's good question that's I'm sure we can google that let's say from the first year of your university study to passing the bar yeah what kind of debt Jaime are most lawyers in just college right yeah justjust Law School College Law School you want doesn't matter where does it change depending on the universe yeah so Ivy League okay let's go with Harvard let's go with the big boys so if you're an Ivy League you it helps you to get a job presumably that yeah I graduated from Harvard right he's the cream of the crop my boy okay yeah you're fucked III half a million in the hole before you even get going I in the UK we've it's standardized Oh 65 okay that's a hell of a lot $65,000 so more than most people make a year yeah you have to spend on your education while you're not making any money so yeah 65 k here just think that's stacking up one two three four five six I suppose what they're saying is that's an investment for the future because if you do this you'll get the great job and maybe but you're almost $400,000 in the hole by the time you graduate when yeah I'm making any money it's nowhere near like that in the UK it's horrible so we and we have a really good student loan system where the the interest is minimal and you don't have to pay it back until you're earning a certain amount and all that and we found I when I went to university I was the last year to get a full grant I didn't pay for anything the government paid for absolutely everything that's awesome because it was also means-tested back then because my family weren't well-off I got everything got paid for that's awesome that mean that's ideal I would love that I mean I'm for sure some people get scholarships in America as well right I would just like it if people didn't have to start their life once they're out of education already hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt yeah it's just such a burden but also what do you do if you are from a poor background how can you possibly and say that you can get scholars you can't get definitely can but you have to have very good grades okay and you know I think with a lot of people that they get out of school first of all a lot of people sign up for this debt when they're 17 18 years old they don't even know what the fuck they're doing yeah and you they're gonna come on we got a loan for you get in there go to work who the hell knows what they want to do at 17 no one knows and if you don't you get shamed you feel terrible yeah it's going straight to school I heard this recently on Harvard specifically right there's also I popped it up on the 20% of Harvard families pay nothing for their students to attend well those are probably just 20% kick ass fucking super good student sweet great a bar of 65k for your family income you get in I think it's like a scholarship for lying right or something but you have to have obviously stellar grades right yes obviously just to get into Harvard in the first place do you think it's an effective meritocracy than the US there's aspects of it that are effective but it's definitely not perfect and the the student loan issues a gigantic one I feel like if we spend so much of our tax money on so many different things that people disagree with and how much would it cost to have I mean I'm not talking about for people to don't try I mean you should definitely have there should definitely be requirements for you to get a free education right but it should be definitely much easier than it is now yeah and how is your what you call in our country the public schools in the terrible because in if you've got nothing and you go to the local well the real issue is high schools high schools and and in grade schools like if you're poor goddamnit there's some rough school country and they don't get paid much and the teachers don't give a shit and there's some good ones you know there's definitely some good ones and there's definitely some people even in some bad neighborhoods that get some good education but that's few and far between and this is the points that if you if you want from one of those backgrounds the odds are stacked against you they just so it's all very well sort of saying that anyone can succeed if they work hard but not really no not really no no not really you definitely don't get as good in advance I mean if you look at the when they show how well kids do in private school and yeah the restaurant versus public school pretty staggering differences and you know and I've see I see the argument both ways that the people that are in the private school they're there because their parents care more and they pay more attention so the kids study harder but if those same kids are in public school and they studied just as hard they would get by but yeah but they they'd be dealing with crime and violence and so they shouldn't be that the kids and the private schools aren't dealing with and you know more much more stress and more like even more stress at home and so that issues I find it astonished that people don't won't acknowledge that some people are more advantaged in certain way alright this is why I think when it comes to social advantageous or the way in which people are prioritize are privileged over other people it's mostly about money ultimately when we talk about privilege all the time we hear things about white privilege and heterosexual privilege and stuff like that actually ultimately is about cash it's about who's the richest that's for sure that's a big part of it for sure and I think that stuff is obscured by all the other the other stuff that well anybody who thinks white privilege is universal needs to go to Kentucky and see the coal miners right because there's some there's some families that live in these insane rural communities in West Virginia yes they're so poor they're so fucked and everyone around them is on pills and no one has any money and there's just crime and just poverty yeah that you can and I mean I have a friend who's from there it's like man you've never seen poverty like this so couldn't they just come up with a different phrase than white privilege because I get the point they're trying to make which is that if you have two people exactly the same backgrounds the person of color is going to face more prejudice right I guess point and that's yes that's right but the problem is not white privilege the problem is prejudice right yes examine accept prejudice don't combat why people don't experience the prejudice right and for the white people that do have this advantage that they don't experience prejudice the only reason why that exists is because of racism right the actual problem is racism is racism absolutely yeah it's not white privilege no and they and just rhetorically it's a really bad thing too because people just hear the word privilege I think I'm not privileged why they white especially poor white people act 'va stin the UK who called Monroe bergdorf and the phrase used was you can still be homeless and have white privilege oh and we're law and I just think how how is that a helpful thing to say like it even if you could break it down philosophically and sort of prove your point and just think in terms of how you come across when you say that you know that's that's not again woke yeah it's just the religion it's there they're part of the religion and we really should start with referring to it as a religion we should but then that there would be some push Church of woke okay they get tax-free status just show up at the walk Cathedral yeah and and they've got all your money to try gender people or whatever I've got their high priest yes they do they've got their you know their Saints their can and I certain people they've been all of the hallmarks yeah I just think I my only I mean I'd have described it in those terms and I have done today but but to what is that really effective way to challenge it as in is that isn't that just gonna get people's backs up isn't that going to get a little bit everything you say about it will get people's backs up but I think at least it'll make people understand that there are some fundamental patterns in human behavior that have existed from the beginning of time yeah people like structure and they like they like knowing where the rules are because life in itself is too open-ended there's too much existential angst there's too many confusing questions that can't be answered there's so much going on in life itself that if you have a very rigid ideology whether it is about a holy creator or whether it's about the fundamental aspects of society that are that are unfair yeah and need to be rallied against whether it's woke ideology or whether it's you know fill in the blank whatever other ideology I just wish I could talk to them more but they refused to talk to me this is well they don't want to be I mean you could talk to some the same way that Meghan Phelps talked to her husband online you could talk to the ones that are thinking maybe this is bullshit and some of them do think it's bullshit and I know some of them that have broken free ya know some former woke people that have woken up I but I also get a lot of messages from people saying I really like the jokes you're telling but I will never retreat them dad - yeah I can't say it but they also want to keep their job you know they don't want anybody harassing them okay there's a lot of that all right a lot of people that just want to keep this job well maybe then when I was talking about the tipping point and when does it end maybe it's when more people who are willing to be honest about their skepticism about the whole thing maybe think that's coming I think I think is even though thing people are being very rabid I think more people are going what in the fuck they are happy they say and it's the language policing that gets so annoying words are not the problem folks it's actual prejudice that's the problem cause you know I mean whatever it is whatever it is it's we've got this issue with telling other people what to do yeah I've got this issue with wanting people to comply with the standards of behavior that we are adhering to well that's what I terrifies me about it is the sheer certainty of it when you get into a conversation when in the rare occasions where someone from the work movement will will talk to me it's like they've it's never crossed their mind that they could be wrong that it's just not in their realm of existence that they would even possibly think for a second maybe I've got this a bit wrong and that to me is a horrible I don't know how you challenge that even you know but you can't just like you can't challenge someone who's a believer in the Westboro Baptist Church but really does one walk around those God hates fags find their way out and they eventually they did them too but not many Megan can't even talk to her mom really didn't they talk to her they even turned on the leader didn't they turned on Fred he died okay did they turn on him after he died said he was a sinner as well I think they probably that's probably why they think he died fucking nuts but he was truly pure he would have kept him alive and he was probably thinking about homos you know who knows right okay okay at least they're consistent I mean they they are hateful hateful losers they are hate pretty consistent you know they they they don't twist that they are literally interpreting the Bible as it said like in a really scary way yeah very scary way and the fact that it justifies some pretty horrific actions I mean q-max your soldier if your son was a soldier and your son got shot down yeah and you're at the funeral and these guys are standing in front of the building where you're having the service and they're saying the reason why your son died is because there's a bunch of people out there that are in love with other men yeah having sex with men and so this is the reason why they're gonna hold up these giant placards it's horrible it's fucking crazy that's one of the that's one of the examples that really gets me that challenges me insofar as my free speech yeah its position because I just I thought there's something it's so appalling and upsetting when you see that sort of thing but then do I can't I can't say that I want to live in a society where people aren't allowed to protest right it's you can see it's like everything else in human nature it's messy and those work people need to understand that messy - yeah life is messy you can't you can't get 100% compliance from people and if you want that you're a bully yeah you know you're being mean you can't they're not gonna do it and I'm not right you're not right especially you're definitely not right if you're not willing to debate people on this idea so you don't even know if you're right that's why Obama was saying was anybody who said that you know people aren't perfect any time to be perfect yes it was brilliant that's it and then straight after he said it there was an article in The New York Times that said basically what a Boomer thing to say that was what the responses are what a boot lady's a boot like wow that's well serious that's not a serious response to quite a nuanced point is it no I think every generation thinks they're gonna be the ones to change the world yeah you know I mean that that's an issue as well I mean every generation yet comes along thinks that they have the answers that their parents didn't have I see signs though that the younger generation said what generation Zed or Z you'd say like are reacting against the millennial generation and there's there's there is that's probably where the hope lies isn't yes basically because actually the Millennials are getting old now and and those ideas are getting a bit out out of the Millennials are gonna have to pay their bills right the bills are coming yeah and when the bills are coming like fuck yeah I gotta earn some yeah and then they realize other people aren't working as hard and like hey what socialism is great but I'd like you to work Mike yeah no they'll be destroyed by the realities of a capitalist society yeah I mean ultimately the realities of life are show me a young man who is not a liberal and I'll show you a man with no heart right show me an old man who's not conservative and I'll show you a man with no brain yeah or Bernie Sanders you just get stuck to his guns a lot of people develop bills and Andrea and they see that there's a lot of people that don't want to work hard and there's they make excuses for things when the reality is their own behavior that's been holding them back and there's there's so many realities that are uncomfortable that we have to address as we get older in life and we realize how many people have fallen into these classical pitfalls and maybe our parents that told us about but we thought we knew better when you talk about liberal you mean left-wing here that's what the word is yeah oh yeah when we use it we don't mean that was a liberal mean over there it means sort of like the the tradition of liberalism is that is a belief in freedom ultimately it's a belief in the freedom of the press freedom of speech individual autonomy yeah it's those kinds of principles which aren't necessarily left and right in that in that in our so I actually think the liberal standpoint is the solution to everything and I mean that in the classical liberal tradition it's okay so then we give an example so if you for it take the trans issue right with it which I know is something that just by talking about is a bit it is a bit of a risky thing although I think the fact that we're not having discussions and debates about that is part of the problem but if you take the liberal position on that what you say is anyone has the right to identify however they want call themselves whatever they want have surgery on their own body do whatever they want to do mmm-hmm but then other people have the right to choose the language that they use in in terms of addressing them everyone has their own individual rights and that's the liberal position you that strikes me as the sensible way to do it you know and yeah I think that's the sensible way to do it I think we should be nice right actually I don't think you could legislate that right you can't legislate nice behavior um I think if someone doesn't want to call a trans woman a woman yeah yeah I don't think you should have to go to jail that's what I mean yeah because because that would be in a liberal position yes the work movement is a fundamental liberal movement because it believes in compelled speech yes it believes in not just compelling forms of speech but also censoring you and saying what you can absolutely what you cannot kind of demanding compliance so I'm just sick of them call themselves liberals yeah well you know it's me you guys definitely have a different definition of liberal yeah yeah liberal in America is essentially mostly left-wing like when we hear people call themselves a classical liberal liberal over here or like oh you're just like a sneaky Republican okay that's not what it means well yeah we are I think I think we need to restore the idea of liberalism is in what it actually means yeah Arlie are classical liberals well maybe Jordan Jordan Peterson a classical liberal but he's not American no he's from Toronto the everyone says he's conservative and they they okay he's not no I mean he is in certain things but he's just a believer in responsibility and hard work yes he's a sweetheart of a guy yeah he really is he's very open-minded and very intelligent and you know and I don't disagree I don't agree with him rather on everything but I I definitely respect him yeah I'm definitely and he's onto something with with the liberal okay if you come from a liberal background as well you'll be willing to be challenged and you were willing to listen to other people and I think he is well you know you you've over your country that Kathy Newman interview be Oh huge yeah so what you're trying to say is like he's like I'll tell you what I'm saying that's think I'm trying to put words my mouth you're trying to distort my position I think ninety-eight percent of all the arguments that go on on Twitter would disappear overnight if people just actually faithfully represented what their opponents were saying well if they saw each other in person well that have faithfully represented that's a big part although the Kathy Newman thing shows that even that doesn't necessarily help I mean she did help eventually she was usually ignoring what he actually said and substituting it for something so she wasn't even talking to Jordan Peterson she was talking to a figment of her imagination called Jordan Peterson that's not the same thing yes you're dead right that's not you're right you're dead right that's exactly it is and I think she severely underestimated who he is as a human being I also think she hadn't read the book no how could she she's so busy yeah she's a busy she's a busy woman she's very talented actually I think you know I think that was just a it was a mistake that's yes I think that's the best way to describe it I messed up and she's been tortured online since then which I would I think he's horrible as well you know it is yeah but it's easy you know it's easy it's easy for people to pick on her but but it's good now that we've got that lesson because that came like a meme then didn't you know that so what you're saying is and that's a really good example of this Mis characterization stuff which is just so the norm now yeah and now that we've got that example it's a it's a way to point you know I used to teach critical thinking in school at an a-level which is sort of like sixteen seventeen year old kids and one of the first things I'd teach them is about firstly ad hominem attacks if you throw an insult you've lost the argument this is a class that's it it's over you've lost it if you don't faithfully represent what the other person saying you've lost the argument okay that's called a straw man yes we've got all these things and yet not just people on Twitter but but people in the mainstream media and and politicians are failing on these basic principles of critical thinking and argumentation so if we can just restore it back in the educational system so people understand once you throw the insult you've lost it I couldn't agree more but again this is not in compliance with woke ideology it's not yet that's what for straight you'd have to adjust work ideology right and I don't think they're willing to do that because I think they think that they're right well yes they do yeah yeah they have a religion and you know if you think that you shouldn't take the Lord's name in vain and someone's doing that that person is a sinner but if you go if you can go back to the universities and you can reinstate critical thinking there that would be the solution I think that good luck because you got a lot of world people teaching I know I know I'm trying to come up with the solution here I really am the solution is generation Z yeah it is that's a solution hope lies with the children yeah and what I'm getting all these books like feminist baby what that shit's gonna work I think that feminist baby stuff is hilarious and that's also Millennials having kids right they're not having kids yet and I think they're probably not I think the younger people are laugh at that I think they should yeah yeah I hope they laugh at it I haven't read feminist baby action I don't think anybody has how about that no just buy it they just buy it and hope the fucking kid comes out good listen man it's been a pleasure having you on I really appreciate it yeah in the grout everybody this there is a book it's called woke a guide to social justice by - Tonia McGrath you can get it it's hilarious my friend Bridget fetes II was the first person to tell me about it she's great she's great yeah and she's another person who has become hilarious and and famous on Twitter just from being logical and funny but being honest and being herself you know it's but today it's so liberating when you just realize I can say what I want yeah it's a wonderful thing can and many many many people gravitate towards it yeah that's the beautiful thing yeah you know I don't think it's a war so I'm wouldn't say we're winning a battle but I think there's a lot of people that get it I think there's every reason to be optimistic there's a lot of fucking people out there man that's part of the problem and a lot of them have a voice yeah yeah the noise I think will win the noise thank you brother appreciate you being here man let's do it again that'd be great thanks [Music]
