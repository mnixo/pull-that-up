hello freak bitches there's the guy who was the doctor behind that movie concussion he was recently talking about OJ Simpson because OJ Simpson was released and he's like there's a hundred percent chance that guy has CTE and they've even said that OJ if the trial was today his doctor said that he would introduce CTE as a defensive defense which is crazy because then you have to say he's guilty I didn't do it you know until he wrote a book how I did it yeah if I did it that was like yeah I know but if isn't I did it I watched the the Cuba Gooding show last night the FX show I'd never seen oh you'd never seen it's great it was a great great yeah great show you know it's weird watch managed to revisit everything the night when the OJ got out it's like just go away yeah just goes away can't buy it don't say anything play golf and keep your mouth shut he's not going to and you can't he's he's addicted to love yeah you know he's addicted to people liking him and there's gonna always if he goes to Florida there's plenty of fucking stupid people don't take him right now yeah easy or he's going back to jail he's gonna do something stupid and violate his parole do you think you'll do that though at 7 years old or whatever he is well if he does anything other than shut up he's either gonna die or go back to jail you know I mean like there's no there's no positive that's gonna come out of him making public appearances you know writing a book going on a talk show circuit like no like you're 70 years old live out the last 10 15 20 years whatever you got was just livid isn't there's money somewhere right because Florida they couldn't take his money like that's why she moved there so yeah he's got money somewhere just just quietly fade away you know let people people might recognize you when you go down to play bingo at the home you just wave thanks mom you know but but yeah and there's no I don't think there's any way there's no positive public appearance know that Oh Jay could make it was it was really really an hence and at during that time two of his friends died within two weeks of each other of heart attacks at age 52 and 59 and Nikita Kamiya of who's 52 years old and he's running he had resigned from running the Russian anti-doping agency so so technically the Russian anti-doping agency shouldn't be working with Gregory's lab the wada the world anti-doping agency lab those should be two independent things but these two were working together because there was never any anti-doping Russia was the anti anti-doping system posing as anti-doping so Nikita is still in Russia he's been forced to resign and Gregory and him are still talking via via Skype and Nikita tells Gregory that he's gonna go but he's writing a book and that he's been in contact with David Walsh and David Walsh's the Sunday Times journalist that chased Armstrong for ten years he's probably one of the most renowned famous sports journalists in the world that Stephen Frears filmed the programs based on David Walsh and send Nikita had reached out to David Walsh and him and David Walsh were making a plan to meet and Nikita had told Gregory that you know he was gonna meet what David Walsh Gregory was like this is you can't do this you're still in Russia Nikita you're still in Russia what are you doing and a day later Nikita dies of a heart attack this was a guy who was healthy had never had a heart problem in his life was a was a lifelong athlete never he was 52 52 and apparently he died over about 3 and a half hours while Nikita's wife was on the phone - Gregory crying this is uh really have any suspicion of how they did it you know correct griego's that they just you just die have a heart attack they poison you or whatever they you know I don't I don't know how they do it but you know Russia isn't like Isis they don't do something and then take responsibility you know there's been so many stories like in BuzzFeed last year that of the 14 deaths in London all tied to you know various adversary of Russia there's been multiple books written on it even you know which was not widely reported the Russian agent the co offered apparently the Trump dossier with the mi6 the former mi6 agent he was found dead in the back of a Lexus about five months ago outside of Moscow so you know clearly they they play by a different set of rules if you look at how men and women evolved to get partners women just have to look hot you have to look like you're fertile and young and have good genes which is what we consider beauty these what feminists say are arbitrary standards of beauty aren't anything like that there vary across cultures men like women with this hourglass figure and who have long shiny hair and who are not 72mm because if you had sex with the 72 year old your genes died out yeah this the feminist thing about arbitrary standards of beauty as a person who is deeply entrenched in science like that's got to be frustrating right because you're looking at something that's not accurate it's it's a you're pushing a narrative that's just not accurate there's this very takeaway culture takeaway you know all the all your personal feelings about human beings and you look at the mammal the human mammal and it's it's very clear why the certain males are gravitating towards certain females and contrary or conversely why certain females are gravitating toward certain males it's biological right and this it's so unhelpful it's really awful this idea that people should like you for what's and on the inside you know we don't see the people if you look at porn it's not the woman who buys a homeless man a sandwich you know who's in the porn it's the woman with those features that are just cross culturally appreciated by men what's also - we're talking only about sexual right because people do like you for who you are on the inside like Melissa McCarthy is a perfect example she's as vibrant hilarious woman and no one's no one's holding her up as the standard of beauty or sexual attractiveness you know your your look her is this fun person and that's why millions of people go see her in movies and her TV shows us giant hit I mean it's literally what's on the inside and how she carries herself right and she is very vibrant and if you look at that cross-cultural research David buss who is an evolutionary psychologist did the big big cross-cultural study and kindness was what both men and women wanted I think that was the top the top of each list but if you prioritize well okay well what do I what are my must-haves in a partner a guy is not going to want a very old unattractive woman as his partner if he can do better and a woman is not going to want to have the guy who is sleeping in grandma's basement playing Atari Atari or whatever I'm a girl so I don't know anything about football or video games you know I'm sure when you're you were a sex addict and you're in this hedonistic you know whirlwind experience you're still you're taking in all this data and you're taking us in the hollow feeling that you had that you didn't like it is what propelled you to your new stage of consciousness once you emerge from it yeah that's right every so often like because it's like pleasure Laden an orgy I mean that's the point of it I mean this flesh everywhere it's this bit there brilliant I was know in hold on a minute this isn't working this is a thing what would really really work you know like sometimes the the great gift of promiscuity is you get to experience all the intimacy with all of these strangers and it seemed exciting and the type of sexuality that I've always had is more about worship than any kind of domination I adore I adore you know so it's not about like I want to control you so like you know all these wonderful experiences and encounters but within it this kind of ongoing seem of loneliness and ignore ball and also this is the thing when you get the things your culture tells you you should be doing and you experience them now you know now you know you can stop chasing the carrot because you've had a bite out of it and it's like minute bullshit like you know not and it's a hard one to learn because anything that's got an orgasm at the end of it you know there's a degree of pleasure to be had but it takes it takes a while to recognize on what this it would be emotional cost on me the spiritual cost on other people the fact that is preventing me from becoming a father from becoming a husband from settling from becoming root it from becoming actually whole from becoming a man from becoming connected it takes awhile to spot that I think a lot of people don't get the opportunity to break out that pattern I would never have spotted it had a not first been a heroin addict and got holden minute you're doing that thing again same with Fame and celebrity well toxic well toxic exciting and brilliant and loads of lovely people in there and I still like you know I might make another film I don't know what happened but like it's because I'd had the template and the experiences of our this is addiction you're expecting this thing to make you feel better now what's happening is I am as a baseline disabused of the idea that the material world will give me anything that it will ever fulfill me that I am responsible for my own connection and that my role here is to serve other people and help them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
