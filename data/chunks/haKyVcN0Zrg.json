hello freak bitches like one of the things that is driving me crazy about a lot of this tweeting and craziness like I was in New York City for the fights and how me and my friend cam Haynes who went to the gym and young Jamie was there too but you weren't with us when we were stuck in the in the swarm of humans with just me and cam we've got to the gym no problem but on our way back the protest had marched through the area that we walked through and all of a sudden we couldn't go anywhere it was just jammed with people so you're literally shoulder-to-shoulder with people like just everybody's touching everybody there's just you had to deal with it there was nothing to do it which is one of the reasons why a fanny pack is so important folks cuz you keep your money in your front ok nobody's pickpocket everything zipped up my shirt goes over that sense is gonna know to get there it's gonna take some work cuz pickpockets do go to those things you know be aware if you're one of those super lefties that likes to go in fast right so while we're walking this one guy with this perfectly manicured beard I'll never forget he had a really nice like wool jacket on he was he was obviously like a wealthy liberal character and he's screaming out I mean screaming in my fucking ear he's right here he's reaching me he's touching me the shoulders Jill Donald Trump KKK racist sexist anti-gay he wouldn't stop he wouldn't stop partying part of me want to go hey man could you just like if you want to go in the protest the protest is in the street like you're on the sidewalk this isn't the protest this is a Lancer this is some non-committal shit you're doing if you want to be out in you'll be all in but he's like he's doing drive-bys he's like a walk by screaming protest but does it really do anything he saw a black guy in the distance I swear to gosh Tarts go oh shut up s'matter he's just trying to get everybody to join him when my friend Michael Shermer likes to call virtue signaling that sort of does he's peacocking his virtue and just trying just trying to get it away John Rowland oh there was a woman with a sign that said rape Melania jeesus yeah and apparently that it's about writing that thing out crazy here we go it's a hashtag on Twitter now look as a as a Brit observing what's been happening in America as an outsider I'm enormous ly encouraged by the legalization of cannabis movement that is that is taking place here and and and what it and what it all means sure I like to smoke a joint but this is not about getting high it's not about recreation what this is about is recognizing the sovereignty of adults to make decisions over their own bodies their own health and their own consciousness while doing no harm to others that's what it's about and that's a really fucking important issue that is for me that is the most important issue because if we live in a society that is not prepared to recognize adult sovereignty over one's own body and one's own consciousness then that cannot be a free society in any meaningful way and so I applaud the people of America in those states who have voted for full legalization that's a brilliant thing to do and that's going to have an impact around the world because the war on drugs all the ideology and lies about cannabis are all going to be proved wrong we're gonna know that the Emperor wears no clothes that you can legalize cannabis and civilization does not fall apart as the war on drugs Lobby have been telling us for ages it's going to it's going to change everything and it's a beautiful thing because it's the American people whereas the American state America as a governmental state presence on the world stage has been the dark force behind the war on drugs so it's it's a for me a beautiful thing that is the American people state-by-state who are winding that back and saying we will not put up with this shit anymore I'm not sure I think we need to under whale language dolphin language right um there's really Jimmy if you look you might be able to dig it up there's a there's a guy I want to say that Northern Arizona University who worked on prairie dog language well have you heard about this there's no crazy research so one of the reasons we've never been able to study animal communication and I could screw this up but we'll try it is we couldn't talk back right we couldn't talk to them so what he did is he recorded a ton of prairie dog communication and then started sort of decoding what little things mean and but you know in shooter to play it back to so what he discovered is prairie dogs which you don't think of as particularly intelligent when they started decoding their language they started to realize that prairie dogs routinely say things like hey be careful of that right path over there because there's a fat guy in a purple sweater coming this way that detailed like in the beginning they really yeah they used to think animals only sort of communicated in like nouns and verbs present tense nouns and verbs right snake of the you know there are some certain calls that are monkeys monkeys right the three calls now they're starting to realize they've got adjectives they've got tenses they can think in the pit for a while they thought animals lived in a perpetual Pleasant present right like the argument was all animals are always in flow right which is the every focused everything in the now it turns out that's not the case at all they have past they have futures what we asked this question a lot running an animal sanctuary if we're caring for a dog it's not just older special needs it's come from a shelter it was on death rows probably if it's ended up with us because we work with the worst of the worst of the worst it's been very very badly abused etc etc and the question my wife and I always used to talk about was do they know do they like do they feel grateful to us do they can they remember their past enough to know that you know the present is different and we we were what was different like those kinds of questions and after you know ten twelve years of doing this work hardcore I think they really know and I think you know they live in a time scale that's a lot broader than we've given them credit for when you do see all this stuff on TV one thing that you can't deny it might not affect you and it might not affect me but there are certain people that follow the tone of the leaders of this country and when you have a guy who's the president who you know is gonna say insulting should call Jon Stewart a pussy in an in a tweet at 1:30 in the morning like that sets the tone for the country and it's gonna make some people very happy some people that love to talk shit they loved and so people on the like fuck yeah open season the way I described that I said political correctness took a missile to the dick because that's what it was like like this is the this is the guy at the top of the totem pole and we we can relax our standards now and all the things that have been annoying but people nitpicking about behaviors and insults and you know safe words and safe spaces and well that stuff's kind of gone yeah I mean yeah so it does affect the way people think and behave right there's almost nobody who won't use the word pussy and probably they do do you remember so many months ago when that just wasn't a thing that's so true you couldn't say that that's so drew it became like a constant like dinner table talk like people sit around talk at saying grab the pussy yeah and it's coming from women it's it's so true that's so true that's interesting yeah well you know I think that we go one way and we go the other and I think that people get tired too much left they want some right and I think that's why we went from Carter to Reagan that's why we went from Bush to Clinton I just think that's what we do I think it's what we've always done
