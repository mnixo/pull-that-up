the Hemi no I didn't I got dropped off in a Chevy oh my god Rajon I had one for a little while it's just a little while yeah figure like you would have to have one for quite a long time it was fun well okay I'm gonna backtrack a little bit so first commercial right thank god I hear me right I did six of these things yeah and around commercial three I was talking to my agent and I said man you know if they ask you should do another one oh shit here we got it yeah that's the worst I've ever looked in my life I felt like I was sitting in a desert like no one's ever gonna see these commercials no one's gonna know what a hammy is incorrect I could not have been more wrong yeah did they give you one of these go out and buy one well I said listen if they if they want me to do another commercial see if you can get a vehicle out of them right in my agent was like you know make it their problem he calls them up he goes hey I don't know if you know this but you're hammy guy your spokesman is driving around Los Angeles right now in a Suzuki Sidekick know and they're like what the same thing it's the lightest it's a box guy if you could put a string to it and float in the air is that that shitty looking Jeep thing yes oh wow you have one of those I did yeah red Wow I don't know why for some reason I like that thing I got it in college yeah missed algin it was cool for tailgating and shit there it is yeah that's the LL Cool J version I didn't have that one let's do G I don't know I think I saw that the video one toe cuz it's a compatible one I had you're at that hardtop damn yeah I totaled that thing in North Dakota one time hit black ice I mean a gust of wind just knocked me off the road and I was in a ditch but it was uh you know how people are motorcycles you'll see another motorcycle no way it's like a little club that you're in and jeeps do it too and I started doing that to other suzuki sidekicks and ila for a reason I'd wave Tom nine times out of ten it's like a overweight black lady and I just like what does he do I was like we're in the club man so but yeah people are gonna give me nice cars yeah but to do that with shitty cars - yeah that's what that's next level that's more fun yeah like I see you so what did they give you when they give you a hemming it was a 1500 Dodge Ram quad cab no like a lot of chrome feel comfortable Anna they loved it I loved when I first got it you know it's like it's like in the middle of the you know I did success commercial so as right around La with the windows down just blast and you know Leonard Skinner yes very school like Park it I mean they hated parking that thing in that lot because it's gigantic that's a wide and they're like really man can you just have somebody drop you off yeah Brendan jobs been showing up and is he got a raptor oh yeah realize how wide those things are until you stand in front of him like a huge fucking giant vehicle and then trying to valet that thing anywhere in Los Angeles you know that's a lot of tiny little Mexican dudes are like really man well the worst is if you try to valet a stick shift oh I tried to give a valet my keys to my Bronco and he didn't know what to do okay you don't know how to drive a stick shift he goes no I go what the fuck are you doing here man how can you have this job yeah yeah that should be a part of the resume I can't drive all cars it's crazy yeah I don't think most people know how to you know Indy went under 30 could drive a stick I don't think so no if there's going it's going gone yeah Porsche doesn't make him anymore the only American muscle cars are one of the last holdouts like Corvette and Camaro I haven't driven a stick in a long time Mustangs you have no you won't try sure actually the last time I did I was in Costa Rica row and I rented a rented a car and I'm like assume all of cars now or when you rent them or automatics you know you get another country it's it's whatever and so I'm pulling out of the lot and it's like oh shit it's been a minute I got this yeah when you're in Italy they all drive stick shifts even like minivans yeah it's weird yeah everything's a stick shift over there I'm not sure why I don't know what's the advantages and disadvantages I mean what do you prefer well if I was in where I was in Italy it was in Ravello which is very small little roads it's very tiny and it's like crazy congestion because of tourism yeah and the guy was always on the clutch back and forth back before those like yeah this is gotta be annoying as fuck you get an automatic and that's like la right if you're in if you're commuting to LA bumper-to-bumper every day you're gonna want an automatic exact that's what happens right I think you're right yeah yeah it's just more comfortable let the car do the work but if you're on a mountain road like the Angels Crest Highway and yeah there's something cool about being in command of the vehicle and yes you're killing it when it's manly yeah it is and if you got a dick in your hand yeah and if it's a woman I gotta go whoo don't get too close to this one yeah yes driving stick shifts like well she's a rebel I'd be great in bed though maybe yeah for a little while and then she gets mad at you for an email for 12 years ago I didn't even know you that yeah what the fuck yeah - right where's that phone come from that's fun flip phone Sookie sidekick we were looking at that thing from CES that Jamie pulled up what does that goofy thing called these are good right our league I don't feel like I'm drinking a non-alcoholic it tastes like a regular beer planet computers Cosmo communicator which look at the four that is that is wasted not like someone was doing coke and they decided it's that I have a spaceship but it does oh my copy that looks like he needs to have a or a spaceship it looks like one of those metal wallets that you get to keep your credit card yeah but that shit's preposterous sure he's not even your fingers because you know but would you who makes that fat fuckin hands are not gonna fit on that thing yeah do that I mean at this point we're so used to doing this why go back and go back to that now whoever goes sideways in your iPhone yeah take a picture I will never typing no way I thought that was the move I'm like all once we go sideways that's gonna be the shit have you tried on an iPad uh I have not it's not bad yeah sideways all right yeah like when you have to type on the full screen all the full yeah we're all fans not bad yeah not perfect but it's way better than just your thumbs on an iPhone yeah that sense I suppose if you can type I used to think I would never get used to that just that you know the the the screen without feeling it look at that little front screen like you got a bunch of shit that comes in on it look at that Oh like apps and stuff I guess boy that's you know no one's buying that son oh my god here's the thing there are so many options now if you don't like Apple and you're committed to like an Android phone there's so many options yeah why would you buy that thing what I don't even know what company is that hmm exactly that's also part of the problem right that would be going like where do you bring that thing to get it fixed okay yeah the screen cracks you bring it to the mall what is it yeah a Cosmo communicator bro I'm gonna just go to the future and fix this thing yeah we can't do this in 10 minutes nothing's a mess I mean I got a cracked screen now and you know it's not even that bad but I've seen people walk around with like damn spider web on them yeah I'm ridiculous when are you gonna go get it fixed what's the point sighs gasps was falling off this is an indication of you you need to get your shit together yeah that's true yeah if your phone looks like a like a haunted house yeah that's a good one yeah let's go into like you know see if this girl's gonna be crazy all right how cracked is her security that's a good point give me your phone like a girl who can deal with a little crack that's probably sorry your hair it's okay she's cool just a little crack of the window in a corner no big deal she's gonna fuck she's easygoing yeah she doesn't even need to wear makeup bro she's I have to do like this get the light just right cuz it's like a damn it's a full adder wiggity cuz that part of the glass won't work yeah what about the other way they're going with the flex phone because oh no this is a good one that broke but this is another one that came out at CES - mmm that they recalled Samsung recalled the ones I suppose they recall all of them huh yeah they done release date now they're document who knows when they're gonna come out they break in like crazy apparently flex phone but then is it flexible it bends yeah well how does that one work all I'm seeing is like yeah the Samsung one had like a little teeny phone line and yes it already looks like a little flash aquarium that you put sea-monkeys in it does right looks like one ones it's like a pillar and a shitty hotel for hours yeah someone needs to clean the tank they have a Huawei has a flex phone that looks way better than the Samsung one it looks thinner and it looks like they just nailed the design better and on the side of it what's this yeah it's a different no Rowell flex PI beats Samsung and Huawei to mark it none of those out that's what this one was it folding does it fold in half yeah yeah they're making these things where you can flex them and bend them like a thousand times oh how weird yeah that's weird how am I supposed to how fat that thing is that's like carrying a VHS tape in your pocket mm-hmm right I mean imagine the advantages and disadvantages of watching porn on that thing oh there's advantages yeah just like oh I see your ass and then you got to turn your phone upside down that's pretty wild yeah how it works that is Nate yeah well I don't hoping it works so that the Version three or four in a couple of years is way better than these broken ones yeah well for sure you're gonna see people at concerts holding up well it looks like 12-inch iPads that's gonna be these goddamn things in the future I've seen that before now does anyway how would you do this or else yeah they're everywhere I mean yeah you're right yeah I hate it especially like a comedy show looks like the the Falls bad at night yeah iPad I have a Tesla in the Tesla has this huge screen right it's enormous yeah yeah and you get so used to it yeah so I go from that to another car with a little tiny navigation screen like that is bullshit yeah it's funny how you get used to things like I really have a Thomas guide when I first did you have one yeah and you came in La God you have to pull over every five feet bill burr had one of those as recently as 2011 Wow to my house to my house and his fucking Prius he still has a Prius that asshole probably got a billion dollars gonna fucking Prius he pulls into my driveway and I see the Thomas guide this backseat it's like yeah those fucking that navigation shit if that goes down I can't figure your way around town yeah you lost up in the hills no connection Thomas guy works every time I knew how to do it man like a back of the day Oh II ten I know how to do that yeah that's why I need to go that was always dangerous fuck up and also in your community chickens sounds great yeah is Sun Valley sketch I never been to Sun Valley I think it is yeah I've been there once like I think I got lost I was like this is this is not so when you got rid of your Hemi did you say hey this is from the Hemi guy like this should be worth some money yeah well if I thought it kids like auction at all yeah yeah eBay like I took pictures with it and everything it didn't work yeah it was like there's what I think it was when gas was at its highest price and people like now I think we're moving on to other things so fucking high now yeah five bucks a gallon again but I had it for about two years why'd you move it well I was married at the time and that thing was hard when I would leave and she'd had that car it was just hard to back into the the garage or anyway has a small - door - a two-car garage and it was hard to get that thing in there and so she she she convinced me that we didn't need it so that we got a we at least Alexis our rx350 for a while does it dope I like them I like when you drive like a backup camera in those things that's very nice yeah but you drive a truck and then you get into a little car like that like oh yeah agile like a dancer yeah what was your first car my first car was in 1973 Chevelle Chevelle SS it was a shitbox I drove it from the guys house to my house and then it died never it never worked again I think I drove to my girlfriend's house and then I drove back to my house it and then it died yeah and I called the guy up buy him a fucking card okay yeah he came and gave it gave me the money back and took his car he said what happened to my car I'm like it died just doesn't work Wow and so you had like a day I had it for a day and then my horrible yeah then I had a 1968 4-4-2 that I wrapped around a telephone pole shit yeah whoops hydroplaned yeah yeah if you didn't know how to drive back then and you had like kind of balding tires yeah and you hit some water yeah cars would just go sideways mm-hmm yeah what is this floating in the air yeah it's great it's a crazy thing you can't do anything about nothing about it they always tell you to turn into it like nothing's happened I was just going sideways I was like I can't believe this shit I just got this car I had that one for a few months and then bang fuck that one up just hydroplaning just high-five yourself Naz with a couple of guys from school you might get hurt no we're all right yeah but it fucked the car up I was in a Fiera remember Fiero oh yeah my sister had one oh it's like a little cake Ferrari so small these who do Ferrari kits for those yes is it turned into a fake Testarossa yeah put a car bra in there yeah those were interesting my friend Joe had one of those - those were cool little cars oh yeah all right back in the day it was like either in my home town it was like this yeah take one great that is adorable those cars are so gross when people do that you and it's obvious well it's like what do you no one wants that once you get is that one that can't not is that really a great job that's crazy that one actually looks good yeah what's the trick some really dumb girls with that Miami really dumb one yeah like if that's the like if you were only looking for really dumb yeah yeah that's your car dumb gold diggers those loafers yeah it looks like glass lubbers yeah it's probably plastic rear window oh my god they make some cars with plastic windows just save weight okay relax relax with that yeah we uh my buddy and I he had one of those we hydroplaned mm-hmm spun around a couple times totaled it hit another car that was parked at a body shop and they had just finished it no he's like cool I guess I'm doing two cars totally by slamming into a car that was just finished in a body shop yeah it was serendipitous uber is that guy's friend yeah get on yeah on the uber yeah I love over I wonder how much that's preventing drunk driver I just had this conversation yeah I think what you know Mothers Against Drunk Driving mad you know maybe even the government should like kick in you know these guys are saving lives yeah for sure yeah because if you're not doing that then you're drinking and driving most likely most likely so it gives you a real easy option yeah yeah it's so quick it's so convenient you don't have to pull cash out it's it's great it's kind of a weird organization of both of them it's like they're trying to figure out if their employees rather their contractors yeah and then there's like this fact that you're just getting into someone's car you don't know them yeah yeah I mean you assume if you get a limo but there's a background check right if you get a cab you live in on the edge if you never know Robert DeNiro how do you look at me that's what you'd like but you get like New York City cabdrivers need to get characters you get either like angry white dudes or like ya guys who come from other countries I could tell you cool stories yeah you get like characters yeah yeah here it smells yeah crazy smells lots of weird music possibly a voodoo doll but now you know what you get when you get in a New York City cab driver you get advertisements and yet screens like they have little laptops facing ya and they play these these credit card machine back there and they play these these videos about things about restaurants and this and that shows its own network at this point yeah like just the cab network it is kind of right it must be yeah a shame that Robbie has their own little loop that they plug Jimmy Fallon and I mean I've seen him down there many times yeah doing stuff everything they see the HBO show taxicab confessions yeah yeah that was crazy I enjoyed that I was like who the fuck is signing this release what are you giving these people like I just want to be on TV and I would say the worst stuff like if you're fucked up on coke and you get into a cab and you start just talking shit about all the crazy sexual stuff that you like and then and then afterwards they're like hey you're gonna be on HBO you're like fuck yeah I am inside then you wake up in the morning this waiver at the right time yeah that's gold that's a good move how does that work how old they get if you're hammered uh yeah that's gotta be some loophole like I was wondering about that um the catch a predator show yeah why the fuck would they sign of it they'd have to sign a release do they yes or cops they have to sign a release yeah you have to sign a release so yeah and then there's like the is it entrapment even you know there was that whole thing - well that shows definitely entrapment yeah but it's entrapment I support yeah totally I support entrapment if it's like yeah fucking 60% and they like yeah I do okay get in the cage shit that's right yeah this certain entrapment yep all for nothing you in the fucking anybody under 18 right or sorry yeah how do they get away with that how do they get show in their face maybe because it they were proven guilty you waived your rights but just by being guilty you have no rights when you're a felon right thank you understand when you have no rights is that right well you have rights Bernie Sanders wants you to be able to vote even if you're a terrorist have you seen that it's like anybody in jail for anything yeah like you should still be able to vote okay okay Oh a lot of people in jail that's true what if they count as residents of the state like what if you have like a maximum-security prison somewhere right and these prisoners have everything to like they have all day right now they're not anything to do and they register to vote while they're in there if you have a few hundred thousand prisoners yeah you literally can shift an election one way or the other that's true all you have to do is get into that prison and go hey guys here's a deal I'm for shortening your fucking sentences okay yeah I'm forgetting you better lawyers people would start campaigning in prisons that's true if that's legit man yeah like these laws bullshit and you can bribe them real easy with a little ketchup cigarette bring in cigarettes were trucking yeah of cigarettes how'd you win this election Marlboro Reds what's that guy's name Buddha GG judge what's his name yeah how's his name Tulsi gabbard's my girl I'm voting for her I decided I liked her a matter in person I don't know I give up I give up and I pay attention anything else Tulsi Gabbard but if you could go into a prison like what is it what's a bit what's a giant prison population what's got big his fingers one I don't know we think the biggest one is the biggest one I don't know would it be in New York California there was no isn't there a giant one Colorado the Joey they take the serial kills they stuff them on the ground what is lada what's the biggest one uh 2004 he looks at ok do you say 50,000 prisoners i I don't know much about that that's probably a lot of people think about it God spread a ball Reena right yes that's all that's true okay no okay fifty there's 60,000 the biggest one the biggest yeah what's the smile it's well it's probably some Odin rinky-dinky yes but a bit you know yeah I'm gonna say a little lighter I'm gonna say 30,000 don't say 30,000 it's the biggest will you put money on this I'll put a dollar on this I don't get a fuck bro I'll bet you a Heineken double zero shit we got you rich for my blood what we got Jamie's confused I have to be very specific about what I look up to find this answer so do you want largest maximum security sure yeah killers not people who smoke weed known as Alcatraz of the South the Louisiana State Penitentiary we go has an inmate population of 5,000 okay let's go with thieves let's go with a medium-security maximum is like violent times right I guess prison yeah the biggest prison I looking at largest prison that one thing that popped up before we are 5,000 as looks very curly ex in Florence Supermax prison there's one old supermax prison that's when I think you're talking about okay even higher about I have way less people see if it says oh that's even higher criminal level yeah that was like where they put the ice 23 hours a day done single cell confinement 5000 is a lot of people confinement is so weird cause like we're just we're killing you but we're just killing you with nature we're gonna kill you with old age and shitty nutrition mm-hmm just gonna keep you in a box kill with your own brain and no weird yeah it's like it might be more cruel to put someone into a small cage for 23 hours a day than it is to just kill them I think so yeah if you just kill you it's over with it's suffering yeah percent yeah 100% like that was my take on Chelsea Manning who's now free yeah like they tortured her they tortured they did yes was naked in a cage by herself for years I think it was like the whole that she was in solitary I'm gonna have to find this out once Jamie's done with this service I'm like looking around there's the one in California's male-only where Manson is it's got 3,500 there's one in Illinois medium security it's got a thousand okay so wait we're way off yeah yeah by a factory or so pesimistic going low and I was off I don't know if it's just his countenance ooh there's private ones I don't know if I can get the numbers on private and those dirty bastards stuff I mean on top of each other it makes sense if there were 30,000 inmates in one place I mean it would be hard to contain that and control that yeah what's the largest private prison see if that's yes but the Chelsea Manning thing she was in solitary confinement when she was still a dude does that count like as her being like I said he say that you say Bradley or do you see Chelsea when she hadn't changed yet I have I'd like to ask do you still say Bruce Jenner won the Olympics or do you say Caitlyn well Bruce won the Olympics no no Caitlyn what does it say he's Caitlyn now you can't get it now you know if you dead named him you'll get kicked off of Twitter dead named him do you know that dead naming and now I never know so say if you'd become Johanna reap yeah as you decided at this stage of the game yeah I'm wearing Prius yeah that's time to get my legs waxed the Reeves County Detention complex and pesos Texas has a combined capacity of 3763 prisoners and it's three sub complexes Wow so that's probably about as big as it gets yeah does that far and you still can't get anything over 5,000 yeah so it's in the thirties the 3300 3500 what about the world so if you you change your name of Johnny preap and I started saying hey Jon REEP what's it like wearing dresses pretend you're a girl right that's dead naming you a dead name you cuz I called you John because I miss Johan right right well but but Bruce Bruce is the one who won the Olympic yeah but that's his dead name well that's what he was doing asshole John you're so insensitive can't believe this I hate finally this day and age I'm gonna make you subscribe to this woman off with a lot of passion oh no you shit together shit you need to get up my time bro that's the way behind I just kidding about melissa mohon when she's doing yeah I don't need that it was a good name though at the throw room oh yeah Alyssa Milano's mmm what so because she has she's active on the Twittersphere I believe so yeah she's very political yeah she's always argument people I think that's one of them people you know they booted John woods you know John woods the actor they booted him off the Twitter with him he did some naughty I don't think he did anything that big a deal would it wait first of all refresh my memory James wig I'm sorry people probably mad if we dip right no this what New York City's Rikers Island has a population of 11,000 but I don't know if they're all prisoners or not well I mean like this vacation workers that live on me yeah yeah do they really says it'll happen it's a fifteen thousand prisoners verse fifteen thousand prisoners yeah now we're in the neighborhood is one in Turkey that's got 10900 M Wow okay yeah I think that's a lot of metal a theater like if you down an arena like fifteen thousand people's like Madison Square Garden that's a lot of fucking terminals so the the Chelsea Manning thing like now she's free but then she got locked up again for contempt of court but I think when she was locked up in solitary confinement they took away her clothes they wouldn't let her have clothes because they thought she was suicidal really mm-hmm I think that's just an excuse to so when they okay so when the key shade was a male yes Bradley not dead they don't do it what so when chelsea won the olympics yeah was that was was she gonna do that was was he in a male prison that's a good question and then as a female does he go to a female prison that's a good question okay I don't know maybe that's why they put her in solitary all right right protective from dudes I mean that's kind of a loophole that lets say if I know I'm going to prison and I got like a year before I get sentenced I might just go to get that sex judge right so I'm with females right I don't know maybe yeah or just a sex change anymore you just have to identify oh okay thank you oh good do you see that male who identifies as a female just broke all these World Records and weightlifting just came out wonderful that's congratulations everybody you broke everything fucking so progressive that we broke everything you have men that are winning winning Women's World Records in fucking weightlifting which is like the dumbest shit for men and women to compete against there's ever one thing what even though I like the tennis argument it's like well you know Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs yeah but Bobby Riggs was 55 she was 29 and they say that he threw the match cuz he bet against himself alright he was a big gambler that was what I heard yeah yeah I would say that too if I lost yeah yeah you know it's a it threw the match yeah well yeah basketball that stan is it's a woman the one yes it says Chelsea hmm this is uh the women whose win is not Bruce Jenner records okay let's get a look oh my god here we go seems like a gal huh that seems like a very strong man yes how much weight is that it doesn't look very a lot of weight so I thought this is about reps here yeah 300 300 315 yeah okay that's this ridiculous amount of weight for a woman lift and two together if you're gonna be a real woman a biological woman excuse me and lift that kind of weight you have to be a real outlier yeah it's very rare yeah but this is so ridiculous Wow what is this guy's quote what say one guy in the comments say congratulate and the accident performance screw anybody tries to knock a chi Vince the hard work speaks for itself hey whoever you are fuck you yeah fuck you have in your nonsense shit is happening in the first place because people tolerate this that is nuts if you if you had a daughter that trained her whole life to be a weightlifter she's really into it and this fucking guy decides he identifies as a woman and then competes as a woman in weightlifting it's just fucking stop yeah everybody just stopped you're in crazy town this is officially crazy yeah yeah out of our fucking minds how it's legal what oh is it legal it has nothing to do with being open-minded or tolerant it has something to do with logic just basic reason this is craziness this is you're enabling people to do something that's preposterous this is nothing to do with being open minds that are kind to people I'm a hundred percent for people being trans sure I'm a hundred percent for people doing whatever they want to do just don't hurt anybody and I'm cool with that same here but this is just you're in make-believe town why not pretend you're a fox and go live in the forest like you're in make-believe yeah this is make-believe you can't you can't just decide you're a woman and compete with women right there's all let's make-believe you care all right there's no advantage make-believe that's make-believe this but there's an advantage fucking no there's an advantage yes everyone knows this is crazy I want to see that in the NFL you know you got like was that before and after is it two different looks to see this person don't want to shame this person look someone's letting her do this right you know it's nice the problem that's the problem they should say transgender league right or there should be you know some rules where you have to compete with the chromosome your birth you don't have to fucking compete most people don't compete in organized sports most people don't and if you're trans maybe that should be something you can't do it and particularly for girls who transition to boys you know that school in Texas that won't let this girl is transitioning to a boy they won't let her compete with boys so they make her compete with girls and she's on fucking testosterone right so she's taking testosterone to be or he's taking testosterone whatever you want to say it I get so confused yeah yeah to become a porter it's taking testosterone to become a boy yes and then now is forced to wrestle with women yes young girls in fact all jacked right Jack like a boy it's like a boy wrestling girls crazy probably pop a boner doing that I don't think she has one yet oh you can get a little thumb yeah that's what happens oh yeah yeah the clitoris gets a little bit bigger yeah and did that ovary sort of like start getting suspended in a I don't know income that he's dropped what do they do not wonder the wonder if they remove those parts you know because they do have direct Amis on women when they have disease and what if they do that with a man when a man transitions from a woman yeah when a man transitions from a woman yeah when you used to be a woman and now you're going to a deer's yeah what do they do I just can't wait to the day where they can do it genetically where a woman really becomes a woman like a man becomes a woman or a woman becomes a man but guess what even if they do here's the issue if you knew that a woman took steroids for 30 years and developed insane tendon strength and muscle strength and then stopped doing steroids it is a scientific fact that you are going to keep a very big percentage of those gains what are the game what is the percentage at 30% at 40% whatever the fuck it is whatever percentage that you would keep after you get off the steroids that is significant even if you're not currently on these performance-enhancing drugs your body has been artificially boosted to this superior level yeah through these drugs yeah and you lose a lot of the feminine you know you lose the breasts yes and that might not come back well I mean a thing if you take estrogen the probably calorie I don't know our fucking doctor I'm a moron but what I do know is when this is we're in nonsense land yeah okay it's not is it not saying that someone can't become a woman and be a woman and call them a woman I'll treat him like a woman I'm cool with it I'm a hundred percent cool with it right I mean as open-minded as I come with this but this is this is unfair for women which is what's so ironic about this yeah because everyone's supposed to be looking out for women if you're looking out for women but you're also blindly progressive to the point where you let and shit like this flow well now you're not looking out for women right because now women are in this weird position where you putting them at an unfair disadvantage right fucking crazy I agree god damn it makes me want to drink real Heineken no they just sent this stuff to me it's good yeah I used to love how they can light I talked about that subject a little bit too much but it's just it's a symptom of a sick society and it's a symptom of a lack of rational thinking it's a symptom of people just just be bending over backwards so hard to be progressive and open-minded that you're just you're giving in to these extremists these crazy people that are looking at this thing completely delusional II when will it snap back it's coming Trump that's why Trump's president that is he's gonna win again yeah I know he's gonna win again of a who can beat him they're not gonna be there's no one who can right he's gonna win again he's gonna win again because of shit like this the more shit like this happens there's a after chump I mean it's another four years son Donald June Donald Donald Jr was with a friend of a friend of mine his name is crispy and he's a disabled veteran or he's very able I should say yeah but he's a wounded veteran he's missing he had his leg amputated burns over most of his body a super positive attitude great guy anyways he doesn't get political online he took a picture with Donald Trump jr. right and Instagram took it down for violating their Terms of Service it's just a photo picture of just photo with president's son yeah photo with him a trump jr. just stand-in there and they took the picture down Thanks what that's what are you doing yeah did they ever when they do that that they give you a reason or they just do what they want well he posted it on his he sent me a direct message about it too yeah I asked I actually reached out to him cuz I'd follow him and he follows me and I was like does this shit real and he's like yup and he's super positive about it I mean this thing I served our country to and he's a great guy like his his Instagram handle is crispy 11b okay yeah and he just put it up there and they said that they got him for Terms of Service and they took it down he put it back up again good good for him so this is the photo right here let me say when asked Instagram says that they didn't do it so they didn't do it but who took it down that said however an Instagram spokesperson told Fox News the post was reviewed but was not deleted by the company after found the post did not violate their standards but that's not true because it's missing spokesperson said that there are a number of reasons a post may no longer be available including the account holder deletes either the account or the post the cut he's saying you didn't do that so it could have been something else mmm I mean you can't prove it yeah I don't know well that this dude is not an attention whore and you wouldn't do that he wouldn't do that in lie about it that's ridiculous I'll make Twitter Instagram could be lying I mean it's not really it could be a glitch too yeah you know sometimes it's a fortuitous glitch that looks like a massive conspiracy yeah but he said they sent him notice it said it violated the terms of services so if he said that he's okay yeah that that's what was said back to I'm pretty sure that's the screenshot you want to make sure that says you violated something yeah that's what you want I mean it's just so weird what's going on now it's just everything just seems so fucking preposterous yeah just like on Facebook Twitter all that stuff if I get if it's something negative I just you know that's gone I don't I don't let I don't let people just start bashing me on that stuff I just okay here it is once I landed I opened up Instagram and got a message that your post was taken down for violating Instagram guidelines so did he post that yes he did well there you go wait a minute let me see they did yeah he posted the thing saying it ok here's what he posted yeah it said wounded veteran violated community standards by posting with Donald Trump jr. he didn't post the actual notification but he probably didn't even save it right and I would yeah he's I believe maybe you're right it is a sad and just like overzealous employees I think there's no oh yeah I think there's a huge company yeah I mean you anybody could go broke at any minute and just do what that wonder what do they want you think the reading dick picks who's been fucking with them on the other way the other way around someone could have just flagged it by a bunch of bots it's just made up disappear all right to get a reaction like this yeah so it could be simple as that can you do that sure so if you just had a bot they do Instagram review it manually before they delete it no I take it down it happens on other accounts for that doesn't read get reviewed that way that just got taken down because it got flagged so many times I don't know well that's one thing that we did learn from talking to Jack Dorsey the CEO of Twitter like it's impossible to manage there's too many ghosts they're going up right now by the thousands like if you could see everyone everyone in America posting on Twitter right now be like ah explosion oh my god ones and zeros just busting all over the place and text just check what do you think like if you were to grab somebody's phone the most popular person that gets the tweeted the most just emotion at it just looked at it yeah how fast would that go you know nothing like just that that one account Oh be insane maybe yours boy goes yeah a lot of the people yeah yeah I follow a lot of other people I just filed whenever things someone's interesting so he's got cool pictures a follow guy yeah yeah hit like first yeah let me see yeah so what else this person's make sure they're not whacked it's really funny as people get mad at you for certain people you follow yeah people that you stop following are Kelly now don't tell me what to do right that's first of all first of all don't tell me what to do second of all what am i doing am i boosting up his profile yeah he's fucking art Kelly no doesn't matter if I follow him if I don't I want to know how crazy he is that's right dude did you see Tyrone Tyron Woodley UFC top welterweight former champion had a thing on his Instagram page of him watching are Kelly getting interviewed where he was he was who was denying that he knows how to hog-tie people play this play this all interview yeah it's crazy shit ain't funny but Dawg that's great he's not using confidence tonight I follow our Kelly for the same reason yeah that I loved Real Talk watch this video real talk we played it on the podcast multiple times Real Talk is one of the greatest unintentional comedies that's ever been real Tom Real Talk it's in it oh my god what is it it's an r kelly song okay where he's an argument with his girlfriend on the phone while I was girlfriend the phone he's like getting his hair done and shit he's smoking stogies drinking it's got like different outfits on yeah he's still in the conversation and there's one part where he goes bitch I wish you would talk bitch I wish you had burned my motherfucking listen I absolutely feel for any person that he's victimized oh absolutely do you get what you cannot deny that shit is fuckin where that shit is hot oh yes there is oh they just played that would you try the name trifling-ass is the best is the best african-american saying of all trifle trifling trifling and it's one that why people cannot use its to I pronounce it too good that word that word as much as the only n-word right stop trifling you can't be trifling you can't you can't right now to the G and trifling yeah you can tackle it yeah that's why white people are not allowed to use exactly he's out there trifling he's not there trifling again shit this is a bullshit trifling well here's the thing but gay guys use trifling I bet gay guys will pull it out I came over there with this trifling ass no it sounds like a rifle that you travel with it's a trifle it yeah look it's a travel rifle they're thinking abandon those good for long range don't bring a trifle with how many people do you think had to live it up before Webster had to like answer this question what is a trifling effort laugh lacking in significance or solid worth such as a frivolous trifling be trivial a trifling gift see chiefly dialectical my god lazy shiftless in a trifling fellow a trifling fellow that's the most English thing very winding fellow he's a trifling fellow don't bring your ass over here without travelling hello yeah that's a word bro so that's a legit word trifling shit was gonna say something else like what did we talk about right before it caught my heart Kelly Kelly yeah I like that point he did an album where it was a lot of just talking oh trapped in the closet yeah yeah I think Aziz had a whole thing on that I did it like Aziz Ansari did a bit on it I believe so I know you had a bit yeah about our Kelly it might have been about trapped in the closet yeah trap the closet is great but it can't fuck with real talk really the jam have you seen a show Weird Al Yankovic's trapped in a drive-through no it's really good no it's the same length as our Kelly's trapped in the closet and it's the same and it's all about being trapped and a McDonald's drive-through because the personal firm's taken too long and it's like he did the whole style is this website yeah yes respect commitment it's animated oh my god that's hilarious which one is this Weird Al has been around for a long time man yeah I mean I remember when Michael Jackson's beat it came out and he had eat it eat it yeah I mean that was mad it was unfair yeah yeah what year was that that's kind of might have been the A's it's gotta be late eighties early night yeah it is y'all a name is real out real how old is here Weird Al's gotta be 85 years old what yeah 12 yeah back then his first song aired in 1976 what he was that big on Dustin 6 yeah that's insane uh-huh so he was really young dr. Dement dr. Demento never listen I was a kid but that's uh they played always weird goofball nerdy songs yeah and he was the king of it he has a huge following now he said like he'll sell out places weird out

good dancer too accepts his gender you know I like he's not trifling that's what it's definitely not trifling yeah that's a word it's like there's certain words like that one you just seem so ridiculous if you try to use it oh this is what I was gonna say yeah we were talking about we weren't even talking about this but my daughter is watching these YouTube videos of this there's this young gay fellow that does makeup tutorials oh yeah okay he's enormous like he's enormous you know he probably gets more views in any network show that's ever been created how old was this fellow he's young he's like 20 okay what do you say Jim I'm trying to realize if I should bring this up he I just the last thing that popped in my head during Coachella he got accused of being in this viral video that happened it wasn't him but there's a the ferris wheel all Coachella have you ever seen that dude I'm talking about no it's a big famous thing that people take pictures in front of during a concert you could see a silhouette of somebody getting head in there and it's two guys oh really it's a very vivid video that was going went super viral on Twitter that night and they were saying it was him yeah how dare they he's all about makeup not head bitches we apply your lipstick achieve it clean but it's hilarious my sister only my sister my daughter sits in front of the TV cackling yeah it just really going oh is it supposed to be funny she thinks it's funny yeah she thinks her laughter I don't know yeah I mean he's covered in crazy makeup I think what she was laughing at though in all fairness was he was making fun of someone subscribers 6 million 16 million oh my I think he was making fun of people that put on too much makeup okay so he was going crazy with yes he thought it was really funny that is fucking banana 16 million people and he's doing makeup tutorials hey that's great he looks great that's the thing it's like we there's an Kardashian all kinds of shit like this that you would have never expected yeah and because the access because on-demand access especially like through a computer is so easy it's so easy to just type in the next thing yeah I read but just what's next just pops up yeah so like these people that know network in their right mind like NBC would never say hey that young guy let's get that guy to do a makeup show the but get the fuck out of the office you don't know shit about readings 8 million subscribers that's crazy that'd be a fun game to play as like what rabbit hole would YouTube send you down if you typed in this I just let it keep going that's on its own those algorithms they the real problem is people think that a lot of those algorithms are essentially designed to get you angry Oh pissed off see what's the next thing tick yeah yeah our children what are they teaching our children next yeah this is the problem with the illegal immigration I knew there's a fucking problem next thing you know you're just more and more angry yeah that's like the argument with Facebook too is that they're set they're trying to figure out what gets people to engage and so the algorithm realize what you engage with and then that's what they show you more and what gets people to engage is shit that makes them mad yeah yeah totally it keeps me wanting to i watch you fight videos on Facebook all day do you really know just like you know like brawls in a schoolyard or like you know just it just keeps going I'm like oh man what's gonna happen here well you know I'm not I don't do much of the fighting so when I see it it's like oh this is interested who's gonna win this one and I couldn't you know what that the underdog yeah I enjoy watching it yeah I mean I will watch them I wanna watch it Chuck it's obviously someone's about to die right that's good like her couple punches to the face well the best ones are when someone deserves it yes so those the ones you enjoy yeah someone's being a real dick yeah someone's like listen man you're being a dick yeah I just saw as a guy oh no it was a I want to say like an old Middle Eastern couple they're on a subway and this dudes like smack and his wife in the face like then and there's this other guys he's across from him and he's recording it and he's like no not not in front of me and he walked over there and say he ate oh like eight times to stop and then I'm just punching the shit out of him so it's nice to see it you know yeah there's one big area okay it's like a bus and some guys running his mouth to this old white guy who's obviously a like an ex Vietnam vet and he's telling like just leave it alone man leave it alone and he comes down there and then he walks up to the front and he just beats the shit out of him and you just see blood coming out of his face and it's like you know he started this he engaged that whole thing the guy was walking away and then he was like just once yeah those are the best ones yeah when someone deserves it yeah how many like that's the thing about like a guy smacking his wife in public yeah like how often does he smack her that he's so confident that he'll just smack her yeah everybody right like if it must be he must think it's acceptable and everyone else was cool with it I must think that he could just get away with things yeah sometimes people just think they can get away with things yeah it was a there was not many people on that bus in this video I think I wasn't even paying attention to it or that most people are just gonna be too scared to say anything yeah that's what I mean death this is where it gets real scary because that is the best argument for the end of all privacy is that no one would ever be able to do anything like that because the whole world will be watching yeah exactly honest like you you might it depends on what kind of action you could take yeah if you could literally see everything that's happening at anytime everywhere in the world yeah yeah yeah well now that everyone's got cams so it's like it's closed it's closed Yeah right and then they're gonna have those fucking things cops honest you're keeping us yeah the people on us now a little bit until too much alcohol is involved know this something to it because if you think about like with like Kennedy did a speech on secrecy it was like in 1961 or 62 about how abhorrent secrecy is how dangerous it is for a free society and they're basically talking about secret societies and secret you know pacts and the government and he was basically I think a lot of it was him talking about some of the shady shit that he experienced in intelligence agencies and huh but when you have like kings or when you have people that are in power like how do they wield that power one of the ways they wield that power it's all secrecy if they want to execute people then I killed it's all secret right you know no one that the world is not privy to it like what happened to him they took him to a bunker something yeah and then they're beating the shit out of and torturing them like North Korea yeah exactly they're just isolated from the rest of the world and who knows what the hell he's doing over there so if we just know the stuff that he allows us to know ya know that's the perfect example yeah of power and secrecy right now they just take you and make you disappear he's executed a bunch of people oh yeah but we don't even know I'm sure they're over close to the tip of the iceberg on that I'm sure that still goes on here too well yeah I'm sure I'm sure people are killing people for someone right now mm-hmm you know and some of them deserve it yeah give me an extra one for me right stop your trifling ass it's it's all so weird like what will accept people dying from like I was listening this podcast where this wolf lady she's a wolf biologist she was talking to a friend Steve Rinella on the meat-eater podcast and she was talking about how we accept people getting killed by mountain lions yeah like it's it happens it's happened twice last year right it happens it's not it's not really common but it happens but the moment that people start getting killed by wolves in America people gonna get furious really yeah cuz we they reintroduced wolves all the 1994 that's right oh so that's so that's their outrage that we did that too yeah well she was basically they were saying it was there was two really interesting things about the podcast a lot really interested things but two that really stood out was one that the these people they they reintroduced these animals in 1994 but there were already some wolves here and the wolves would have probably eventually made it down there was it Yellowstone right yeah yeah yeah but that we aren't because the fact that they brought them in and it wasn't just a natural fixture we have this thing like Oh somebody ruined this you somebody fucked this up yeah the other thing is that they number them instead of named them mm-hmm because if you name them it's like there's Dolores aw Dolores killed some chief we're gonna have to take her out and we can't kill not Dolores number three Wolf one57 right yeah that's true let's like inmates in prison just give them nothing exactly it's easier to kill it easier to treat them like cattle right so but we did that one guy killed that mount lat they fought back yeah that's to be horse shit I thought right yeah that the male lion was yeah it was a real kitten and had been separated from its mom they think his mom got killed it was really really small and really young so it wasn't like I mean he might have it who knows right ciated yeah yeah if he's listening right now I'm sorry bro yeah but I think what happened you're alive and we're happy love you better not touch wolves buddy I think it maybe was starving to death and it took a chance to try to kill him yeah that's possible too but it was very small so 30 pounds which still a 30 pound cat it's fucking terrifying I never saw pictures of the cat either because something had ate a lot of it yeah so did he say how he did it did he put it like a chokehold or did he he said I hoped it oh right stepped on it something like that oh man yeah I asked if you saw this thing going around the internet about this wolf pack being tracked or there's actually six so much it's like a moving gif over time but oh yeah I have seen this it's amazing it shows how they never cross territories oh cool six different packs I think yeah they all establish their territory they mark their territory and they respect all respect it yeah let's take over Minnesota yeah Minnesota has a shitload of wolves apparently if it keeps going it's a picture Jimi Hendrix Wisconsin yeah Wisconsin is a shitload of wolves apparently like thousands it was car yeah yeah I could see that and it's a lot of you know woods up there and just yeah land not not many major cities I think I saw Keith once I think I saw wolf once but it was you mean like in the wild yeah it was big it was either a coyote or was a wolf but I think that might have been a wolf because it was just getting dusk and I was in Alberta and I saw this thing run across the road that might have been a wolf yeah but I didn't see a wolf that's the spooky thing is what are they doing they circling you they have checking you out and they're not usually alone right those are the lone wolf but that's rare that's an asshole kicked out you ever seen this video this one's great no look at the size of this thing comes out of the woods it walks across the street look at this oh Jesus that's a bear that's a bear no that's wonder what that way that it's a big-ass wolf that's what that is that's probably a young 130 pound wolf or some where is this if I guess this is a no show Russia yeah it's gotta be Russia that's a gigantic wolf rushes had real legitimate problems with wolves where in Siberia they have these super packs they would get together like because they were starving so he'd get like a hundred wolves who would form a super pack cuz they could kind of do whatever the fuck they wanted once they get that bang yeah and they started killing horses yeah go on a horse stables just take down a horse easy yeah but it's just the idea that the super packs they realize it was too hard to just take over shit I have all these pesky people and their guns and houses yeah so they got desert fucking horses though Siberia has always been an interesting believes in Russia no they know have you you do up there 1990 Yeah right before communism fell I was there for three weeks well before communism yeah yeah we do a Chavez uh in power whoa yeah it was a spy yeah pretty uh putting my jewels would you say I said hello I don't understand please and thank you lords I remember it was this program founded by dwight d Eisenhower in the 40s of its called people to people where they stood the youth of America to other countries to hang out with that youth to promote world peace and that's all it is and certain kids from high schools are selected and you get a Washington DC first for three you know for three days they briefed you and then you go to another country and ours was Russia there's awesome had great time Wow yeah and I told Bert Kreischer that - you know cuz he has the whole machine story I said I feel like I can't tell my Russian story because you've you've owned it so much with your machine stolen and if I do anything about this then it's gonna look like oh okay you too huh yeah you gotta rush the story do you should tell it yeah yeah people want to hear it they'll understand then I figured I kind of got in trouble cuz I was trading illegally on the black market over there well we don't on purpose I didn't know it's doing it because you a story cause a copy like tell me more that's kind of what happened this dude I was talking to is after like a function that we were at you know where they would go to the some town some village and they'd come and they'd greet you with bread and salt and they would dance around and you would just eat with them and hang out or whatever and so I was just talking this kid you know they speak perfect English you know we're the ones who don't speak Russian so this kids trying to teach me Russian cuss words and I thought he's pretty coolest before the Internet you know so I have a bunch of these ink pens that my mom gave me from the phone company where she works she goes just give him ink pens they love anything with English writing on it anything American they're gonna love it bubble gum jeans ink pens so I was like yeah dude let's let's be pen pals so exchanging addresses you know like I'll keep in touch with you why not and I give him a pin and he gives me his address and what I don't know is this dude's already kind of in trouble with cops over there for trading illegally on the black market I had no idea and this cop just grabbed both of us the drags us into the hotel and no one saw me from my group get grant by the way because I was off doing my own little thing that this dude right learning Russian cuss words so we go into this office in this hotel and they're just cussing each other in Russian and I don't know what the hell's going on I'm like dude what what is this I'm my own big trouble here I mean you know he goes it does little shits not to worry about that this is bullshit and they scream some more now the cop doesn't speak English and so he's basically my translator this guy's - the cop I'm like hey man I'm with this group you know I don't know what's going on and so he kicks that kid out the Russian cop and now it's just me and this Russian cop and I'm looking at him and he's looking at me and he looks at my bag with all these ink pins and he's like he goes like this he's like was let me see you know like all you want a pen so I hand him a pen and he looks at it is that kind of cool he puts it in his desk and he goes away and he comes back with this big-ass Russian pendant sickle and Hammer thing with the wings coming out of pretty cool looking thing and he's handed it to me then he goes like this so he technically arrested me for trading and then he traded with me yeah 1990s when that happened that's pretty crazy it was fun to see all that shit though right before it fell did you see like lines in the street for food or anything crazy like that yeah not well yeah we saw linens we went to Red Scare Square Lenin's tomb we went to some smaller little danke villages went swimming and the knee put a river right close to where Chernobyl was like 50 miles from Chernobyl and whoa so but yeah there was you definitely tell it was definitely some poverty going on here and there but not not to the extreme that you hear you know I didn't see like these lines around buildings or toilet paper or anything like that but you know that's what it was communism was on its way out too so it wasn't in the worst part of it but it was definitely an experience I was 18 when I went over there there's a picture of me in Red Square and I'm well I got acid washed jeans I got a Bugle Boy t-shirt on and I'm wearing a fanny pack with deck shoes and I'm just doing like this so that was fun man yeah that's got to be a hell of a flight to right take to get the wrong we went to Germany first long layover there for like three hours Frankfurt and then the house so yeah I couldn't even tell you how long that thing was it's been a long time 37 now that is an interesting country to me it's always been an interesting country because it gets so fucking cold and suddenly there are hard people and they create all these amazing fighters there's so many great fighters and wrestle and wrestlers that have come out of Russia former Soviet Union dragged off rocky five over four and four yeah it was scary didn't it was a new Creed Rocky's yeah you know that I've heard I haven't seen it yet yeah Drago's son is ya fighting who is this breed son do we know the hacker the Creed guy no though I think you know the son of Drago I don't know some Russian cat okay already famous over here I don't you think so I don't think so yeah there's the guy look at him cool yeah this is son this is my son like a badass it does he's still a badass I'm sure that this is Joe is perfectly square that is like a damn square how much bigger my groggy Christ how tall is Sylvester I don't know I mean met him yes yes um I think he's about five nine he's taller than me I'm 5/8 okay so he's either five nine or 510 okay so that well the drug out must be huge like hotels say he is cuz everybody was jokes Ron says he's 511 or he's five seven five five five but they do that with everybody yeah they do it Tom Cruise yeah it says 510 see that makes sense so he's two inches taller than me 510 yeah okay well yeah I think I'm five nine I don't know how that measured myself in a while how tall do you think I am I think about that about five nine yeah in high school I always built like if I've dated 911 or bigger now we're old people that are small and as people get bigger and bigger these kids today that are getting hitting puberty when they're six yeah there's the hormones in the meat six-five mm-hmm who's excite it probably accentuated his height for that that's seen well that's just his hair is five inches look at that hair looks like he's almost like a foot taller than them yeah isn't it yeah yeah they probably had they probably had him in heels and home barefoot or something for that shot didn't they say like at one point they're in this movie rocky said go ahead and uh go ahead hit me for real one time just what you know something it look real because they were always like you know they're like an inch apart and the swings and it almost hit him to the hospital like he gave him the chance that's right yeah he talked about that it almost stopped his heart ah my dear doll friend right he's a professional yeah he's a kick box kickboxer yeah really good semester stolen Lungren put me in the hospital during rocky for yeah yeah don't let people hate you bro I guess I won't have to even use the clip right he also has like screws in his neck from doing the Expendables oh yeah yeah what do you got Jamie he's been intensive care for five days because of that wolf with nuns walking around Jesus Christ Wow an insurance company would not pay out until after they saw the footage of the incident once they did they wrote the check I want to see that footage he saw what I see that punch he hit my heart so hard that it banged against my ribs and started to swell and that usually happens in car accidents that guy could punch he's a beast man he's a giant dude why would he ever he's a serious striker like he knows how to throw shots if you watch him in his movies he's he's obviously trained yeah I want to see that footage I want to see that punt out it's got to be out there what if Sylvester Stallone wouldn't let anybody handle see it alright this one's too embarrassing the weight cried grapes and falls down loses her breath you can never be an action hero again if somebody sees you cry that's true right if some Suze like legitimately cry from a liver shot why shitting yourself is probably the most embarrassing thing a person can do right yeah like a guy who's known for being handsome and debonair yeah there's no control of rings shoot yourself in your car while you're driving you know white leather seats that's the worst it's it's gonna happen to say it happens everybody this is gonna be a time in your life if you eat risky yeah right yeah think of the most handsome person in the world there's a woman on the world splash it all over herself point in her hotness heyday most likely do you remember that I don't like thinking about what was the Woody Harrelson movie was that was he's throwing up was it Woody Harrelson movie where he played the bowler oh yeah oh kingpin kingpin yeah that was a milkman scene right there wasn't a shit scene in that that was I'm thinking of Dumb and Dumber there is a shit seen it well he's bullshitting in the urinal that's about it really oh yeah it's not a Farrelly Brothers movie done the dumber has big kissing - with Jeff Daniels that's right yeah what he's that's what I'm thinking that's laxative in his yeah where he's hanging on to the toilets yeah like he's gonna get shot to orbit yeah they got all those weird noises yeah because Jim Carrey was healing his girl yeah he poisoned poison his friend yeah that's it right there there it has full on but kingpin but that was it a Farrelly Brothers movie that's um that's one of my all-time favorite comedy movies Jane panting that's a great guy it's great I remember loving it but I haven't seen it in so long I need to go look at it looked at it I'm scared to watch movies that I love again you can see them in like the light of 2019 and go yeah yeah this is terrible yeah I know that's happened a couple times it happens yeah right yeah you remember them so fondly yeah look at that don't worry look at that hair that hair is amazing yeah who's such a good movie with like some hair makeup had to go like I'm sure that was his decision we're gonna take your hair just fan out randomly it looked like a spoiler on a Fiero there before dogs on pad yeah yeah like a little Trump thing going on there it's very similar professional bowler now and a PBA that has a full-on orange afro right now we're on and he's like really good and he's from my hometown yeah see if you're a bowler you got to do something like stand out wear like purple glitter each clothes or something that's smart that's just Brandon he's peacock and he's like there is that dude's from Hickory North Carolina see that's why he wears that shit got it well he's got to I mean how the fuck else do you get luncheon when you're a bowler it's exactly like that might be the only way to save bowling they might have to like go like roller derby just knock into each other whether yeah they were bored of bowling that I've never sat down and watched bowling Ari's got a good friend Tommy what's his name he's a professional bowler real nice guy met him at a couple of shows okay but this guy's are a real pro bowler you know we were talking about like the financial opportunities of bowling and it's not good like pro pool players surprised it sucks it sucks Ari's friend I'm sorry this heavy boldly recently I bowled my kids yeah that's fine bald yeah dilutes maybe I think that's it yeah Tommy blues I think that's it you guys go with was uh yep that's him did turn percent there's already a bowl yeah he's good guy real fucking killer bowler do you can you make it curve no yeah he was prize team role that mother I do too right damn middle I'd do it as hard as humanly possible or it's just disturbing for people to watch and now they have it they have two miles per hour up there you can see how fast it's like a damn you know yeah like a pigeon thing I'm trying to get that bitch fast yeah I just want to smash those things I get annoyed it the guys who like curve it really good like he goes way over here that just whips real fast in a gutter ball oh okay all that from fucking note the fuck duh look at all that you did shitty whip watch but now watch me right down the middle strike to me bowling was always like breaking in pool it's like yeah it's cool to break the balls but the real cool thing is to play the game like this is you just breaking the balls over and over again it's the same look every time yeah it's home well it's like bowling yeah bowling you're just breaking the balls that's all you're doing like when you're bowling you got pins just knocking down the pins the exact same or you it's the same guy every time yeah and I know the combinations are different than the way they collide and the where you impact is different but it's still the same thing it's a dumb game sorry and my grandfather was a big boulder man in bold leagues and he had trophies in his house and shed he said love bowling when I was like a little kid I was analyzing bowling because he'd take me bowling with him I was like this isn't a nonsense game yeah this games nonsense do it just so you can smoke and drink there's a thing that they have in the East Coast in Boston that they don't even have anywhere else it's called candlepin bowling you ever see that shit it's which smaller version dude that you you ball with a softball that sounds more fun to me but it's huge in the East Coast of hometown Ohio they've got a few places actually this gigantic bars that they have all these lanes for this thing in for candlepin bowling yeah it's called pins or something I was looking down on that because I came from my grandfather in New Jersey I bowled regular bowling like a fucking American right and then I wove er what's this candle and bullshit like would you guys steal this from Finland or something what is that nonsense shape that one throwing rocks the throwing rocks at pins I found I was talking about the bar this is not what you're talking about well I mean it is but it's it's way smaller and it's really just like a bar game oh no this have like five lanes or ten lanes Nico but but it's this same game yeah yeah they should have bowling in New England don't have like bowling alleys and you know let's go Bowl and like all we're candlepin only people like what candlepin only bowling alleys yeah so we're gonna like these candles that's what I want stead of our fire it only works on the East Coast for some reason there's like a few those things like how about this high light oh fuck people go that ball goes fast right it's nice actually it's way smaller and I was thinking in my head of furniture bowling kinda yeah okay ball to ball a little bit yeah so it's kind of like an open bowling but the candle pins are the pins are different they're shaped like candles that's why it's called candlepin bowling if you look at them they're thin pins or not they're not like fat on the bottom that's like why are we even here hmm Boulder not make a commitment highlight I think is one of the most corrupt games oh yeah someone someone tried to tell me explain I was Joey he was explaining to me how highlight works that it's all about gambling and the only reason why it works is that people are betting on the games and so because people are betting on the games they get these guys these guys just fucking miss it on purpose and they do yeah it's like it's rigged I might be wrong if you're a highlight player you like this podcast again hey I get my information from the Church of what's happening I go look at that damn glove it's look how they play with that it looks like somebody with a one long freaky nail are they they're holding it right it's not like wrapped around their wrist yeah they're holding it like oh how much more fun would be if he watched a baseball game where the picture just had that thing boy that looks so stupid this game looks so dark I don't know they're throwing it off the wall and then another guy catches it I'm gonna throw it and but there's somebody here to get hit in the face pretty quick they're putting forth a minimum effort even when he falls down it's like that guy he's falling down like he's trying to get a foul oh yeah he done it looks like he flopped yeah soccer the soccer flops oh he soccer flopped it that's why soccer never make it in America the flop you can't get out you have 30 years of flopping you can watch it on TV we know what you do you know though I think it's catching on the NFL and the NBA flop they're starting to flop a little bit more because they see what happened isn't somebody analyzed who's the free throw did they analyze there was someone that an Allah there was an ESPN analyst who analyzed what's the guy's name with a big crazy beard really good basketball player Oh from the Clippers oh go to I don't know what literally don't know shit go to Andrew Salt Schultz's I think it's Kevin Durant is that it Andrew Salt Schultz's go to Andrew Sol Schultz's inst Twitter page so he he had it up on his Twitter and I watched it I watched the analysis the difference between him one he's challenged and he throws a free-throw verses unchallenged well he's hard with the beard I'm James Harden blank okay we've been challenged meaning someone's trying to block him or he has a free open shot when he has a free open shot he just jumps up in the air and does his three is three-pointer but when he's challenged he throws his legs up to hit the other person so he could fall down on his ass like a leg kick ass move well he's not even in son even a self defense move he's like making he's forcing contact with the person so that he can fall down so it looks like yeah it's interesting so like so here you'll see him this guy watch watch no one's there watch watch he jumps he jump straight up in the air straight up just straight up in the air and this guy analyzes several shots where he does this on him and then then they show when he's contested right and when he's contested he jumps up in the air and look he throws his body weight forward and all falls down so in the hopes that there'll be a foul yeah yeah they're saying like if you look at the way his body moves when someone's contesting him he moves when leaning his legs towards them to make contact you think that's involuntary or voluntary could be involuntary I see the problem is that pencil-neck dork fucking pushing that not this is he's specifically known especially like in the last two or three years for getting himself to the free-throw line right at a way higher clip than they'd almost anybody in history so like that's what they're also saying like you can't fault him for that I was using the rules of the game sure to play the game right so this guy is exactly was this guy who's examining this you know he's got van pelvic Center guy so the head sports center guy is analyzing this and he's realizing that the legs are moving in a direction towards the other player because the guys they're witches might exactly be what he's doing it might be that or it might be that he has a different reaction when someone's in front of him he almost wants to kick the guy away from him yeah I don't know most times fouled a three-point attempt Diaz 9550 more than anybody in LA so yeah I'm going with Scott Van Pelt yeah I made it a rule to cuz you perfect there's a big thing that happened over the weekend in their game cuz you have to give the guy a space to land because a couple years ago there a couple of defensive players that got in trouble for hurting people they're getting their ankles turned ruining their career which is then ruining this team's chances to a championship lots of money involved yeah they made it's a flagrant foul like it's very bad to do that mm and the referees all of a sudden didn't didn't call this on Sunday like the very first time all year they stopped calling it that's why they're talking about it really and they stopped calling it because people are taking advantage of it why they stopped calling it is the big question people are literally talking about for 48 hours like why are they doing this bringing up the question of like are the officials really involved in the game and it's become a big discussion about another reason why I won't watch it do you watch sports i watch football that's it yeah do you worry about brain damage well yeah cause it's gonna rule the NFL do you look at it differently sorta way do you look at it differently than you did like before that concussion movie uh well I played high school football IV I've got hit so hard that I've seen stars and that kind of stuff that I think that could happen I don't look at it differently to answer your question no no I think it you know they might change the helmets and they've tried that over the years do you member it like it was just leather helmets there was less concussions because you would not lead with your head exactly now you have a weapon on your head and people have used this such and so I would love you know how they do throwback uniforms let's go I mean let's go throwback equipment you know a helmet back on take that take that stupid face mask off you really should but you'd have to change so much you'd have to change so much in the way people there's so many different factors the way the practice out there they set up plays yeah it would have to be a new game I don't think it's gonna happen I think the perception of the helmet being safer fucked the game up I really think did but you know alright I used to think that bare-knuckle boxing like they should have bare knuckles in the UFC but then I've been watching this bare-knuckle boxing stuff and people get cut up so bad mm-hmm now I'm thinking you know what it's better to have padded knuckles it's better yeah it's better for the fighters well that helmets were padded they just weren't like a hard shell mm-hmm shell is what they did you know you used it as a weapon so that's literally the only way you're gonna be able to stop some of the brain damage yeah and you're still not gonna be able stop they're still colliding into each other they say these guys are getting brain damage from getting hit in the chest yeah they're getting hit in the chest in the head snaps and it rains washing around inside their skull well they're changing I think maybe like a younger like little leg now it's like you can't do tackle football until a certain age so now everyone's you know it's all flag football to a certain age I think yeah that'll probably happen and yeah and then the practices will be different where we only do pads once a week love it for the real game will be amazing if they ever came up with something that definitively fixed it like some stem-cell treatment or something like that that regenerated brain tissue and bring you back to your normal state right if they do that then we now have to worry about anymore right but until that man oh that's gotta be around the corner that's close I think that's a very complex question of how to regenerate neural tissue brain tissue how to get rid of all those abscesses and all those things you see in those people's brains that have CTE they develop these like holes in their brain yeah it's serious shit yeah it's um wild a sport though did you play football no no no I wrestled in high school I was a little mad I wasn't that I've wrestled a higher 34 pounds yeah a bit of good fuck fuck out of here there's another show the fastest guys are small and just I wasn't that fast runner I was fast kicking and punching and stuff it wasn't really that faster runner didn't do a lot of running but when I was in high school when I was wrestling they were trying to tell me to like the coach coach Murphy he was also the wrestling coach he was also the football coach and he's like oh come on you're a sick fuck you should you should play football yeah and I was like dude that guy plays football we have this heavyweight his name is Bobby Baker he was 300 pounds he was enormous he was so big I was like he's not squashing me the fuck out of here the hardest I've ever been hit was by a little did in practice probably like five seven and he just he was a DB and it was a practice always like third-string running back and there like I was just running up the gut and I was falling into the end zone right it was over and this okay he had a running start like 20-yard headstart and it was like he came up from out of the ground with file didn't locked me back up well that's the hardest I've ever been hit was my little guy so you know think about speedy momentum he'd oh yeah when I went torpedo yeah with a hard helmet he led with that helmet but you know how fast like a really good athlete can run and just think of all that mass behind them I just yeah yeah that's the way those guys get hit and the amount of force behind them getting it's probably unlike anything in sports other than a car accident right yeah yeah that's Carl I think they should bring they should you know how hockey that you still fight in hockey uh NASCAR fights yeah pull out in the pit stop lets Duke it out let's yeah let's if there's a caution and everyone else was lapping you got two guys but have a beef pull over and get out of a car whoa in the middle of the infield with grass we have a wrestling ring and it's like full-on let's go get in the rink we'll get it we'll give you two minutes and then if you win that match maybe you get a little time shaving off you know so it's uh there's advantage to uh I'd watch that more if it were like half wrestling half mast put the hot your Libre mask on NASCAR's a weird one right because it's it's obviously fun to watch it's fun to be there but it's not as fun as Formula One you watch Formula One you're like well these guys are going way faster one of those wheels yeah yeah I mean that's the whole nother thing yeah you know those wheels touch it's over you're in the air right yeah these guys NASCAR law that happens it's fine it's true that one wheel Wow yeah and those guys died yeah well just NASCAR guys do too yeah not as much anymore but me that anybody's driving a fucking car going fast can die what am I saying but there's something but if you ever see the video between they show gt3rs racing versus Formula One racing it's the same track and they show a gt3 car like a Porsche going around this car really fast and then they show the same exact path being taken by a Formula One car you're like Jesus watches like a yeah one on the left at 200 we how much faster they are now what's the okay that's the same track the same track exact same turn look how much goddamn faster they are bats look at that it's so much cargo it on the right that's the same it seems amazing yeah and if ik line he's cutting see how the line the perfect racing line is cut into the groove like you can see that darkness yep yep that's a bunch of talented drivers no thank you I think the fastest I've ever been is like maybe a hundred and fifteen you ever been on a race track a bit on a race track yeah yeah but not you know not a pace car you know oh nice car yeah yeah but that but the Daytona 500 has that huge you know that incline hmm and just being down there and seeing that standing there next to it like whoa I didn't know is that steep you have to go faster you stay on it then yeah yeah that is pretty wide yeah and people get hit up there the bump wheels up there and collide and fucking spin out yeah look at that thing yeah yeah that's a serious bang look at that it's like a wall that is a little turn to the picture but still what is um what do you think that degree is like what angle they've told me before I forget it's probably like it's pretty serious though 20 degrees whoa wow that's great that's exactly that's I mean if you would be nervous if you're on a skateboard on that thing you have to go a certain speed just to stay up on the probably alright yeah it's such an American sport man NASCAR so American because it's loud as fuck yeah the cars are gross yeah they look this guy they're so gross looking yeah they don't look anything like that how many sponsors are all right even if you have a really nice car that's supposed to be the model that that car is the NASCAR car looks gross now yeah and they the decal that make fake headlights that's a sticker yeah of a headlight why haven't put that on there yeah what are we doing lying to me yeah yeah it's a fascinating piece of equipment though yeah that we've decided to make these things that just drive really fast and then hurl them around the circle this oval over 1000 high-tech like every they count every look the drafting of it they know it every angle that's you know all that but back in the day it was just a couple of good old boys Musha trying to outrun sap yeah that's that's what I wanna see that was hot rotten in its finest that's what it was that's what I want to say put moonshine in them cars and that funny that's where it all came from guys are trying to figure out how to get the fuck away from the top yeah used to have the shiniest cars man yeah you think they had to chase people in like Caprice classics that is it with but bench seats yeah that is the worst car for handling with dress shoes yeah they make him wear those stupid shoes yeah yeah he's got some Nike that's back in the day that's like that long the days when taro was on the ocean was Daytona 500 the first event you know I think so I think well I don't know I don't know about that I know that Honda on the sand okay the first Daytona was on the sand I believe so these are on the sand yeah they're driving in the sand this is crazy they're not going as fast all those cars are specially convertible those are the Batmobile they are convertibles they're comparables Wow that's what I want to see I'll bring back the damn convertible in NASCAR I'm gonna see these dudes faces wonder why they made them in convertibles yeah well that got the roll bar yeah but still I mean I bet it gets too hot in there and they probably didn't have air conditioning right yeah that's probably yeah well it's all fire it's easier to get out when you don't have a roof yeah yeah those people probably died in those things all the time those shitty cars and if you were a car racer back then you were gonna crash there's no way you're gonna you're not gonna keep together every time what's the fastest you think you've been in a vehicle well you know you don't say where what country is in I don't know this could be on Germany on the Autobahn in them 100s yeah yeah there's some really know no that thing that would have fallen apart yeah flying off the the the newest cars though the the problem is there in this horsepower war where every year they have to have a faster zero-to-sixty and now they've gotten to the point where they're they're ridiculously fast like the the cars of today like if you just bought a regular car today it'd be faster than a muscle car was in the 1970s right and you would even feel it yeah don't even know even tell you're going that fast yeah like if you bought like a Honda Accord today it would probably handle better and drive faster than any supercar from 1970 right yeah probably fight a gas yeah you can't feel it yeah they're real no way safer yeah one more boring have you driven a Tesla no driving I love to those stupid is it electric cars zero to sixty way quicker than gas you wouldn't even believe it I mean it's gotta be right yeah it's just instant power instant power and that one has a four wheel drive the the tesla model asks 100 d yeah it's got four four wheel drive and so it's got an engine in the front and engine in the rear and it flies yeah it's so it's it violates physics there you get like a whiplash and that thing a roller coaster dude yes you can't believe how fast it's going it's stupid and they're making a stupider one they're making a faster one that goes 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds yeah it's a Tesla Roadster it looks dope too looks a spaceship I would love to have one do you are you still living in LA where you got now I moved back to Hickory North Carolina to him I was out here 18 years just couldn't do any more no well it was a couple things you know my career has always been like a roller coaster ever good years bad years and I actually just admit I missed my family I haven't you know I've missed out on a lot growing up you know so and the market was really good i had this condo in Studio City I bought it for a certain amount and then it's it's it gained value and I thought well this if I'm gonna do this now is the time to pull the trigger mm-hmm and I think I saw you at the improv one oh yeah I'm out of here I'm bouncing yeah a mile road so much right yeah oh that's the thing too and the industry's changed like you know I already have a manager in an agent's not like I need to be here for every little audition you know I'll put myself on tape I got eastbound and down on a tape I got Harold and Kumar on a tape you know and then now yeah the the second audition yeah you fly up for a bit like you know getting your foot in the door that tape I can do that now they just change so much that's if you want to act and you guys so much stand up on the road there's really no reason to be here unless you just want to perform at the store all the time that's right yeah so and I moved back to Hickory and I was gonna get myself a nice lake house and Lake Hickory yeah still want to do that but then soon as I get home you know Thanksgiving dad has a stroke so I see that happen that you ever seen someone a stroke I was looking right at him that was weird that's a funny guy like I thought maybe cuz we were gonna eat Thanksgiving dinner late so like it was like a 6:00 p.m. thing we were doing to get other people in the house and so he was complaining all day about not eating like I'm hungry we were gonna eat we're gonna eat I'm looking around adding me sitting next to the fireplace and he just like he just like nosedives like just headfirst right into the hardwood floor and it was like bump you hear like a thump that's like ha ha that's making a joke we haven't eaten yet it's you know this make the thing about like a little blood sugar or something and I was kind of laughing in my brother's like no he hit really hard his head hit that floor way too hard for that to be a joke and then you walk over to him and arms curling up 1 I was going like that and it's like this is a stroke and we called 9-1-1 they came pretty quick but he suffered some serious brain damage right here and so he's paralyzed was left side now but I was in a weird way happy that I was at home when this happened because you know how was still out here that should happen right I'd be happy hating life yeah but the fact that I'm there and able to help Mom out you know going through it all this whole thing because she's got glaucoma and she's got brittle bones you know she can't visit lift him up and do stuff and the fact that we were in the house and able to help it's crazy today it was I didn't see the drooping of the face I didn't see that happen you know that's what people say when you see a stroke you see like the drooling happens yeah like that that fat chicken Total Recall you know weeks let's see we're head explodes get ready for our surprise no he just hit the floor so have you toured at all since that or if you just small it's just places I could I didn't take on extra gigs i but I didn't cancel the ones I had so the ones that I could drive to definitely as well let me go I have a brother who's there as well so but I definitely didn't take on anything for you know since Thanksgiving that it wasn't already there so yeah yeah it's but he's he's at a skilled nursing facility now and they showed us the X right you know the the MRI of the brain damage that happened he had a colada artery he's got it now he's keeps getting UTI infections because he has a catheter cuz it also it doesn't just fuck with your muscles it's the organs on that side too so his bladders got to relearn how to operate so he's got a catheter you know and that that's just opens you up for UTI infections a lot and those I don't know if you know that like UTI infections when you're older like it really devastates you because you hallucinate so you see shit oh yeah and it's weird being in there and you know he was like hey make sure that bears not out there like a bear like it keeps hearing or think there's a bear outside the window so yeah that I was happy to be back home for that but that bears where you live no no not not the skilled nursing facility I mean it might be some points yeah yes yeah no but uh yeah hope it for the best don't go into rehab occupational therapy physical therapy do they think that he'll be able to recover some function on this left side you know that they always want to get dangled a little bit of light of hope at the end of the talk I'll chase but you know some people recover quickly some people not at all some people three years later can recover you need a yeah three years later yeah I mean it you know so we're just still we're still doing all of it John Singleton just died from a stroke that's right shit yeah and he was watch Nifty 151 yeah it could happen to anybody teenage Luke Perry same thing 51 stroke that's right yeah yeah crazy the law strokes are happening fuck man I wonder if those folks smoked cigarettes well my dad definitely did yeah yeah yeah they said in cigarettes contribute pretty heavily to jokes he used to smoke a lot when he was younger and then quit you know when he was in his late 40s you know but that was a lot you know back then where you'd smoke at 12 years old or something oh I don't know if singleton smoked but I do know Luke Perry did yeah yeah and this woman that I talked to who is a neurologist was telling me that that's a significant factor uh-huh it raises your chances of stroke pretty significant yeah so I'm back in hair cream but I came I'm gonna cut my ideas to come out here you know for the holidays and keep doing it right Yeah right and then hit the store I was there last night yeah it was good seeing you man you too man that's that's on the roast battle my comfort zone - oh it's so mean no I'm like okay because she's shake hands hug thing I'm glad they hug - well Brian Moses the host of it is awesome yeah he's such a nice guy then when he does that show it seems like it's okay yeah cuz he's so nice like and he's so funny - yeah like him hosting it it makes it seem like it's okay and Jeff Ross being there sort of like let everybody know kind of what the rules you know are you know listen you know Jeff's an interesting cat right like he's really created like roasting is yeah it's like it's come back he's carved out that whole niche it's all hims all him now yeah but it really is I mean there was so little roasting going on before Jeff Ross yeah there was the roasting was a thing of the past was old Friars Club yeah oh yeah it was like old Jerry Lewis d'amour and that kind of stuff you know kind of amazing amazing yeah they were great I like those guys are so mean to each other we were all friends and they were laughing yeah while it's happening that's also the difference - it's like those rows there weren't that many of them and they were friends like legitimately friends that's the thing yeah they already were friends yeah lottie's Rose smells like who am i doing ooh right and I'm gonna come out swinging yep ya mean no man yeah I feel like I gotta get to know you before I could realize bust your balls otherwise I'm just being a dick exactly but it is just being a dick but it's really clever yeah it is being I enjoy it or what am i far you know yes me too but I think it's a great joke showcase for joke writing 100% yeah yeah really good the best ones although this the quickest right to the joke brutal you know the guys this guy last night I pulled out a laptop and was trying to do some voice created like you know Stephen Hawking voice or something and I'm like this is taking too long it's not working like just the neck the next guy had like it was like four words pat pat Pam yeah that's a skill I wish I had see I'm like I get up there I'm a goofball I tell stories I'm animated I move around I bet I envy those guys who can go but a bing bada boom I wish I had that skill you could develop that skill but I haven't gotten better at over the years but you have a style you have your own Jon REEP style right and people like your style though they would be mad like hey man why you doing that but I'm anxious guy I like the guy who tells the great stories he do an impression of a comedian yeah what do you remember like when you first started out there was like a way you thought you had to be yeah you know did you do anything like cringy that you look back on now and you go what was I yeah back then yeah I mean I used to come out like oh I used to dance a lot I was the hickory dance machine the hickory dance machine I would come out dancing really the crowds like okay the whole lot easier what kind of music what arrow is popular you know something from jock jams volume to you know snap I got the power oh yeah so I come out dance and I made up stupid little uh I do a shovel dance a rake dance and mob dance and then I would stop and do comedy and then I would get bored with myself and then I dance again in the middle this is what I was featuring and then I would dance again at the end hickory dance machine my favorite one though this was I'm actually proud of this dance it was any guy washing women's laundry in the 1800's dance it's very specific that's a guy what look at you oh it's turning it off look at it so he smells it well that's before the beard look at those chins look at that baby face yeah how are you back then oh this was a week ago I think Russia that's the theater in right outside a bakery a place in Lenore I don't like 700 people Wow yeah yeah out of shape right there where did you first start doing Stannah in Raleigh North Carolina Charlie goodnight that's a great spot it's one of that people love it it's like one of those clubs on the East Coast days yes it is yeah doesn't somebody buy that place yeah Brad it was Tommy Williams forever then he stole it - Brad Raider Brad reader sold it to the guys that own helium so that you know Philadelphia and Portland that Club chain so now they own it it's just called good nights now they took the Charlie off of us us it's still a great club I don't know charlie good night was some cow bland I think maybe they didn't like that what's wrong now boy am it Charlie's great but you played there before mm-hmm yeah a bunch times it's it's hard not to do great net Club but it's also can kind of you know ruin you in a weird way if you start out of the club where everyone kills all the time cuz you're thinking okay I've got this well it's been a week I've nailed it come on world what do you got and then you go to some other little shitty one-nighter it's like no no you can't dance there that's interesting like why do you think made it so good was that the dimensions of the room was it the crowd yes the Town Council town yeah sounds great it's a college town yeah it's also the capital yes you get a mix of like you know your your politicians your college professors your students and right outside of its the rest of the world so it's a mix of everything and it's really close to campus too so I don't know I think it's there just in that Club that was good at what they did you know like you go until one night or it's a bar like I remember the first time I did a gig outside of a comedy club it was just a bar there's a pool hall that had a comedy night and I went there a Wednesday and then me and I said I got walk-in were the comedians and they're looking like oh yeah so we're here for the show the comedians were like oh shit that's tonight huh all right trying to go get that amplifier so it's like there's a mug are you kidding me and then you have to tell people to stop playing pool so you can tell your jokes right away people hate you oh yeah I get people to stop playing pool go back to cut nice Wow yeah that was your first venture first one outside of a club was like a one-nighter pool hall Wow yeah that's a rough first one-nighter yeah yeah it luckily you know I only had to do like 10 minutes but I did that 10 minutes seemed like an hour Charlie good nights also was a club that had been around for so long that it's such a history yes there's so many comics this time felt everybody came through there yeah everybody I know everybody came to everybody so like the people that lived in that town they were used to good comedy that's right they got great comedy every week yeah and yeah the 80s was the heyday you know what else is like that zany is in Nashville that's my favorite comedy let's fuckin trade spot man my favorite one so far a Chinese god place is the shit yep I've been going there for years there's a lot of dead heat here in those walls problem yeah there's a fight ends yeah there's eight by tens of comics many of them there's a guy named Brian Kiley the no prank oh this is a different one oh I know the one you're thinking of the guy from Boston yeah that's a different one same name but he started in Nashville it's big big big guy right probably like five six hundred pounds and you know he's a polite guy he says hey I'd love to open for you and you know do the road and all that stuff I said sure you just show up at these gigs and you want to go up I'll let you I don't care and so it got to be a thing you know he did it he did a gig for me and right outside of my hometown and then that night he goes well I'm just gonna drive back to Raleigh tonight looks like a three-hour you know drive and he died on the way there some drunk driver hit him and he flipped his car and he didn't have a seatbelt on because he didn't have the extender he couldn't physically put it on and so I don't matter how big you are if you're flipping that car you're going out the window and so it killed him and his head shot hangs right there above that door and so that's one of many people on that wall there's no longer with us a lot of comedians dying yeah but that that when do you think that zany's was started I want to say in the 70s probably started Chicago yes zanny Chicago there's a real Dorfman's that's the Chicago one right that looks like yeah that's not yeah that's a weird angry that's a little Club that one yeah that one's not as great to me because it's long and boxing and the further you get back to the bar area the more chance you have to lose them back there yeah but it's so only 150 yeah yeah that's trying shit but but it's perfect you get the flanks it's it has a balcony right there at the top shout-out to the Dorfman's and everybody just has a good time at Zanies that's a great club yeah if everyone and then second favorite would be Denver I was bummed out when they lock Denver's fantastic but I was bummed out when they the punchline in Atlanta that was another one man they lost that one to a parking issue is that what it was yeah now when it was a nice shaped like a barn perfect yep it had a small balcony but they just packed people on top of each other yeah so you didn't have room to be you know on your phone or talking it was like you're right on top of people you had to walk through the crowd to get to the yeah to the stage you have got that one weird green room the whole time yeah well there's no bathroom that one weird green room yeah spot and then had that sign on the back wall that said quit trying to be Hicks yeah yes in the writing on the wall which is weird Atlanta cuz Rock kind of Hicks boom remember there was an upstairs area too we can leave town like it was about where the deejay was up there whatever he had like that's what our office was and they had like it's like the heckle that maybe like five people could sit up there yeah I did I did a good practical joke at that place one time there's this comedian named James Sibley great guy very funny southern did we were sharing a condo somewhere I think in Myrtle Beach and as a joke I thought I'd be funny when he's leaving to put a condom wrapper in his bag and so I did that right and then did this happen you know okay no but I get so he goes away I don't see him for a year two maybe three he's divorced now well the first thing he did this is Atlanta punchline he walked up to his like you motherfucker you know what you did to me help me got me divorced like it was this long thing I liked it I'm so sorry stupid it was just dumb I already had I wouldn't even planned out it was sitting right there I just do it in there haha maybe he'll find it when as he's packing to go home I didn't I didn't think yourself you know right so I felt really bad about it he goes I'm gonna get you back and I'm like okay and that stupid greenroom they have in that corner at the punch line right where you're sitting in there there's no access to a man's room or if you if he's poke your head out everybody can see like who's in there - what's going on - right so I'm sitting in there he goes alright here's what I'm gonna do when you go onstage cuz he was opening for me I'm gonna put mustard all over the doorknobs in here okay and you're gonna be in such a hurry to get out of there and go back to your stupid merch table that you don't even remember that I told you there's mustard all over this table and you're just gonna grab mustard on your head it wasn't as good as me getting him with the condom obviously but he was right like I go onstage he told you is good he told me he was going to do it I said cats have the bad gems not gonna happen and of course I grabbed it right away I was like okay he's still close alone yeah well not I mean as close as I can be but uh we're good we're fine did you have to talk to his wife no he's got a new life now I'm not gonna be one if it was it was the first step maybe so first down the first nail them that's right yeah and welcome you're welcome new eyes glass is half-full okay down everybody yeah welcome to why yeah yeah I was like God's plan that's right yeah where I was like going come on man in a lot of ways what if God was one of us he is it's me it's not a song is it it's who's saying that but if Jane Osbourne I think yeah you know what's really funny am i right yeah pretty close pretty clear you're not impressed with the speed of that I was very quick like a DJ from the nineties jock jams yeah whatever happened to that lady that was a good song yeah she had her nose pierced he had beautiful curly hair she just said listen this is not for me I'd rather be a hippie commune somewhere doing yoga every day maybe she's doing that probably what is she still out there still out there still making it everyday I'm hustling I love that one when I go to the that's on my playlist of working out I get on the treadmill everyday I'm hustling yeah that one gets me going Kenny I can't William started it though like when I saw Katt Williams do his bit I'm not like you can have any stupid job and if you hear that song you do the best you can at it right it was a great bit yeah and I'm like the way and that's where the first time I heard a song I like that yeah I'm Jocelyn oh you're on the treadmill Katt Williams has some all-time great bits yeah especially the earlier stuff all that pimp Chronicles stuff he says it's a murderer yeah shit's ordering he was coming up like white when he was starting to blow up his stuff was so good yeah it was so good he was so wait did he talk excited too and yeah really fun fun great comic so there's Rick Ross on my playlist and then I also do a soundtrack from Flash Gordon Queen you know you're the best no that's quite a kid but that was a soundtrack that was on there too yeah rocky obviously I'll go with movies that kind of inspired me when I was a kid and get that soundtrack and then I get on that elliptical machine and now I'm doing the elliptical you know for the universe like Flash Gordon you letting motherfuckers know I'm saving the planet ever watched the old Flash Gordon from the 1950s no I saw was the cheap shitty one in the 80s I was on a plane not really recently I guess a couple years ago and they had one of those video catalogs so you could just watch stuff yeah I think was an international flight yeah and it had old TV shows and it had Flash Gordon yeah I watched a bunch of episodes of Flash course his wives again it was weird it's weird to watch yeah it's weird to watch what people thought like space was gonna be like aliens it's so strange yeah I mean I think Flash Gordon was probably from the 50s right it was a comic book was it yes yeah it's originally a comic book so you can get pull up video of they need to remake that family photos of the green room and the punchline I was looking for that Hix lion-o we've showed that before I wish they would remake Flash Gordon and make it a comedy but keep the soundtrack because it's Queen no human rights these huge queens huge right now keep the exact same soundtrack make Flash Gordon a comedy Jack Black get what are you thinking of a Flash Gordon the movie yeah the movie that's that I'm sorry a movie wait wait wait there's the original flash board with Ming the Merciless may the mother look at them tonight Istanbul like look at him how where does he look look it flash like that's what they thought people gonna be wearing weird neck collars in the future belt buckles I like it's such a strange look man it's just a lightning bolt on your chest if you pull up a video of it so we could watch a video cuz it's so it's so weird to watch because it looks like what years it's a 50 64 255 Wow Ming the Merciless so this is where he like it's so shitty like the special effects were so this is not even the movie this is I know I mean I'm saying the claim jumpers steve holland does Flash Gordon Irene Champlin Dale Hardin look she's hot she's hot in a real way yeah there was no name no faking it back then dr. zharko yeah same care I've not seen this though so this was a whole TV show yeah how many episodes do you think they made if I had a guess I bet they made 50 or something yeah look at that she's hot got that shirt she is hot see that's how you look at good looks like a drill yeah no she's long ago drill women back then all had flat butts unless they did gymnastics that's right unless there's some freak of nature accident uh-huh and that that is some sort of weird ylva stupid that's a jackhammer that you know what the hell jammer looks like that Tim Tam that their gun that's what it looks like what is that thing this is a things I do it's for massage oh shit [Music] may i yes probably shouldn't do it right in front of ona microphone like idea it's great it doesn't hurt yeah true good for loosening up muscles yeah bro that's what they had good lord yeah that's their weapon but to me it wasn't punch you in the face real fast it's always weird seeing what what people thought the future was gonna be like once the Futurity hits yeah cuz if you think of that movie alien I didn't we figure that out it was like 2015 or something like that they thought the first one was in 2000 was this whole yeah yeah like the future yeah it was 2015 yeah it was something along yeah it is weird now like it well back to the future is classic you know their future was what was it - what was the future because it happened in 1985 mm-hm and they went to in the second when they went to the future but it was like mm wasn't it oh no no it's like 2015 or something right yeah suddenly what befell is the billionaire now yeah cuz he took that stupid sports Almanac and bet on a bunch of shit I watched that a couple of years ago at a movie theater in Bozeman Montana with my family they had like a Back to the Future night where they were playing it the old classic movie yeah what's up it's so good it's especially cool to see an old movie in a movie theater I can know they do those sometimes at certain movie theaters we'll have like they'll screen an old movie yeah it's fucking I went to the Hollywood Bowl and watched Back to the Future with and they had an orchestra playing live the soundtrack you know the movie as it's happening and you kind of forget that that's that shit's happening right now yeah we do that every year we go to see The Nightmare Before Christmas oh yeah they do that yeah oh yeah it's great you ever go to the cemetery watch a movie no forever I did a show there once though he did yeah Duncan Trussell used to host a show yeah love him so we're outside no inside the song inside place we just stand up okay it was real weird yeah we did that way at the 70s concerts there and shit yeah yeah well that's what they have that one gigantic white wall that just project movies and everyone sits on the lawn it's like 5,000 people how weird is that I watch Purple Rain Cemetery look at that I watched screamed yes super weird screamed the arm

and after the movie and well it dresses up like characters from the film wow yeah it's awesome have you seen proper rain in the movie lately no that's great is it no it's yes I know yes and that acting is so bad I mean great sarcastically ah Prince it said it so funny when he there's this one when he first makes his full face on film right and then the movie it takes a minute there's this one scene where Apollonia is walking off he's mad and he's just like whips around real fast his hair comes and does that and that everybody in that in the cemetery was watching this in front like 5000 people every girl's like this guy was four foot one but it was 18 pounds kind of changed music yeah I was a huge fan yeah I saw this one in a theory came out was the first time that like a French
