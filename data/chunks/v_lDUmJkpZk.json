alright here we go Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight but we wish we were brought to you by wd-40 cuz Brian I think our shit is constantly squeaking so we would be like hear all that it's really the springs the springs of the problem but I wonder if like just a little splash of wd-40 wouldn't save the day Joe maybe it would maybe it wouldn't maybe we just smell like a garage in here then you know I thought you guys need a free case of that a pre k CW check it out and then maybe a little bit of sponsors I think the reality of the uncensored nature of this podcast makes it very problematic for anybody to want to be professionally associated with I don't know if I go to my dad's garage he has a fucking Pamela Anderson poster on the wall and he has all these wd-40 products they have like these wd-40 pens now where it's just like if you just want to dab something like the fleshlight yeah I'll be deportees a lubricant you imagine do this you imagine what kind of damage your duty a dick if you fuck the flashlight more wd-40 no does that shit all day that's all everything that's squirt Rick spot in his hair is it's from juicing all over his fucking head wd-40 squirting out the tip of the photos got black loads oil like loads it's been around cars too long do you imagine if you love cars so much that you really tried to jerk off to gasoline you ly try to pour gas in your hand and beat off with it I mean it is like a lubricant right it's liquid oh great smell could you jerk know that we have to be unbelievably painful right you realize you're pitching some sort of extreme reality show like what can you check off with yeah and it's a combination yeah of some perverted show and like name that tune like I can jerk off with gasoline Joe Rogan hook up with that gasoline no I can I can just get a fucking band-aid on like a few second coming three strokes ha ha ha yeah how many ages that didn't take only how many minutes how many minutes three minutes into this what if you had a race to come ready go there's a fucking camera on you you're alone in a fucking white room and you you don't get to watch it what he else beat off so you have to the man engine and it's for a million guys who the people who get a lot on that are people who always fantasized about being in a room with just a kid yeah if your shows always turned me on I don't know what it was if you're a freak reality star gay dude that would probably be a good gig for you you could probably like win that contest the quickest all right yeah cuz you know you would really be worried that guys watching you beat off or like athletes who don't freeze up in like game sevens can take the big shot they don't care they with all that attention I was watching some documentary on prison and there was one dude who claimed that he had an affair with there was a female prison guard and he wound up fucking this female prison guard and some some shit went on she got in trouble for it Wow the guy apparently he could make his dick hard and ejaculate all without touching himself that's how much free time that dude had that dude was in jail for so long he figured out a way about game though yeah to be in the prison cell you know she's fucking with their career her ability to mortgage still got it mmm I mean did that trick you know I think he showed her that I think he showed her that I bet she just couldn't take it I mean that was like the ultimate pimp move you're in a cage locked up in a cage and you can make yourself nut all over yourself and it's so hot that the guard the one person who is she's free she just works there she just works around you and you're sucking up what did he do for a crime I don't know I wish I had all the details of the story or the not it was actually true you know I mean she could have just made that shit up that's a pretty extraordinary thing is there a guy who can do that I've seen guys below themselves I didn't know if it was I night I earlier the guy who uh we went we went to a titty bar uh and Deonte he got a lap dance he was just looking at it he got so turned on he blew it in his pants and I laughed he didn't tell me until like weeks later and it was one of the hardest I have a left because he was laughing he had a great sense of humor about himself so dude it was just one of those fucking you're just crying laughing like it was the first wave of what fucking away and he was like dude I don't know how I was just sitting there is like a pothead I just sitting I don't know I just came this pants anyway this

Rd Papa bill burr good to see you buddy what's going on good to see you too sir fucking awesome to have you come down here again always always a good time and you were telling a fucking hilarious story about eating a pot brownie about how fucked up a guy yeah yeah guess this is the story that you told on our first podcast but I forgot it but it's fucking hilarious it's true kids don't don't just don't just eat pot that shit is way stronger than smoking pot four to five times more psychoactive yeah nobody told me that the person I didn't know and yeah so I had two and a half I have a sweet tooth you know no I had one she had half a one right she had half a one then I ate her other half I don't remember then there was another half left I threw that you cuz because she was getting high and I wasn't feeling anything and then we got in a car went to Newark Airport to go fly at Costa Rica and by the time I got there dude it was it was it was insane I was like borderline like hallucinating dude the the eating of it is like if you go back to like early literature on hash eating like what would the kind of things that people are describing when they were eating hash these incredible psychedelic experiences people don't realize that's not just like getting hot you're not just like smoking a little reefer and kicking back and hey this movies kind of vantes fucking pizza tastes so good now now you ate two pot brownies well you probably should eat a quarter of one of them cuz they're fucking notoriously strong nobody ever when was the last time you ever heard of anybody getting like really shitty brownies seven days ago seven days ago you heard him I getting shitty brownie I got shitty bran where I think there were mushroom brownies oh you just got them from a dude some guy just gave it to me at a fucking show and then I felt like I was tripping crazy you're eating things people just giving you a chance like Jim Morrison shit walking down the street eating whatever anybody gives you yeah The Dispatch I go to a dispensary that I trust and there you get used to whatever they're they're sort of labeling is you know but when you gotta ask them like what like what do you do really is happy frontier yeah I don't know like like governmental sticker that's on there like this is you know 4.5% well then alcohol it gets silly because they have like exes like when especially baked goods see them with marijuana if it's just marijuana the smoke it's pretty obvious you know it's all even if it's really strong marijuana it's still you know what you're smoking you know what the size of it is you know how much THC is going to get in there from a bowl or a joint when you eat something they have these weird labels on them like 5x + 3 X but X is there's no real X it's not like x equals 10 milligrams it's just they're just making it up so it doesn't mean a ya know this smellin when you guys smoked it took me back to that fucking hotel now it gives up all set up it'd be like if you have a puked on a drink you know to me like a long time ago I one of the worst I ever puked was drinking rum and cokes and for like 25 years I never I never had another rum accrue not 25 when we talking about that old like 20 years you just smelled it and it would just make just just immediately associated with pooping outside you know underage drinking is oh shit so when I smelled that stuff Moses like Ruth I had one of those I with Jack Daniels for a long time Oh fuckin that the first time I got drunk I got drunk with some friends in high school and oh my god I didn't had no idea what I was doing I mean it's just no I got a drink Oh Daniel yeah yeah at a party with a bunch of my friends that were all - we're all like serious stoners but I I wouldn't smoke pot because I was doing martial arts and I thought that pot was a drug and pot would fuck you up but I would drink every now and then with them and the first time I ever did it was oh my god that's crazy gusting Lee blasted Ontrack tails I was Old Milwaukee just in comparison some like my dad Rose couple of screws and I drank like a third I'm like am I drunk yeah there's no way or do we do jack did you up in her car I threw up in a taxi hair taxicab throw up in the back seat of the cab I was fucking horrible I could barely remember it he went when I talk about something that happened when I was like 14 or whatever the hell it doesn't seem like I'm telling the truth you know I mean it's it seems like I kind of have a memory of that but boy is it fucking fuzzy you know if I had to describe to you like moments in high spike it was so long ago long fucking time ago man I'm 44 now when I look back when I was 14 I don't really remember what the fuck happened back there I remember a few things I could tell you where we lived tell us three we lived on but if I like try to get specific with I went back to where I grew up the other day and it was it was really fascinating man went back to the house and where I were well when I went to high school that that era in my life and everything looked different than I imagined it was it was a very strange it was like man my memories of this shit or blurry as fuck like you can start pulling them when you go back to towns then like you go oh yeah member this is where we did this oh yeah this is what we do that hey they'll they'll start pulling back because you could have been that you you went back home I would have been a long fucking time I moved out of Boston and probably 90 91 maybe 92 so you have been back in like 21 years yeah been I had been back just every now and then to do gigs like Boston itself made sense to me but then I went to Newton where I grew up and I went like the house where I used to live I went and looked at that I was like wow this is crazy yeah this is strange done that come back to houses when I was a kid you thought the front yard was like nine miles you can make it to the front door in two steps that's why when you were kid you thought it snowed more it's cuz you were a midget your little fucking record every snowstorm was up to your waist you know I think that's good for you I think it's good to grow up in a place where it snows to have a little respect for nature University we grew up in Boston man in Boston you fucking respected nature for six months out of the year for six months out of the air you knew what the fuck was going on if you had a flat on the side of the road you might die yeah okay how about that how about that and now you could be out on your way to Mansfield they don't they don't find you in time the State Patrol you know but the payroll hit by some guy driving by yeah that's it that happened to a friend of mine from high school dad who's changed the entire guy hit the car and killed him oh yeah fuck that man and bring up a bad memory yeah good being convicted of drinking and driving I had to go to Mothers Against Drunk Driving meeting and I was all paranoid he's gonna be like 10 mother's screaming at me about what a piece of shit I was and when I went there was the exact opposite it was like 200 drunks sitting there and some woman trying to tell the story about her kid while all these fucking drunks bitched about their cases to her going like I only blew a point away and she stand up they go well you know you probably should discuss that with the with the judge so johnny was changing his tire after practice it was fucking not I was a watershed moment for me because I couldn't judge him I was like I am in this demographic of fucking idiots it was it's like I am a 22 year old freshman in college I'm a fucking loser and like within 12 months I started doing stand-up and I got away from all of that crap but you don't drink at all anymore right no I do you do I do I took a year you're in two days off I wish I didn't start back up it's just a bad habit I mean I don't get like you know but uh I love it I love drinking I love getting hammered I hate I hate the next day how I feel yeah but uh I like all that shit I like all I mean all this shit that's bad for you I like it yeah it's a very unfortunate that next day feeling you know you got to switch the waters at some point that's not when you become a professional but like that just still doesn't really have been really help I got one buddy wrecked in yourself yeah I understand I mean none of it's good I do bad shows if I'm hungover I don't like my shows they don't feel good they don't have the flow to them you know and III just I hate that feeling I hate the feeling of being on stage and it's it wouldn't be my fault if I was hungover if I was hungover on stage like it's my fault that I'm working it like 3/4 speed right now or it's not clicking right now like that so well I wish I could just have one but it's not satisfying because you have one and then you want a hundred and then and then you drink a hundred and then you feel like shit and like if I just drink one like I've have one at lunch then it's like I I want to go take a nap it really easy got to keep going if I keep going I can go for like you know a good hardcore four or a gentleman six and then I'm done but like I yeah you I feel pulled to it no is it like golem in the ring no I don't know what that means I just - yes I just go fresh no no no like wants us to take it's precious yes I don't you know what that is I don't you didn't see the Lord of the Rings you didn't see the Lord the ring I went to one of those and it was so fucking long and every time they would they would fade to black I'd be like just roll the credits roll the credits and then they would open up on some big field and it's just like Jesus get the fucking thing back to the guy so we can get out of here I hate I you know what I fucking hate all those movies and I fucking pay people don't have a sense of humor about the bullshit that they watched when they were kids like adults who talk about star wars like it isn't a fucking room with a movie now when you watch it I mean like how bizarre ball it's what I was making for the other night the other night I came home I got I guess I got free free cinemax which is the greatest fucking channel ever they either with it 24 hours a day they're either showing the greatest movie ever or the worst fucking movie ever and it's all compelling as I watch like nine movies in a row like fucking channels unbelievable so I ended up flipping up uh because lady Knight they just had some sort of you know softcore porn which is ridiculous now when you have the Internet so just was redundant so I got off of that so I went onto vh1 uh and and they were playing this to show metal mania and I was watching all these bands and these videos that I just thought was fucking sick and they're into the devil dude I was just by the end of it I was like how was this better than disco like why did disco get so much shit like I'm not talking about like the Iron Maiden's the Metallica's but you know what I'm talking about that middle of the fucking ground those people with the spiked fucking gloves and all this stupid shit and Rahmi you just it was horseshit it was fucking I watched it it was the dumbest shit of it was embarrassing that I I mean I know granted I had all of that music still on my ipod I'm not I'm not above it but if someone were from this generation would come back and tell me that music was awful and was stupid I would laugh there's like there's no way I could defend isn't it weird I mean you look at like if you look at music or you look at movies that's like one of the clearest examples of like some sort of evolution or progress is going on with humans because like the the movies of the past like so many of them are there so clunky and the style of communicating is so artificial it looks it's it's such a shit you know representation of life in comparison to a real good move until the system once they figured out you know like just acting on film like those people just learning how to do it so everything was was gonna be not you know like I got very yeah that type of acting had to go away with the Brando's in the James Dean's and those guys and then you had to have like the there's a couple would like this movies back there like Jack Lemmon the apartment well the Hustle is way ahead of his time that the hustler I say my name is Stanley Kubrick yeah that type of shit there was some delivery don't hold up though but the bad movies from the 60s in the 70s you know watch like try to wash like jaws 3d oh yeah that that's Apple this is this a bit but they've always had they still have movies on shore I mean oh yeah I think a lot of shore to this day that transformer shit even though I didn't see it but if you say I never I never vibe with sci-fi people like sci-fi listeners I always get trashed by them because I just don't I just don't get unless you don't get sci-fi at all know if it's like aliens like it has to be high quality like alien does like the good fellows of that side like on like top-shelf sci-fi I'm gonna be the Blade Runner aliens and that type of shit but if I'm just gonna go wat you know oh we're in Hoth I mean what the fuck that's from what is Hoth is that that's a Star Wars thing and I don't know what that yeah like one of those fucking things was the action figures of shit it's just did you like transformers about it I didn't like I didn't like Chewbacca you know I did I didn't get you Baca it's like dude you're a Pacific fucking awesome gotta have a rise huge imagine you could party with Bigfoot I would totally party but he should be ripping somebody's arms off he's shooting a gun like he's a fuck he's like he's well he's a badass limit is how to shoot guns - we have rippling bucking arms up but he can also shoot you from a distance bitch she's limited oh I liked you lost our were sea I would totally hang out you know what did I give you I didn't like about him he was a follower well started he started hanging out with all the humans next thing you know he's sitting upright in chairs right right sipping little juicy juices right yeah I want if he can understand us could they understand him they can speak that caballo yeah I think it was a language that we just didn't understand it so that's same fucking thing every time not that many wookies you know it's like Chewbacca and like there's no other famous one he was like the dodo bird I was know weird we're gonna be destroyed on Twitter because we are Star Wars knowledge sucks and there's a fucking million wookies there is a nation of wookies there's a federation of wookies you know not what you're talking about there's nothing better than just just having a gig fucking 10% knowledge of businesses criticizing them because it's just driving some kid nuts if you look at old TV shows like father knows best and then you know watch was something good today with the office or it is the office good that's what you're supposed to say I watched it I think it's good I hadn't watched the sitcom in years I haven't watched anything since maybe Larry Sanders I just watch sports Larry Sanders and unless unless unless something huge happened fucks his name Larry David Larry David Jesus Claire day I was watching some classic Seinfeld last night that shit is fucking awesome by the way that was an awesome show Larry Sanders I don't know why I pulled that out of my ass yeah but yeah yeah amazing show Seinfeld remember that that episode where Elaine everytime showed to the doctor that doctor wrote down notes about her and then I only saw a few Seinfeld quite honestly maybe saw like five or six of them ever for whatever reason cuz you were headlining and you were on a hit sitcom I was not on a hit sitcom I was on a sitcom that was like number 84 and the ratings when news radio was on it did terrible it was terrible in the ratings I did good when it was in good time slots but they moved us around nine times over five years so there was nobody ever got cocky everybody's like camp fuck it was always that there was always that good show that they just kept moving around like the creators were like losing their fucking minds but you guys made syndication alright yeah it did but barely it's kind of funny we only did 98 episodes you're supposed to have a hundred for syndication I'm pretty sure we only had 98 put it but how does that work about checks now for like three cents does it still work like it was a halfway decent I judge well yank that on air no it's okay you the people people think you get really rich from it the people that get rich from it or the people that own it so if they said if you own the show you sell be like the actors then they're going to get compensated they get compensated very well but it's not like but a showrunner make so when people see like oh he's in syndication he's rich not not necessarily at all because it seems like the stuff I do the first time you get paid it's great next time they cut it in half on the second running and then all of a sudden then you suck it in check see dollar 30 but when you Tim Allen or someone like that who has a home improvement then you know he owns I'm sure he must have owned a chunk of that show so when that shit goes to syndication you just fuck it rake it in it was worth it for him I guess to stop doing stand-up for a long time I know I shouldn't speak out of turn because I don't know if this is really true that's just what I had heard was that Tim Allen it was a very good stand-up you ever watched Tim Allen back in the day that's what I heard he's a very good stand-up and you know a fun guy to watch he was fun and but he's show was like just a little rowdy you know just not not dirty not really you know wasn't like Kinnison or anything like that but I guess it was too too rowdy for the show they were saying look you're gonna be on home improvement you know you should tone that shit down and you should you should stop performing right you're out there and you you know you're saying crazy things about drills and hammers and you know you got to go some trouble so this probably wasn't the shit about the drills and hammers I imagine it was the shit about BMO Jail fucking Michigan or whatever that's all this oak yeah that I want what I would want to hear yeah well that was a weird thing when I when you hear about that they like well you could you go to jail and then wind up on TV that's pretty fuckin badass know when you get out of jail is to cue to get into sales or show business yeah those the only two places they don't give a fuck I had to guy up night well you know do like five bring up the next it was a dude that we knew from Rhode Island that he got a deathless stick I'm just thinking about this car right now do you know Eddie Galvin now from Rhode Island was he gone by the time you were uh you were coming in Galvin yeah I would remember the guy if I get beat to death no no he didn't get me to death he'd beat a guy to death oh heck I'm sure I'm saying his name right he was a really funny guy though he was one of those Brian Holtzman type guys there was just like comics would you like get into the back of the room to watch him when he would go on stage just go jesus fucking christ he just say that he was a crazy dude who did he beat to death Oh some guy I don't know another story I don't know I don't know what happened I might not even write Jesus do what that what did you smoke before this is so random no I'm just don't know if that happened if I shut up you just thought at Rhode Island in this whole movie started playing in your head what's a thought people beating people to death what's a famous movie that was shot in Rhode Island where someone gets beat to death I bet that's just playing in his head right now that's what he's remembered you ever see Friends of Eddie Coyle is that it I saw that the the Mitchum movie Robert Mitchum what a fucking great movie I was hungry I what's-his-face from Everybody Loves Raymond is in it right yes Peter a Peter Boyle yeah put it Peter Boyle yeah I just saw it in the past year all of a sudden like resurfaced Peter Boyle was a fucking amazing actor holy shit was that guy could that's a great movie that is a really good movie I like those kinds of movies I kind of shit I still like if I buy something on DVD yeah I'm gonna buy like the Dirty Dozen yeah I've never since seven like that era you know what I bought the other day LeMans with Steve McQueen yeah god damnit I used to come out once a year they would play that on either TV 38 or WL VI channel 56 I was saying this shit cuz I know you grew up that area and I would I watched all those guys all that Bronson Lee Marvin yeah Clint Eastwood all of that shit and was on a rotation the same time every year that they would play like the eight o'clock movie Steve McQueen did you ever wash it you've seen the moms yeah there was like parts in that movie for like oh like 5-10 minutes where no one said a word yeah for like 10 minutes like you watch the movie they're changing tires they're setting things up people go and get a cup of coffee all this shit is taking place no one's talking at all like wow this is like a different era it's a different world yeah that's when the directors took over the world of like Stanley Kubrick you know the world of 2001 a space you know before that whole movement happened that back in the day like the director all the director did for the most part was just make sure that you were in frame Rianne that you said everything you said in the second you rapped on the movie the studio took it and they edited the thing Wow and it wasn't until I don't know I'm really speaking out of turn because I don't know about as much about this as I do about Star Wars but like somewhere in the 60s is when the directors started taking over going like no this is my fucking film I'm going to edit this and we want to do it this way those sort of the first wave of that and when that happened that's when you had all the dust on Apocalypse Now yeah oh that was sort of me that later that was ten years after yeah but that kind of attacks that kind of movie that's where that comes from and that would that was like that during that time like art was ridiculous the music you have tail into the Beatles going on those directors were taken over and then you know Richard Pryor was like finding his voice and like stand-up was coming out to the forefront like that whole era in an artist is incredible yeah what is funny but then they just you know that 70s show they just boil it down to like la belleza that's like it was a little more interesting shit going on back then I mean I know I know it's just a sitcom but I'm just saying you know they do the early 70s is Nixon resigning and the late 70s is everybody doing coke listening to disco and then like well that's that decade now we're into the eighties how about Michael JJ Fox picture I remember when Nixon was president do you remember mm-hmm mmm when I was a kid listen to him crying on the radio when he stepped down first Kent State and then Watergate like has there ever been a more fucked up crooked guy shooting at fucking college students Johnson was in opposite no that was using those next so he wasn't there with the rifles was he he probably was it's probably his idea was son of a bitch he probably wanted to silence these fucking punk kids mm-hmm next time was a creepy dude man he was the fact that you're so paranoid that you fucking record yourself having conversations like what what you thought was going to happen to you I think losing to Jack Kennedy just fucked with his head yeah because I guess he blew him away in the debates on the radio but if you watched it on TV Jack was sitting there looking like a movie star looking like fucking Tony Curtis sitting there looking like some guy waiting to get his teeth cleaned it is true when people will vote for looks no he went from almost winning the presidency to his entire career being fucking over he then lost I think the governor race or something like that in California and he was completely out of office and they were like that's it game set match and like within four years I don't know what happened signed a deal with the devil that guy was in in office Lyndon Johnson was growing his hair going crazy and Nixon slid in Bobby Kennedy got whacked did I kill you that they just fucking knock down the Ambassador Hotel like they just don't give a fuck about history out here yeah that's where I was in Dallas they would have like an entire like they would like the entire block would be preserved do you think it's an embarrassment you think that's why they knocked it down because that's what Kennedy was shot no because I think they deal with everything I find it frustrating out here because III it's it's very hard to feel grounded out here with just the end endless like strip malls if there's like a piece of history right as a way to be like okay this is from then and this is what happened and then this happened and now we're here this is the steak house where John Gotti shot Paul Castellano that take a shit like in New York they Triangle Shirtwaist Fire and they get a little plaque they got all that shit you can kind of be like there's a bunch of Native Americans buried under here the Astor's got a bunch of blood money and now they have a subway stop and after them Cooper Union that type of shit but you're out here and it's just like you know like they had like you know before 9/11 like the big the biggest like act of terrorism like you know blowing up a building people jump into the death and shit was the first LA Times Bill and it's not the one that's there it somebody blew it up at like 2:00 in the morning at the turn of the century and there's not I can't find it on the fucking Internet where it was I don't know what's there there's no plaque there's no nothing go fuck yourself burn down here's the new one Wow that's it yeah yeah that's true there's not much of a sense of history here I mean there's like the Chinese Theatre all right that's the big thing Mann's Chinese Theater that's like a little they'll knock that Ambassador Hotel I guarantee you there's like a Burger King sitting on top they don't give it a Staples it's just I don't know that's the one thing out here that I that fucks with me after a while we filmed fear factor there we filmed an episode there I remember being weirded out you know you went to it yeah I was something I never went yeah I walked through the kitchen I walked through where he got shot yeah what what was going on at that time was it was it shut down well yeah it's uh they rented out to for filming they rented out to people make movies there and they were there making TV shows how how creepy was that I would have loved it was bizarre I would I wish I had known I wish I don't think I knew you then but if I had known or you weren't here then I think I was living in New York I'd met you but if you I fight yeah if I knew someone was like a crazy Kennedy freak that's all no no just a history like that type of stuff what I mean about that but that's the I come on man that's Lisa would you ever go through that place in Dallas - have you ever driven through woolley brazo weird right no stood out that was too much they preserved and that you feel like it's weird that you're not in black and white yes as you're walking around I mean they literally I've never been there - your listeners the entire block is this just watch was it the film yeah that's one in color you're gonna you're gonna see you're gonna you're going to see those buildings I mean the same color the whole thing yeah it's a it's a real mind fuck - yeah there's a block away it's 2012 and you go there and it's November 1963 Bill Hicks had a great fucking joke about that place he goes uh you go to up to the Book Depository and he goes and I tried to do a Bill Hicks action and he goes and they have it marked off and it looks exactly the way it did in 1960 was it three yeah Charlie goes 1963 why cuz I was not err yeah I was not there either that's hilarious they don't let you look out the windows as he walks in oh so I'm the Patsy that's the one yeah that always sends a chill you know baby no me dude I think everything is bullshit I think the anti a is fixed definitely a most things so most obvious pieces of bullshit and you know what some fucking sports are fixed man that's reality there's a lot of money be eight the NBA had a mobbed-up ref and then they did an in-house investigation and then they did the Oswald I acted alone nothing to see here and they found how'd they catch the guy uh how did not how did they do that a Ferrari you know what I don't even know I just remember our it came on the news and you know all gamblers were all yelling I fucking knew it I knew it I knew this shit was fixed and I think they try to say it was just him and I you know I'm not saying they all are I'm just saying like look I was compared to this like like do remember when you had a day job and shit if two people were hooking up on the down-low how long did it take it to figure they thought nobody knew you could tell by their body language you could tell what the fuck they were doing you can't tell me you're on an NBA officiating team and you can't tell somebody's is fixing games how many times okay it was kind of weird tonight then he's weird again and then weird again I'll send you gotta be like this guy is uh I don't know if you're sitting in the crowd and you could notice I just don't think another professional referee can't notice I think it's uh they're investigating it right now I heard one guy yeah well I mean we already went to jail he's already in jail oh they already talking about I thought you're talking about the PAC fight nevermind oh no no no no we weren't talking about that but we've gone to I'm going to I was going to ask you what do you think about Pacquiao Bradley was that fixed that was the worst decision I've ever seen in the history of boxing never seen such a bad decision I didn't watch it but here's my my I don't know shit about the fight game believe it or not to look at me I don't know anything about it but I find it amazing that someone could come in at his light of weight put on 40 pounds not lose any speed be actually be stronger like I don't know how how do you do that I don't know okay you gotta talk to him about all that I wouldn't I would never that guy deep he'd headbutt me then sing me a song and then wait for me to wake up and kick the shit on me again right what do you need explosive looking for my phone oh did you leave it in the bathroom no that was one that's what I was worried about I'm sorry I panicked well I I think I think yeah I think the NBA is just as filthy as boxer do you what did you see - watch the boxing match did you see the Pacquiao Bradley fight no I didn't but I've watched boxing I see what happens the only fight where I've never never heard of a fight before where I haven't met a single person - thought Bradley one not one person I mean they must be out there so what's the reason for doing it - just make a bunch of money on a rematch eight for a rematch the ring cos they don't think Mayweather is gonna have this is yes Mayweather is in jail right now yeah and look if I not eating yeah from what I heard oh really like on like a hunger strike yeah like let me out of here or I'm not gonna or I'm gonna die is no I could tell look real I have an AM radio in my truck I I went under a bridge halfway through that story so I don't know I don't know that's hilarious that's what it sounded like they were longer cuz cuz the the prosecuting attorney was like well what he thinks he's in prison this isn't the four seasons well see there's our rumors get started in bars by shitheads like me who have like fucking half the information they need and then they just started pontificating to someone on the Internet who's took it taken a couple of hits and you'll back me up oh yeah totally dude dude I'm telling you I'm just happy to be in the conversation yeah dude yeah I bet that's exactly how they did it there you need to listen to the first half of it cuz you're freaking out about your phone well Bob I know that Bob Arum and Floyd Mayweather did not get along and Bob Arum was Pacquiao's promoter and Floyd Mayweather tried to make some sort of a deal with them but he didn't want to do 5050 like they were having a hard time bargaining it out but if I was a promoter and I was a crooked guy and I was trying to fix something that would be like the perfect fight to fix because there's nobody else that's interesting out there now that Mayweather's in jail so who else is interesting for him to fight if you were a mastermind it is if you if you wanted answer together a conspiracy I'm convinced exactly it would be a bit it's a brilliant money-making move and you gotta admire them really now everybody wants to watch Pacquiao get his revenge exactly don't I mean I think the NBA's the same way I think they have that guys that they want in the ring they finesse it yeah finesse live and I also bet that Pacquiao I bet there's probably some verbage in his contract that changes you know how much money gets based on whether or not he's a champion based on whether or not he wins or loses I mean I would imagine did you do something maybe not maybe eat me he's such a draw maybe that's nonsense why would they gamble something like that I think that I I like your theory that they would try and keep it interesting I think that's exactly what I would do if I was a corrupt guy I'm not saying that they did that but I'm saying look if I was like some dude in a Batman comic book that was manipulating I got this plastic world and the bite down and I think it's like that dude it's a business it's a business and you had you had a major asset just get taken off the table yeah what can we do to keep excitement but keep it spicy going like that yeah and I think like did you hear today on on Jim Rome he asked David Stern if the NBA lottery was fixed I know it doesn't mean shit to you what is the NBA lottery and real lottery is like basically in most sports if you have the worst record when the draft comes around all the new talent comes out of college or whatever you get first pick so that way that the worst teams can get better and it creates some sort of parity mmm in theory keeps them you know but the NBA to make it more exciting they have a lottery so like that the lower ten or whatever the fuck it is they all get a they all get a shot at possibly being number one so then they put a bunch of ping-pong balls into the thing and then they pull it out like the Massachusetts State fucking lottery whoa and they do that for whatever reason like and some people think that they do it so every like three four years when there's a serious guy coming out who's going to be like a Pacquiao level guy but like a like a basketball player as far as like a drawing power of a Pacquiao and they have a major market that's hurting they manipulate it where like you know they're good like the first year they did it all of a sudden New York City which had the worst chance of winning it they wanted and then they got Patrick Ewing which was great for hoop like that that's something if they do manipulate that I'm just thinking you know that's just a good business plan you know but anyway so this guy Jim Rome asked him he asked him if it was fixed which is a fuckin and hilarious and insane question to ask the Commissioner of basketball like he's gonna be like yeah you know what it is but he asked it right and and I guess Stern freaked out and when he said how could you even ask me that he said Jimmy asked you this he goes when did you stop beating your wife oh so everybody takes that literal that I guess that I know I never heard that I guess it's some old-school expression that that what he's really doing is he's criticizing your question by saying when did you stop beating your wife is the insinuation is that you're already beating your wife here I totally innocent so Jim Rome didn't beat his wife right he threw it at him like that saying that's what you're doing to me right now Wow what kind of hidden fucking stanley kubrick symbolism is that I don't know and once again once again say I have not heard the audio oh Jesus cries driving over on my radio on the AM radio going under bridges and this is what I heard this is all what I heard you know I heard they found Sasquatch now this one thing about me though I admit that I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about it cuts down on so many angry emails and it also makes people feel good about themselves most people think they're as full of shit as I am but they but they never have that honest moment with themselves well you're full of shit Nesta art creates comedy you know yeah by being the butt of the joke I know how it works think I don't know how my dress how my bread's buttered I got my voice down on the fucking idiot I make people feel smarter than they really are I set the bar low Joe oh it's not a bad move I really like how you're rocking it yeah I shouldn't be here I said I should have died of an appendicitis in 1980 really but they had enough medicine to keep me going I'm one of the weak Joe I shouldn't be here oh yeah weak yeah I'm gonna B's I feel be allowed yeah I think that that's why you like did this sea of fucking morons that's out there that's what it is it's it's all the penicillin that's available if you just you just brought it back a little bit you know I think we'd have a lot more shining stars out there they'd see people driving better if there was more disease if you just let the weak die off and I know I'm not going to make the cut well I think there's only so much chicken there's only so much water out there we just weave out fucked all of it but that's a terrible decision because it's it's often timing there's there's a weird balance to the way life works and when you say the week often it's those week that are inventing fucking IMAX those are the ones that are figuring out how to make your internet faster and more G phone if they want to come up with that I don't think they would have a problem you could leave those fucking sword-swinging dudes you could leave them alone for a million years come back they'd still be hacking each other to death with swords then I do I'm not painting with one color here I'm saying the best of the best of the IMAX guys the best of the best of the the guys who will beat you down I think that the dream team of human beings is what I'm talking about hit one what I'm saying is the physically weak often are lots of people when they fucking aliens show up the guys who've got action an actual game plan those are the guys we're gonna figure out how not to get on that spaceship and get eaten and isn't this obvious joke this is I'm dumb well if I was locking right down the street here if I was living another plan I want a food source people would be a good one you know we're like fucking rats on a sinking ship we're everywhere I know just grant also and I would come here for we would be like a nice steak house a little fat marble people would be the best we're well fed you know like is that a corn-fed of you this one's from Texas yeah so some Houston would be like the Kobe beef people market beans this is a 100% vegan diet got the guy ate nothing but plants no nothing but plants that would be that would be like the edamame of human beings if he ate one of those guys cannibalism everybody the Joe Rogan experience well we know the chimps eat monkeys chimp see dude and they have the fucking assholes about it I hate chimps I fucking can't stand a man i watch this fucking shit arey this chip ripped his fucking they had this dad this whole thing I know you've seen this you watch all of this shit they were basically I don't know what they did they set a trap yeah they steal that one and they had they had the infrared thing whether you could see where the chimps were going and they had really scary yeah it's like they chased him down the street except it was in trees yeah and they had two of their Tufts hang in there and they basically drove this monkey bait right into the trap and this fucking chimp grabs him he's standing on his back and rather than just twisted his head and in his misery he just starts digging into his back pulling pieces out of him and this fucking monkeys it's gonna freaking out ream and this fucking thing is just sitting there like biting on its hip so I remember that he's like biting on its hips the monkey scream it with little eyes or like bugging out of his head it's dark and that fuck is relative yeah and just like us they're fucking evil man I'd shoot a chimp dude would you I know if you saw in the wild oh no no no if he's gonna sue right up to him fuck you oh yeah this is for the monkey yeah not on there's certain animals I could kill I would be after once that person got their face ripped off by a chimp oh I would be like a trigger-happy cop well that lady she was given that chimpanzees an axe well that's crazy she was given a xanax and wine I used to get my cat flonase because it's Persian and always had breathing problems and I was really stoned I'm like I'll just put a little drop on the tip of her nose and like that's probably done saying you could probably do and from what it's explained to me I've never tried solitude fuck is this such a bad for human son even I have a cold now I don't you still have one it's like that 5-hour energies liquid Coke I need a nap now I want to work all night you know what that is mostly it's a lot of vitamin b12 so I mean that much caffeine though those 5-hour energies are actually healthier like on a chemical profile level than it is to dry I read it they Starbucks for their insane levels of everything that's good for you but you're never good well it's Italy at one glass about wells good for you you know twelve chugs for just you think you pissed that out it's none of those you have to worry about it it's not like you're drinking them all day every day and you're gonna develop toxic amounts of vitamins once again Joe I haven't read about it but I've already made up my mind it's liquid code fucking stuff okay yeah well do you remember that you do some shit called redline did you ever try redline it's not a thing any of that shit it's a like three servings or something I don't know this I'm making up I don't know if it said three servings hey driving your car underneath the bridge you're in my arena arena because I don't wanna get sued only redline people pissed at me but it was the strongest fucking caffeinated beverage I've ever had in my life like I remember drinking while I was tired I was driving back from some gig and I got one at like one of those 24 March at a gas station yeah and I sound fucking drink this the way I'm on my way home and I'm like holy shit I am wide awake I'm taking all the shit I'm gonna do back when I get home I got to clean my fucking office Jesus Christ I could still get a workout in if I put an hour and a half cleaning and then I do an hour at kettlebells I'm taking all this in like oh I'm like on crank right now essentially on some some lick my enemy with any of those sports drinks energy drinks anything it's fizzy I don't fuck with the coffee but less it's like a root beer or a coke or something like that I'll do that shit okay I'll speaking of that can I can i plug something that tell enough I'm going doing something for the Oakland A's they got root beer float Dale day I swear to God and it's to raise awareness for childhood diabetes swear to God I guess a long time ago uh the root beer company Dave this was their cause and they were into it and I guess there was no irony back in the day so they are the ones they are the ones so I already know Irene I already everybody in my Twitter thought that they were the most clever person ever like I didn't notice how ridiculous it is to how funny it is I think it's kind of funny that stop gal you know come on down open Bartlett's and Alcoholism you know this is something there's something what I like about it there's something almost like anchorman like old school about it that I love it so I'm gonna go up there and plus you know being a baseball fan of the way it used to be where teams like the Pirates in the age were good before all this you know the money markets won the money markets won yeah it's my big business including the Red Sox I guy I mean Roger Clemens they said that he's theirs he's still getting tried he's going to try it again for something now yeah but none of that shit's about steroids it's about perjury perjuring yourself and it's about steroids about steroids but it's really you lied under oath it's just it's a sense of Clinton thing wasn't the blowjob at state you said you didn't get one under oath we swore that you would tell the truth wow that's crazy yeah um they're going after the dude for doing steroids in baseball leave the bankers that is fine leave those guys a lot that's how this motherfucker trying to claim he's got 300 victories it's amazing we got to stop this how strange is that it isn't doesn't really well but I mean in 2012 they would waste any time on that the fact that it got to Congress Congress they had congressional hearings I'd also their most basic everybody gives a fuck about baseball you got a mobbed up ref the fucking NBA is able able to handle that in-house and we just had my Right see you later go fuck yourself let's go out games at seven and this stuff here like they for some reason they had to get involved I don't know why I don't fucking read I don't know what's going on I really don't I have no idea so I never noticed like how truly uninformed I am until I get behind a microphone because I always just hear the audience going like dude that isn't how it is and it's just fuck this is ridiculous fucking dude it is so fucking ridiculous that I've been able to to earn a living and be able to eat three times day with just the unbelievable lack of fucking information that I have that you just act like an idiot and strip malls around the country yeah but there's a beauty in that there's a beauty in that lack of information that's the weed talking know is if there's a beautiful comedy it's a beauty in it that's uh that's your that's your thing driving me nuts the whole time oh I see I thought this was added prosthetics Duncan chats headboard cat's head broke when it moved in here that was the first thing that broke was my favorite cat who are you a cat person I used to be into recently now I can't I'm done with all animals I think this there there just there you have to give them too much attention and I don't have that time well cat would be good if accent cats are like you know we have to like a loners man go fuck yourself fuck your company when I need you yeah you think that but you know if it's my cat's a needy bitch yeah my cats are getting the order they get well yeah my kind of super need when I'm trying to write oh well tries to get my lap all time and I'll give her like a little bit and try to send her on her way but after a while I'm like come on I got a right leave me alone stop and cats and I think robbers take her out of the room I can't take her out of the room shut the door guess you have that voodoo vibe yeah like well they know the date you're gonna die they have like that looking at right they're definitely different I would not I would not be surprised if cats couldn't see some shit that we can't see know some shit that we can't know they say that animals are the ones that know when earthquakes are coming they start fucking freaking out and they run uphill like when the tsunami came no animals died in that shit or not no animals died very few animals died like regular animals like deers and shit because they all ran away they all knew it was coming they feel it like they have they have senses that we don't need we've we've ice gets cuz they're they're on their bare foot they're on their hoofs they can they can feel the rumbling you're sitting on your flip-flops that rubber that's all you need that little half inch of rubber yeah and you're not going to be able to pee that no no barefoot guy died in that tsunami though that's true last thing people heard before that wave crash was the slap of humans running by them it's true remember that honey central dog made this video when their dog heard the earthquake no no I don't think I knows why this is that there's no sound to this I don't believe which are them how the fuck can we prove it but watch you could hear the door for example I don't know is in 2010 we can find out in a sec but is this Japan no I see the dog runs and then watch it oh shit whoa this is scary as fuck I here's another view the dog is running dogs just like go fuck yourself oh look at all those cars move outside this is such a dumb place to live we lived in the the dumbest place ever we're just rolling the dice and hoping that the the ground doesn't open up and swallow the city over here yeah but it's all every place is dumb yeah it's true yeah it's gonna be something you live out in the middle of nowhere then some grizzly bear can come and eat your face have you been watching mountain men no but I I'll be like out your window Oh Joe I am Joe mr. Joe I have like the utmost respect for fucking rednecks in in mountain men and people who could just let you know you're off the land Green Berets he doesn't fucking drop them in the middle of nowhere and they can just get a fire going and just live out there and like that you should know how to do that this mountain man show is a fascinating show bunch of guys who live in different parts of the country all of them in the mountains one guy runs his whole farm and he puts on classes and teaches people how to survive trains people how to survive in the wilderness so you could live off the land shows you how to plant kale shows you how to hunt deer shows you how to make it look homemade deer stands he's doing all this shit and another guy is living up in Montana and this motherfucker has a gigantic grizzly bear that's stalking his house and they see this thing they got this thing on film and they're shining a liner it's fucking enormous and it's just wandering around his yard the footprints this thing the next day and they're huge me it's a fucking giant bear and it's hungry because it's starting to get snowy and they won to hibernate but is any food in his stomach so go get him some fucking sandwiches have a big bag of raw meat out there let him get the itis in your hand let no he'll shout that down we'll get sleepy you can never do that if you feed a bear they always remember where they got it from when they come back for more now that's an urban myth hahahaha started by those Park Rangers just trying to get some press you know what I wanted to watch twister coming in now fuck you bill bird you don't even respect mammals unfollow I know I love that like I give a shit that's my favorite oh the fuck out of me I like the threat that I'm gonna unfollow you dude is you have one more sports text I'm gonna unfollow you body fall go ahead follow through with it yeah um I want to see that that show with the the the the people who are preparing for the apocalypse what is that I wanted to watch that because I think what show is that that's another that's another thing that you're you're an idiot until it goes down you know what I mean yeah yeah you look like a nut until the guy sticks the money in the mattress is a fucking idiot because what if someone breaks into the house and then the banking system collapses right the real problem is not going to be storing food and and containing water because you could do that you could store food and water and likely you could ride it out for like a couple of months or so the real problem is going to be your neighbor probably didn't do that that's gonna be the real problem not only the other people that are you know clothes that were poor that would live in day to day and check to check what the fuck are they gonna do my food stops coming in that's when the real problem kicks in so it might not help that you have a lot of water no that's why you plant your food in the backyard you don't advertise it by being in the front everyone's gonna see oh or what you do is you're the middle of the night what you gotta do is is linked up with your other paranoid neighbors this is like a great beginning to a fucking movie right you fucking they link up you're like three or four paranoid families on one block and when the shit goes down my house is the rally point and we we fight off all these other suckers and meanwhile we're bringing them bundt cakes and everything's fucking cool right this I only got the first 10 pages don't look at me like this is going to go all the way through this is like a shame black script who shares name who shaped like Shana yeah so they're not famous screenplay car no it's like Red Dawn we got to kill your classmate except it's your uh your fucking your neighbor somebody pees into a radiator I don't know no flesh in rushes getting involved Syria and they're selling Syria these giant attack planes that's awesome they were talking about this in the news that uh now Syria is going to have these crazy Russian attack helicopters can't be honest none of that scares me anymore really I have given in to the fact that this is our destiny our destiny is that we are going to fuck ourselves over and you know you can only die once you just hope you're not you don't have a chimp on your back eating your hip like this I don't to go out that way but yeah you want to shoot some shit at me and fucking you know blow me to smithereens how long am I gonna give a fuck for I'm just gonna be a gap like half a second it's over hopefully what if you get your legs blown off and then you have to live it up bring it down war I'll bleed out how do you know you'll be able to bleed out what am I gonna push my legs up against Ryan managed and try to cauterize the is that the right word sometimes they get fused from the blast I know there's no way I talked about this on my podcast like I if I was ever faced with like that challenge I I don't know I could do that but if I was neck down there's no way there's no way I would just sit there and I would be going along with everybody big wow he's so positive I'd learn how to steer my own wheelchair with my tongue and the first chance daylight I got at a staircase I just fucking steer it right over I set myself right down this is the way there's no fucking way I could I could like people who do that naked naked write it write a book are the most amazing human beings on the planet because there's no way I could I would pass that Stephen Hawking since the craziest situation huh guy in a wheelchair can't even talk can't can barely move his hand to communicate he scrolls through words they have some method of doing that and then this thing reads what he says and it says it out looking believable yeah and he's like I guess I should have died after the appendicitis this is one of the week I just it's just no way he's like one of the rare guys it took three jutsu classes I tapped out for good I'm out I'm out you should come over come come on me tonight man look I know I'm not a man with love I don't need to go down there and have it reinforced all you guys get just me refresh your size it'll calm you down make you feel better dude I'm like the comest I've been in my life I'm always gonna sound like I'm in a bad mood because I have the East Coast accent right look dude you're fucking phony calm down you're like you you're you you smoke weed when I come down from exercise to I really doesn't necessarily calm me down as it does make me a little more sensitive red been you buying this I think weed calmed me down uh yeah dude you are a completely different person like when I met you in in like 96 97 you a good guy but you were the most intense fucking dudes I never Mo's like this switch somewhere in your life was flipped and the shit was on I don't even know how you slept you would like you were like a fucking goal line defense middle line bag that shit doesn't mean anything to you I'm using sports analogies like you were fucking intense dude and I'm a story I heard about you at Taekwondo vents I believed all of it after meeting you for like literally about 25 seconds well I I was transitioning then still that was still just a few years I'm like a guy trying to expel writing no it's true he's transgender when I was uh when I was a young guy crazier when I was younger I'm going 3 my entire my entire childhood was spent competing in martial arts tournaments from the time I was like 15 to the time I was 22 is my last fight so do you think it made you like that or it tapped into something that was already there I don't think I would have been that intense if I didn't have to deal with really dangerous shit on a regular basis it was the fact that you were fighting in tournaments on a regular basis and nothing ever happened to me I never got hurt but I easily could have easily could have saved when I should have zagged and got knocked the fuck out it just never happened I only lost once in a kickboxing match and that was not not that I didn't lose before and Tyco won but lost once by stoppage the only time ever got stopped is in a kickboxing match that was the third fight in a day and I was terrible nutrition back then always getting sick you know didn't really take vitamins and shit and I was on the fence back then I was like doing stand-up and fighting at the same time so it wasn't like a bad knockout I got dropped by a left hook and then I got up and my legs just wouldn't work and he hit me again and I fell down again they stopped the fight like it was just he had hit my jock in the perfect spot and everything gave out and I was thinking about it like when I was when I was going back that there's one of two things I'm going to do either I'm going to go fucking crazy now and rededicate myself and try to be a world champion kickboxer and just use the fact that I got tired in the third fight of the day as motivation to just run extra miles and do extra plyometrics and do extra rounds or be a stand-up yeah no-brainer way I'm built Yeah right like I can't there's no there's no reward in that there was no Ultimate Fighting Championship back then there was no so it's like I had a reprogram my brain I had a probe my brain was used to always thinking about martial arts competition that's all was dodging kicks landing your own you know getting in closing the distance and you know and forcing your game plan that's what my whole day was spent fighting in my head even if I wasn't fighting I'll be fighting in my head what I was when I was uh like I had girlfriends we'd bid sleepover and I would I would very loved with oil in Cicero kicks in the middle of the night like boom like my whole body would jolt like a kick because I was having a fighting dream so terrified all I was constantly terrified I got really good at it because I was absolutely horrified of it I just didn't like I just did not wanna get my ass kicked and I was already doing and I'm like well this is what we're doing and we gotta get really fucking good at this cuz I this is not something you can half-ass dudes are kicking dudes in the face and knocking people unconscious like this is fucking terrifying I saw it happen so many times saw it happen to good friends I saw him having a people who are better than me they just fought the wrong dude at the wrong time which easily could have happened to me it didn't but it easily could have like are instructor never protected us at all he put us even more like kids weren't teenagers he would put us in the men's division and you know and tell you like you're good enough to fight as a black belt when you were like blue belt or red belt he was just you want to see who is crazy you want to see he wanted to develop a team of people who didn't give a fuck that's so funny that you could do that with kids like that guy without here on the the like at the very least local news you know it was very cultish though the martial arts schools are very cultish it's yes sir no sir it's all like almost military you know like it's always bowing when you see him you know this all you always bow you always calm sir it was very I can I can I never been able to exist in that dynamic I don't no matter what it was like there's no way I could uh I needed it I grew up without a dad I grew up without I have a stepdad but my real dad I knew he was alive and I didn't communicate with him so it always fucked with me so I needed some sort of intense discipline to get my shit together so first time I ever felt like I had any control of my life at all was when I started doing martial arts like whoa finally I can fucking get good at something look at this I'm good at this shit you know but so that's why I was so wound up down first at me it took me a while to relax you know you're trying to be the best of the world kick up people in the face yeah that's a that's a thing that's addicted a few the few fighters that I have met most of them and I always felt because it's like they already proved that they're fucking guys guy in the ring that when they're hanging around that just relaxed they don't want to fail or any problems most of them yeah most of them are really tired from training too you know when when your fighter you know man when you're not trying I never thought it I just always thought like I just knocked the guy out on television no the ring wearing no shirt it's like a blood sport I kicked the fuck out of this guy I don't give a shit about you and your Dockers go ahead talk shit I don't give a fuck like I always but I always felt like that vibe so I always felt that they were after I met a couple so now these guys yeah that chill they don't have anything to prove yeah walking around definitely that too definitely that they don't have anything to prove the worst part about being a man is dealing with dickheads you know and the less dickheads that like the smallest amount of dickheads in the world that I operate in is guys at the gym nicest guys might when I go to jiu-jitsu class the fucking everybody in the class is nice there's no dickheads none everybody's just training hard doing their thing it's fun I think there's it's way easier to be a nice guy when you know how to fight this is way easier it removes a big thing that fucks with a lot of dudes has also easy if you don't know how to fight like me if you just just be nice because it won't be nice to you I believe luck with you I believe in being nice to it's not like people fuck with me I really get away with very little fucking with most people are really nice to me people say oh is it weird like people coming up to you that you know you don't know them they know you know most of the times they're just being nice like 99.999% of time they're being nice you know so but I'd rather be the guy who can defend himself you know then a guy who worries about some weird fucking person doing something to them I don't want any fear seized just like me I don't really worry I've got living a house now and ever since I've lived in a house now this there is something fucking unsettling about that where it's just you in that they come someone comes in they're getting you whereas I can apartment building there's like there's a bunch of options it's like a buffet you know apartment building thing is weird too because you don't know what the fuck these people are up to you know who knows what that guy wears I know where you live money but I know where you live so if you're gonna do something you know fuck with your neighbor guys weird too though isn't it when you like you know you look at each other like across the hall hey I don't he shut your door he shuts his fucking door to his look he's sleeping right there he's like feet away from you or he moves out and then you feel like a loser bass going to a better build than ever never moving back home they're always they're always going moving on but Patricia's talk about that I used to talk about how people moving out of when he was young when he would see neighbors moving away he would always be looking out the window all sad if you get like depressed like I don't know why they usually used to laugh our asses off talking about that kind of shit it just makes my big tree sana who said all bummed out yeah like he's in some sort of Christmas episode or something I lived in a real cheap apartment complex in Revere when I was first moving on out on my own I lived with a girl there and I'm it was really cheap it was a shady place it was though it was not good right I was one of those and all these fucking people be cooking weird shit you would walk walk down the hallway and smell all kinds of weird ethnic food it was very strange like it aromas of food were so potent in poor neighborhoods you know like it's very rare you walk into like a real high-end apartment complex and you smell some like fucking like goulash yeah spices someone's fucking making fish head soup you know what's funny is I can hear that metal door slamming in Echo first apartment I lived in in New York when I would walk in there's just that overwhelming smell of somebody cooking some fucking cow's head they got a market me and Bobby used to live we used to live together in this place in the Upper East Side with this Nigerian dude he came home one day with all this fucking meat that he had bought or whatever and being cooked Bobby summoned Bob ate it kind of tasted a little gamy what he's like what is this and he just was like he was like it's cow because I know what kind of six cow like I don't really know hoof it was just was it like looks like part of the to like the cheek or something I don't know what the fuck he was eating but it was the weirdest looking the texture of it I didn't fuck with it I didn't fuck with it that's what I Bobby should have known that he had some sort of food issue before he was starving because he said fuck it you know Bobby's a more open dude anyway so he's like I'll try this shit I looked at as I say I'm not fucking with that that looks like that's like a tree stump and it was supposed to be a rump roast he pukes easy easily doesn't he does he isn't he like to have like a gag thing where he just starts puking non-stop if you hear something I you know I've never no iran-iraq have that yeah I think he doesn't remember like Jimmy pulled his uh he had his belly button he came in his belly buddy I'm putting fingers belly buttons making people smell it I smelled it a great oh yeah why this cuz I wanted to know oh I wouldn't know it's about like what it tastes like taste it you silly bitch that's the most disgusting smell it uh I gotta tell you though I took the guy asked me if I wanted to smell it you know right there I want to be rude the closest I ever came to puking in public like that was on the Opie and Anthony oh you were fuckin there yeah yeah yeah danger baby bird oh my god yeah no before that let them they had the egg the egg nog drinking contest my god that to this day is the most fucked-up thing I've ever seen and it was absolutely brilliant and it was a Nathaniel he named you you were the one who said the only thing they can top that is if somebody leaned back and opened their mouth and had somebody puke into it so you did you had the idea and the Nathaniel named the baby bird call that the baby birds made it that that made it because think about you ever seen a baby bird get fed by its mother yeah the mother essentially like opens its mouth in like fuckin yaks in the kids mouth ah it's so hard to watch it's so glorious you know I told that story like three days later we'll tell the whole story so people the people okay it was mostly comic it was an egg it was an eggnog drinking contest ever even if you like eggnog eggnog is fucking disgusting is unbelievably sugary and heavy and dude every time I tell the story I start to gag and I haven't told it a while incredible stuff so basically what you had to do is you had to do a double shot of eggnog every 30 seconds or once a minute what was it was an um I don't yeah it was like every every few seconds I remember what yeah it was like what's the name what couldn't be once a minute because he had 72 shots so couldn't even once a minute no he didn't oh yes he was up to forty something really I don't remember what if I do I want to say so I know what you want you wouldn't think you might be right yeah let's just watch it now that's the great Pat Duffy I remember this young man's name comes an intern I remember his name little more savage sir this is a pattern of knocking because I can 7373 thank you thank you how's the memory kids 73 yeah so anyway Pat from Moonachie is by the way a diabetic who lost a toe to the disease so he has to get this out this right after comes in and it starts going and he's oh my god and when it comes out it comes out in giant clumps at first but then after a while it comes out cartoonish right there that's cartoonish that is cartoonish that is cartoonish that's cartoon oh my god that's a that's insane the sheer volume is insane oh my god again but guys the Peter North to throw up oh my god that is the most fucked up thing I can't top that that was the greatest moment in ratings again and only Opie and Anthony would be fuckin crazy enough to do something that was amazing it was genius I've only been watching Power Hawk version this whole time I just never really watched the real version I've always been watching a Paltalk version so much better quality oh yeah there's a couple different cameras in the room huh I told that story like three days later look at his fucking head and that's insane check it out in open Anthony calm if that's done I try to clean his head off didn't even have a shower for this young man it was the craziest thing I've ever seen Wow the greatest moment in radio history because it was just so what up the stars aligned with a guy who's 300 fucking pounds he could drink seventy three shots of eggnog this there's no morning show has ever even come close nothing nothing in the neighborhood and then just the stars aligning with this Pat Duffy character being so incredibly insane he had already built his way up to it he what about the shit that that did led up to that there was all those funny nicknames we had there was the one guy he would take the shot and then when someone would go to puke because basically we didn't we didn't explain a last person to not puke wins so what would happen was people be getting full of eggnog and you're not going to puke but then someone would puke which would make you puke so this fucking guy every time someone would go to puke he would walk three steps away and just face the wall we started calling Blair which number that and then there was the other guy who already puked and he puked into like a fucking I don't know like like what'd he call it the thing to be a poor like picture a picture he puked into that then thwarted on fruit loops and would start eating his own puke in loops to make other people puke that was the terrorist he's making people out with him and I just want to go to so many and then I also remember the terrorist he's just taking people ahead of them and then there was Pat for Moonachie the champion and after he won he kept drinking and we were like like a true champion he's only competing with himself and he just be put to wreck it out like he crushed the record he crushed that that had to be like a gallon of eggnog lorry thing yeah it was like look at these are it's double shots will mean he's he's not lying Bill's not lying if you go and watch it you will not believe that what is the video the video you just played what version is a bunch of oh yeah I just went to YouTube and typed in Opie and Anthony uh baby bird baby bird is the first one don't do the Paltalk version that one's the bad quality version but okay one rifle so eggnog champion most insane you know just say so that's I've been trying to I chose I when I told uh Monnett Nia had one of her friends over and I was telling the story dude and I was literally laying on the floor crying laughing retelling the stories like three days later while gagging and I remember Nia's friend was horrified she finally says where did they get these people and that's what sent me over the top I was like I was like crying like I don't know and that was it and I I almost puked like look if I actually went into detail and went to tell that story I would start gagging again I don't think I ever won't gag telling that story that was the most disgusting thing and the amount of people on the staff who everybody gets the point none of people who puked oh yeah a smell of fucking stomach lining what the hell it was I not yet that's my Sunday night I just gotta I'm now finally over that but I had food poisoning and it fucking ruin my life I it that's it's such a great way to lose ten pounds but isn't it it's an it's true I did I did lose about nine pounds Friday yeah that's not good dude you gotta be careful gotta be careful with your sushi son and I can't even eat now it makes me even feel nauseous but you should use it as a like a time to get like in great shape yeah been eating watermelon what did you that's good sushi at katsu or whatever it's called it Glendale Americana or whatever and that's a decent place right that's a nice place bye Oh buddy sushi people are like dude what the fuck ate sushi on a Sunday never do that I'm like oh yeah I was happy our sushi Sunday on that's probably the worst time to go go because it's Friday sushi old fish yeah I'm not getting rid of it yeah I never thought about that I not have a seven-day fish market I don't know but I guess that's the thing Sunday sushi I'd like to get Gordon Ramsay on the case it's so amazing how we've been able to cut that out of our lives that whole food gathering nonsense like while I was watching this mountain man show watch this poor guy with Shiro do knees he's going out looking for deer like trying to get a deer some meat for the freezer while he's looking for bears constantly like what what an amazing change of life it's happened when they figure out how to cut out that whole gathering food it was already bad enough bad knees looking for a deer and then he does the the over the top while looking for bears yeah it's amazing you got to watch the show - great show now that's why I just watched it last night for the first time I'm comfortable being in the matrix hey you know I'll starve to death and it'll be a brutal month and then that'll be it I don't want to be walking around my bad back out in the fucking woods trying to shoot deer in the face and trying to gut it with some sharpened stick Oh got me all right I'm part of the week I'm not supposed to be here that's just like you you'll tap back into your uh when you through kicks in at night yeah I'll just grow like a mountain man beard that's where animal skins make my own Spears I guess that's the name of good Bruce Springsteen Oh make nygma here but when I threw kicks in the night well two kicks in the night when I do kicks in mine where are you kicks you said something we have to be like a breakup and modular word man yeah it's something about being young yeah getting out of the town yeah and then getting away from all the boozers and then you go to the courts when I do kicks of the night I would split my in see when I he still write songs huh Bruce Springsteen still out there right I have to see that guy live because Jim Norton finally the guy who put me over the top cuz Jim was yet another guy who I don't want to speak for him but he didn't seem like he was a fan and then saw him live it was just like dude you got to see this guy live he's just fucking inside it's as a performer you gotta go see the guy yeah that's what Bryan Callen was saying the dudes like in a 60s he does full back bends and slides on his knees on stage just like you know it's like he's in fucking tremendous shape puts out a three and a half hour show I did a stand-up show and he was one of the acts on it it's what a good what yeah seconds line up ever I did a thing called I know I've told us on like 20 different podcasts but it's a great story I was uh I did this to stand up for the troops it's his great benefit it was at the Beacon Theater and this was the lineup was the Max Weinberg band was was the the play in the music in between the accident beforehand and after an Jon Stewart hosted first act out of the gate was Tony Bennett then it was a Bruce Springsteen then they auctioned off one of Bruce Springsteen's guitar went for like a hundred grand then Joe McHale had to follow that somehow did that then me and then Seinfeld oh my that was the show wasn't insane it was insane and I remember looking over you know waiting you know didn't want to go over cuz that's like Jerry it's a king I don't piss a guy and I looked over and he was literally like backlit with this suit on like Jerry ready to go out on stage was like fucking iconic and I was looking over like going I'm at the Beacon Theater and that's Jerry Seinfeld right they're gonna go on next one of the great great nights of being in this business man but I saw Bruce Springsteen one song he was jumping all around I was on the pan on everything and I was just like wow this guy's I can't do that this guy's dead 25 years old what song was it I don't know I never got into his stuff so were you the first guy to do stand-up on no Joel McHale has all McHale did Joe had to yeah he's a good dude man I did that yeah he's a really nice guy it's it's nice to know there's still nice guys out there like you meet people that you know hang out with a because most people are the vast percentage in our business are in comparison the way people think of us people think of comedians as being like comedians are always miserable they hate life they're really only funny when they're on stage there's a lot of stereotypes that go along being comedian right a lot of there's a lot of truth in that the samba4 well some but the vast majority you were miserable for a while yeah I'm aware just you know what happens in your late 20s and early 30s when you don't think you're a psycho and you're not you know think you're out of your mind and then you realize oh wait a minute I'm completely out of my fucking mind I'm just you know I you know what you just walking around saying hello to people hi how are you nice to meet you you don't paying your bills on time you think you're you're normal and that all of a sudden you know some shit happens you're like oh fuck I'm this guy I need to work on this need work on that and uh you know hopefully you make the right choices by the time you get to your late 30s yeah I know this is just how it happened for me I started like leveling out being like I what am I gonna be angry the rest of my fuckin life I certainly did that too you know I mean pot can't be a hundred percent to blame for me comment down but uh no they dig but if it comes that point are either gonna steer it into the wall you know all you're gonna is gonna try to chill a little bit but getting back to the other thing though there's just way too many talented fucking people in this business for you to I feel - even if you were a dick to get away with it for because all they're waiting for is that first project you do to flop yeah they're just looking for I mean they're gonna hang with you while you while you're making the money but well there are a lot of people that are Dex and you know then they stopped working I mean that I've have friends that are directors and tell me horror stories about having to work with some crazy lady who yells at them on set and you know what demands changes to her character because her character would do this and like my god we got to get through this fucking season with her and then they gonna kill her off because like gee they tell you stories about shit like that you like God's business no you Q can get away with that for a little while but like all you know not very well yeah the next year was getting off the bus every day they don't to me up if you're just gonna go the performer route so there's always going to be somebody younger fresher face whatever it is so if you you can't I don't know I don't know how you survive doing doing it the other way so well I'm not a would I like God yet I've yet to be on anything I mean I'm done a lot of acting stuff but everybody everything I've ever done it everybody's been unbelievably nice yeah but we all know guys especially comics they're kind of cunts you have a how far do they get some get pretty far thank you very much you killing me I was thinking there was a justice in the world no but well but the ones the examples that I could pull up you know especially my favorite example it's kind of been diffused you know but men see is a bad guy and that's you know does use a vindictive God like what he was doing in comics was he was going after them take their shit and do it right before they went onstage like that kind of thing take your clothes a bit do right before you go up try to kick your legs out from under you that was a bad guy that was guy who did it for a long time he did it for a long time it didn't last because eventually people figured it out but for a long time it did work it's the shot decide bad I've never had to be around somebody like that that we're lucky but I bet a show business shelters them though there's a little bit of shell subtle stuff I've been around but like nothing nothing to that hardcore level I keep thinking that's Ellen DeGeneres who you know Hillary Clinton I thought you was talking about me so you're looking at you your video no much is going on yeah Ellen's way way better way better looking than Jesus Christ don't do that to her I just out of the corner of my eye Hillary Clinton she's crazy so uh Ellen DeGeneres's old-school haircut Hillary Clinton who she stole from Wayne Gretzky if you want really want to be honest yeah that's a yea wingless weird wait recipe ok ELINT the case she had that this how that haircut goes for her Ellen DeGeneres Jersey before that it was Wayne Gretzky Patrick Swayze brothers Rhoda yes it's amazing what the 80s is a guy had Hillary Clinton's hair come like a lot of guys had Hillary Clinton's haircut no a lot of guys this is good I would have with my hair who didn't grow out like an afro I would have rocked that thing I tried to grow the mullet I did but my hair was too when two afro wish it would just grow out I look like a redheaded Juan Epstein so I was like I can't do this one obscene he hits us with a Welcome Back Kotter reference now nobody knows who won I've seen his man he is a sad way he did just passed away a few a few months back oh he played my brother on Newsradio they dead how was it to meet him it's cool it was um Nick DiPaolo Brian Cowen and an Epstein from welcome back our data tell you any any Juan Epstein stories no really you're just happy to be working a nice guy to be around friendly guy it's hard for him and it's hard for all those dudes it didn't work you know you know they they did this big hit sitcom and then they had a hard time getting work after it meanwhile John Travolta takes off and becomes this fucking gigantic movie star and just sort of eclipses them and then it becomes a story of well how come these guys haven't gotten any work when John Travolta is a superstar you're in the same movie ish TV show is John Travolta how come you're not a superstar I don't know how actors do it because like if you're on if you're on a movie and it ends as a comedian you still have a Judas ya be a comedian then you put on our special and you can like reinvent yourself on all that like I think I'm trying to make it just as like an actor or character actor this one the hardest things ever it's got to be brutal sit around waiting that's why so many of them are so phony because they're constantly being politicians they constantly have to sort of protect their image and sell a certain image and the other got a chart which I'm the same thing like book actors I find that nice so it's definitely a different energy it's a much more uh not as intense less comics yeah cause you know comic comics just the you up there by yourself you're gonna heckle you you you have defense yeah defenses up where they're kind of more like a little more open you know they they they came about this in like acting class well everybody's got to go up there and it much more healthier sort of easing into the space there's a sort of but I mean this the only way to be is a comic give it's it's a nutty fucking business no absolutely go on stage and some shit that you wrote down and made up and you're gonna tell it to these people they're gonna laugh are you sure and they gonna pay money to hear that for an actor isn't the biggest surprise the first time you did that you wrote some you thought it's gonna be funny and you just say it and there's nothing to say fucking invisible kick to the chest you're so confused so I knew this was going to be a huge bit for me like I don't think I found my new closer or what's worse was when you had one and it destroyed and then you went out in the first time you tried to recreate what you did the night before but you were thinking about the night before but he didn't realize the reason why it didn't work the reason why worked before was because you were in the moment they try to do what you did the night before and it falls flat that quiet ride home with yourself yeah and this there is a reality of different fucking crowds you know a lot of people like to say it's never the crowd that is absolute horseshit because there's some crazy fucking crowds and there's some crowds will tell a joke you know it's a great fucking joke this is your fucking ace in the hole starting off slow but I'm gonna hit him with this and away we go and clunk it just comes out like this no this is the crap there's something wrong with this fucking crowd you know when you're just showing up did you do any a strip clubs or anything like that you ever see uh strip our strip clubs rock and roll I'm trying to filter all the ones that I went to and I'm trying to think of his ever show ever is shown yes you ever do as I did he did what did I did there was a there was this titty bar in New York City but this was it was weird like on the other side was the titty bar it was during that Giuliani stuff where he was like okay 40% of this can't be poor not for not pornography yeah pornographic pornographic pornography pornography fucking shit I was trying to say put pornographic I said pornography and I thought I was on the right track and I just kept pornography it's gonna come to you it's gonna uh fuck pornographic so uh so so technically we were there but there was no girls walking around with like titties out or anything like right I just my eyes remember some girl told me a street joke a really bad street joke and involve lifting up her dress and show me her pussy what the hell was at night and I couldn't enter the heart to tell that I already heard that joke and she went all the way with getting like the tattoo did you want to see my don't see my pussy necessary once my pussy I'm she lifts up her skirt and it's a tattoo of a cat and says I guess I'm Mouse aided or so what I had a Fox's ago however though I think that's a tattoo of a cat how the fuck does that go I don't know I can't remember the end of the joke and she did it I'd already heard the joke and I want oh I laughed anyways I don't have the heart to be like yeah I already heard that one someone else has that joke on their body am i bombing at this point I feel like I am I have to go I have to go to risk this this people leave everything yeah what is the pitbull thing I don't know they're always trying oh it's for a shelter that gets people to uh rescue those beautiful dogs that are fucking awesome and they have you back and I love you to death and I love those don't somebody's face off up there tough action around other dogs you have to be careful don't you know what it's like it's like it's like driving a sports car you have a lethal weapon that there's a responsibility it's like owning a gun like anything else it's not like either one of those things because you can control both of those things you can't control an animal so you know what you need Iyer you need to step into my dojo dogs I love pit bulls to death but they're dangerous dogs they are dangerous dogs you respect that but you have to respect that they are dangerous that's why I worked with the trainer for like almost a year and at this point me my girl could take a dog walk it through a bunch of five-year-olds holding raw meat and there wouldn't be a fucking problem it just wouldn't be you say that but you don't know that because dogs do strange things I had a dog kill one of my dogs yeah I know came home and I saw a fucking bloodbath in the kitchen I never after that I know but also but how much did you read up on the breed before you got oh I read up a lot of had him for years I've had them for most of my life I don't wanna get to this day no it's look I love the dogs all right dog i sat here I supported you and your lifestyle as I'm walking out hyping my fucking little charity thing I'm going to all of a sudden I'm getting static as I see how this game is I'm saying what this is I do love them this is a bait and switch I

dogs likes little dogs get competitive with big dogs so we don't take it to dog park problem solved just make sure that you have like a sturdy leash and you never have more on dogs right yeah they're great to have Wade intercepts that's like me saying listen make sure you don't stick your thumbs in here when you make a fist that's what you're saying to me right now okay no I'm not I'm not even suggesting I'm just asking how you do it like what does you give a philosophy behind you some people don't have that philosophy they just say I see problems come in and I just cross them across the street I just you know they everybody has to be the martial arts version of just avoiding the fight yeah absolutely sure there's that hoping that there is this assert yeah you got to have the right kind of collar you have to know what to do with the call if you know what to do and how to hold the leash you and get that thing's gonna go the same way you get somebody to hold and where they want to stand up and sit down they have no fucking control right because like ah is the same thing with like you know the next like the point pep by fuck it choker collar yeah you're the ones with laughing
