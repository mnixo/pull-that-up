love not okay no here we go three two one the champ is here how are you sir I'm good I'm good huh yeah all right is that good to see you brother what's happening oh not for much mate nothing much just has settled in that you're the champ ah yeah it'll feel real yeah yeah it's it's settled in you know I mean lucky it's weed it's a how to explain look on the top of person that you know soon as I'm home I'm Daddy on the regular blog that everyone knew me 10 years ago mm-hmm but at the same time obviously you got you know the the media obligations and everything needs to be done so it's you know what is different you're gonna get recognized a little bit more on the street but what is it like in Australia now the people get excited to see you know yeah yeah Australia you know obviously that's where I'm from so that's a you know the supports a big especially where I'm locally like you know every time I fought literally out there in our city your stops you know just to watch it what's the city now Wollongong the dong say it again Wollongong Wollongong they're gone the gum just sell for Sydney oh okay yeah close so you go to Sydney when you want to get crazy yeah no really I don't thought I'd do too much partying on that except for a couple of days ago when were in Vegas so they just got me got me good did it get you after Izzy one got me before and after so yeah I mean real struggle straight that'd be good well we'll get you some water we got water all right I did extra lights ah yeah we got some bring in some of those liquid IVs they just bring the whole box of it in there oh okay yeah Bobby's great have you ever tried that shit mm-hmm it's good good all right he hydrates you twice as fast as regular water alone actually tastes good salt electrolytes all kinds of shit in it all right oh my god they say coffee chairmat coffee yeah the Laird Hamilton super food coffee yeah I'm addicted to these little I'm addicted to coffee but I'm addicted these fucking alright yeah look at that rip one of them bad boys okay chuck it in your warm oh yeah well now way mmm go to do that I guess so you know I mean there's becoming the champ and then there's becoming the champ the way you did because you beat the consensus greatest featherweight of all time in his prime you know yeah that's a big deal my friend exactly right you know it's huge you know huge for me obviously I'll have been an underdog as well you know I had been in my last three fights and you know I love sort of proven that the doubters wrong you know I mean and then obviously again to beat him like I did as well - you know out fight him you know how to strike him and and stuff like that again he's a great champion nothing about respect to him but for me to go out there and and do like that you know I'm someone were very proud of oh you should be you should be proud of your whole run man I mean you haven't been in the UFC that long yeah it was you know I mean how many years you've been in there now - I think it's a two in a bit too close to 300 K closer for a year but it feels like well since the Chad Mendes fight that's when people started really paying attention that's where yeah that's when quick shit well before that I wasn't even ranked right and that's why I wanted that for no no I think I was ranked tenth maybe sorry so that's why I wanted that fight you know I knew if I took him on that'll get me straight to you know 5th ranked and then that's why I wanted to call out you know aldo after that because i knew that would put me in a position where I could you know father-daughter you know shoot for them ranks as always said what is going on at City kickboxing you need to tell me man yeah well that's another thing that a lot of people don't realize I'm actually based in Wollongong like it right yeah but I go there for my camp right so I go there a lot in man this is one in New Zealand or you guys have one in Australia no no no we go to New Zealand so how far is that flight about two hours two and a half hours yes but you decided to make that trip well I've known the guys for a long time you know Eugene easy even and Brad Rudolph Brad wardell's actually when I was in Thailand you know tagamet ah yeah I do a bit of training out there and he was a striking coach for a while so I was working with him a fair bit and you know that's when they bring Eugene and Israel and that's when I started like you know got to know them and stuff like that and just ever since then we've we've always you know sort of got along and now we're just you know we're a part of a part of team Mean Joe Lopez is my head coach but we go there you know to see the kickboxing and tremble the boys on every camp will go there you know we'll go there you know a couple of times each camp so I'll do like 2 or 3 weeks get back to the family and train and then go back there again for the last couple of weeks and then I had head to my fight usually and where do you train when you're home I train a free stuff on gym so that's locally where I am that's where I first my first day ever in the gym was at that gym so that's to where I am today that's awesome what made you need to make a shift though need a higher level of competition to train with well yeah that's always gonna be a big part you know again it's not a massive oh right where I am you know I mean we've got some some people but it's just you know we're starting get a team in that now but that competitive sort of training partners is a big deal and my coach was always you know Joe's always been a strong believer of you know training with so many different levels of you know styles you know everything you know that Coach Crean coach that's not worried about you going to another camp and training is a great coach exactly right saying it works you know luck it no surprises come fight time because I've seen so many different body types so many styles you know I put myself in that position every time luck you know what I mean like every every fucking by I'm doing as many different bodies as I can yeah just so you know there's no surprises comfort time yeah it wasn't a fire no way so when did you start training what year did you start I started I've been doing it for about yeah not even 10 years 9 years so I actually started MMA training as just a kid to keep fit bolos playing rugby league so I was a you know that was when I was 214 pounds so that's something that uh obviously when we're when you when I'm fighting and you say 240 a little slow getting your language you guys have that Australian language yeah things different 244 takes more sense yeah but still is ridiculous most 100% you know five or six on a good day you know Elena give me a good stretch yet do some yoga sessions I'm I'm eight five five foot six but you know I mean it's just a yeah aza you know a lot bigger and I wanted to stay fit in between yeah in between like sort of the season preseason so that's why I went and started and just loved it ever since so that was about yeah again nine years ago so and holding now 31 they're looking grow oh yeah they're you guys say besides you Christ you're 31 that head so you were you know early early 20s and know martial arts training in all before that um I wrestled so I wrestled before even down rugby lega wrestled for about probably a year I can't even remember you know honestly I've done it for about a year and you know I've done pretty good it was something that I was actually pretty good at but you know I want to play football with my mates and I've got over wearing the tights you know wrestling and stuff like that so you know it was just something that yeah I end up just playing football with a mate so I sort of gave it up and I was actually pretty good at it so we wonder I'm on the Nationals like you know obviously it's the wrestling is not as big in Australia as it is over here but you know it's the one luck strategy membership twice and stuff like that but then I just I just gave it up and stay cool yeah so that's crazy so you won the Australian Nationals twice yes yeah so that was a yeah they have maybe you don't even training for a year you don't have done it for yeah honestly I remember we used to have a game night we call those at a PC why say please boys club it's just a local club usually they'll have like games nights and they'd had wrestling there and I just went there one time and the you know the trainer was just like oh you should come and do training because I was doing all right so I just started doing it and then I was actually pretty good again I was always like I literally you know come out the the mother's room like this you know what i mean so I've been I've been this big since I've been this big or you know this hard and he looked this old look for you know since I was like 12 so I was always I was always verson guys to ostracize me and you know animate cells you know all that much older as well and I used to do well so that's what a lot of people you know thought I was mad you know when I gave that up because I was doing so good and then the same was the rugby league when I played but bleh giving people thought I was mad giving that up as well because of something I was pretty good at as well so what made you decide to make a switch to MMA professionally um just my last year of football rugby league I we you know we won that calm you know I got player of the match scored a 40 meter try so you can imagine that guy running 40 meters yeah so it was just a you know was just yeah good year to finish on you know I had a couple of fights as well that year so I was training at MMA and having a couple of fights while I was playing rugby league oh really yeah that was during the season yeah yeah during the season you're having fights yes they'd have a game and then you know a fight yeah yeah so they're pretty full on and still working through concrete research riced it was pretty pretty full-on so a lot a lot happening you know and I guess that's probably where I get some of my fitness today as well you know I mean I've just always been a bit of a gamer and you know just it's just something I've always done but maybe from back in them days as well well I would imagine that just the sheer tenacity and cardio that you would get from rugby rugby is a tough fucking sport in there I mean that's what I think Americans should play I really do I look at American football Mike what's up with the shoulder pads and now honestly I think it's safer I think rugby safer I don't think it's safe it's obviously a very rough combat sport I mean it's kind of a comp it's kind of like a team combat sport almost but you were at least not under the illusion that you're protected like American football players have been for so long with the helmets and the pads mm-hmm and that's what's causing a lot of the brain trauma yeah with imhad helmets and I get what you mean slamming into each other you know yeah it's a yeah I guess I know I can see what you're saying there as well but you know then again then you're looking at that you know someone running that you know no no helmet as well but I get what you're saying I actually think you know I think you're right I forget the name they do well I think they they've considered this but people are so accustomed to football helmets football pads yeah so the idea is to just make better helmets and better pads but according to the guys who really study traumatic brain injury that's not really gonna help because it's the impact yeah though the head the brain swashing around inside your skull that is just so the the amount of mass that you have these guys colliding into each other it's almost unavoidable it's like what that actually when you talk in boxing and that as well and a lot of people you know obviously we go to smaller gloves right but then the boxers they they have more padding but it's just so many more strikes to the head yeah day in day out and they reckon that's actually you know can be actually worse but yeah I imagine is and then also there's nothing else you can't you don't even allow to clinch I mean if you clinch they separate you you know whereas an MMA if you get rocked you could at least protect yourself yeah and if it goes to the ground you can hang on you could try to submit someone you can try to wrestle with them there's not a lot of options in boxing you know yeah definitely so what so you you did well in rugby mm-hmm and you had a couple of fights while you're playing right what was it was it just a one on one aspect of it like what made you decide to focus entirely on that main I've always loved martial arts you'll always love it and I love the fact that you know you're in there by yourself you know I've always been a hard luck worker yes so you could play the best game of your life and say rugby league and still lose well you could do everything right you know it'd make thousands of meters whatever someone else fucks up well yeah again you know I don't want to put it out yeah well exactly right that's sort of even even it could be vice-versa I could play back and we could win but I love you know the fact that I'm such a hard worker and you know I'm always putting the hours in the gym you know I'm so dedicated this sport that so if I lose in that cage that's on me you know what I mean and I love that I love the fact that and if I am half-assing it you know in the gym you're gonna see that comfort time and I've got no one else to blame but myself so you know that's I've always loved that and again I've just always loved Marshall I think the boxing UFC even you know before I even started a you know training MMA I would like you know listen to music and older you know to picture myself winning the world title oh yeah I've always loved go trade I wasn't even training you know it's just something that I've always loved I actually started watching a back when I think because we we had a box you know you get the the chips and you can watch whatever channel you want and the pay-per-view would publish and say that but anyway so pay-per-view was on and I remember watching a chocolate there on a sorry Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock that was the first time their first fight so that was the first time I ever started watching like UFC and and that's when I just absolutely started loving it so I've always you know watched it and loved it and you know picture myself being in there and all that I wasn't even trying at the time that's well Australians are tough as fuck it's like it's a tough fucking place there's something there men you know what I mean there's a lot of I mean sure there's some pussies over there too they're men you know what I mean like this like one of the ways that people look at Australia it's like it makes sense yet great combat sport athletes would come out of Australia yeah exactly especially in colony well I will now yeah I mean that's really what you guys start exactly right you know especially you know well as you're saying you know if you see me being a being looking like this since I you know since a young age Akio obviously you're gonna I'm not the type to the brag that you know get into fights and all that sort of stuff but when I was younger that that would happen and so I've always been known to fight and being able to fight type of thing I've always said to sort of defend myself never been the one to start it but yeah those times where I had to finish it but you know so it's just always something that I guess I've had in me so I mean Australia you guys have John Wayne par Jeff Fenech you guys have had some great combat sports athletes cuz you know well that's now it's you have say so big in in Australia so we've always had as you're saying very talented guys you know we've got a lot of very good athletes over there but that will always in your rugby league's and AFL or whatever it is now UFC and MMA is getting so big that you're wigging these athletes that you know train MMA and you're only gonna see it grow even more and we're gonna get a lot a lot more champions from our from our regional I'm sure have you ever trained with John Wayne Park I haven't I've met him a mini matter uf7 I think that's the only time I've ever met him to be honest he's actually got to get a hip replacement fucked up from all those years of kickboxing his last fight he retired in his last fight which is a boxing match yeah I'm mundane so that was a yeah blow it you know mundane can actually box really well together and go to him he's achieved a lot John Lee and savage oh yeah he's a straight-up savage mm-hmm I mean that guy's mean he's been fighting more Thai since he was a teenager yeah you know spent a lot of time in Thailand I think I've watched him actually this was a long time ago this when my cousin was a kickboxer and I went and watched him like this was I was very young oh wow and him pretty sure was John Wayne power that was I need actually hit him up I need a hit up my cousin below was he was a John Wayne father main event of that cuz I remember watching and I'll connect you in John Wayne if you'd like yeah well sure yeah all right yeah I appreciate that yes we sure but again like I've always been a fan of him to luck but when I got a little bit older you know but yeah again like it's something that I've always been fascinated about combat sports so you decide to make the leap was it the Rugby season was over and you're like you know what I'm done yeah well I was while I was falling again in my last year I had a couple of fights and how many fights did you have before two fights and that was enough yeah I think so you know I'm pretty competitive type of guy and the fact that you know I wasn't at the highest level in rugby league yet you know it's 22 and you know at that age usually you know if you're not in you know not in our role as that's the the highest if you're not there now robotic 22 you you pretty much yanking in like sorta it's sort of like that and that's how I was and I'm again I'm competitive so I was like I don't know if I'm gonna make it up even though I was pretty good you know made a lot of rep sides and stuff like that but I was just no you know I'm gonna take this on work and I can go the whole way and again look I've already pictured myself winning world titles and stuff like this and I even told people like before I even started that all of the UFC champion one time and they're probably thinking were you even getting this you know I'm sure a lot of people say that but yeah exactly to actually go out there and do it though it's a it's pretty it's pretty cool yeah I'm pretty amazing because I maybe even having conversations we've like friends and watching the UFC again I wasn't even training and I remember saying I would've sounded cocky to be honest the way it would come out but I'm like I could do it I reckon I can do it how many fights have you had total I'm 20 and one 21 21 21 in 120 and 120 and one I think when did you have your first loss that was my third fight a full fight also was right after you started to go pro I mean right after you decided to make that your life you know now it's actually because I had two amateur fights oh it's not that wet before when I started so mostly amateur fights were when you yes rugby yes I had four amateur fights in went pro so I didn't have that that was against at the time you Corey Nelson he's named Lucia of course Nelson but he was a you know he was a pound for pound number one obviously was that welterweight this was and you know it was very early in my career and I should not have took that farber win a tournament and he I had him first so I had the favorite straight up and again it was in a Division I probably should never have been in right but you know I took him on and you know I don't know I hope my own but you know things didn't go well but that was you know we always talked about you know that really things really ask you know it went a lot better for me after that because I realized that it was too strong so I started I thought I have to go you know down or I have to start grappling as well so that's where I actually started grappling after that my coach was like alright you got control a bit too much in there let's just do Jiu Jitsu for the next 3-4 months or whatever it is just straight jujitsu I had a jujitsu comp and you know just say again I was that's when I started dieting as well but I was I remember doing that Jiu Jitsu comp and I was on the podium ended up getting the gold soles on the first podium there on the second and third and they're still taller them you know these are the guys that you know I'm so familiar that's why now a father featherweight and I really do look at these even though they still care over me because I'm still short in my division but I look at them and they look you know used to fully play as big front rowers Ryan yeah props and I'm frightening middleweight and all these different divisions that you know I look at these you know featherweight some of the stuff they're puny compared to what I'm used to but it does make sense though I mean you fighting at 170 is crazy I mean that's 25 pounds heavier than what you're fighting at now and that was that Pro and again fought in the top class off your night anton zafir before that and he was a UFC fighter as well in you know welterweight so what did you do to drop the weight down and what do you walk around that now walk around on be heavy after after because obviously burns my hand and stuff like that but you broke the hand the max well yes I did yeah but I broke that in the max flat and which round I'm not too sure I remember feeling and thrown and be like ooh that hurt I think from watching back the tape I wanted to watch back and see where I noticed that I noticed in the fifth round that's where I think it happened could just that see me you obviously on the offense I was only using my left hand and stuff like that obviously if he comes at me as well you know he'd at the moment I'd fraud you know so that's but so I think it was in early in the fifth round I think so you were walking around that now yeah I'm about 78 kilograms what's that that's over 170 so what's that 170 something I guess let's see if you I'm not using I'm usually around you know maybe a couple kilos there less than that usually but so weight comes off I hold a lot of 165 ish yeah say that but yeah took holidays I went hard in it you should celebrate man one time in your whole life you get to be champ for the first time yeah exactly right exactly this is your time but again I didn't you know have in the broken hand you know I want to train them on the top of you know try and be it you know I'm a professional so I'll do what I can on still doing as many things that I could in a strength condition building them legs being able to just throw you know shitload of left hooks and jab so I should have a good left hook and jab come next fight so you know got to work a lot on that well that's great now when you decided to dye it down you were you were even heavier than you are now what did you do to get your weight down from 214 to a manageable weight where you can make further way yeah it's a obviously dieting is just absolute key you know what I mean even now like even when I trained so hard if you're not dieting world you the weight won't come off so that's how but you know starting early again you know I used to I didn't know much you know I don't know what I know now you know having dieticians and that though I was never doing that so I just literally ate next to nothing like and I trained a luck I told you I was playing rugby league you know I was a you know fighting training and then concreting and you know when I was getting close to fight so I was eating next to nothing and yeah like you just want to say nothing yeah a hundred percent you know staph infections all the time and all that like it's it's a crucial I thought you know obviously the science to it all and where now it's absolute game changes so I just did pretty much lost my weight that way so I used to be a little bit you know bigger obviously from eating like that as well you know you lose muscle you lose you know you're probably losing strength and everything like that obviously lose health yeah exactly right so you know it probably makes me make 145 a bit easier now but because I don't have as much muscle as I did but again it wasn't healthy and it put me in again I had to miss out fights from bad staph infections and you know mr saye and you know yeah I said that's terrifying it rattles yeah it how does it get you in there for what's that so how long were you in the hospital for that was all yeah I was in the hospital the first night but then they just had a nurse that come to your house every morning and night to give you everything and so it was a pretty full on and then obviously these when I got well got cellulitis after the Brazil fight we've Aldo will cellulitis is a form of staff yeah yeah yeah so that got him a leg so it was also a rattle man so it's crazy luck we always talk about how you know MMA is such a roller coaster ride you know what I mean so many highs and lows and that's a perfect example you know you go over to Brazil and then beep you know one of the greatest for the weights of all time and then you get put in hospital and I was there for like a week you know if she knows that was in Chile so I was on my home where it just absolutely rocked me they know struggling I was really struggling it really was it was a you know I had like 40 plus degree temperatures and Celsius yes yes and why the fuck don't we just go the rest of the world is on the cellular system yeah yeah that's what I'm trying to get today I was like even wearing the clothes I end up dressing up I was like what is 40 Celsius what is that in let's guess I must say 104 because whenever my Canadian friends say oh it's 40 degrees out I'm like what the fuck does that mean yeah that's cold as shit was it really oh yeah myself but kilos keep between kilos and Celsius I have no idea what I'm talking about yeah well I gotta is I'm trying to keep up with that cuz obviously every time all right now I always say 145 you know that's every time I 145 champ you know so I'm the 214 when I'm talking about that but I get my was the X and everyone gets that wrong I think it was just me yeah right here in fact it's funny you know you always go on your social media and there's always like these things like you know they just roll along with like certain things like you know whenever I posted everyone will try and say I'm a New Zealand air and like they just thought like banter like that and like and everyone's into each other on there but there was one that the same as oh yeah I got told that he was 214 it's like there's just sort of trying to quite you and they're like oh and just keeps growing and growing and growing so it's you say 240 I can't distinguish that between 240 and 214 that accent yeah 214 so cool fucking accent though Australians are straight-up cool accent Australian in New Zealand very cool accents some some accents are just ridiculous they need to stop but you guys you got a cool accent I appreciate that thank you New Zealand's a dope place to be too man I want to go visit there and just the beauty of it all man yeah green man I love that type of stuff I'm all about you know the landscapes and all that type of stuff but I'm never actually in every time I'm in New Zealand I'm in Auckland in the city they're just training that's it so I never actually get to go see the place I did for the last event where the boys are falling in Auckland so Joker popular yep yep Seoul's there yeah it was here that was unreal what a fight a man that was good could fight for sure and I was there because I was in the way I was at a wedding the night before so yeah the night before and that was five hours north so I had to drive five hours remember in Australia in that like it they the UFC's in the morning so I had to get up like 3:00 in the morning 3:30 in the morning and then and drive all the way there to watch the fight so while I was there for the wedding I got to see a bit more you know I went fishing like and stuff like I said I love about fishing in New Zealand yeah so some of the best in the world yeah yeah not some beautiful sports up there so it's good good drive was the laces a good Drive and where it is in New Zealand when it's really good is during my season my say yes yeah so something happens where there's more seeds and when there's more seed there's more mice and when there's more mice than mice get into the water and when the mice get into the water the trout eat the mice and so they catch these enormous trout that have just dozens of mice in their bellies well yeah might may you know all these sort of that I know that's good that I know a lot this is actually shot out to Jay Scott this is listen to the Jay Scott outdoors podcast where he was talking to it's a hunting and fishing podcast where they were talking about they were talking to a guy who's a guide in New Zealand okay we're talking about you know like when when's the best time to go over there they just have a enormous brown trout all right over in New Zealand yeah I've never done a trout fishing now done a lot of fishing that but never done like the freshwater fishing that's fine yeah they do fly fishing too which is a little bit more skillful okay yeah that's my given that given that authority last time I I went fishing or went then we would try to get king is a matter would come like when you're king salmon yeah like that you got to reel it in and I pull it up no no yeah G yeah I was useless at that I'm pretty coordinated but I just couldn't do it I couldn't get it riding or what it was but I thought like a fish but you know maybe a little you know small fish and then I'm alright up with but the big fish on either need to work on that well it's a skill like anything else and fishing is it's the guys are really good at it they're consistently good at it's not a it's not an accident yeah I do a lot more speed fishing yeah yeah that looks fun yeah yeah that's it yeah you know again as you know underwater it's just a whole nother world yeah I mean so it's a it's unreal it really is it no I love it so I go with a mate needs like a professional speaker Sherman and you know he's abalone diver it does all that sea takes me to pretty crazy places like in the middle of the ocean just where there's a boy you know like a I know what use will call it here just a you know a chain and there's like a you know floaty boy we call them and they just say and then we'll go there fish off then like go for like dolphin fish and stuff like that and yeah you literally just see a chain that goes down to and it just disappears it's pretty scary when you you know I mean you at the end sometimes you're on your way and you'll see a shark on the way over there and then you've got to jump in in your luck flour yeah I've had friends that were hunters that got into spearfishing they say it's basically like hunting yeah you're hunting underwater hmm you know you're yeah and and also the element of holding your breath yeah exactly so there's an athletic element to it and the fucking predators underwater they're they're way scarier than predator is on land because you can't get away or some thing you do it's know that well you know a little it's it's unreal so I get to watch him like you know mate Jack Lemmon done little shout-out to him as well so I get to go down there more taking all these perform forever like five minutes you'll be down there look sometimes when it's murky you'll go down he'll just disappear and I start getting nervous so I'm lonely I feel like I'm by myself you know what I mean and then you just you hear a shoot so you'll hear that made like oh yeah go and then you'll just come up I'm like where is he and I'll see come up like 100 meters away and stuff like that but do you know it's a it's not real so it really is it's something that I think you should have you see how I've never done I need to get it yeah my friend Bert just got back we've had Valentine Thomas on the podcast before and she does it basically professionally okay yeah she's always spearfishing and her whole Instagram poop her Instagram her Instagram is all like her spirit she was a lawyer she was training to be a lawyer in Montreal okay she was like what the fuck am i doing

all dedicated to her catch him wild fish Oh far out and she's hot she speed ups yeah yeah the fucking spear in it okay when did she get that far out god damn that's huge is that a swordfish or Marlin that's a Marlin Marlin ya know how do you even how does that even work you know I don't know I mean how what yeah how do you pull that fucker pull the trigger and then just lock your house even begun to the boat or something like that I mean that's some serious line on that thing how do you get close to that I caught one Marlin once it was a small Marlin and it was like 70 pounds and it was so hard to pull in it was it's kind of fucked up stories with my my oldest daughter and she was I won't say she was 12 or 13 and she was vegetarian cuz she loves animals I'm like let's go catch a fish it would be great you know you catch a fish and he eat it and cuz she had like started eating like a little bit of me yep so I take her we catch tomorrow in five minutes into the trip they pull it on board beat it to death with a club all right in front of it she's like oh it's big I have a dog right there beating this thing with clubs you see the look at her poor face she's like ooh welcome back to the it didn't die quick either it kept making it flop around every now and then it would like come back to life a little bit and flop around you see get back to know it was a bit traumatic like yeah but I love fishing man this is one of my favorite things to do I love it yeah well watch because I get into the I'll do a bit of hunting and stuff myself so y'all watch their made it up what's that yeah Tommy that's cool in Australia yeah yes yes a great bunt yeah shout out to my friend Adam green tree yeah yeah yeah oh there you go there that came from Australia all right well well yeah okay Asiatic water buffalo and dangerous motherfuckers okay the big I've never never never done like that topping the vein right up there he'll take you don't go yeah if the offers don't do it yeah drag me out there's nothing for exactly mosquitos and crocodiles they drank water that they filtered out it still tasted like buffalo piss yeah is the Buffalo's pista swaller no just just filter it one key it's funny you say that because I wanted to you know gave you that a kangaroo hat those are there okay it was there we go cheese if I would didn't live in North America Australia's world live yeah yeah I love it there I don't go there very much because the fucking flights do want oh yeah he likes that so so it was a sight that I was gonna actually get you they even had a crocodile belts and stuff like that but I wanted actually get you a knife custom-made one we've luck and I was gonna get lucky maybe crocodile skin it by just time thank you next time next time hey thank you very much for the Hat look at all these fucking crocodiles Oh actually what's that video yeah look at this fuck where's that green tree this is probably in Australia so they're the Everglades I don't know but what I mean I could no those are crocodiles bro that's not alligators if you look at their snouts they're they're long and thin crocodiles have a long thin us now whereas alligators have like a blunt snout I mean I could be wrong but I don't think I am and the fact where you could be going past a little little pond or not even just a little pepper puddle and there'll be a big croc laying in it and stuff like that this is so ridiculous that scares ya hold my beer why go for a boat so many it's so many I mean that's insane that doesn't mean make sense I don't know where that is maybe that's Africa but if it's Australia fuck you Adam green tree yeah I mean that's all I think I don't think I could do that how to be a I'll be the snakes and all that when I was younger I used to be a pretty wild you know I mean like I'll do anything you know I'm not one give me on a snowboard I'll try backflip off a cliff and you know cliff jumping and I'll do it all like I was a silly but now that obviously I can't afford to get injured and you're having kids and the kids that really really does that for you of doing some of that sort of stuff so now we wait to skate up there you shouldn't we need you know very important very important so your position now where you are the UFC champion what is next is it a rematch with max Holloway locally right now we don't really have anything locked in obviously I think they'll waiting for clearances and stuff like that but hand clear now yeah yeah so many months ago was the fight now it was a December 15th so yeah a few months so it's a I just had like my first like wrestling sessions and grappling sessions they held up well so you're not told her my dog that and you know he's a he's happy to they're more than happy for the June obviously there's a perf card in June and yeah so that's something that you know give a pin in there anything I've got a couple of screws yeah so I've got a couple of screws in there but and I've done a bit of ligament damage as well we don't know if that was before the fight or during the fight but you know again I'm back in the training and then taking me long to get fit and I try to do again I'm professional try to keep training but nothing's locked in nothin's locked in we haven't even really had that conversation yet but all you know everything's pointing to you know perfect and even Max Payne the rematch you know that's what they know what keeps bringing up but we haven't had that conversation I think for the division and for me I think that that probably is still the biggest fight it's enough I yeah you gotta make it's a big there's nothing else that makes sense that horizon that's the thing you know Ortega is gonna fight Korean Zombie and I don't know what the fuck happened this weekend we're holy smack jay Park I just missed that so I oh I knew that that could have happened because when when oh yeah Korean zombie done done the interview like way when they had the translator with all that sort of happened I was like watching it so I knew I knew what happened he and Ortega said that he was gonna slap him but he actually said this he was going I'm gonna slap you if when I say or something like that why was he saying that because Jay Park was translating for for Korean Zombie and supposed to be he said things that you know insulted Ortega and I'll tell you didn't like it so he said he was gonna but did he say things well he translates yeah that's where a lot of people are saying but I think you know he didn't translate fully and then he just sort of had his opinion as well like so maybe so I think you know jay Park mother just said that he was duckin Duck and zombie when he got injured oh you know they were meant to fight and that happens so I think he said that himself as in I don't know was weird so I was away though so it was in a way I was backstage we've we've easy you know so we go out there and you know what's the boys and then we all huddle up and do our thing and then I went back and then it just happened so it was a joke my my coach ends up telling me suck on all right there was a fight just there and he didn't really know who it was but and then I got told by a couple of people and then I'm like oh man how bitch'll is that that Jay Park cause I didn't know was it can't do that yeah and I can't smash he's a tiny little guy yeah yeah you can't smack that guy even if you want to I mean if you want to point at him and get in his face and make him nervous that's fine yeah exactly you're a goddamn professional killer yeah exactly I mean Brian Ortega is a killer mmm can't be smacking some guy was a rapper yeah that's it well if we wanted to get that fight again I think it worth because anyway wasn't he wasn't it scheduled I don't know if that was enough though because it was scheduled and then it didn't happen Ortega has gone through a series of pretty significant injuries and just keep happening to her I heard the him and was a bit as well I don't know if that's happened so I don't know but I'm oh that's that is what I heard that's right you're right it was Calvin cater Jeremy Stephens ands a beat in Ortega okay those are the things that I heard but after chanson Jung knocked out Frankie Edgar who knows maybe they would make that fight now but but I don't want to reward people for smacking people you know yeah I mean they shouldn't make a fight just because he smacked jay Park yeah here in there so that's again like when you're talking about the division and lucky what's next for me I was while I was injured I thought there's so many people that are probably one far away from a title shot yeah I believe you know I mean you got your your or Tigers is a bit you know Korean zombie you know yeah I think any of them fight each other you know and win you know I think the clean number one I think you know I mean obviously people gonna always say you know you know max deserves that immediate rematch and things lion dur seeing that but I mean I think they could have had a you know case there to actually but no one did anything so right now you know I'm not I'm not gonna wait around expression when there's Aussie card you know and yeah I think they've been talking to Mac so I don't even know again we haven't even had that comes out I just do my thing I'll let my team do do theirs and I just do my thing and but nothing's happened yet it's a hot division I mean that division it's hard you know just like Calvin cater who's another guy who's on the up that's a dangerous guy this is so much talent that division yeah it's an amazing division really yeah 145 is one of the if you look at stack divisions one of the most Activision's in the sport yeah I think so yes that for sure it's a lot of killing a lot of killers in there and now they all go there their eyes on me so I well I was so impressed with the fight you fought against max because for to fight your style for five rounds you have to be in tremendous shape because you have a such an explosive style your style is so movement leg leg kick heavy and then power shots I mean you're throwing so many power punches like to just your sheer output and you're not touching people you're smashing you know mean it's like it's a very it's a very difficult style to maintain for five rounds yeah well it is but you know again I've always been a hard worker and we train hard we definitely yeah we all put in putting out we under if you've ever we call a workout we do despite we call it spider I was named after someone but yes spider so it's just literally fight gone ban and it's just the hardest whatever you're fighting if it's a free rounder you'll do the free rounds it's a five-round you do the five round it's like the hardest five-minute rounds that you can think of and like they just put your you versus everyone like the atmosphere is absolutely crazy and lucky if you just say in the workout you'll be like well you know that okay that explains why I spit you know what I mean it's it's crazy really is so we put the hard yards in and you know obviously to have a star like like that like you said you know you got to put the work in but again it as you're saying like you know obviously they're not just touching like there's a lot of big shots but you know I always try and break the rhythm so a lot of times I I am you know there will be a couple touch and then couple cuts end and run through and I just try and mix it up really well and I think that we worked really well we've max obviously gets a real date but I won't get do them up be remiss I can't give too much right well you could give away this what was the game plan coming into that fight and was anything unusual for you like when when you actually wound up fighting max was there anything once you were actually in the Octagon with him was anything unusual not like everything pretty much went to how we thought it was gonna go so that he made adjustments during that fight we both were adjusting so you know I don't know if many people would have would have seen it but even when it come to just a way like you know I would go in the nutrient counter and then you would be like pretend to counter then pull back then counter you know nummy well short of just having these little battles but always leg kicks were going to be a big part not just to hurt his leg but just to really break his with him and you know and make him you know obviously he loves that jab and he stays pretty heavy on that front leg yes and whether that's you know making him adjust you know he stance and and just putting him in a position that he's not comfortable with and he's been fighting forever in this style and been so effective for him so you know him even been a couple inches back you know so he's not so heavy on that front leg that just froze his whole rhythm up you know I mean and that's what a lot of people it's funny a lot of people gonna go he's gonna make adjustments he's gonna check the kicks and all that be good remember he's you know he's a volume fighter if he starts adjusting so much you know I mean starts worrying about all that then he can't stick to a game that's been so successful for himself so uh I don't know I'm expecting the same thing I'm expecting a guard and do my thing but again you will mix it up but I give too much away right you saw some adjustments where he switched to southpaw do you guys anticipate that as well yeah yeah yeah we anticipated that yeah so that was a again like you're gonna hit you know smack the leg that many times I'm sure you know yeah but again it's just even though you know he does switch stances a lot so we were ready for but I mean for him to actually do the whole rounding in Southport I think there was a third round or later in the second he sort of switched but in the third he was left out but for a while and that's where you know I was probably my biggest around it's very couple lot so then he tried to come back to Orthodox but you know just again I'm so so good at playing what's in front of me so he did make adjustments and I adjusted again and it's just again I think that goes back to training we've so many different bodies and installs and you know I mean that no surprises comfort on that's how I look at her yeah you mean you guys have a crazy crazy team you really stop and think about it you know Dan hooker Israel Adesanya and you just alone and I'm sure you guys got a bunch of killers coming up right well I'm telling you there's some guys in you go there and you train and there's guys that do it as a hobby they just train there as a hobby and they could be in the UFC I'm sure it's a blowout look it's always guys like that you know Jiu Jitsu there's always a guy like why aren't you competing ya know like you roll them and they're like like elite black belts there's always these guys that just really love it but they don't feel like doing it for a living yeah I mean it's a blowout you know I've trained with a lot of people and then I'll go there and I'll have this guy that hasn't even had amateur fight and he's giving me problems Neela what's going on here you know but it's a it's cool again that's what makes a great gym right yeah I mean it's not just the main stars it's all the supporting talent that you have in the gym as well yeah yeah well that's again your knowns a you know even in our gym you know we've got a couple of guys even amateurs that fought you know we all treated the same you know I mean when when it's fight time if they're doing that spider workout everyone's here you know even when you're a city kickboxer on all right our gym like you know the champions will still be there supporting the other guys that are doing their spider you know what I mean so everyone's it's just one big family sort of feel and like again we're we're obviously a freestyle far dingy but we've been welcomed as a part of the family in it and I think that's a big big part of you know why they're so successful as well just that sort of team camaraderie you know I mean it's for sure I mean it when you see it when one of you guys fights yeah everyone's there to support it's a it's a big factor yeah definitely so that again you know maybe I just think it you know obviously it's working well we're doing good things and think therefore yeah it's here to keep posted for an hour at the mom and we'll just kick in the moon's up what did you think about a lasagna versus your Romero yeah it's a tricky one you know it means obviously a lot of people you know and I'm not gonna obviously wasn't the most you know wasn't so many exchanges and stuff like but I guess you've got to look at it why that happened and I think y'all you know obviously was just sitting there waiting for for easy to come in every time you know easy did commit to something he just come out like he literally was gonna wait till you come in and I'm just gonna throw bombs obviously is he knows that so he's trying to touch him trying to get him to react and you know you know waiting for him to explode and things they just didn't happen and so was just a tricky on me and that's why a lot of people don't say whatever but you're never in there you don't really know what it feels like to you actually in there and someone like Romero he can take care of like that you know what I mean so yeah I didn't like the criticism of it there's not much how it's out of Sun you could have done and yeah well like I mean I guess he's he's selling that is he didn't do anything that he wouldn't fight him man-to-man but that's not true yeah because he didn't come forward yeah like he's he's selling as if he was chasing Izzy and is he wasn't doing anything but that's not what happened like is he was trying to get him to engage and he didn't want to engage he was literally standing there at the beginning in the fight standing still which is kind of crazy there was that was like a solid minute or something or landing still and then he was switch stances a little bit true yep stand still true couple little he but he's lulling you to sleep and you saw that when he did land a couple good left hands yet when is he did try to connect when he did try to get close chart bought into it a little bit and yo all through that fucking left hand yeah crazy how fast that guy is yeah I mean so again like you know when you're just you can sense that as soon as I do commit to anything he's just gonna come guns blazing obviously you know fair enough obviously there's gonna be a lot more opportunities if he started trying to do stuff as well but the fact that he done nothing to lose just ready to explode it it makes things a how it is you know if you want to fight smart if you're trying to find smart as well you know and he should fight smart and I think you need smart I think he did I mean day this is what fighting is all about some fights like Zhang Wei Li and Yanni on Jay check is super super exciting but that styles those styles matched up you mean not every fight is super exciting robert whittaker fought Yoel in a very exciting way but I mean that's a bad way to fight with that guy yeah you're Welles a fucking beast he just even just hidden him or even like a I reckon easy from the leg kicks now obviously that would have been hurting a romera but it's probably hurting yourself kicking him you know I mean just solid rock he's a solid you could imagine France stuffing he didn't just a break well so what Rockhold said he said every time he hit him and hurt him well the guy's just he's a freak man and he's 42 it's like what in the fuck man crazy absolutely crazy I I really felt like that was how is he how to fight him I really didn't think that he could fight him any other way I mean I've expected that uses length use his reach use his attributes stay on the outside used the he's a higher level kickboxer use that yeah and try to lure him into you know attacking and counter those those attacks but it's one of those things where it's like if you seem like when tyron woodley fought wonderboy kind of same thing a lot of people were saying all those are boring fights well that's how you have to fight that guy yeah exactly that's how you fight him and you wait on him and you could remember you know I mean obviously all let's just go there let's just be you know really exciting but you lose ever forgets about yeah it's about you you gotta have that sort of especially if you champion you gotta you gotta fight the fight that's gonna get you to win and you only have so many holes that can get punched in your card right those those punch holes are valuable and you let yourself get cracked when you didn't have to there's no need for that yeah you should always fight smart it's dangerous enough we'll fight smart hit and not get hit you know such a you know that's that's how I believe as well you know that's what it's just Stiles it's just Stiles the way Stiles matchup like here's another example Paulo Costa Paulo Costa and him that stylistically is gonna be fuckin crazy cuz that guy that guy fought Romero the way Romero wanted someone to fight him and he still fucked him up and they didn't fuck him up I shouldn't say that he's still won and even whether or not he won was you know close yeah it's close very close some people saw the other way but I mean he had Romero with everything but the kitchen sink there's a there's a picture that I put on my Instagram of him head kicking Romero I mean it's lean and cost is a knockout artist and he's he's shinning him right upside the head and like doesn't even budget it's not even moving there well Romero has a huge scar down the back of his neck and I think he's his neck is fused and I think that's part of one of the reasons why he kind of moves funny okay yeah I'll glue this leave this photo oh yeah I mean Blaine it even looks like he just went into that as well huh I mean he's ducking into it he's catching it right in the face and nothing happened that's a big dude kicking you laid to his his neck also there's a big scar it's really big I've never seen a neck surgery scar is that large and it's he said he almost died you know he said he had some sort of serious neck injury and you know I mean when you're a silver medalist in the Olympics in the Cuban national gym the fucking wrestling practices those guys must have in the wrestling actual matches that he's had I'm sure the wear and tear on the bodies yeah unbelievable beragon is one of wrestling's gonna be one of the hottest sports it's one of the hardest and by far looking at you obviously don't name a mag or do a lot of wrestling and yes just seeing them scramble luck there's nothing like a scramble and just see the scream was they have to train for yes I imagine that the training you've got to do to be able to just do a two-minute scramble or something like that it's just mean it's crazy yeah and the test of wills in there like they relish and being uncomfortable you know in a lot of ways exactly right they enjoy it they like being really fucked up and uncomfortable well that's that's a big part of our you know you've got to be comfortable when things get uncomfortable or you know could have worded that better but that's something that I'm all about you know I put myself in uncomfortable positions in the gym you know day in day out or you know obviously obviously you're gonna have structure to how you how you train in a week but I put myself there and then how do you adapt to that how do you you know how do you sort of go from there so that's what again with that spider workout that's what meant to do you are gonna go to breaking point right we put you there and I'll be in that position but are you going to shy away from it or you're just gonna get up and just do whatever you can m1 will be the best because you literally can't move but it's how do you adapt to that that sort of decision of being in such an uncomfortable position so you know if it gets there that you know you're always going to be able to at least push yourself at least get you to that whatever you need to do to win that's we're a great team and a great coach comes in handy that's where it really comes into play because a fighter you know especially some fighters they want to be the hammer all the time they don't want to be the nail yeah they don't they want to be dominating in practice they don't want to feel like you know they're getting smothered and swarmed and they don't want to fuck with their confidence but you have to trust in that process you have to and there's many many fighters who don't they don't they train with guys who are not as good as them and everything goes great until it doesn't go great yeah and then they're not used to that position exactly right so I think of I've always done that I've always been even from the first day of doing MMA you know I mean I'm I'm the type of person when you're always doing that when you're always like putting yourself in uncomfortable and then you know you always got to figure ways yeah yeah so farm there's some heavy weights cuz that's the type of guy I'll train with heavy weights and you'll be losing but you know you can just sit there and accept that all along gonna find a way to get up and you're constantly doing that over the 10 years you train and you know that's where a lot of people like you know how do you hell you say fit and all that sort of stuff I think it's just for so many years of putting myself in uncomfortable positions and where not when training does get tough I'm still gonna go I'm still gonna push myself you know I'm not gonna shy away from it and it'll make me you know who are who I am today yeah I mean I just think there's such a value such a value in being able to deal with uncomfortable positions yeah and that's there's a lot of really talented really really good guys who don't do that hmm but I think if the shit gets ugly you're used to it well you say it you say it in a lot of fights where people obviously get uncomfortable and and they just it goes downhill for him yeah you see people mentally break yeah it's it's such a crazy sport man definitely do you have a mental coach I don't I actually don't have a mental culture I think it's something that I could definitely invest in and look into because again this is as they say you know so much mental in this and it really is physically mentally draining so it's a but I think I'm I'm really good in them situations a bit quite honest you know a lot but obviously I can be better right I don't get like nervous before fights at all oh yeah yeah I get more nervous when my teammates are fighting and all that I'll get nervous but when I'm fighting on me I really am I'm just I'm sweet I'm having a laugh I'm here with the coaches and the boys and you know we even have a lot of people that work with you have seen be like moving my max fighting their luck you realize you better fight for a real time I'm like yeah good luck you know what I mean that's just how I am I'm pretty chill in their positions was actually funny story on a really funny but it was a cool it was something he actually mentioned those Bisping so I end up don't wanna had a chat with him and I had pink headphones so that's a lock I had to wear him like when I'd done like an interview with him and so while I was there waiting to walk out he needed to go to the toilet in between you know breaking between the fights and he stopped and he was like oh well I felt a bit awkward because he's thinking I'm ruining this guy's mojo he's better you know walk out and I'm like I you're you're good go to toilet and he starts going and they're still trying to stay out of my way I'm like on our pink headphones I'm just having a little laugh and he's just had a laugh back and I remember on the pod on his podcast he was talking about how you know like just the fact that I was able to be so chill in I'm about to walk out for my title fight and that's just who I am oh that's I just adapt to every situation I feel like I'm pretty good in these situations as well I don't know if I need one but I think I should still invest money it's probably a good idea just to have one just to take it to another level exactly right exactly right I think you can cause I feel like I can do alright but maybe there's so many things that we don't know yeah and I think that they could help a lot you know so I'll look into that look into it I'll look into it will you like that look at your shirt I've looked into it oh whoa look at that well you um will you like that in your first couple fights and now wouldn't say I was a you know I think it again like I'm lucky when I was fighting I'll always try to keep myself level you know I'm always doing that no matter whether I'm going in the interviews or whatever it is you know safe I'm yeah better fight I'm one just relax relax don't let it luck you know don't let it take over you you know the nerves or whatever it is or the anger or what you know some people get hyped up I don't want to get how I want to be level-headed I've got a game plan to stick to so I've always done that and because I've always done that in my fights and in all situations I really am like level rock when it went off fight so sometimes it was hard for me to realize I want a world title because I'm so used to keeping myself so composed that it was like it didn't happen I won the World title I was like there's a video of me backstage and I'm like looking at the bow of my far-out look it's you know what I mean like you know I even say something like that I'm like go on you're the fucking champ like wake up you know I'm like it's right there exactly like you know I'm just seeing they're still walking around just like nothing happens that's probably a good way to be it is it does help me in my fights it really does and I take instict or game plan when you know so composed and little headed in there so I've believed it it works it works for me but yeah again I wish I could be more excited about being a champ that maybe it's not a bad thing I mean maybe it's great to keep this mindset throughout your entire career yeah yeah when you retire you can go holy fuck what did I do yeah like the Vegas trip I sort of was like what the hell did I do the last couple days that's a little different yeah so you say you hunt do you is wild game is that a part of your diet yeah yeah yeah obviously yeah you know I like to eat that a level that type of stuff and I've done it from a young age like with my dad like so we used to you know even go like hunting enough for goat and our pigs and stuff like that and you know we can get the spit down like world war over there like we have to turn up with our hands in the air like full of all tangled yeah so yeah man I'm yeah I don't know to be honest when I'm in camp I don't I can't get out there and stuff like that but but I'm all for I love it I love it I swallow water a lot of you and always say you gave me meat and all that and I love that I love that top stars my favorite food I love it what's your favor mate elk elk yeah is that I've never I've never got to taste any of them push you around I'll give you some you were in town I'll give you some she cook it well sometimes we get when I fought in America there's a lot of places that will have these stops up boys in flat camp you know what's hilarious lightweight if you get it if you're an American you get it at a restaurant it comes from New Zealand oh really yeah and then nuts that's crazy yeah because I'll try like you can't sell wild game in America you can't sell okay yeah it's that's one of the reasons why it almost went extinct elk deer all these animals almost went extinct at the turn of the century the 20th century because they did what's called market hunting when there was no refrigerators back then they shot everything in this served it to people and they didn't think about conservation at all so they got whitetail deer down to like a really low number elk we're down to a really not mean the extirpated it from many many states where it used to be a game animal in many many states it's not it's not there anymore father yeah I think it's something crazy like it's it's only in ten to twenty percent of its native range where it used to be but it's they're very healthy populations in those states now Colorado's very healthy Montana Wyoming Idaho Utah's where I go every year it's so it's delicious meat though yeah that's someone I'll I know that Boise's in Idaho mmm yes there's a fort there and I wanted to go and explore like because I knew it was a lot of big big hunting over there so I was like I wanted let's go for a drive and see if I could see any luck in a deer or elk or whatever it was but I didn't get a chance that was got Grizzlies you know Grizzlies are staying the careful's and being bears yeah all right who's got bears I have friends at hunting Idaho and they they get real nervous when they shoot something all those wolves - wolves and Grizzlies like that yeah if you shoot and Wyoming does as well if you shoot an elk and so does Montana but if you shoot an elk in any of those states that have Grizzlies they're very dangerous because usually it takes a couple trips to pack it out okay like if you shoot an elk and elk is you know probably eight nine hundred pounds oh yeah and you're not gonna carry it all I was like you and your friend if you pack it out unless you have some four-wheel drive vehicle that can get back to it or you have horses they they use horses hunters use horses to pack out meat aisle have a whole train of horses like five or six horses no they'll take the pack you know put all the meat distributed evenly on the horses and get out of there in one trip and yeah because if not then you got to go back late scent rolling you gotta hope that motherfucker doesn't smell it cuz if they smell it they claim it I have a buddy of mine who killed an elk and they came back to the carcass and it was buried oh really fucking down happen to Adam green tree that had him at happen didn't he say that on his I think he saved it on his Instagram page he shot an elk I want to say he's buried yes grizzly came and buried it that's what they do that well they did the whole area besides there's oh well for them digging holy shit yeah it's like that's crumpling up a piece of papers wall he's covered this fucking Elkhart here it is oh where was he at does it say give me some volume on this oh it's a moose others Alaska shit yeah blow it man yeah refreshes so we can hear although the words is it a good idea to get back there now that's a terrible idea might I be shitting myself right now mate yeah the other guy I don't like this see the other problem is that grass look at the grass that grass is like five feet high you can't even see the motherfucker if it's coming yeah that's what's scary that thing could be 30 yards away just watching them walk up on the shit shitty position so he got most of the meat out of there but the bear had taken some of it but they had to dig it up and if I wrap yeah my desk carry oh so scary Matt Lisa even crocodiles Alicia's otter I noticed sort of stay away from the water or something yeah well that that's the problem is it it had decided that that mousse was his yeah you know and they were yeah they're all over it's a big fucking animal Matt is that another videos at two videos what's this thing I'm trying to get it out of there Man Overboard I mean gone we take the take the end let's just go oh you want that meat though well what's today's oh I'll get you so they've already cut it all up and heading back so there's what I was saying okay they cut it up and they were carrying now okay yeah one step at a time so all right yeah so say if you and I shot a moose and we were out there you know we both put like a hundred pounds on her back and we like and everything of the organ they were trips mate would be already packed up and yes Oh careful that would technically cut it they put it in these game bags and then they let it sit there since I've been on meat-eating yeah exactly so when they went back it all been buried oh it's a scary situation to me yeah I know obviously we got a lot of snakes and all that so that's what a lot of people like gone you know fucker straddle you go there yeah it's weird like you literally you know there are a lot of snakes and spiders and stuff like that but now the yeah that even that make that a talk to you about the spear fisherman he's just that he's like a Stevo and like he's just that you know in everything everything he does he could I've seen him like run he was on like a swing jumped off and then realized there was a octopus in the water just goes there jumps and dives in somehow got like just don't even how you catch it goes in boom pulls this big octopus out and just the situations like that man I've seen him even other times we're walking you see a lizard jump in the water he's just dived in like his head and arm goes in boom pulls out this big visit just you know there's just crazy things connected to the wildlife for then you know obviously we snakes I know I saw stuff and he's catching the snakes and octopus will fuck you up - man they have their beak they scare me man they scare me yeah well they even just them sticking to y'all feel like plus they're smarter shit ya know a smart I've seen some mad videos of a month only live like a couple of years oh yeah yeah I think that octopus is life how long Jamie shaken said it's like max two years maybe yeah Bridge about a year maybe average - it's what we looked at we've looked it up a couple times that's like that's why they don't take over the world because they're like two-year-old babies but they're fucking smarter shit man they figure out how to open up jars and shit I've watched them videos I mean they they obviously know their size so they put a tentacle fur and a lock oh yeah I can fit for that it's like this yeah and the big octopus lie and then I press as long as the big kangaroo mm-hmm nobody can go first yeah and you watch them do that you know what look yeah crazy three to five it says crazy octopus giant octopus three to five years and then died of old age smaller scary they're delicious yes so yeah I used to feel bad that I was eating them but then I found out they only live five years I'm like what am i cut in a year out of your life you know yeah so I'm saying everything in the you know obviously in the wall there in Australia we've seen it's a pretty crazy thing because some wise you know like the hunting stories are always some crazy stories well you have a crazy place too because so much of your wildlife is invasive so much of your wildlife has been introduced because the people that put your ancestors there they decided they were trying to turn that place into some wild hunting habitats they brought over stags and red deer and all these animals that thrive over there yeah there are all invasive species they a man well we got all make the day their day everywhere in the airlock so where I live is unlocked a beach coastline there and I've got mountains and they're just deer everywhere like they just walk in people's yards and and stuff like that and I've seen the photos of them on the beaches and stuff like that just there where people come if you need me oh yeah exactly like my friend Adam I mean he's all he eats his wild game and he you can hunt in so many different places over there yeah for sure and they treat him like like a red deer over there is it's like a rodent or a pest alright yeah so many of that's what I mean the DS especially are there they're just thousands of millions of just everywhere everywhere you go there and just to any open paddock in the afternoon and I'll be you you'll see like herds of New Zealand's the same way right yeah they brought in all those animals and just left them there and now there's no predators yeah luckily there's no predators but they fuck up in Australia and bring over some predators they brought over cats and wild cats in Australia are a big problem they kill it devastated ground nesting birds and all sorts of different wildlife and it's one of the weirder things about bow hunting in Australia is that they'll hold up cats like like something they killed okay take a house cat holding up a house can't smile like look I got him yeah like what the fuck the same way people would here with the coyote okay hunters kill as many coyotes as they can over here okay coyotes kill fucking cats and dogs and the killer chickens and they've killed all my fucking chickens already watch the chickens they killed nine of them at one time yeah I've had a bunch they killed them slowly and then they got em all at once we had a fire out here and the fire burnt down my chicken coops I put him in a smaller chicken coop okay and the Coyotes tore open the chicken coop and killed my nine remaining chickens all in one night bad feathers everywhere they're monsters they're clever they're really interesting animals okay part of me admires them because they're really they're really smart little fuckers they're really smart and they're sneaky like they'll they'll trick a dog into chasing after them and then a couple other coyotes are we waiting and they'll jump the dog and kill it oh really yeah far out yeah what is this here Australia's deadly serious about killing millions of cats eat yeah hold on a fucking cat yeah feral felines are driving the country's native species to extinction now a massive culling is underway to preserve what's left of the wild someone who didn't understand wildlife introduced cats there to deal with other small animals because I think they had brought they brought something else over there that was causing problems I think rabbits I think that's what it was I think they brought rabbits over there and the rabbits were fucking everything up so like hmm what can we do rabbits reading almost Oh cats though and they just created a mess so they're they're trying they literally would like all wild cats to be extinct yeah you do you do see a fair bit of Matt day yeah well cats in America kill billions with a B billions of birds and mammals every year yeah every year they kill billions birds and mammals and so that's why I know a lot of the farmers and that they obviously can't you know even in my again my mate like is he just you know they kill so many native birds and all that sort of stuff and as well he's not a big fan of him but yeah yeah it's just again like it's bloody crazy they get some of them get big as well I've seen photos of but they look like a house cat but then they're just like huge if they're holding like this and they're almost touching the ground you're like what good and I've seen some ones that were black so they look like a paper or something lighter paper they're not just a cat result fire 28 pound house says the number fluctuates from between two to six million depending on the weather mount of cats in Australia yeah holy shit dropping poison sausage out of the air to kill the cat yeah oh well that's gonna fuck everything else up because other things gonna eat the poison sausage yeah what in the hell man why don't they ever figure that out you can't just do that yes they estimated over over two hundred thousand cats were killed in the first 12 months after the plan was announced dropping lethal sausages from the sky is only part of the country's efforts to eradicate the feral cats yeah they they dig some places they have a bounty on them like we shoot cats they'll give you money oh really yeah yeah they have that with wolves in some places too you shoot wolves they'll give you money because the wolves will fucking up so much wildlife and might get pretty like you said with the Coyotes and all that look you can just the end and the Bears and all that sort of stuff hunting some scary stuff you can get real yeah because you're out there you're putting yourself in the food chain and yeah obviously we've got a lot of poisonous things and little things that'll get ya but then over there over here it just seems like everything's big that'll just fuck you up well Australia's crazy too because most people live on the outside yeah the inside is just madness yep I'm a that they're a bit different as well I don't know if what's lucky but when you get west and all that and you know just a bit different so I'll go like we'll go out there and even just driving on the roads and yeah we will sit there and like a wave of someone and you know the worst these they will just be like they just lift a finger up as in that should that say hello they just they just bread so much different over there so the people the bush yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what we call Westies sorry that guy that whiskeys they're spooky folks that live out in those weird places no we talked about that I think you just said it to the number of birds that they kill is like at least in America it says it's estimated 1.3 to 4 billion birds a year yeah they add mammals to that number which equals like reptiles and other things six point three to twenty two point three billion mammals are killed every year by United States that's way more than people have been alive ever the more than all the people ever every year the fuck's lost they're cute you little Park you pat them leaper dick [Laughter] little murderers it's amazing stats I crazy sizes that rallyin that said just by the way and you know it's even more look at that Wow in addition of mammals catskill in addition an estimate 377 million birds and six hundred forty nine million reptiles every year in Australia that's fuckin nuts far out yeah you know some asshole brought them over there not that long ago I think they brought them over in the 1800s yeah I've heard like a couple of different like cases where that they bring people in and notices yeah something just went backwards for them yeah you can't just bring things places you can't just get you know what's actually predator was the cane toads so they got introduced for I can't men on the mana fear this one but they bring them in and now they're just a complete lock past like they're they lock up those big fuckers yeah yeah they're big what they bringing me for probably for some other stupid reason I remember yeah beetles in the sugar fields yeah there you go too many beetles bring them and now now they're like a massive problem you know the main side 19:35 these dipshits they're brought to Australia from Hawaii with the intention of controlling the cane bead on the sugar cane fields in North Queensland cane beetles live on the high upper stalks the cane plant cane toads can't jump up that far so they barely had any impact these fucking idiots they didn't know jack shit in 1935 they couldn't Wikipedia shit right some some idiots like you gotta justify your job Toad's we're gonna bring toads are we talking about the for pest campaign that happened whoa look at the size of that prick look at the one in the middle click on that one in the middle the middle hole oh shit a person look at that look at those fucks yeah man Jesus Christ well they started off though all up though up north in like Queensland and then they just now they're now they're all in New South Wales and they just explained it's just they're gonna take over so I don't even actually this is this is that sir I knew about luck eight years ago so it's probably quadrupled by now or like they probably have covered it all around even though what do they use to kill the cane toads they're gonna bring in birds have we talked about the for pest campaign that's like anxious not ancient but like it's a historical event that happened that looks like the death of 35 million people in China no yeah they had a sparrow problem or swallows which ever was a small bird mm-hmm so there was there are an annoyance that they allowed people to kill them they're like bang pots and pans to get rid of them that work to get rid of them but then all of the bugs then ate all the rice fields that led to a famine that led to 25 or 35 million people dying oh geez so it would have been better off for the birds yeah well looks like a hole it's a historical event that people need to keep in mind when these things happen that there's a very sensitive ecosystem yeah was that a 1935 as well nobody learned yeah it's a no man I don't know how they're gonna get rid of those frogs do they have an idea I don't know I mean I don't know too much I just remember hearing that stats all fall on Frodo out there but I don't know it's bloody I think I mean I remember seeing videos over and there was like just the floors absolutely covered of in certain spots up in Queensland like absolutely covered like actually it was in a Simpsons one that was it was a Simpsons episode yeah I would call them shares roses or something like that someone comes they beat him they like the plot sticks and be a four person thing was a couple years later it's 1958 to 1962 mmm interesting so they learn from 35 well maybe those toe tastes good maybe they should start eating toads I think frog legs are delicious are they poisonous no problem yeah that's maybe not maybe not cane toads poisonous I'm fine down here that's have you ever had frog legs uh yes I have well they're cooked well they're good wait I'll have that I did have that and I was actually what was it it was actually a mixture of our four chicken and fish the ones I had yeah is that you recognise everything but no one's died from that well get sick they have boiled toad eggs Oh oh boy toad eggs so they're vent they have some sort of poison says yeah there came to those poison glands through their whole lifecycle mmm depends on when it's killed depends on what that's for animals so they it kills it's bad for animals dogs oh well that's great that means you can't eat them that means these fuckers they're running around making sure that predators don't eat them I'm animal to bring over here to kill beetles you fucking assholes you should find that guy from 1935 and kick his ass or go back in time like what we thinking man what a dumb move like over a poison toad that no one can eat what I said well as the foot bug said literally for bugs that's crazy yeah and the fact that it's poisonous which is not venomous poisonous which means if they eat it they die so these predators if you brought over a bunch of fucking jackals or something to go eat the frogs yeah are the toads they would wind up dying cane toads oh they do have venom secreting poison glands known as paranoid glands or swellings on each shoulder where poisons released if they are threatened when they're threatened if ingested the venom can cause rapid heartbeat excessive salivation convulsions and paralysis and can result in death from any native animals great so you can't even fucking kill them with predators God it's up well maybe we get the cats to eat the cane toads maybe that's the move I swear look I could be wrong right the mercy look at this the most humane way to kill cane toads to put them in the freezer alive humane that's the most humane well myoga I think I remember getting told like that back in the day like you you had to kill him if you seen him or something like oh that was a that was a kill if you can the months popular method was used to kill millions of poisonous pets until it was banned 20 years ago because animal ethics committees considered it inhumane oh you fucks it's all those fucking animal rights people they ruin everything what about our rights huh got poisoned toads everywhere assholes how do you get rid of it what does it say remove toad temptations and make your home a cane toad free zone you know sign you decide hey where it came code free zone yeah cover or bring pet food in at night as it attracts cane toads remove standing water oh great how you can do that what about ponds what about puddles remove rubbish and other degrees debris so cane toad cannot shelter under it during the day keep your outside lights off when not needed keep toads out by creating a barrier all right far out indeed I don't know that offense if they can't jump that high just hire people aren't be able to kill them give them a lot make it valuable to kill them I'm telling you I think it was Furby I think that honestly I remember if you save on a lot of think you you had taught under supposed to kill yeah I don't know I could be wrong maybe I just heard that from someone and you want them with it good archery practice if you had a lot of arrows you know because it's not a big target it's a good thing to shoot that fucking crazy assholes bring over fucking poisonous toads estimated over 200 million so you have so crazy that's so many toads 200 million toads Jesus Australia yeah I don't know about that one crazy yeah so what do you eat during camp let's burn well actually I got a dietitian I'm bored now so he does a few a few of us a you know he does easy in that as well and do you get me up like like now I usually get that but now I just yeah he just gives me a sort of game playing a go Evo sorry no game a diet plan yeah meal plan and you know I just scare or viously I've got options and stuff like that and it's a game changer man it really is like I said from what I used to eat to now and I'm talking even just a couple of a couple of fights ago like you know I mean I was a do my own thing and you know the fight workout literally just eat chicken and nuts and this wasn't that long girls and you know I was ranked and I was just eating like chicken and nuts and just to played myself so much I don't get me wrong I end up pretty light but I mean it was not it was not good for the body that's for sure so when will you start so I'd save you have a fight and it's eight weeks out when we start the dieting process to try to lose weight and when are you just eating just for health yeah well I'm I'm always trying to all year-round I try sit for the last few months all year round I'm trying to eat in a reasonably good you know during the week and then the weekends I'll I sort of just do whatever and I still do that all the way through to my fight till about two weeks and my last you know cheat meal as people would say like you know my last time I'll actually do that but you know it's just again I'll when I'm in Kyoto know if my body just knows obviously this science tour but sometimes I swear meeting the same and as I get close to the fight maybe I'm training that little bit harder or maybe I'm having that little bit less sugar or whatever it is you know the sauce I'm cutting I don't really realize but it's just fine little things I'm doing and the waitress just falls off and how much do you cut the week of the fight the wake of the phone I'm usually about seven kilograms out you know so it seems like a lot but I hold a lot of water and then once that's about fifteen sixteen pounds yeah yeah I think so yes I'm about there and you know a lot of it will end up coming off during the week so again I hold a lot of water so I blow it up man I look at a piece of bread and I'll put on five kilos or yeah actually I mean I'll probably it myself in trouble but I end up weighing in at 145 so yeah 145 are usually a little bit less actually last few times and I was getting up to 160 what was at 166 or something like that camera water was my end up getting to 76 kilograms Wow so I end up putting like 22 pounds or so yes yeah overnight yeah how does that feel though when you do well I'm used to on that way or okay pretty much that's my weight I'm comfortable at you know what I mean so I'm about even two weeks out from a I'm about 75 kg you know maybe 74 but I'm pretty close to it it's a real science isn't it is 100% and again to be able to eat what I eat you know fart week and I look at the food and you're now far away can be a lot more their goods ish you know all over my social media I'm just look we are lucky I am before I when I used to do that lucky in a fight week and do my stories I'm just seeing literally show like six pieces of a nuts and a little piece of chicken we're now I got luck mad lucky meals and there you know it's obviously dicker what changed how did he change it I'll just yeah like again they just know long before I didn't know I just knew I had to cut sodium's and carbs and undo that you know you know for five days out and then again I'll deplete a lot of water but oh lucky I don't drink distilled water and stuff like that and but you know again you're still just doing similar sort of stuff but everything's more calculated now and you know and you know they they do all the measurements and you know calculate everything and this again the science to it it's crazy and then the last now I'm usually a couple of kilos heavier when I got a sweat like that from the night before but it comes off easy and I feel good so I got energy and it's easy to come off hmm so like what's a typical meal for breakfast for you fight week no like during training okay I'm just getting boats usually when I get closer I love my oats you know look it heat it up and cuz it always fills me up I feel like I can I should be eating more but I don't even eat or fills me up that much like you know so there's some meals like now because we trained so hard that that's that's what I mean by the difference you know I was eating next enough into now not even being able to eat some of the stuff that they want me to eat I'm like man I can't eat that much like you know me I probably could but I'm like I don't need to you know know meaning right right and it's amazing cause we do lock in with free full sessions a day and and some of them like you know we tell them what workouts and you know we've got a scale of one to ten how are their workout sessions you know some days you real yeah yes I'll do a you know usually three on average but again like it's gonna be controlled doesn't mean I'm I'm actually you know go on the balls to war every session you ought to be structured to it but I'll do strength and conditioning a couple days a week and then I usually when I'm back home in Australia it's the you know the free sessions every day and then sometimes I do strengthen conditioning so when we go to you know New Zealand it's usually in the morning we'll do a couple sessions and then we'll get a session at night as well so it's a but again what some of these episodes i some some of these are sort of training sessions full-on like I said and we're burnin like anywhere from 1,200 calories to more like a forty nine and we're fit so to burn them sort of calories why that fit you know it's a lot of hard work so we're doing that and then they're like you know they've gotta feed us like all this air so we can have the energy to train look and that's what I mean like some meals I'm not man I don't think I could even think that but it's crazy to be able to do that and then and like be happy with what you're eating and then go into fight week and stuff like that it's a game changer really is yeah that's where the value of having someone who's an actual nutritionist really comes into play where they tell you know this is the calories that you need and this is this is going to give you all the electrolytes and the protein the carbohydrates this is everything yeah you're good when you like you sure yeah that's exactly right but that's how it is that's what I will be like while I'm eating I'm like it's the funny thing is if you starving yourself with the chicken and the nuts like you're not gonna lose as much weight it's not gonna be as easy because your body's gonna try to hold on to food and you're not gonna have any energy yeah well Dudley done the chicken and that's fight week but I mean again early earlier in my career I was just a didn't know we're near enough I remember I remember I sort of went off my wife's a meal plan that she had and like she wasn't even training and also another meal that she wasn't meant to be having like you know the meal meals that she was have not even trained in the Nama you know obviously if you killer said I'm working a lot harder I'm obviously you know training and doing all that training I'm trying to stick to this diet that she's meant to lose weight you know what I mean so was a it's yeah that's what I'll you know that's what I would sort of do my diet and that's when the staph infections always common yeah yeah so when you say you're working out three to four times a day like how do you break up your sessions to someone is someone dictating what you're gonna be doing for the day do you have someone who plans out your workouts are you most weeks are pretty much the same but obviously you're gonna have you like that's the thing like you know Jo my coach no one knows me better than he's so he knows when I'm not on you know he knows when something's happening so those before the max flight there was a you know I I don't want to miss training sessions you know what I mean so I'm going to go there but they could see us run down and that's when the injuries can happen and there you can get sick and all this type stuff sir they pulled me up and as much as I didn't want other now and I'll be right they didn't let me train that night and have like the day off and I mean honestly that the next day the next sessions after that I was on fire and I honestly not I mean and perfect you know that was a again at the time I'm like you know don't want to miss out on trail I don't feel like it you know I don't feel like I'm I'm not working hard enough you know I mean so that's sort of how I was thinking but then the next day it just made me even work so much harder and I've done the vo2max session wrestling session and absolutely killed it you know I mean and that just it knows my last week of training and I just finished a perfect like sort of you know rotten Pig you know obviously that's why you structure to peak you know wake out and that was you know it was perfect as with the nutritionist it shows you the value of having a real professional that and and particularly someone who really knows you and knows like you're not gonna slack off your yeah you know you're a guy who's gonna go balls out yeah so if you're tired like that something's up and so many coaches or so many fighters rather don't have a coach like that yeah and so they will over train and they'll come into a fight beaten down yeah and it's it's unfortunate it really is that's what I mean the one-percenters and you were signed with the mental coaches and all that luck I just think there's so many places that you could really really you know work with it and I think they're all helping you at one percent now how much of your camp is dedicated to strength and conditioning how many Stern's and conditioning sessions I'll do anyway from me at two to three no I'm doing it yeah yeah very weak and what kind of stuff are you doing um again I started with bay made a performance so they come on board because I used to get a lot of those named Bay med bay med same it yeah performance so they deal with a lot of athletes so they do Rugby League teams and all that sort of stuff it was a that was a game changer for me because I was having a lot of problems with my back before ice thing this was before Chad Mendes so there was even times in my career where I was I thinking I might have to like give this up like you know after the Elkins fight of your back I just I have a bulging disc but like I'll get all the sciatica down the leg and at the time I just thought you're so much worse than it was and was mentally getting me and you know it's just a lower one so yeah tell you which one was but the lower one so I've got a couple of but I even went to a specialist and now telling me that you know to give it up like I don't know whether it was just something that and he has to say like you to cover himself or what so no yeah they told me to give it up and again I was already mentally getting me and then I had these guys come aboard and they're like now for my 80% of people literally have bulging discs and don't want to literally goes onto your foot you know stays flat and you're like drags and all that sort of stuff on the side occur or you can't control your bowels that's when we'll start shitting yourself okay to start but we might maybe do the surgery or something like that so this is sort of what again they were trying to get in my head and really sort of just you know let me sort of smash this mentally as well and so they started getting me thinking lion again I'm pretty good at this type of stuff so I'm not all right now or as they got me on a mad program they built a strength program specifically for my body you know for what I do fighting and all that so it's absolute game changer and I don't have problems now when I used to those times where I was having like anywhere from 14 weeks to not train and before I fought like okay yeah all consumer Kennedy I was doing next to nothing in between the fight and then literally having six weeks to do yeah so you're trying to recover well I'm trying just just trying my pain yeah so I my back will go and then I'll have like two weeks off try to get back into it it'll happen again and I was doing this for 14 weeks straight and then getting told I'm fighting and then you know door came and be like oh I've got six weeks to get myself ready do you do any spinal decompression or anything now well no not that we just do a lot of it's just again hip mobility and all that again so a lot of times I'll do a lot of mobility before I do sessions and stuff like that that really does help we've we've what what I'm doing here I want you to try this this thing I think out there yes Teeter Dex it's this thing you you climb into it's real simple you put your legs behind it almost like a leg curl mm-hmm and then you lean forward and as you lean forward all the weight is just decompresses on your back and particularly your lower back it's fantastic for it it feels so good yeah I do it after every work I do two things for my back that are really big one is a thing called the reverse hyper you ever use one of those no is that luck with the round thing that but no no that's another one that's hip glute okay a string thing the reverse hyper is this machine that was created by Louis Simmons from Westside barbell and it's like a flat bench you climb your upper body up on the bench and then you hook your legs into this thing and you lift your legs up and then you let them drop down and as it drops down at decompresses as you lift it up it strengthens well that comes from this guy Louis Simmons is like he's a powerlifting legend and he had a back injury they were they were trying to do surgery on him yeah and he was like well what's it from they were like it's from compression he's like well I gotta figure out how to decompress it so he figured out this machine that created active decompression I have one out here I swear by I love it there it is right there it shows it how it works okay so when you lift up don't stare that dude down when you lift up it goes up and then when it lives down it actually pulls the back and decompresses and it feels great pull that video that right there you could see it if you watch that video you could see that's Lily he's a fucking character he's a really wild guy but so see how it's going down yeah that thing pulls your back down so what I'll do is and the up it strengthens the back muscles in a real unique way yeah so what I'll do is I'll do that and then after I do that then I'll decompress with the Dex that's the Dex that's the thing right there so you climb into that thing and then see how she's got her hands on that those handles you let go of that and it just all it makes your lower back like how much give it to you to try out here no we're gonna climb in there you're gonna go oh I need this I love it I just wanted home to I swear by it mmm I fucking swear by this thing yeah because your own bodyweight is like pulling your spine apart and decompressing it it just relaxes everything it's very nice yeah yeah well that's it well hey you know again it's just you you need these tops that you need obviously the knowledge is getting there with everything you know the knowledge is out there so what kind of shit does they have you doing a lot of it was a strengthening so I was a a lot a big problem of mine like I was getting told like it lock your core like when I'd get my back you know and there was a bit more old-school type of stuff just lucky core you know don't do nothing you know literally do nothing for like a whole week and then try get back train and I'll injure it again oh like literally if you told me to stand up you know old luck hold my breath and luck stand up you know what I mean I was love you down well now that's just sort of my mental side of the sort of where I was at with it and there was a you know what I mean so they had to change all that they had to you know relax and I'll let me look literate they said if you you know if you drop a look this one thing he said to me the first time only because you drop a pencil pick the fucking pencil up don't fucking game plan here you're gonna pick up that pencil and like you given him he's trying to get in my head like just relax you know what I mean and the training even though this the first few sessions I started doing from a strength program like cause I would always like really hyper extend my back and like you're thinking I'm keeping it straight and you know think I'm doing the right thing but so they had to try and change my posture and everything wallows doing workouts just so I could start you know doing things properly like even when I used to do deadlifts old like try and stay as upright as I could because I thought my back would go and my back would go every time I but then deadlifts in that because of my technique was bad and just little things there so that's what I mean by having a strength program and all these sort of stuff and now luck see if I do get a flare-up you know within you know even the next day I'm back in - back in the Train and you know me we're before and I've got two weeks off literally two weeks software now I'm like back a train and like they're they're like you can't stop moving like you need to keep moving that that'll you know no no you're muddy look at my brain would literally make it lock up I'll get my hip out to the side it was bad like I really was I'd get a flare-up and I blow and then my brain would just - I go back to that position you know where you go my hip will go out and I wouldn't be able to walk for a few days and and it's just kids that was keep happening but now we're we're on top of it now it's a game-changer now I'm having camp so you know full full proper camp so that that happened before Chad Mendes so that's when I end up seeing them and I had my first like proper 12 we came for the you know for the chair minute it's amazing yeah that's amazing so what kind of stuff they have you doing other than you said deadlifts and strength oh yeah a lot of glutes cuz all my my glute my right blue it wasn't even firing just cause yeah yeah well just not just that just the fact that I would use my back muscles and core to do everything I wasn't ever activating my glutes to do stuff because you know I was just using the wrong muscles the thinking you know I was doing the right way now like yeah that's a big part of my my sort of mobility before I do what I do mama B Liddy and I get the glutes firing and stuff like that and every time I do that I feel good so a lot of that strength program is still building the glutes and and stuff like obviously you're still doing your core exercise now we're at a stage where we can just sort of build everything you know and even just having people that know what they're doing again you could go there and they can just work on everything and I a let's let's go nuts but you know the specific sort of training knowing that I got to go and do my other sessions at the other gym and all that so they all take it all in to play and you know that everything's just real structured you know you know training weeks are so much more structured than it used to be and you're seen it you know not only in performances but even my body and being able to train them it's a game-changer that's amazing wow you're really very really really fortunately you found those guys a hundred percent it was a it was huge and do any yoga stretching or um I do like it stretches and all that like I tend to I'll be honest I don't order and not focus should be sticking to especially when I'm not while I'm back home I do that in my sessions that I'm doing with them so I'm doing that I meant to be doing that every day but you know I like it I like it sometimes I should be doing a lot more so sometimes I want to do not feel I'll get tight every time I go on an airplane I come to you know come to America and all that come and I'm just stiff as a board you know I mean and but as soon as I do these mobility sort of exercises and stretches and and like get the glutes gone I'm 100% like straighter one show me someone who doesn't have a back issue that trains martial arts and I'll sorry someone who trained enough exactly at least a little bit of stiffness you know it's yeah that's just always yeah it comes with it what is it you say yeah sometimes that means and they'll be like our best childhood memory not having a sore back in its man my middle daughter she's 11 and she she's so fucking flexible her spine she could stand and then bend backwards and put her hands behind her on the ground and then kick her legs up in the air and go over like what in the fuck are you made out of little kids man Amy they're made out of rubber and yep that's all well ladies like that actually yeah I mean hundred percent even with my daughter once actually they're gonna probably cop some flack for this but I remember I was you know sometimes he just I didn't know so one time she's like sort of film I was like holding a firearm and she end up like heaven like a little dislocate like sort of elbow and I didn't know alike she was just crying I thought she was crying cause we left the park and stuff like that not just just the the thing I literally just had and she just fell and I just looked sort of her yeah like just War yeah just grabbed upon Harmon right and like you know just again like I hope you're lucky I didn't break her infant but I obviously have been being young and they would be more flexible but like full hyper extended to her arm but she was alright a couple days wasn't too bad I literally thought I broke my daughter's arm imagine telling people this story you know what I mean so it's crazy but yeah some of the same things you say the kids do crazy well they're just they're built to fall down ya know okay just down hold on them when they do so yeah so what about running are you doing a lot of running I don't do is much running I sometimes do the weight loss and all that but you know I get you know obviously when you try and get your you know your your heart rate at a certain amount and doing your would is that the endurance you would know max you know not vo2 max like when you don't know like when you run and that consistent run or something you keeping you out right at a certain yeah I rather on the top post I'll rather be drilling at the gym I'll keep my heart right there and I'll be drilling and I'll just do hours or an hour to use a chest monitor yeah we do yeah we do yeah we do that with a lot of our sessions and yeah that's again we just try and structure everything we're all about the science that and stuff like that yeah I mean it's it's so important but so many people don't do it they just go by feel you know but when if you really have great coaches especially great scientific based strength and conditioning coaches they really understand the science behind getting your body into a great endurance spot mm-hmm even though we even do like we get our HIV so every morning to see for you know it tells us if we can train or usually say yet you're good to go or something like and I pull up you know right so you it tells you how your body sort of yeah I don't know how we're strapped and we're one of these things okay variabilities traps yeah it's big it's big it shows you if you're fucking wrecked yeah sometimes you feel like maybe I'm just being a pussy and then I can look at my phone and I go nah man you fuckin do you not you haven't recovered yeah this is a thing that'll show you where your static heart rate is we're in your normal resting heart rate is where it is now as you've trained too hard yeah and then sometimes they look and be like so you prefer drilling to things like a favorite of running a like when I was in Thailand and stuff like really making it run yeah exactly right but I'll be honest I don't do as much now so again doing the force the four sessions day three four sessions a day I just say I'm the top person I'm just a believer of a drilling you know I can be a lot more flight specific yeah get much that heart right there so that's just how I am it was different obviously it's working for you yeah you know sometimes that's a big part of it too is like having a thing that you believe in and the thing that gives you confidence and you know it's obvious that you have great endurance as well so it is physically working for you yeah exactly so you'll do three different sessions at least a day and you're breaking them up like a strength and conditioning maybe boxing workout kickboxing jujitsu may be an MMA workout how do you how do you how does it structure you yeah you're much much mornings you'll do like a MMA sort of workout so you put a roll I'm all about pull it all together you know what I mean no I don't like to separate each discipline but obviously we still do that as well we'll do like wrestling some days a couple days a week and then the jujitsu every morning will do as well we'll go war work sessions and you know it's just we just do everything and then you've got certain sessions that'll of Leah - max wrestling and things like that so it's just and these are mapped out by your coaches in it yeah yeah so you know like what the week is gonna be like yeah yeah pretty much pretty much the same every every week that's the difference between now and the old days man the old days guys to just work out so they dropped and the only one knew what the fuck anybody was doing right you know no really no one knew yeah what about sparring in and what is your philosophy on sparring hard versus sparring light yeah man oh especially Joe like where we're all about you know more technical spine obviously we have like our saturdays is where we spar and that's a little bit more full-on but you know you know you don't get paid in the gym and again if you're going balls a war every every time you spar you know I mean look we're how do you learn as well I believe that you know keeping it a little bit more - you can work on things yeah that's why I love training we've all different types of styles I even if I trained something that's not on my level that's where I can learn so much as well it's we're not gonna try things right there's that if you're going against someone that's a you know better than you or just as good and you can't make any mistakes so you're playing it safe like if you're hiring every day you know I mean but again we're we're all about you know keeping it pretty chill you know especially during the week we spar probably you know anywhere from free full sessions maybe even a week but a lot of times it's very very very true you know very technical technical spiral and again that's where you learn and that's when you you know I think it works of what's been working for me but then there are Saturdays is we got a little bit harder but not not too hard so it's never like a full on Bona never never so humble that's another brilliant thing that people learn today because back in the day everybody you should just brawl I mean I mean there's so many story like the best stories come out of Brazil the Cure atiba stories from shoot the box okay yeah those guys used to knock each other out and training and just keep training yeah wake up get back in there hey just push them back in there and you could just imagine you know it's not too good for the brain for the brain I mean cancer the head and Vegas trips not good for the brain well listen brother appreciate you coming down here man and talking to us and nothing but the best of luck to you in the future and
