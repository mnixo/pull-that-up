hello freak bitches what did you what it stuck the big thing that you got out of this personally or sort of into all the above I mean intellectually as personally right personally you know there was I've been through a sort of lifetime of I don't know like I was a late bloomer as a kid real small always sort of the runt of my in school came from a sort of an average-sized guy now but I came to my growth really late and so I sort of have a basic you know schoolboy story about getting pushed around and bullied and and it's there's no heroism in that story as I always back down I always ran for it I always found some way out of it it wasn't because I was a pacifist it wasn't like I had some noble high-minded reasons for avoiding the violence it was I was scared and I knew I was making my ass kicked but I've always kind of felt like that's no excuse from that for fighting you know that there's a you should stand up to the bully I've always felt that way and even though I never did it so I so so part of what I wanted to do was I wanted to go into that cage and I wanted to sort of stand up to guys who were stronger than me and more skilled than me and sort of taking those beatings that I felt like I should have taken 20 years ago you know I mean and so as deep well yeah I don't know if you ever had experience like that as a boy where you were you behaved in a fashion that you define as cowardly yes definitely and it's amazing me I'm 42 years old now I've had a lot of accomplishments in my life have a beautiful wife I have little children who are wonderful it's amazing to me how much psychological weight that still carries for me that I can still make myself blush thinking back to those moments and so part of it was a redemption story for me about whether I could whether I could do something to redeem myself at least in my own eyes for those times when I'd flinched as a kid that's awesome I love that I love that you did that I don't love that you're still blushing over it it's silly it's so silly it's so crazy but it just means you've got work to do as long as you know just got worked before you realise you're not that guy anymore right you know so when you're doing these heavy heavy lifting it dead-ends that impulse it slows it down and not only not to mention you're neglecting the 4 foot all these exercises are pretty much done on the ball on the heel mmm you know I was squatting I remember us you're taught to press through the heel dead lifting the same thing so you're you're training over and over these movements that are not practical for a sports movement which pretty much every sport is played on the forefoot yeah that's true like you're never really in a sport you very rarely push off the back of the foot so kind of moving forward when you're punching the back heels on the ground absolutely hmm and so knowing that it's kind of like why are we doing this you know right it's improper training I mean it really makes sense like Mars been preaching this for years and you know and people just kind of scoff at it you see I know I got to get my heavy back squat and yeah that's fine but maybe this can help you with it you know start training the feet looking at looking at what we're talking about here and the sequence of muscles that you're gonna start firing when you do start training the feet like how's this a better option for squatting would be a front squat and now let's say you take a couple of 45 pound plates and you put them under the balls of your feet so now you're engaging more of a sports moving you're on the balls of your feet and you're loading up the front instead of the back which is it back squat is technically a lower back exercise it really hits the lumbar it hits the lower back a lot the front squats gonna hit more quadricep you more muscles required for jumping you know what I mean as well as the core and stabilizing the spine with the abdominals and everything so that's just a thought like maybe you can do that you think like start thinking in that process where you're training from the feet up mmm the forefoot up not just the heels but the forefoot up and you'll start connecting different muscles required for sports movements okay let's see not a hero and other stuff with Alex this is Kevin yep that's Kevin right now okay crank up the volume who's Kevin I'm sorry I don't know Kevin Pereira was the host of attack of the show he's a very bright man dan has beautiful complexion and excellent bone structure look at that jawline oh that's the one cop that they dispatched shot that
