the gyro can experience remember growing pains man before Kirk Cameron became one of the most awesome he's really lovers why is a banana shaped the way it is I think I can explain that shit Joe I am she was on a plane with Kirk Cameron recently and he was just sitting there looking so sad and depressed and I cuz it was one of those things where I was waiting for somebody else to put like their luggage up so I was just standing right next to him and he's just sitting there like looking at his phone like looking past his phone not even looking what's on the screen and he's just sat there and then like some woman came up to him and he just looked up went like did those like little smile but it was so weird being dude what he imagined every day the guy is fighting off the gay with every fiber of his being he is just clenching his teeth and fighting out if you really want to save Kirk Cameron this is what you do if you're a big gay guy just sit in his lap and pull your cock out and you know just it'll suckle on it like a baby to its mother's breast with a banana peel on at first he's doing he's just fighting off the gay tooth and nail and claw and Fang people who are most outspoken against homosexuality are just look at him he's so obviously gay you can't get any obviously gayer than Kirk Cameron not there's anything wrong with being obviously neither I mean for the guy to be happy she'd just come out of the closet all of them just come out he was a Tom Cruise Scientology Suri or whatever in a mental thing it's amazing that Tom Cruise already has a new Ukrainian beauty and it was a picture of him and her holding hands already in a magazine like it's such an obviously staged picture they like Scientology are bad motherfuckers because they're still rocking it old-school in 2012 all right they're putting together storylines they're creating like narratives they have like a whole fucking publicity so like like whole area department that like figures out how to handle they're like we need Tom a girlfriend and we need Tom a girlfriend right it's like at a newsroom like that's it they're there the thought like the news core but we spotted Katie Holmes in New York two pitches in New York shit we need Tom with a hot Russian right right now yeah and Tom okay you're gonna go on Ellen this time and jump on the couch and you're gonna say you're in love and you're I don't care if you're 50 if you want to fix your career jump on that woman's couch all things seaton the the videos of them like people trying to go into their welcome to the public kind of festivals and them coming out and aggressively swarming around people and sobbing uh what's your issue what's your problem what're you hiding what are you afraid of it's that's that's scary shit they love to call you a bigot that's yeah Scientology is a fascinating organization to me just let it helps helps people though man no doubt about Evan neighbor who is a Scientologist who's a nice fucking guy man he's a great guy and he did helped him man he tells you all the great things that he did for him and how it helped his business helped his life and helped his focus and this and that and if I can believe isn't it mm-hmm who will you tell him differently Kevin Pereira nobody I'm nobody Joe Rogan do you think how much of Tom Cruise's life is surrounded by Scientologists is he just like you know Scientology yeah I think he wears the pig helmet at the meeting you know like he's the one that's like the deepest sin and I think I think there's like a group of like probably like six main players and he's like one of the head guys you know just created your own fucking Council of doom seriously when they meet in their hollowed out volcano you ever seen the video can you pull up the video of him in the do you know the Scientology video where he is it's a video that wasn't supposed to get me play it like a conference or something right and you're supposed to be in there yeah I don't know what you would say Tom Cruise creepy speech Scientology but it whatever it is they had it set up and excuse me they had it set up in this like a whole it was like a whole auditorium of people that were like watching this hey yeah yeah I'm like cheering along with it am I remembering the right thing no I think it was that he was like a annual meeting like a seminar like you sit through that and then they offer you a timeshare and then you get to go skiing board Katie Holmes didn't she sign out like her Simon if I sign up for it yeah and it's like when you get this much money career to come back you just wanted to be relevant you know and guess what man that's the only way to do it for a lot of these girls you know these middling girls you know they're doing pretty good there okay and you know five years goes by and she's 39 ooh pass and that's it it's over yeah so you got to make a you got a bus to move before your fucking rice runs out of a fuck it sand out of the sand out of the hourglass so that thing the old rice bucket right why do I feel like there's a similar measuring devices of rice in some cultures look at them all clapping he's got a medal he did it

LRH and I've met the leaders of leaders okay I've met them all so I say to you sir CoV we are lucky to have you and thank you very beautiful wasn't it he's beautiful wasn't Elrond busted on like a boat in international waters having sex with underage people yep okay so maybe not but I said yeah there we go update the wiki can we just get that that's not even the one man there's one where he was appearing by tape right yeah yeah that's the one I originally found but I thought you were talking about that one that was beautiful too though he's beautiful the way he's just so carries man I would sign up for five years with that so that should help my career if I just had a inkling of the possibility that maybe he would hang out with me if I could just write cultures oh my god the music's like that once you know these tools and you know that they work it's it's not good enough that I'm just doing okay traveling the world and meeting the people that I that I've met now talking with these leaders to various fields they want help and they are depending on people who know and you can't be effective and do it and that's us that is our responsibility to do that it is the time now is the time stop this it is beautiful Holly some people are beautiful you better know it you better know it and if you don't you know go and learn it what oh that's the option if I don't know it I don't learn it jeez it's not even the end of it the end of it is what I wanted to hear what he says that if you stop by an accident you know you have to do something cuz you're a scientist yeah it's an eight-minute video thing oh here I'll try skip don't don't make me get my dick hard for that's too intense I just loves the visual impossible music I love the you know I love all the religious mission

I need more help I'll get those spectators either in the playing field or out of the arena in the playing field or out of the arena great yeah you're either with us who have the answers and we have we can provide a little help please watch the whole thing because there's so much glory in it there's so much awesomeness in it it's so ridiculous but you know what man it's like we we value charisma like that so much that a guy like that who can step up and tell you what Scientology can do to maximize you and that you will be a better person it's not if right become a but you will be a better perfect you very much the reason you're not right now is because you haven't joined come on dude how crazy do you have to be to be wearing a medal to wear a fucking Olympic gold medal bigger than the Olympic medal the date they said what's the Olympic medal make it ten percent bigger because this is important note those Olympic rings into one giant metal and make it match his eyes we make it out of the gold we took from the fillings at Auschwitz and yeah that special evil goal that we have saved up that we've been a radiating and saying mean things - they have like here's one fucking pile of all the gold that they know was made and gotten through the worst circumstances like Blackbeard's fucking pirate treasure we know he murdered babies for this goal oh this is the goal I want mold into that what are you watching this light show I thought your Tom Cruise screensaver kicked in no your photos of a half Nick he said okay stop right there back up a second think about this real quick look at him with Val Kilmer oh yeah I'll think about what he looks like which is the fucking same he's showing him that Lister put inside him in this photo with Val Kilmer he's saying I'm getting you to the elbow nice and humor Val Kilmer's continued to age whereas Tom Cruise had he got to a certain point and then just stopped because he's been eating from a human liver restaurant and you don't know about it yet the petri dish human livers it restaurant yeah he goes into the cryo freezer especially picks his organs in love with Katie back in the day meanwhile what is he thinking about their cock that's what he's thinking about cock thing about caring for cock I actually want to say on the record that I don't think he's gay and he doesn't want that because in my name is Bryan Reich over anyway he's my stage name's red band and I I disagree with everyone here mr. Cruz and I'm sorry Oh would you do it if he doesn't even if he doesn't want cock I think you should try it yeah cuz it might be his thing Bryan would you do a five five years stint with Tom Cruise if it meant unlimited wealth and career success five months let's just say five months compound I have to have sex or just hang out with I think you have to you have to either fuck or be fucked by Tom Cruise one of the two has to happen for unlimited wealth unlimited wealth sure and success would you do now career success well five months at Tom Cruise sex slave absolutely not you wouldn't for unlimited well now what is unlimited wealth though I'm never having to worry about it yeah but could you buy like jets and share it certainly you imagine your butthole your you let any guy fuck your butthole was worth that much it was like there was a way you can negotiate I'm sure there's the sun'll sultan out there somewhere now people think of it they like sucked your dick just for dinner and like really I could have gotten unlimited wealth
