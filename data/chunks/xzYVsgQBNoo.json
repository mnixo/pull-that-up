the Joe Rogan experience now there is a related disease that from Katz called toxic or Isis and that's a parasitic worm infection we're finding in the United States among the poor and that's a warrant so what happens is if you go into poor neighborhoods you know and you see a lot of feral cats and dogs and poor neighborhoods almost a hundred percent of them have this worm in their intestines and they're seating the environment with eggs and their feces and the feces are spread all over the poor neighborhoods kids come into contact with them and the worm has the ability to migrate through the brain across cerebral toxic rias's and I think it's an important cause of developmental delays it's one of those neglected diseases in the US and about in the book and there's no vaccine for that there's no vaccine for and we need a very little awareness about it Wow yeah I've never even heard of it until just now right so this it's not rare I mean in some cases you know up to 10% of certain populations like Africa African Americans living in poverty are infected with it and it's primarily pets or does is it rodents as well probably mostly stray dogs and snot even pets it's mostly stray dogs and cats and and I get RIT and this is an example of a neglected tropical disease here's here's a disease of up to 10 percent of African Americans living in poverty in the United States and almost nobody is studying it Wow right it can affect the way your mind functions right it's been and it's been linked now to developmental delays so you know everybody wants to know why you know kids living in poverty have developmental delays and people just assume it's because they live in deprived environments and that sort of thing but I think toxic crisis is an important underlying reason for it and this is an example of a neglected disease you know we I mean everybody's heard of Ebola right and everyone's worried about Ebola and and the truth is Ebola is never gonna come to the United States why is it never gonna because it's too difficult to transmit unless you have a complete collapse in the health system we're never gonna have Ebola epidemics in the United States but here's a disease of 10% of African Americans living in poverty and no one's heard of it and there's no incentive to study it so that's why I'm trying to raise awareness about these poverty diseases and that'sthat's correct me I don't understand why people don't talk about that one that one seems insane right you know absolutely it's a no-brainer right and so but you know it's very hard to get people to care a bunch of things happened all at once this was in 2013 I didn't want to leave because I had little kids and so I didn't want to look I was I was gonna stay there and and just wither wither away I almost capitulated you know to darkness but I got up with her before I went to sleep one night well my kid is sleeping with me and I'm hammered and it's like 8:00 at night you know and uh and I had an epiphany I said you know what I can't I can't do this and I will not I remember saying it's myself I won't I will not be defeated I will not be defeated and I put my running shoes by the side of my bed and some shorts set my alarm clock got up early next morning and went for a run a la Forrest Gump uh and I pound the pavement for about ten or twelve miles and I'm not a runner you know I like to run I like the sprint and when I came back from the run worked out in my drivers for about an hour and my local cops came all happened the same time and they came and said hey bro get the fuck out kids be alright you need to do this and that and then I started kind of figuring out a really evaluating my path in life Oh back up a step I also got laid off from this corporation and you know with a guy in the military you don't you don't ever think about job security and when I retired I'm working for a corporation that was mostly were made up of retired military guys so you get laid off you like what the fuck can I get to do now what does that even mean getting laid off I don't what am I gonna do so all that shit happened at the same time I was like it was like a this massive spiral of bad events and uh man I was able to I was able to rekindle my own my own my own fire because I recognize all right bro you still got an ember you still got this all you need to do is just nurture that ember turn it into a flame turn that into a flame and then just start adding would add would add wood until it becomes just a perpetual blaze and which led me to this thing that I tell people now you know it is that you got to keep the blaze alive um I've got that on t-shirts even because I like I like to kick people in the ass who are willing to sustain their own fire once they get that ass-kicking if they can't if they can't keep their fire going then it's not worth it's not worth it for me you know to keep kicking him in the ass but uh yeah so ever since uh that point in time you know getting laid off the depression the booze and I was able to rediscover me and rebrand and and pretty much start from scratch I mean I had to start Life all over again when I was 48 years old Wow yep the whole thing from scratch I think that the idea that this was just some memes is just not it it doesn't respect the significance of what they were trying to do and how effective that they were with these other things or even if they're just trying it out just a little bit just working to see what works they're always experimenting they're always trying to find ways to create that tension and that's the thing that I think is so interesting about this right this evolving this idea of an information war where these tactics evolve and you are really at a disadvantage when it comes to actually detecting them one of the things about hunter that's really intoxicating is that his sort of self-destructive path becomes romantic when you read it and you get involved in his work and you kind of mimic it you know it's a that's the greatest fallacy I think I think what he was trying to say with self-destruction was that this was an incredible threat to our American democracy not all meaning that I mean I mean his there's no romanticism telling his well I mean the romantic aspect of it was that his work was fantastic I mean when it was till it wasn't it was fantastic till it was it wasn't I mean it's why he understood what in the failure it wasn't but he lived in with he spent much more time within the for consequences yeah of that bingeing than he did within the success of the bingeing right and that I think he knew that mm-hmm it is letters it's really beautiful um and heartbreaking and in his writing too I mean I think that's what's been missed about him is there's no romanticism in self-destruction right towards the end he definitely lost his productivity and yawn Werner talked about that in the Alex Gibney documentary sticky-fingers was a great the document are the new book on the new book on yon winter has great moments of Thompson the 70s just being kind of lost yeah you know and I think I think we got to remember that we have incredible times in American history we have times that are gonna burn brightly and it's up to each writer to decide how they like to burn next to it and ya gonna burn brightly they may not have other times and that's I think an American thing where you can wager that bright flame which means you may have nothing left afterwards but Thompson knew that he may have to live in that kind of afterlife but want one Thompson writes about it so beautifully yeah stories I tell myself there's some some footage of him when he was writing for I forget what newspaper some what was it somewhere in the Pacific Northwest what what was he writing for who's the author of playing off the rail google playing off the rail there's a guy who was a journalist but year do you think it was what David McCumber yes David McCumber David McCumber employed hunter for a while when David was I forget what publication he was working for but there's some footage of them community communicating together and you know it's trying to get hunter was in San Francisco was in San Francisco and hunters out of his fucking mind I mean it was younger you mean he wasn't even that old but he was just rekt he just couldn't communicate he couldn't talk and you know media makes a beast of you escape the pain of articulation you escape the pain of saying this is what's wrong in American society for him to say the way he did one of his great essays is from 1964 it's about going to Hemingway's Ketchum Idaho on grave in Hemingway's house and it it's gorgeous because it talks about Hemingway was a good writer one of the best writers when he was writing about a period he understood the 1940s 1930s when there was a firmness to the reality that he could articulate one of the writers goals is to give a pattern to chaos is to give an articulation to casts about what happens in the 1960s when the chaos is multiplying repeatedly somebody like Hemingway becomes a literal relic like his narrative no longer fits into the president that he's in and Thompson saw Hemingway's decline and he wrote about Hemingway's suicide I mean by his narrative doesn't fit Hemingway's idea of what America was and what a man should be fit perfectly with what I think the 20s to the 40's when we experienced but I think in the early 1960s with our social upheaval of civil rights of you know political upheaval Hemingway it was confusing to him it didn't it didn't fit anymore like his way of operating no longer articulated the president right and so Hemingway his last act was to take away his ability to say anything at all that was his only the last thing he ever said was to say I'm not going to say anything anymore was the suicide that had me committed and Thompson wrote about that gorgeously the only problem with those gals is that there is a reality to certain levels of musculature that most likely they're only achieved by injecting male hormones so the klitz kind of get big or whatever a little bit can you tell no but I feel like bro there's a dick cone inside a nut that one down there yeah that's what happened that's not real know yet is real it is real way no no it is there's no way how about that one in the lower right hand up
