hello freak bitches i trademarked it because i said you know what it was it was starting to like you know fizzle when I was like and then I was really passionate about it because it's something that I was saying again I have nobody around me to watch to have friends with me all the time I'm training whatever whatever they all left it was all we move doing so for me I was like no entourage nobody to push me I gotta push myself so I started talking to myself something that I ever did and that's a whole nother story I'm telling the book why I refuse to talk to myself why did you tell me I'll save it for book come on but no the reason why is because I'm I had an uncle my mother's brother Anthony Parham he was her only brother he went to the modes he went to the Vietnam War as a child you know as young man 18 years old when he left high school he didn't have to because it was all sisters and he wanted to be called he wanted to go because everyone in around town Petersburg beaches she's me Jaret Virginia and running from his town the young men were gone it's on cousins and everybody so he went he came back um disturbed he came back you know different than when he went in and he was actually missing for quite a time they were gonna declare him dead when he showed up one day with a trench coat on army boots and Mehcad whoa Halsey Street in Brooklyn so this led to him being mentally disturbed all my life he would talk to himself he lived with us I slept in a twin bed he and he slept in the bed there and he was you know when alcohol when he drank he became very violent you know he beat my mama one time really bad cause I had eyes up and him talking to himself was something I grew up all my life watching I'm like ain't me crazy called Amy Amy you crazy you can tell me to yourself so and I got older I would just refuse to even have a conversation with myself all you crazy of you and four years ago I started having conversations with myself Jack you know what champ you gotta go and I start saying let's go champ and I was like man but I asked my wife is you think I'm crazy we already know you crazy you know me so I'm like let's go check you know and they just and it was my mantra it became my mantra you know my friend told me one of his monsters was to be the man you got to be the man when he was tired he was running mile 18 to be the man you got to be the man right be the man you gotta be the man should say to themselves yeah and I was like you know I need the mantra and I was hitting the bag one day and I was tired almost 400 pounds I was like let's go champ in the head champ you know when I'm feeling pain you feeling pain you feeling down tell yourself let's go champ let's go champ do it I hear you want to work out sometimes the people's man the people the people gave me this the universe gave me this the people the people linked into it and it's not mine it's ours we just want to give each other positivity and love it I meet people from everywhere I'm going nuts because I go to every city or country and people say champ I'm in the lobby or I'm in this town can I meet you wanna come over to the hotel and they come you owe me a call I mean you might have to stop that when you meet titles channel a I'm here for the people wow man that's strong things and when I went to interview senator mark Pocan last week about he was one that wrote a letter to the government he wants to keep kratom legal he thinks I you know he should be allowed for everyone and I said to him what do you think about marijuana and he was like I just think it should all be legal and it was the first time I was ever in the presence of somebody that works for the government saying that they think that weed and kratom and all this stuff should be legal and it's because he had a good head on his shoulders about the problems that people face every day you know it's not black and white like I live in this gray area I don't I'm in a lot of pain but I don't want to take opiates right you know I shouldn't have to take opiates so where's the pressure coming from to turn this stuff into a Schedule one drug if there's no if there's no negative response by the body you're not having people died of overdoses is there an ld50 rate on this stuff oh if you look at you know I mean you're saying where is the ld50 explain we should probably explain to people lethal dose at 50% meaning if you take 50 and give them a pound of this shit 50 of them are you know 25 moment die at a certain sure we've heard about you know there's been no deaths from marijuana right freedom is the same thing no no deaths there have been zero deaths and there there have actually been 15 deaths that have been brought to the FDA and the DEA s attention those 15 that's I actually went and interviewed one of the one of the mothers the kid was on three psych meds he was withdrawing he was on ER withdrawing from three different psych meds I have a black box morning that says warning if you're a teenager you might commit suicide basically and this kid committed suicide he didn't die from a kratom overdose he died from committing suicide and his mother wants to blame kratom she doesn't think that the the psych meds had anything to do with it and I don't want to say that kratom had nothing to do with it we don't really know and what I really call for with kratom is just more research like I want people to put in the money to do the research to make sure that this is safe and let's see if we can solve this opiate epidemic let's see if we can crack down you know basically lower the amount of opiate prescriptions we have in this country I just read an article the other day one in seven people in America are gonna be affected with addiction problems Wow that's crazy one in seven yeah that means someone in your family you know that's that's insane somebody in your family will be affected by that's more than ten percent yeah that's weird
