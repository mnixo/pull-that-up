ition we we sparked one up on New Year's Eve we put filled up that hole oh the actual oh my god rolling paper that came with big bamboo that was the first time I really went out where we're live right now so just let everybody know we're talking about Cheech and Chong yeah huge just across the I think was across the double the the double album dude you have a flip phone as you act I do I do I snapped out Oh T G brought that you figured out create less data yeah that's that's my mom's out what it is yeah well two things one your phone is always fucking with you it's yeah it's notifying and you know it yeah and I just didn't want to be a part of that anymore I wanted to you know be a little more connected to life outside you'd still call people well this is so this is actually a new flip phone from t-mobile Alcatel and it has kos which is so it's not really a trackable OS although Google put are serious about this well I'm very serious about yeah oh yeah and you know all the apps are all they're all tracking you they're all doing all kinds of shit but initially really just to not be you know a slave to this thing yeah and the further I got into it the more I liked it and you don't really need it now I have a device with me that's off this works as a hotspot so I can turn into a hotspot if I really really really needed to do something but what do you need right text phone call right and if there's something that I really need to look up you just turn around and say hey can someone Google this for me they do it there's always someone around are you texting on that thing yeah yeah do t9 they have a it's like a t9 it's a little bit better it's their version of predictive texting yeah I really am serious about it well you should be yeah and everyone should yeah the problem we have all this cool shit all this great technology but the business model fucked us all I mean six years ago I had the first Amazon echo I'm like this is groundbreaking Dvorak Mike my co-host he was laughing at me he's like why would you bring a spy device into your house it look I'm just testing this out if at an Apple logo on it everyone would be losing their shit right now but it didn't and I loved it hooked it up to the light and all that stuff going and as I started to understand what it was really doing and what is really communicating all these things right down to like your Roku remote you picked that up it's communicating with home base mm-hmm so all the stuffs I got rid of all of it what's got rid of it um you know I was listening to one of Sam Harris's podcast and he was talking when someone that said and they had a really good great quote that we didn't realize that our data was something valuable the right we didn't realize it was a commodity and it's being sold not just a commodity that's kind of value but insanely fast dreamless yeah but that's where Facebook makes all their money that's where Google makes all their money everybody yeah every make it from your data and you never really understood what you were doing when you signed off to give that data away when you signed the terms of agreements and you're like yeah yeah yeah whatever and nobody reads through that shit you know what's even more egregious is there's a company called plaid PLA ID just sold the visa for I think four or five billion dollars and it's the the financial back-end we're kind of like a bridge between all these apps that can do stuff with your bank account and your bank account so instead of so if you have an app like venmo or shit you know name any payment hash app I didn't want to disparage anyone who might be advertised cash at PayPal well PayPal do it PayPal has their own system but what you do is you sign up and you literally give this app your username and login to your bank account instead of an API or some kind of programming interface just lets the app talk to your bank account and put money in take it out he can do anything it's in fact it is just like screams screen scraping it's going you can go through anything that's connected to your bank account it can look at and they do and at Credit Karma another great a great example of it and they are just sucking out all of your information when you pay your bills who you pay first why you know if you have you know what your pattern is of credit card payment moving stuff around so you think you're just using it as a as a utility but they're tracking your fucking life dude you're really concerned about this everybody will get the world they deserve you know so I'm trying to protect myself and people I love also you know the drone can't target me that easily with this protecting you Joe thank you it seems somewhat inevitable right that this connection that we have to technology gets deeper and deeper into our lives but that what what disturbs me is that there's these giant corporations that are not just profiting off of our connection but then they're using that money and that influence to affect a lot of things in our culture well they're enslaving you yeah so Credit Karma is a great example which also just sold for seven billion dollars it was literally changing your behavior to get a higher credit score and this credit score isn't really even an official credit score it's the one that they kind of made up so they'll say pay your utilities on time then we'll raise your credit score your credit score is higher now we can lend you this money you see so they're training people to do certain things like the progressive app for insurance it's training you to drive in a quote unquote responsible manner because you get discounts if you you know don't brake too hard if you're not accelerating if you're not breaking speed limits etc is it hooked up to the GPS oh yeah so it knows your speeds and everything is monitoring everything if your braking velocity all of that shit oh yeah so they take that into consideration every month well that's the whole point the point is to train the user to be a good fiscally good person whatever dad's just because you want to save some money well of course everyone does that you're gonna be you're gonna be forced into it like I just got health insurance new health insurance and they're oh we download the app and if you download the app we'll give you a break why because they're going to tell me to do things this app to saying you know now it's small things but it'll start telling you stand up you know move around and if you follow it if you follow it then you'll get a discount so we're really really becoming enslaved that way that's what that is definitely a way to look at it yeah that's the business model yeah and it gets more and more immersive yeah yeah oh yeah I did I didn't know the progressives does that that's all of them do you have all of them the insurance company yes that makes sense I mean that's that would be the best way to figure out if you're actually a good driver of you're just some dickhead who gets lucky well yeah I mean that's kind of the the marketing is like you know if you're a good guy don't worry about it but they keep pushing they keep pushing you know they'll just keep telling you and you don't have to have the app active for that to be tracked or monitored that was one of the grossest arguments I heard after the whole Snowden thing like what do you care if you're not breaking the law that's changing a little bit I have a 29 year old daughter and she definitely had that that mindset and her friends did it's changing you know now it's like okay we totally get it they're tracking all of our shit so we're gonna might not use this and we'll leave the phone at home there's a little bit of that creeping in but in general it's like crack you know how can you do with it's not easy it's I mean this this phone it's sometimes like ah I could but no it's like and I just have to stand back and go do I really need to have this information right at this very moment do I really need to do this no typically no yeah when I feel any sort of anxiety or boredom I just grab the phone it's just instantly my little my little soothing blanket or my little teething thing absolutely pinky and I play a game with myself you know I'll get myself points as I'm driving around like person walking on the street holding the phone in the hand one point you don't need to actually hold the phone in your hand and women holy crap they got two phones sometimes with a little you know a little button plug so it doesn't fall off they got their bag maybe they got that kid or a stroller and it's a pop-up bomb they're doing all and just they're all over the place all the time so it's one point for just holding it to if you're walking and doing something I see a lot of that how many points if you have a kid and you're walking and looking at your phone that seems like that be it's the bit if you're in the car ten points if you're walking with your kid on the phone it's five points and you can hit a hundred with in five minutes it's it's crazy it's zombies yeah when you start to really pay attention to it when you're above people have a truck and I want to look down on my truck you can see people texting and it's stunning how many people are on the highway texting at the same time think I rear-ended with my truck say maybe two months ago in Austin you know right after stoplight and I was in the left-hand Lane it's gonna turn left BAM full speed it was maybe 30 35 miles an hour you know the girls airbags deployed she's like I'm like ho and if I was in the in the truck I'm like yeah okay I get out and the whole front end is destroyed she's dazed and like so I'm trying to pry the door open and yeah there I see the phone on the floor still open and then her excuse was well my brake didn't work okay I got my break didn't work does that ever happened my brakes did my rear end to the same thing there was a slowdown on the right lane and some some guy plowed right into me and I asked the cop said oh this is five times five times a day yeah I'm sure it's crazy yeah it's it's weird that that sort of snuck up on us that there's this thing that's incredibly incredibly addictive I was with my family this past weekend in Dallas and we're at this event as we're walking through this crowd I'm like look how many people are on their phones this is crazy like everyone it's it was just you're going through the crowd of this store and everyone is just looking at their phone just yeah it's like a zombie movie they don't know they're zombies truly is a zombie apocalypse yeah truly yeah and the weirdest why I mean it gives you a little bit of reward every now and then someone has a funny meme like but that's that's what Silicon Valley figured out is that the pie vlog in response and the you know all the all the brain impulses you get from a like or a you know a retweet or whatever it is or even just something bleep oh yeah oh and we have different sounds bling blong all this before we go any further we should give you credit you're the reason why all this started you are the original pod father the legitimate one like if there's a lot of people claiming that yeah you're the guy who made the very first podcast you even came up with the name of it right no I didn't come up with the name of the name well let me go back to to the beginning because actually the technology of podcasting was invented in 2000 so before anyone was podcasting before there was an iPod interestingly I was living in Amsterdam at the time and I was working with Dave Winer who had really invented blogging and he had created this RSS syndication format and he had software you could blog and then an aggregator kind of like you know Google Reader at the time and you couldn't you know read blogs it was kind of like a two-way communication thing was interesting and a lot of people are starting to use it and in Amsterdam they had cable modems rolled out everywhere and cable modems were sold at the time as always on Internet it wasn't fast it was just fucking on you didn't have to dial in which was oh my god this is great you know this was a huge improvement didn't have to kick someone off the phone line all that so the the the the experience of multimedia was shit like you wanted to hear a song or play a video it was like click wait wait wait download wait you know it would probably download and then open up some kind of player and then it was not an experience there was nothing nothing there that made sense so and I always wanted to broadcast on the unit that's always been my thing from the moment I saw it so I came up with this concept of the last yard I said what if you had a little thing running on your computer in the background that would know if there's something you wanted let's just forget that how it knows part it would download it and it would tell you that there was something new when it already had it on its local hard drive so you remove the whole wait experience because you don't know you don't know that this computer has been downloading something you've wanted it just tells you oh it's here which is you know it's not abnormal in media you're the 6 o'clock news most of its produced before the actual broadcast so I took this idea to Dave and I said we need to come up with something that can download a media file that I program somehow like this is going to show up and then it downloads it and only tells me when it's there and I can click on it it plays immediately and it it took some convincing he didn't exactly understand what I was saying he probably thought I have fucking MTV God in fact that's exactly what he thought and and then I actually demonstrated to him what I wanted to do in his own software and he said okay I'm gonna do this but only on the condition you never ever ever fucking use my software again because that was horrible what you just did and so we created the enclosure element in RSS and so for two years we were doing back and forth you know like movie files and stuff and I'll click and would open up and the experience was good until I saw my first iPod friend of mine said look at this I'm like oh this is the white one with the big deal on it that was a good one right they got high after a while like hard drive and I looked at and went this is not a digital Walkman this is a fucking radio receiver because I had one I had a Sony AM radio trend receiver which is a little solid-state thing like this is a radio this can receive radio programming and so I said about again with my fantastic programming sales skills to make a little application and you're the iPod at the time you still had to sync it to iTunes is how you got music onto it back in the day and so you could put a mp3 file into a blog post basically but it was a special attachment really and so this program would just be looking all the time is there something new is there something new oh there's something new download it then click trip it so that it's synchronized to the iPod and it works now not being a programmer that's actually Kevin marks a guy was working at Apple sent me a version of the script that actually worked that was helpful and I said about creating a radio show which we didn't have the name podcast yet and I wanted to be able to talk to developers software developers who could create receivers so we had iPod or iPod or X iPod or lemon all the all these different applications which kind of did the same thing and because I was talking to developers I called it the daily source code so I did every day and source code is kind of what the developers work in and I was really talking to them like okay well the guys over in New Zealand they you know they've created this version of and it's really working well and we discovered all kinds of crazy shit like you subscribe to a feed because we know one to thought it through we would try and download you know everything you had in that feed all at once so trying to download 50 episodes and we still had kind of always on internet so everything would crunch and die and this just kept building and building and other people started doing these and we called them soliloquies and little bundles of joy and all kinds of really dumb names and the danny Gregoire guy who was just listening he said oh that's this is a podcast and the name stuck now Ben Hammersley from The Guardian years earlier had actually used the term podcast somewhere in an article which there was no podcasting at the time but he envisioned that and and called the podcast so he's the guy named it he used the term but I would say Danny Gregoire really named what we were doing at the time so so and that's when I didn't name myself the pod father but people started calling me that and it just grew from there and that went really fast before I knew what the BBC was calling and interviews here and there I'm like holy shit something blowing up here yeah and it wasn't until the big moment was I got a call from Steve Jobs and he says he actually was Eddy Cue you know who's big man on campus there now he says that can you meet with Steve I'm like check the calendar yeah so it was in where's the d3 conference like San Diego I think went there and I met with him for an hour and it was an O and I had I've met a lot of interesting people my my best meeting to date had been Quincy Jones where I got drunk with him for an hour on a live radio show oh yeah that was fantastic and so here's Steve Jobs in the flesh and the first thing I noticed is he's got a weird list but I'd not really heard before really yeah it's like well okay so he hides it when he does those maybe doing what he's projecting is but he was much more personable and it's just the two of us but first he's he's he's fucking pissed off and he's yelling about they fucked up Wi-Fi and I learned later that his his plan always for the iPhone was to not be a cellphone but to use Wi-Fi networks around the world and oh yeah and because you know Cisco ever had changed the the way Wi-Fi works and the way the authentication works that it really wouldn't be that seamless but that was his his vision and you know so actually I thought to myself you should probably calm down make you say and then he was talking about oh no Eddy Cue says yeah you know the Raa called and they got a problem with the with how we're able to you know record sounds on the Mac you know breaking any kind of encryption and I said I it's actually kind of important because in order to record stuff we're using like audio hijack Pro and all these all these different kinds of tools and I said mom I hope hope they don't do that because it's kind of important for production and Steve went fuck it tell them to fuck themselves this is tools our guys need and then he said Adam I'd like to put podcasting in iTunes are you okay with that I like are you kidding me yes I'll give you my director got built a directory of podcast art it off absolutely and then it was kind of funny so then maybe what year is this 2004 something like that I think yeah 2004 2005 timeframe and then Jamie may you can find it if you want it's a pretty funny video so he announces this on stage playing my my podcast where I just rail on the Mac it's you take a look at it's pretty funny it's like it's the one video that they're really legitimizes me in the world of podcasting thank you Steve I really appreciate it oh yeah you got you gotta check this out this is hilarious is so great it's free and I think what we're gonna see is an advertising supported model emerge just like free radio here's another Adam Curry is one of the guys that invented podcasting and he has a podcast called the daily source let me go ahead and subscribe to that and we can go listen to his latest one you know just click on your daily show number ones live in Eden something remarkable is happening here radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you've been here since Radio is invented it's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say that's right it's show number 180 and it's Friday everybody thank God I've actually had to restart the show three times my Mac has been acting up like a motherfucker it's something to do with the file system he knew exactly what he was doing bro I'm telling you he didn't know I love Kara Swisher her mouth feels like it was happening larious and then he he sent me an email later and he said I'm gonna introduce you to some people in venture capital kleiner perkins Sequoia Capital which I kind of took is to thank you and I went on to raise a lot of money from those companies to build my podcast network what what was the first like what year was your first podcast the first one you released well so that was 2003 I guess 2003 Wow so you did what was going on before you was there anything was there any other well people have been putting well we had real video and real audio if you remember the low low grade streaming stuff and but this really made it did two things I mean it solved the bandwidth problem for downloading that was the first and now that's no longer an issue of course but it put the subscription model into place and because neither I or Dave why nor have ever patented any of this it's completely free and open so no one owns it and that was that was the mission I'm very proud of that that's beautiful because you know otherwise if someone they're like Spotify is now trying to buy podcasting by buying up all these networks and they'll make it exclusive and granted they're trying to switch from a music company to an audio company but ultimately look at all the applications that are out there that are really good people love them you know the Apple podcasts app I use overcast I like that a lot there's tons of different ones and it's all because there's an open standard that no one can control and Silicon Valley loves controlling shit in fact Apple loves controlling shit this is one of the few things Apple has done that isn't a walled garden locked into Apple stuff it's interesting cuz they're not even monetizing it no and you know they they have many different ways they could do stuff or they could help but I don't know why I don't know why they're not um I think it's an oversight I think they thought for the longest time that it was just this thing that people did that was big deal and then it's become so enormous but they still have this map this model they're operating under that it's just they're just aggregating could be I mean and what was interesting is when they started off they immediately started to highlight NPR program in which I'm not I'm I'm grateful for I'm WGBH in Boston did a lot with putting their first programs making those available as podcast but kind of the the beauty of the the amateurism of podcasts and got pushed down a little bit and it was all BBC and PR yes yeah it's a little too much for me the radio lab I love radio lab but I know what you're saying it's very produced it's very like people answer questions for the guest instead like you look caught in it so what he said was this no why don't you just let him say right well so this is why you are The Tonight Show of our era you have I feel like I'm playing the Super Bowl here I mean if you see my my DMS and my text messages people like holy bluff Logan this is legendary they go nuts and shit you know like an gotta prep for the Super Bowl you know I've got to get ready to slam this but you have taken what you've really done the opposite you've Zig to everyone zag and you just have a conversation unedited you're completely open type of personality so instead of trying to rush in and get the information example I am I like iliza shlesinger now when she was gonna be on Kimmel like oh I'll stay up and watch and watch that she was second guessed which kind of sucks because you get first guest you know and then a bit and all that and there was literally before she came on it was six minutes of ads then a native ad in the studio for Deez Nuts then another five minutes if it was 12 minutes of commercials and Schlessinger was on for five minutes buh-buh-buh not even a clip yep so people are sick and tired of it I mean no the existing media because of just the the structure that's in place the the ratings game isn't really probably isn't really reality but it's an approved methodology people believe in those numbers that's still there but there's a reason why you get tulsi gabbard and bernie sanders and people want to come on your show because you speak to an entire generation my daughter like holy shit my friends are all time that you can be unbroken she never never talks to me about any of that stuff's like but you're okay okay this is a little different that's also yes well it's not like you don't know it I mean this it's weird it's I dunno but it's weird why do you think is why do you say it's weird I was just weird it's weird well well it was never intended there was no intention like starting it from the beginning was just fun and then I well this is cool and then once it got like a certain amount of people there was a point time where I started getting guests so I was like you want to do my podcast and you know right cool people like Anthony Bourdain was one of the first well I remember in the beginning and I've always wanted to be on your show I think we've tweeted you know maybe seven years ago or something you were in Austin but I always felt like dudes doing some kind of pirate radio out there you know it's like what is this you know there's something cool going on there you know you got all these people around you and and the community comics or comedians which do you prefer either ones fine I don't think it matters no Kay some people sticklers for it and I always find them to be annoying so what I liked so much is that comedians gravitated toward it and said okay we can be funny and we can do stuff that isn't necessarily our jokes that are gonna get ripped off because that's I think for the longest time comedians would be like I don't want to be on the internet not putting my shit out there because people will steal my jokes yeah and they'll steal my whole routine and if anything you and comedians started to really blanket the landscape and show you know what could be done with this and the fact that everyone could just kind of you know receive it on their on their phone was fantastic we kind of created a real organic Network that's one of the things that we all kind of talked about it that networks if you think of a network like NBC or whatever you think of its it's a controlled network with executives and shareholders and then there's advertised yeah there's all these different standards that you have to apply to the salat agenda right exactly but everyone we're on the network together we're on Tuesday at 8:00 and these guys are on Thursday at 7:00 and then all that so I made that same mistake thinking that I could build a podcast network and run it kind of like like a hybrid network record company mm-hmm and raised a lot of money to do it too first mistake is that the VC guys they wanted us to be in San Francisco who builds a media company in San Francisco but okay it just doesn't work for a number of reasons but the main one is the advertising model is just not built for this an advertiser wants to know and I'm talking real advertise I'm not talking you know underwear and mattresses and and Squarespace we're talking automotive pharmaceutical you know still have Telecom these are the real that's where the real money is they want to know exactly what they're going to be advertised on and if it's if they don't know what it is they want no part of it especially now as we have canceled culture through social networking they want no part of it so it's just not going to be spectacular the way you know something you're not gonna take those advertisers away what I meant by a network is not that no I know but that's what I'm saying is like I tried to build the contain Network failed in my mind hey I mean people made money and everything the investors didn't make money but I tried to do that all things they're still trying it it's just it's not that profitable and it's also the ones that are successful or successful and the other ones aren't and like the idea that they're all sharing revenue it's like okay you kind of eat with you kill so what you what you're trying to say here about the ad hoc network he's totally the way to go what I'm saying is it's just that we didn't even think about it we just were supporting each other yeah comedians always suffered from famine syndrome because there was only a few shows on television and we were all trying to be on a sitcom or you were all trying to be the host of a late-night show and there's only a handful though I'm sure everyone wanted to be that so that famine mentality was like it created a lot of weird animosity and competition between comedians then somewhere along the line the internet came along and then YouTube videos started making people famous and then podcast started making people famous and then we all realize like the old model of like hey if you do Leno you can't do Letterman like there was a lot of that nonsense back course of course that shit's out the window now everybody does everybody's show like bill burr does mine I do his we all do each other I'll do Joey Diaz he'll do mine we're all friends and what happens is I hear bill burr on your on your show and I'm like oh fuck he's got a podcast yeah in Monday morning podcast boom subscribe Joey Diaz not necessarily my kind of guy but yeah he's off the hook his own podcast is kind of fun so you are either way kind of like a mothership the rising tide lifts all boats that's that's how we think about it how how capitalist oh yeah but it's not even that way it's just like everybody gets to do well it's not that you know we're thinking of it in terms of an industry at all it's really just fun it just happens to be profitable but the way we started it out with no thought whatsoever of it ever being profitable that's why I became what it is because it was all like doing giant bong hits and hitting all this vaporizer and literally not even knowing what you're talking about while you're talking half the time and having fun with it was part of the appeal because half its everybody wants to be at the party yeah that's even that's why radio stations do remote broadcasts you know this white top 40 stations go to Popeyes yeah hey we're here this morning everybody right everyone wants to be part of it and if you're actually partying yeah I mean that's that's what people love of course yeah we do these podcasts called fight companions and then as some of our most popular ever yeah and we'll watch fights and drink and smoke weed while the fights are going on and their madness their did they become total chaos yes and those are some of the most popular projects shout-out to Ryan my dance instructor who's a huge fan your us sir well my wife and I we yeah yeah of course yeah it's part of my workout regimen it is worth a human we'll do a double lesson this has always been my dream and you know so finally I found a woman who this it's really do dancehall have you ever dance ballroom dance but I did have to take dance lessons for this movie zookeeper that I did a few years always with the Kevin Kevin Kevin James yeah yeah they had a whole dance scene where those like weeks like that movie me and Leslie so it is the man leads the woman it is a very traditional role in dancing you know or if you have two women dancing one of them has to be the lead but in this case and the woman has to give in to it and it is for both of us we find it you know just for being together and I'm leading she's following it's a total trust thing there's all this interaction you have which is almost found upon in today's society you know what the man is actually even me saying this all your leading oh you're leading I'm leading it's you know it's called leading but we do an hour and a half like a double lesson I'm sweating now yeah I'm all your muscles everything and just look at them on Dancing with the Stars these funds are cut it's hard you know I talked to Chuck Liddell who is the UFC light heavyweight champion he told me that dance with the Stars when the hardest things he ever did I believe hearing for it I believe it yeah it's hard yeah it's real Joe Rogan says Dancing's real a bumper sticker it's a difficult thing to do and the cool thing is you can do it anywhere yes we want to get to that we've only just started couple months but we want to get to the part where we can just go into a place and just dance oh look at that yeah that's cool that's a it's I I'm a big believer in learning things and liking lessons and just does something you suck at just try it so I got my ham radio license academically I'm a piece of shit and I barely made it through high school I dropped out of college in two months like this is not for me this is like me I learned how to fly helicopters and airplanes so I've gotten all these these things and that's all not that I really fly that much anymore does helicopters I know I know I heard that flew me around downtown LA yeah and then Rob being 4422 he doesn't have his own he was using one of the ones that this helicopter company right it was a four-seater two-seater it was a force okay Robinson 44 yeah that's what I trained in I was owned two helicopters really I had a helicopter company whoa yeah in Texas you could shoot pigs out of him yes but never seen though this was in in the in the Netherlands yeah no believe me I've been invited I'm sure yeah I don't like I don't like that idea well it's a very unfair idea but also they have to do something like there's other things that are problems the pigs are problem but it is like to me it's like haha not problem is that's the problem right why is that the problem is the joking around about it while while death is happening it's a disturbing in very unwinnable situation because the feral hog problem is so big particularly in Texas that you know they lose millions of dollars in crops every year yeah many minutes of real problems just I just can't get into 300 bucks an hour helicopter you know just shoot it yeah out of the window yeah it's a lot of food though it does make a lot of food they donate the food I have never shot a living thing I've I have I've gone I I've shot a lot of guns meat oh yeah oh hell yeah yeah yeah I mean all pigs are a good place to start there's a it's a place that does oryx okay and if you ever had Oryx no I have no all I heard oh my god it's so good they back so they as a conservation in Texas mm-hmm and it's actually more Oryx and Texas than in Africa I believe that's true you know because they're you know they're they're really managing them you can go there you can you know hunt and shoot them and then they'll do they'll dress the whole thing for you if you want you can do it yourself that part's not for me I don't know I just like I just don't think I can if I if I had to no problem but now I don't have to right yeah no I get it man I got it it's not for everybody you have you ever shot something yeah yeah I hunt yeah an arrow right okay that's a whole different level yeah it's well that this is my first animal ever shot that deer I shot on a TV show called meat-eater and I got hooked right after you because I was that was either gonna become a vegetarian or I was gonna become a hunter right seeing too many of those PETA video you dress them you did all that yeah I got a buddy who does that Scott yeah in Austin when I go when I help go elk hunting will dress it in the field and quarter but then I'll send it to a butcher to get it chopped up right different cuts Vietnam I love meat nothing wrong yeah it's um I understand what you're saying like to pull the trigger and to be there when an animal dies it's intense but it also makes you realize what you're doing when you're eating meat absolutely yeah and I think just knowing this I'm cognizant of it and I I don't bless my food but I think about it like yeah thanks man well thanks thanks madam and I was in Utah last September and I shot this elk not only do these guys pray for the elk everyone takes their hat off but they actually take a wad of grass that the elk eat and they make like a bundle of it and they put it down on the elk carcass when we were done cleaning the elk so after the the bare bones of the elk after the meats removed they put this this thing down they take the hats off it was pretty serious right these guides they do it with every every elk that dies yeah yeah cuz it's you know it's a part of their livelihood but it's also their majestic there there and there - they're delicious beautiful lamb and this yeah and they're so special they're so interesting like if I could just eat elk for the rest of my life I'd be happy doing that reindeer who tried reindeer no caribou okay reindeer and I had some reindeer they have is a restaurant and then a buddy of mine worked at Nokia at the time and they bring you a picture this is it and he's alive you're like I feel is Rudolph and then Darius so they write before they serve it I don't know that but they they do show you you know this is the one you're eating right here Wow yeah fantastic fantastic neat yeah it's caribou is a very prized meat yeah and they're they're amazing animals too and they they have these huge herds of them and I went to the North Pole and I saw just tons of him tons him up there do you know how story with them and psychedelics with caribou yeah no but I'm interested okay caribou or are connected to a mushroom called the Amanita muscaria mushroom they're addicted to this mushroom they eat it constantly they've actually been known when people do psychedelic ceremonies in the go outside of their yurts to pee terrible will knock them over to try to get to their urine because their urine is rich with the smell of this this mushroom yeah they eat it constantly hence it's a psychedelic mushroom the flying reindeer it gets crazier the connection between Santa Claus and reindeers is very strange the connection between Santa Claus in this mushroom is also very strange the mushroom looks like Santa Claus it's red and white it also shows up under pine trees it has a micro riser relationship with coniferous trees so when it rains the the mushrooms will pop up under these trees so these bright packages that look like it was under the tree exactly that is what they look like under trees wait boom gets crazier to dry them off the shamans would pick them and then put them in the pine that could put that photo up against round thanks me put them in the pine needles to dry them off so just like like balls riding in the trees right right and ornaments and a Christmas tree well we still put pine needles in the pine cones and yes exactly and and balls those bright colored balls they think the origin of that was those things also Santa Claus came down the Christmas tree and when or excuse me when they were discouraging these shamanic rituals people had to sneak into people's houses to perform them on one of the ways they did that was to climb down through the chimney so the shock dropped down to the chimney with the bag of mushrooms and then they would all have these ceremonies and when these ceremonies were forbidden that's how they how they got around it yeah it's a the relationship between Santa Claus and Christmas and this mushroom is very strange and there's tons of articles also almost all of the old Christmas cards had the Amanita muscaria mushroom on it and elves also the elves that connect I'm gonna tell about that he's he collects he's an archivist he collects old Christmas cards oh hey I'll bet she has some of those find old Christmas cards with mushrooms just thousands of them I've never done mushrooms what does dmt no no no thank you I don't smoke we view it okay and I did DMT and enjoyed it very very much that's a that's a wild one huh twice see look at these old old Christmas find some some ones that show like merry look at that one right there in the middle yeah there you go see that one Merry Christmas trip your balls off kids now look they all have mushrooms oh my god in the early 1900s when they were making these in the even in the 1800's people are just more connected to the origins of these stories sure and over time we've kind of lost that commercialized it into all kinds of but it's always the Amanita muscaria if you look at these yeah the monster of course it's always that one mushroom that looks like Santa Claus Wow yeah it's a weird mushroom though that was a complicated mushroom because it varies genetically and also varies geographically and also vary seasonally I've never I've done it before but I never had a good reaction out of it I did it with my friend Stanhope and Doug and I did and we weren't feeling it and then we had some other mushrooms we brought some psilocybin mushrooms we threw them into the party and then then we took off I'm not into eating any drugs no I like smoke and flour that's about it okay I grew up in Amsterdam that made it kind of easy yeah I'm sure yeah it's um yeah it's it's tricky especially you don't know what you're getting mm-hmm you know but mushrooms are pretty pretty standard once you've done it a few times you know what you know what you're getting into but that that mushroom and Christmas is so it's very anyway the caribou which is pull Santa's reindeer pull the sled right well they're flying cuz they're tripping their balls off they're high as fuck Wow yeah the more you know yeah I mean that's probably the reason why those reindeer are addicted to that mushroom they favor it they love it yeah that's it's a weird one story that mushroom also is a weird one in that when people take it they trip and then to really enhance their trip they drink their urine because apparently the the in the urine contains like your body filters out you get an ex super blast exactly yeah fantastic weird stuff I'm trying to cut back on drinking my pee though yeah it's good bit it's just it's unsightly that's socially so unacceptable you know just like what the hell you doing ker yeah um but anyway carob I've never had it but I've heard it's delicious and I've had a bunch of different kinds of deer access to yours probably the favorite that's that's really delicious that's another one is a weird it's a weird deer because it's an invasive species in Texas in the backyard here in your backyard no no I got deer oh really yeah I don't know a white-tailed deer I have no idea do they have white spots all over their bodies and weird horns I don't like that that's a mule deer you probably like many of those probably whitetail I don't know they hiss fuck oh yeah that's the girls usually they're letting the men know that there's yeah danger here yeah and you know they just walked right through the backyard walk onto the street they're all in and we live in a cul-de-sac they're all over the place whatever okay yeah yes what happens when there's no predators it's becomes a real issue people slam their cars into them I have a buddy who lives in Iowa and you can't even went to the rut like in November you can't even drive yeah just a cross on the road everywhere everywhere you going you better be going 20 miles an hour start out with a boner we don't know what they're doing because the male's lives $30 marbled basically rodents you know just kind of well to hell they're not that wise so I don't feed him just go away yeah that's smart keeping going move on people yeah Butler apples or something in your backyard no comes don't have any of that least you guys don't have bears that's when it really is a pain in the ass people got coyotes now though I bet you do yeah so a couple of those walking through the yard yeah and they're you know I have no pets so yeah we've lost pets I used to have someone I used to have so many pets I had everything yeah dogs cats goats horses without them I do yeah I do it's just you don't really realize it until you know you you're closing the sliding door you're opening it up and you're not thinking shit Yeah right if someone gonna get out you know very free that's a weird thing to always feel bad the cats can't even go outside well they can't go outside in Texas they'll get eaten yeah but it's just sad that they can't even go outside like what the fuck kind of life is that just living in a little prison like a you know in a cage yeah no I don't like goldfish I'm like any of that goat so had a lot of goats those are mean fuckers yeah that's horses too I am I had a thing my daughter had horses and like I had a castle in the in Belgium we had and two horses there you got a castle in Belgium yeah I just have money no no I took my company public in 96 called think new ideas and it was one of the first internet marketing advertising companies and it was big we had 400 people it was a big company why and yeah my buddy and I we just worked out and we took it public and back then it was like this is before the real dot-com craze so we raised twenty million dollars like holy shit we couldn't believe it which is nothing these days and after all the lawyers never wanted taken their money there was 15 million left and so we started to build the business and what we're talking about hassle you know castle yeah so there was that and then I'd also at the time someone had said I did pretty well on the on the IPO and I'm not crazy but you know okay there's a you know I learned what dilution means I learned that pretty quick but I'd invested $50,000 in some company and then I'd in 2000 just before 2000 moved to Amsterdam move back to the Netherlands and the bank called me said you sitting down yeah what's up so remember that company you invested in I said yeah well it went public it was asked Jeeves and you know have 65 million dollars I'm like on paper I'm paper Joe so lock up you couldn't sell any of it you know all this stuff so I did get some out but you know basically wrote it down to wallpaper you can't sell it well if you're an insider right you you lock up your shares it's a it's an SEC regulation so you can't sell for them I think the it's negotiable but it's it's it's so the other investors who come in won't be left holding the bag so you know going to do the IPO and then all the insiders sell their shares and everyone who just bought at the IPO then all their shit goes down in value it got screwed so you have to there's a lock-up typically six months or 12 months or 18 months and through some back ended way out the hell was going on our bankers do it with swapping stuff and promises and derivatives they were able to get some money out for me that I spent on helicopters and all kinds of fun stuff I've enjoyed the money yeah that's definitely glad I got the podcasting thing left so how'd you get back to Austin well I so I had the company in San Francisco this is a different company the podcast company and I was going I was living in London at the time so I lived there for five years damn you're an international traveler I have lived in a couple places and was going back and forth San Francisco London and there was a breakup between me and my wife and we got divorced and so I stayed in San Francisco and then moved to California to Los Angeles for about a year I always want to live in LA lives in the hills over like Highland and it just didn't work for me you know I was doing basically the podcast and that shows me I'm like 1213 years ago and I don't know it's just maybe it was that area but I really had nowhere else to go and if I wanted to go somewhere I'm just sitting in traffic all day it's like if I want to go the beach no I was with a woman at the time who was an actress I never I never marry an actress man bad I was warned so she wanted to be in that general area so it just wasn't working for me and then I did a tour from Virginia down to Florida the Gulf Coast for the show with an RV doing the show from the RV meeting people doing meetups and it was it was just around the time when the you had the the BP oil spill in in the Gulf and so people really depressed and it was all messy and just not was not a good vibe and I was gonna go straight up to Chicago and a buddy of mine Greg Lally who was one of the true last independent record promoters who had known from San Francisco and he knew from Chicago back from the radio days and he said Oh Adam come to Austin you'll love it comes to come to us who stay at my place coming like nah man I'd never really been to Texas you know just like it doesn't really interest me I'm just gonna go up to Chicago and just kept pushing and pushing us from driving up and then he says or I thought to myself Greg is flamboyantly gay single dad adopted a kid from Ukraine and if he's in Texas and he's still alive it can't be that bad maybe it's just Austin I don't know so I visit him and we did a meet-up and this is in the summer so it's about 112 degrees but you know that Austin heat is not too humid it's it's doable and there were 30 33 people at the Meetup and they were all happy and proud of their city and proud of their state and they loved what was just it was so much good energy particularly after it just came from the Gulf and one young woman her purse fell on the ground and out rolled a fresh pair of Underpants and a handgun I'm like Texas moved there three months later really I've been there ten years now Wow it has grown though oh my god it's changing this talk about it too much I mean I've lived in my wife Tina knives we got married in in May we bought a house together the South East Austin but we were living downtown right downtown I had a place there and we moved into an apartment together and we just saw it happening it really started with the with the scooters that's really what started to mess up Austin because they just overnight it's like what the fuck is this and just they're everywhere and you mean Austin already been trying to create a bike vibe with bike paths and you know just all the stuff which is ludicrous and I grew up riding bicycles and it takes maybe 50 years before everyone is accustomed to bicycle traffic you know it's not just something that's built in I turn right around the corner I still look look at my right mirror I look there so that make sure there's not a bike next to me and just built-in though people don't do that so people always getting hit and then these scooters pop up and it's just mayhem yeah everywhere there on the sidewalks there mowing people down people are it's nuts they go fast to just may go very fast they go merry guys he's got a souped up one hmm how fast is that bitch go like 50 25 back we'll see hey this one's a good 50 oh yeah oh I've seen him jacked up doing 50 oh my sure thing you're dead yeah well no there's that yeah you going down at fit he's 25 is already pretty fast he flies yeah I think most of them do about 15 15 17 miles is juicy but what I noticed is because all the Silicon Valley companies are opening up offices in Texas a lot of them in Austin and that's where they put the the human resource heavy stuff so not the top programmers this is helpdesk this is the people who review the YouTube videos so you know they're already kind of whack because they're watching nothing but death and destruction and fucked-up shit all day long they don't really have a connection to the city they're kind of like I'm here for a couple years and I'll go move somewhere else so they don't care and they're on the scooters so they don't really care about the city about the whole vibe like whatever drive around and that's become increasingly more Austin has some other problems now we're kind of following what what California world San Francisco Los Angeles Portland Seattle you know we're following the let people camp everywhere are things that's become a real problem and it's crazy here you know it's based upon it all comes from a lawsuit in Boise Idaho and that's where this started where and the first we went through the Fifth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit Court there was an appeal that said you cannot move people who are camping without having a suitable place for them to stay that you can offer them because then it's a violation of the Eighth Amendment under cruel and unusual punishment that's why and that's what Austin's a well until that solved it's cruel and unusual punishment to move someone who's homeless or not move someone who's camping if you can't offer them adequate housing so these people are just camping on sidewalk they're just like they do here is that the underpasses medians you know the underpasses yeah it's crazy and so it's this weird easel situation yeah this really started well they were they lifted the camp the no camping mat lifted it so it was not a problem then they said well we're gonna let anyone camp and it went nuts and all of a sudden downtown was just filled with people lay in camp and everywhere then they went oh this is not gonna work mayor adler and city council so okay we'll ban it in the just in downtown which is pretty much where the mayor lives you know the W Hotel this that you can't no camping in front of City Hall but we have a we're university town so you've got UT and it's just there's this whole you know like half of a like a semicircle of camping and just mayhem right on the on the outskirts of the campus and you know kids are afraid you know like nothing to get in harassed we have squeegee guys dude I drove into New York every single day from Jersey in 89 90 and near the squeegee guys were a huge problem and then they were gone I think Giuliani like threw him in the East River or something but and now they're back in New York it's like this is not not a good thing yeah how do you fix that though the people are worried about the cruelty in fixing oh there you go you know that's the problem it's like you it's a you have you almost have to be cruel to stop that no no how do you stop well you have to engineer what are we talking about not everyone who is squeegeeing and loitering and and soliciting is homeless right or you know it's not necessarily something that they didn't choose a lot of people choose a vagrant lifestyle the tons of it particularly in warmer climates like here and I do a lot for the homeless problem in Austin as much as I can and none of it is sanctioned by the city they're fucking moron build affordable housing we'll get a hotel and we'll turn that in here it's like Oh a slum hotel okay great the number one reason people become homeless is catastrophic loss of family that's the number one reason someone dies you know this that and then just it's downhill from there and before you know it you're out on the streets very difficult to rebound from that kind of thing and so people need community everybody needs community so where do they find the community under the bridge that's where the community is and the community is transactional it's drugs you know it's whatever you did that's a community it's not a healthy one but it's a community there's actually a great project in Austin called mobile loaves & Fishes community first village started by this guy who was in construction and he just put down a whole bunch of tiny homes and people who are if you're homeless you can go there and you can live in a tiny home but you rent it and there are some you know some prerequisites but you don't have to be you know necessarily drug free because it's your homes you can do whatever you want in your home but it's like $200 or $250 a month most people if they do the paperwork they can get Social Security or disability which will cover that they still have to you know either work there in the community garden to feed themselves at different you know like a Auto Detailing got all this different stuff but there's no police saying it's not you know this or this I think there's five hundred people there now and it's working out fantastically well that's cool because they have community now that you can outside-the-box to lose totally totally gets no money from the city because there's a religious aspect to it you know there's a ministry part so oh we can't give money to that because you know fucking god nuts or whatever is but it's really working extremely well that's great when someone comes up with something yeah you know I don't I mean people should look at this Allen Graham is a saint what he did and he lives there he lives in a you know in a small you know a small home on premises yeah and if you go there he'll be happy to show you around and you got all kinds of cool stuff but just people are living together he says so if Joel walks out in the morning not you Joe but the other Joe and he's got his dick hanging out he's like instead of the neighbors calling the cops the neighbors Hey Joe what's going on man let's sit down for a second let's have a coffee let's see what's going on pull your pants up you know let's sit and a community right community first village that's that's the answer but that's not the answer that you hear from your local city council or your mayor's as always we don't have affordable housing man how's everything it's also there's a lot of mental illness that's a job well of course but there's a lot of people with mental illness who have houses you know it's true definitely it's a mental illness and drug addiction but it really starts with catastrophic loss of family that's the number one reason people become unhoused out here is this shift was Jimmy would you say about four or five years ago it really started kicking in somewhere around then yeah somewhere around four or five years ago you just are to know that noticing like villages of tents under underpasses yeah and then I used to do Fear Factor in downtown LA like right down street from Skid Row which is an extraordinary place if you've never seen Skid Row and you drive by you go what this is real like this is downtown Los Angeles and you urine which is which they turn beautiful by the way I mean that really you know downtown LA became really nice in some parts of yeah great yeah great great infrastructure and everything but the restaurants and cool really cool apartment buildings and stuff it's an interesting spot but then there's also Skid Row yeah which is just you can't believe the staggering numbers of people that are just camped out yeah thousands and thousands and thousands just a mass like people coming out of a fucking stadium to see a game Adam Carolla said it said it really well okay where I saw him he said it's like no one wants to be the bad guy no one no one want to say okay this shit has to stop we got to do something about that and it starts with stopping whatever you're doing and that's part of canceled culture yeah people are afraid you know because if canceled cultural is real if you have something to lose like you have nothing to lose I have nothing to lose they can your your bulletproof to a degree I'm bulletproof you can cancel all you want you're not taking away for me no advertisers I don't have them you know the only the people who listen can stop listening that's the only thing that could happen Iman attached your podcast for advertisers what we call it the value for value system and when the Warrick and I started the show 13 years ago it was just him and I just you know talking on skype I was in London he was in San Francisco and we noticed that because I'd like to read legislation I'll read bills I'll read I was reading the lisbon treaty which was kind of the European it was supposed to be the European Constitution which was voted down by France the Netherlands and Ireland and then the European Union went no no no let's vote again you did it wrong literally like revote and so okay I guess we'll vote this way now guys and then I was reading it like this is this is not the way it's being portrayed on television like Oh we'll have it won't need a passport to go to other countries will have the same money and I was seeing shit in there that was way different about you can incarcerate people you can deadly force by the cops would be legalized and none of this is really what's what's happening over here at the same time I read a book called I'm just gonna give you the background to get into the money part called legacy of ashes by New York Times a writer David Weiner I think and it was about the CIA and my uncle appears in this book multiple times my uncle Don Greg who was big big guy in the CIA for a long time and and I called him up said they'd done have you read this he says yes is it true he said yes pretty much how I remember it I'm like okay so whatever is on television and radio is not at all really what's going on or what has happened and so they started becoming a lot of work we're doing work and then we said well we'll never get advertised we know the war acts a radio guys and media guys so we understand and understand that all will never get advertisers that'll never work so we'll just have to ask people to send us money but why'd you say you would never get advertisers because it's too controversial adverse adverts I mean yeah we can get some advertisers but not the real advertisers and what we talked about earlier and there's no advertisers really going to be interested and also how do you you know what are your what are your ratings what are your metrics what are your numbers you know the certainly then the questions well how do you know if someone listen if it's just the download I mean I can I'm sure you've gone through all of this also we didn't want to have a fucking meeting yeah we'll have a meeting with advertisers I don't want to meet anymore no more meetings so but we did something different we said instead of saying send us five bucks I don't work for tips you don't work for tips instead of that what is this show worth to you so you just listen to us for a couple hours you could have gone to the movies you know if you took a date had some you had a coke and popcorn fifty bucks was this worth fifty bucks up to you and what we discovered is that value is very different some people will say that's peers five dollars I love the show someone else says here's $500 that's how much I value the show someone else says fuck I'm gonna give you $1,000 that's how much I value the show and we built this model where we literally just say what value does the show bring to you and we thank people with the amounts that they gave we're completely transparent you could just sit there and see what people are giving us and it just became this whole interactive feature where where we put levels in so if you if you donate $200 you're an associate executive producer just like Hollywood the fuck to say it's a real $300 in executive producer and we do a little mention in a different part of the show for the executive producers and you know they can read a note and oftentimes it's it was usually something about the show so they're cut that bought into the conversation specifically so it's not just a donation segment it's content and we have like you have lawyers doctors nurses teachers college professors tons of military lots of spooks and three-letter agency DC it's also this kind of a spook agency there's all kinds of crazy people who really I think enjoy when we talk about what they're doing and so they love to let you know and then maybe anonymous you know hey man don't mention my name but you know here's and that just grew and you know now 13 years later we're feeding to families and we're very very happy and that's all I do is you know twice a week Sunday's Thursday's we have a we do we do recorded live you know do any post editing or anything sits in and out is done and do you like the fact that you just don't have any connection to anyone other than your fans is ever satisfying extremely satisfying I mean it's it's not just fans we call them we don't call them listeners fans they're producers and everybody is a producer if you see the amount of stuff that I get in you know so take coronavirus you know we've got a lot of people who are very specified that not just in epidemiology but in finance who can you know give us all these different insights and you put it all together I'm really a professional information manager and I've built a whole bunch of systems specifically for that I just get stuff coming in coming in and we like to deconstruct the media so we'll play anywhere from 30 to 50 little news clips in a three hour show and then just deconstruct it you know why is this being said what is what is what is really behind this is it true and you know then I spend a lot of time researching that's really what I do I just research and look at stuff and bang it around look at this if I can from all angles as much as possible and then present it and it's often surprisingly accurate Wow I I loved that idea of calling them producers and I loved the idea that you're not connected at all to anyone other than your fans mm-hmm yeah that's perfect the producers Joe yeah that's the producer I like it and then we and then we started to I guess the correct term would be game of Phi it so people start saying hey man I've donated a thousand dollars like totally like over whatever that's fantastic we should reward these people so we started to give them knighthoods why should the queen who I've met why should the Queen of England be the only one who can do that we can do knighthoods they're just as good you get a signet ring and some sealing wine yeah yeah you get a real wing rings you'd actually like close a letter with it yes oh when drip the metal black people send letters to us all the time they got their meetups that people with their rings like that's like edge of Honor it's a little cult II it had it's a little bit unavoidable there's a lot of different elements I would say more like a church which can also be a cult yeah yeah you know it's not an evil cult in fact it's a very healthy Colby now have people are now doing meetups around the world where they come together and you know we have a no agenda meetups calm people can schedule it and we got all this that's another thing we have all the infrastructure the entire show is run by the producer so we have independent architecture for our servers all of that one run by void zero Serb M rows they run it they do it you know out of the love love and goodness of their heart for the show of course they receive titles etc for that we have an art generator where every show we have it has new art there'll be ten or twelve different submissions it's kind of a little contest you know to have new art on every every new podcast is really exciting when it shows up in the podcast app it's something different but we also have you know oh my god we have search engines we have just all the stuff that guys and gals have just built for us and just kind of runs and it all kind of fits together so we we would never be able to make money with this if we outsource the production you know paid production we wouldn't make it and I think it's very hard for anybody to do that unless you're at a JRE scale which is a little different I don't we don't even know how many people listen we don't know we don't fucking care I just don't know how many people is there's no actual way to know there's no technical way anyone telling you different is full of shit there's no way to know how many people listened it's just not the Apple iPhone app does have some statistics that you can get but it's only iPhone statistics you can kind of get an idea and you can extrapolate out that's recent that they have that meaning that you don't know how many downloads really or you don't know how many people I just count down downloads but how many people listen to you don't know it's and even then there's a lot of network address translation that you may not be counting all the downloads it's just technically not true unless you rig the listening side which is kind of what Apple did and have statistics there which no one has there's no way to actually know who's listening but for us it's like can I pay the mortgage okay great show that's it and that is it's like killing and eating the meat yourself mmm it's it's it's a version of that and I love it we've spawned a couple other shows that have the same system Jen briny with congressional dish I've started a new one called mo facts which has the same system ology it is so fuckin gratifying it really I love it I love the people who help us who produce stuff for us and we'll go to a meet-up people you know donate on the spot but they also love just meeting together without us they're all over that like leap day there must have been 14 different meetups around the world and I'm talking Israel Australia England the Netherlands just all over the world and they get together to just be in a non triggering environment so you can say whatever the fuck you want kind of like our show and you know no one's gonna get triggered no one's gonna get outraged and it's all different kinds of walks of life and they have one thing in common it's like you know they think the media is kind of full of shit and and they support the show and they like those topics and and you know but there's no it's just it's small amygdalas man mmm that's cool small amygdalas um it has been a weird it must be it's been a weird ride for us noticing how much more outraged people get at things today than they did just a few years ago and targeted outrage where people just decide that you know they're gonna start tacking you for something that used to be normal to say like there was a some of it is so ridiculous it's crazy like there was a titania McGrath had a that's a great cook Twitter account yeah Andrew shoutout to Andrew he's got a post there was a sign that was hanging from a window in the UK that it basically was the definition of a woman it said woman a female human being noun right that's like the sign and then all these people went crazy and we're protesting and saying that it's a transphobic dog-whistle which is that's a new one right dog whistle has only been around for like two years people calling something that transphobia homophobic or sexist dog whistle like holy shit like you can't say anything anymore well let's go back to the basics yeah I was on the internet very early 1987 before the World Wide Web and you may remember we had something called Usenet groups yes and the Usenet groups and the way it used to work because we didn't really have a widely spread internet back then except in universities now I was on MTV and when I saw the in I'm like holy fuck I'm emailing with kids my audience who were not counted in the ratings by the way in college audience don't count in the Nielsen ratings at least didn't at the time and they want something very different from what MTV is playing so I was like wow this is interesting so I got into these Usenet groups and the way that worked is you'd post something and then overnight it would be copied all around the internet and you had to connect to a special server and you pulled in the groups that you had subscribed to and so really it was kind of a it wasn't an immediate conversation but he'd post something and then people would reply back and I just kind of jumped in two feet and immediately fuck-you commercial MTV asshole what are you doing here fuck off that you know you're not supposed to quote like that you're supposed to quote at the bottom and the top and I was like whoa what's going on and what that was is the minute you have the opportunity for people to say stuff anonymously they turn into giant dick bags almost everybody this is just an easier way to do it yeah now we've made it so easy and with all the little the you know the the the blips and the blooms and the rewards that you feel when something is posted or someone it goes against you and it's like and again I think amygdalas have swollen because of this so then you get this this you respond differently to what you think is an attack and the attack read it and you know this shit registers in your brain as something really dangerous I'm going to go back at them but they're anonymous and that's the that's the best thing then the blue checkmark became a little more interesting which I don't have and I tried to get one for a long time they someone over there hates me and now really oh yeah they wouldn't know that's what it is they hate you what else would it be I've never gotten a blue checkmark I don't want one now now it's me it's the mark of the beast you got a blue checkmark you know I'd be looking over my shoulder man like so now that's become kind of those those are the people that now risk being d platform because you have status and so it's fun to bang against these people like the fuck this guy I'm gonna bang against him so it's some human nature that is that just exists within us like you know it'll be really easier for me to go online you know under whatever Twitter handle that joe rogan you dick I wouldn't say that to your face look at you you know beat me the fuck up so no but people have no problem doing that anonymous yeah they don't see you they don't feel the when people look at you in the eye and they act like an asshole like they feel you like what the fuck man it's like a natural human instinct to not do that all the visual cues the human interaction yeah that's how we're supposed to talk you know the book connection the lost connections I think it's a Harare I think it's a nice name lost connection he dealt you that's the guy you should have on your show he delves into the same guy wrote sapiens maybe I don't know what's his name Noah Harare Noah you've all her re is that him look applause get lost Kentucky Johann Hari Johann Hart yes oh that's their guy he's been on the podcast how's he go hon been on the podcast yes yes so that's right lost connection twice right okay yeah I miss that one that that human eyebrows well it's not just for catching sweat dripping off your off your brow you know it's for communication yeah inquisitive yeah you know all this stuff use all these cues are not not there the deep platforming is getting really preposterous to four things you know zoobi got D platformed he got kicked off a Twitter this is crazy who zubi zubi is a musician he's a rapper from the UK who's been on the podcast for I mean they do does swear all right he's back on so they suspended him temporarily but this is why he got suspended he's I forget he was having a discussion online about something and someone said I bet I you don't know what the fuck you're talking about something to that regard like I bet I sleep with more women than you do to which he writes okay dude Oh Oh transphobic I mean he didn't know he said I have no idea who that person was especially especially the UK it's illegal the UK you cannot transfer beside somebody and you can actually get a visit from the cops we even made posts about it like showing how ambiguous the probably like you couldn't figure out he didn't know if it was a guy or a girl you just know someone said that and he was like that's a ridiculous thing to say I bet I sleep with more woman than you so he goes okay dude right like what he's not even assaulting the person and they decided by him saying okay dude that is grounds for being banned from Twitter temporarily like well madness and then these people are laughing about it and making light of the fact they were able to do that because it's a game right there of a rock they see oh yeah they want to throw that rock and they got him they worked they got him kicked off temporarily but that sends a weird signal to everyone else because it makes you self censor it's it's not healthy for anybody it's also not really a sustainable business model long term I mean Twitter the Nate because of this the canceled culture they said we're not gonna take any political ad you know like that's why Jack Dorsey's gonna get kicked out you see that ad I mean to see that new thing with a billionaire guy just bought 12 singer Paul singer it he is a huge part of the Republican financial engine this guy has been under it's very interesting he's doing this now because he's an activist investor and he's he's trying to get three or four board seats he'll get them cuz you know of the amount of shares he's bought up like a billion at least because he you know sees the so-called bias against the right and he wants to skew that back all of that is a failed mission the advertisers eventually want no part of this they just don't want to have a part of it the future is some version of a federated system which exists today Mastodon if you'd heard a mascot for a second when you see the advertisers don't want a part of it would they don't want controversy any controversy fuck no they don't want column they don't want organized attacks or bands they don't want don't want to be near it right they don't want to be near it it hurts I mean that's why you see quite the opposite you'll see Proctor and Gamble and all these big you know going way out virtual signaling as much as they can like oh you know we're all yeah you know Sports Illustrated's gonna have four I think for the first time on the swimsuit issue will have large women I'm saying that because that's what they are they're large women it's difference a large still I am there might be a time problem what are they gonna do yeah yeah tutus but and and I'm not saying that's good or bad but but that they're being forced to do this it's not an organic thing I didn't you know I'm not really a Sports Illustrated guy but I just don't know was this something that the readers wanted maybe I don't I doubt it so and again it's not necessarily bad but anything by force is yes I'll go broke that's yeah just give it a chance and no one's gonna buy that up that's it but that's another thing that I like about your show is you're you're a man you're dude you're not afraid of it you're not afraid to say it and I think it's very healthy and I'm sure you get all kinds of shit all the time from all kinds of people for all kinds of crazy reasons but it's important that we keep some of this just alive I get a lot of support I mean I'm sure it's something for some shit but I get way more support than I do shit yeah I'm a nice person I just happened you're on a male and I think it's okay to be a man and this the whole toxic masculinity thing is so fucking ridiculous like no there's bad people some of them are men there's bad women too like Casey Anthony it's a bad woman doesn't it's not a indictment against all women and this idea that men and masculine behavior is somehow somehow or another negative let no negative people are negative that's what it is that we men just and this attack on men is so stupid so it's to throwing out the baby with the bathwater and so what it is it's just dumb it's just and it's dumb people that are doing it and they're doing it in an articulate way and in a passionate way and they're using all their verbal skills to try to argue it in a way that they seem to think that it's justifiable but it's basically a tribal thing and then what you see is you see big corporations who do if anything want to be on the right side of history they will never go against the mob of Queens you just don't go and so and it's not even the film effectuates it's not even less like it wasn't very said that people are supporting you 20% of the people not supporting use a large number if they're active and it's it's it's such a waste of time yeah so when are we smoking some weed because I'm about ready now I will say beware Mike Tourette's will get a significantly worse but but that can be entertaining since I was I was diagnosed when I was seven I actually didn't know about it until my dad passed in November and was and my this one there's a little one no that's not and and so he and my sister you know was talking to him and wanted to know a couple things and and and she wrote up a little kind of like report and I was reading like oh fuck yeah Adam was diagnosed at seven with mild Tourette's like they never even fucking told me thank you they didn't tell you no I've known it because I got twitches and things and MTV was great for me because the segments were like a minute and a half I can control it for a minute and a half but you know I'm always like typically I can see out of the corner of my eyes like not here but okay they got Joe on screen so I could do all my things right what causes it no no one knows shit firing in your brain does anything comment well it's not no I mean I'm sure there's some crazy-ass drugs but I won't do that hmm and of course well you seemed a very very mild version of it and why would you fuck with your neuro chemist it's Who I am yeah so I'm you know I'm 55 I don't give a shit anymore whoo it's a part of me I'm just saying it up front because it'd be like the fuck is Kerry doing yeah that's why that's why I love radio I've always been a radio guy you know I can be like taken away and like no one sees me you know oftentimes if I'm doing a long thing I mean I'll just be like completely screwed my eyes shut I know be into it and no one can see that right well there's something beautiful about audio-only I mean I've really enjoyed doing audio and video together on this show but there is something pure to tobacco in this oh no no no why do you want some anyway no that's just no I stopped yeah that's why I pulled that one out we have blunts here which I like oh I do I've never done a blunt I do one but see how this goes I'll give you a couple minutes and where's the black rifle coffee I'm a got the term race he's got something yeah I'd love some the tumeric I'm just afraid my lips are gonna look like like I puked yeah I know it does but it doesn't really show up really yeah not on camera it's a look you get a little bit of a hue to your to your lips of the turmeric but that stuff's delicious fantastic yeah in the coffee with that Laird Hamilton superfood blend it's very very tasty yeah and you know it tastes good I like the taste you're doing something good for your body it's actually good for you legitimately I tell you man that's the best thing for my body it is I don't know the inside of a doctor's office or Hospital I mean I'm hanging together from THC Texas is weird though right you know it's medical no no no no medical no nothing no it's free no no no see legal Oh everything in medical mmm-hmm goddamn it hmm Jesus Texas it's not like well in Austin they've actually haven't really decriminalized but they're like the cops so I mean I really can't get away with letting people steal and Rob and do crazy shit on the street you know it's like here in California you can steal up to 950 dollars and then also go busting people for weed so they really got better things to do so they're not really making a problem out of it but but it's still but still Ely someone wants to find a reason to arrest you absolutely nuts then it becomes an issue absolutely it's just sad the Texas which is one of the most free places in the world you'd have a fucking giraffe in your backyard you can't smoke a joint but it'll change it's inevitable it'll change it's interesting because you know growing up in the net Evelyn's where now I marijuana was never legal it was just they called it o´clock into custom which means we look the other way and it's okay that's basically and you know it was it was limited to coffee shops where you can sell it that's still kind of that way you're not actually allowed to produce it but okay the Netherland is a narco-state I mean all your ecstasy comes from there oh yeah that everything is shipped through the Netherlands the Holies all the techno of course it was the techno came with its own drug Dutch kick boxers who are famous from coming out to techno music yeah like Holland don't know if you know is like the the birthplace of some of the great boxers of all time not really a man well I knew all I knew some MMA guys there's some MMA guys in Holland but it's really famous for kickbox okay I didn't know it was kickboxing yeah I really don't know shit about it but I do know that a lot of guys there become very famous like the greatest of all time there's like it's a crazy pool of talent that came out of Holland yeah yeah like well the Mon deckers and Rob came in and Ernesto Hoost and Peter Hertz like the names of these Dutch guys it's all savage dutch guys and everybody was like how holland like what what's happening over there it's a is a very interesting country I'm very glad I grew up there because it gave me a world view I think that you know is incomparable so the drugs has never been a problem you could walk into a bar at 13 look like you were 15 that's changed now look like you were 15 you could drink drink you know beards order a beer how old you have to be the drink well now they've changed it to 18 21 depending on where you are but it used to be 16 kind of yeah it was very loose I mean I have once the EU came into play and they had to harmonize and become the same as all the countries around it which is not actually true because Portugal decriminalized everything yeah they decriminalized I think maybe 15 years ago and yeah spectacular results but you can't really sell it but you can get a prescription for almost everything including heroin so they've they've changed kind of that people have a really hard time with that but hey look we're not putting a dent in Harrell folks now it's it's going the other way it's going I mean when I was a kid I never thought we'd have a heroin uptick in this country when I was a kid everybody thought of heroin is the stuff that killed Jimi Hendrix and stay the fuck away from it people overdosed and then they died once you start shooting a needle boy you fucked up like don't go that I could never even imagine putting a needle in your in your arm that was like not even imaginable it is the worst PR representation of all time it's killed some of our greatest rock stars right Janis Joplin dead all these people Kurt Cobain commits suicide had a problem with heroin classically lead singer of Alex and chains Elaine Staley right heroin so many guys yeah and the guys who kicked it who come back from it will tell you Jesus Christ I was in Satan's lap like he had a grip on me I could not get free yeah and meanwhile it's got an uptick so what's the solution the solution is clearly not business as usual that's like the devil you know what does that expression the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over getting a different result yeah we know now that we have a problem well I don't know if legalizing it is the the only way to fix it but to make it illegal you're just propping up organized crime that's all you're doing you're not stopping people from doing it because these people there's a giant percentage of them that are doing stuff that a pharmaceutical company made that they got illegally now they're selling Italy right they've become drug dealers whether it's the cartels or or other povich oh you know we had the financial crash in 2008 yeah I don't think the trillions that we put in really saved us I think the drug trade in general was the only thing that kept the economy running at the time I mean this is so big the money in drugs is so astronomical it's you don't even you can't even fathom how big it is it's a lot in yeah so many industries pale in comparison I mean h8a HSBC was literally you know laundering the money from Mexico with drug dealers just coming up on the Mexican side throwing millions of dollars a day into the deposit and got you know pushed out the other way into the legal James Comey was running that at the Jesus James he he was well aware it's just nuts how much money is involved in it and how many people look away you know people are trying to stop different flavored tobacco smoke I see you're a vapor well that that I actually look into that very very deeply this was that the tobacco industry had a problem the problem was this I kicked cigarettes with this because it's just you know you can have nicotine in it or not but you know it's not and if you had any health consequences from using that thing zero keep hearing about people getting lung issues well okay so a couple things happen the lung issues and I don't know who you know personally but there was this still know anybody person there was a scare and the scare killed a couple of people like ten people and what it turned out was that was people who had vaped THC cartridges and some the people who put that you buy your THC cartridge from a dispensary here it's actually packaged by somebody else not by that person so you have you know King world or whatever these different you know that's kind of a reputable brand but it's packaged somewhere else that means putting it you know putting the stuff in and they put in some vitamin E acetate and that just kind of like created a wet you know heat that up and became a web of some shit inside your lung and fucked you up so that's a man thing but that nothing to do with vaping nicotine with it with the typical chemicals that you get from reputable companies I asked you this is the the vaping from marijuana what their process is more problematic than vaping of tobacco well it certainly was in that case because I just someone so change the formula then you need to have some some oil in there and want to keep it you know liquid and for to you know just for it to be able to go into the vape and not the issue was actually vitamin E oil yes yes and and so that stopped of course somewhere someone did something shitty and that happened you know a really high guy actually said this to me once he he told me that he uses organic MCT oil for his vapes and he was like handing me his video like problem not suck on your vape I don't even know you you could be a crazy person you could be liquid DMT vapes they have DMT vapes now that's somebody hands you a vape pen you might be going into orbit for 20 minutes yeah for 20 minutes before you're driving oh you know I've flown a helicopter high on DMT no non weed oh that's a dead man yeah with an instructor you know he wanted to see how I did it and it was perfect yeah I play pool which is a very sensitive thing not quite the same death by helicopter but you're controlling the rotations of a ball it's very literally the amount of effort you put if you like you watch a good player the amount of effort they put really accurately depicts how many revolutions of the cube I'm sure yeah and after it's colliding with the object ball and you get more sensitive to that when you're high yeah jiu-jitsu is another one a lot of people do jiu-jitsu really yep and it's really really really common guys smoked out in the parking lot and then go roll it's really common well that was I did the most perfect landing ever when I when I super into it oh and it's very small input the helicopter you've seen it yeah yeah anyway so the tobacco industry had a real issue and that it also comes back to the states because there's this Master Agreement that was put in place decades ago that tobacco companies would pay a percentage of their sales to all states to as a pre compensation for whatever fucked up shit people get from smoking tobacco and all these states wrote big bonds against that money and so when the income from the tobacco companies was decreasing significantly because of vaping all of a sudden the states are going especially this one what the fuck we have these bond these bonds are gonna you know become go bust that's you know when you have your your state bond go bust you know this is a real problem it's a financial issue states and cities and everything go broke so everyone had an incentive to get rid of vaping and get people back on tobacco so they Altria bought Jul the the the main that's what I mean this isn't this is you know hardcore this is you know got a battery it's all technical you get to babe juice do is a prepackaged product kids were buying it like what's the benefit of that over a jewel you can control how much does it look like dragons and you can you can put whatever you wanted it not just limited by what jewel wants to sell you so rifle coffee in the house it comes with nice the mugs yours to keep that mug I want one of yours though you have a mug do you make a no agenda box oh no agenda shop comm which we don't run yeah these got in they just send it donation from time to time you can get mugs and t-shirts and really just sell your shit no no yeah so what they do is they they go to the heart generator they get images off of that then they put it on t-shirts mugs hats whatever they sell it give a third to the artist they keep a third and they eventually give us some money okay but you know it's we've always said nope just do whatever you want I'm careful we don't care it's a kismet kismet karatsu I mean that's a better word I don't know what either one of those mean do you know those I don't know either just sounds what does it mean that's like something Larry Ellison would say isn't curette to when two companies agree in like Japan to do some kind of you know business together with like without a contract yeah those are nice contracts verbal ones from PVD trust your sir yeah it's like glad we got together to do this it's way overdue mmm way overdue for sure but those are good relationships when you have a relationship with someone you don't have any paperwork just like each other Devore I can i you know we eventually had to you know do an LLC because the the the IRS was going I don't understand you know people send in checks that do PayPal you know give cash so we have you know all and they're just like you just make a little simple or can we just cutting it down the middle cuz you know there's no one else involved yeah and but otherwise we just had a handshake you know for for a decade you know it's like you didn't ask me to oh is this my release yeah yeah you didn't ask me to release the fucker okay Wow look at this whole thing here we made that bit just in case because you don't want to get sued but yeah we can you know this is a weird world yeah particularly well you got celebrity guests on yeah this the only thing I have to be careful about is slander I guess yeah anyway back to that because you like this story okay so it's a tobacco States everyone skied up they buy jewel for 18 billion dollars they buy it as a write-off they want to get this company out of the market then they go to the FDA and they start all this shit about flavors flavors flavors flavors you saw it everywhere it was massive it was a perfect storm we got 10 people dying from vaping something completely unrelated but vaping East cigarettes he had an e-cigarette he died it was actually yeah he vape but he vape tab add THC cartridge and you know got a severe problem so you know how the media plays that and then just kept on spinning spinning there's like well we have to stop the children and the way you stop it is by taking away the flavors because children they want flavors that's what the problem is so that fuck jewel over and actually Altria who used to they bought philip morris basically so it's the biggest tobacco company they start they already wrote down half of it just taking the fucking l on it they want to get rid of it because in the wings they had their competing products which is i qos i quit ordinary smoking small I capital Q OS and it heats tobacco so it's a it looks like a vape pen it has though but it actually runs on tobacco and it doesn't burn it it heats it up has whatever it's some kind of mechanism in the filter you inhale and it's almost there dream which is the smokeless cigarette very close to it but most importantly it's not a nicotine synthetic nicotine it is tobacco product which is their business and they've got they really ratcheted this up so high that they got Trump involved and Trump actually with melania they did a thing with Alex SR the Health and Human Services Secretary he said well you know B this vaping is very dangerous we have a kid actually was one of those moments where everyone loves to jump on Trump he said Melania has a kid you know he forgot to say it was his whatever it was and now he's actually been overheard saying I wish I'd never gotten involved in that fucking thing because he figured it out he figured out was a huge scam that the bill has been stopped but now they're still trying to push through a bill that will help the tobacco companies even more by outlawing any type of flavored cigarettes or juice liquid or what they just want to get rid of it so it's really like who killed the electric car it's exactly that and they just go look at it now I QoS they're launching there's new stories today that say oh my god it's the saving grace we have the new product we've all been waiting for it right at the moment that vaping it's going to kill you it's hooking children because of flavors so do you think they're they're hiring people to write news stories and the news organizations are picking you up because they're being told to just do a press release to do a press release meet come on it's so easy in the media to do a press release and oh by the way we're Altria so we're gonna buy five hundred million dollars worth of advertising over the next five years would you please run our story or you know you might want to look at this come on it's tobacco so do you think that they make a deal before they accept the press release to do advertising or do they wait a little bit you know it's the only I have to say anything it's just the yeah it's implied why do you not hear why do you not hear the discussion about overmedication of children on television does it look at the number one advertiser right you if you start talking it's just not discussed you can't because it is a controversial subject and it would be a good subject not has launched a lot of people paying attention to it it's not like it would get a lot of ratings if you have a lot of stories about overmedication of children people like what what is going on it would be something people be interested in yeah and yet they don't do it because the adverts right I mean that's Lou look at your advertise I have to turn off the sound these days because I'm sure that I'm being blanketed with so many ads that eventually I'm going to get propecia eventually I'm going to get high blood pressure I mean my dicks not gonna work because that's what your telling you every every commercial block now everyone its pharmaceutical until you know like cable news especially because an older demographic but even if you watch what is it what do they have a where they have two and a half men running all TV land to a Half Men and what's the other one Doug and Carrie come on Kevin James is a to enough men no no the Doug and Carrie where is that you okay in Queens take a quiz yeah but I don't watch uh i sitcoms I can watch that that's funny show I can just watch it over and over I'm good dude but then very funny every commercial break boom drugs yeah what is it which documentary was it there that had a description about the United States saying that we are one of two countries in the world that allows advertisers yes foster alia is the other I think it's New Zealand okay let's see the Australian sorry either one because that's like a real fuckup yeah call out the wrong one of those things pretty sure it's New Zealand but that for whatever reason that everybody else is like what are you crazy and once we got it in there it's like once something becomes something that everybody does we are crazy it's really difficult it's crazy that we do that let me get you a blunt but this coffee by the way is phenomenal you are legit man who do this yeah that's pretty good though what is this Swede my mother would roll over in a you know grave she saw well she's dead oh but she didn't like it but she would just be like I don't know your mom Joe I mean it's like you know my mom smokes pot yeah my mom was not a pot smoker I grew up with the Emily Post etiquette you know I still if a woman comes in I'll stand up at the table oh good for you well the Texas that's I love that one that one of things that I really love about Austin in particular this is kind of a hybrid of hippies and Texas people yeah you know that's how I feel yeah and I like that I'd like yeah I like having guns I like the whole idea of you know protecting my family yeah and being able to take out an evil government yeah I like that whoa well that's what it's for right the Second Amendment is to protect the First Amendment that's that's my view and and we got a culture is it you go we have a gun culture in Texas so and also people are really nice in the car to each other yeah it's like go ahead man after you it's fine no one really there's no real road rage well there's that expression right a well-armed society is a polite society mm-hm now I'm not saying that that's my rainbows and unicorns of the world I'm not either but it works yeah that's work it does work there's places where people are armed that it's a really nice place to be it doesn't mean bad things can't happen there and what does that that's very interesting this stuff yeah yeah I've never done a blunt oh it's good right Charlie Murphy got me anything so that's a pre premade blunt mhm yeah Charlie would actually make them so how much tobacco is in there versus it's the leaf on the outside is it rolled on the thighs of virgins I don't believe so I like building I don't know Bill Hicks is bit I do know that some sicko he bizarre supposed to be rolled on the thighs of virgins well it's marketing it's out a bit about good marketing rolled with Claudia Schiffer's pussy lips I think that's what I know skinny Lincoln hot yes definitely skinny yeah but um it's wasn't she married to David Copperfield but she's still with him or was with him for a long time I don't know I try not to pay attention to who's fucking who it seems like it was a while ago and kind of celebrity this at that it's going down I don't know shit she still looks hot though saw a picture of her mm-hmm some of them gals can't keep it together good skin yeah good skin drinks a lot of water good habits I guess mm-hmm I'm so back to the vape pen thing yeah so someone needs to make a documentary that that is a crazy little sneaky move or at least a YouTube video multi-billion dollar scam propagated again multiple states in the United States and free choice of consumers all to protect an industry that essentially we're trying to get away with with vaping yeah because I've been an addicted smoker all my life smoke cigarettes from at least 15 probably earlier then luckily got into weed and smoke you know been smoking all my life pretty much but I still would you know would roll it with tobacco which does give you an extra delivery mechanism and extra kind of kind of kick yeah but then I would just from time to time just smoke one a cigarette and I really it was first of all it's chemicals and all kinds of bullshit is in there stinks to stinks up the house yeah I want to live longer you know so this is this great no I'm sure it isn't you look very good for a person who smoked a long time about 55 you look great for 55 you really do you look a lot younger than I think if if you if you took me and compressed me down I'd look like you really long muscles like we push it all down yeah it would be better yeah but your health yours like you look like a healthy person so I do the dancing and I go to ride indoor cycling oh can you spin that's excellent oh my god and bits is more like a dance orient you wanna use it and it's just fuckin loud music and it's all in rhythm and you've kind of got a group vibe going on and and cardio of course is fantastic they also do weights you know cool three pound weights there's something really cool about doing stuff with a group of people you know more any kind of difficult thing yeah everybody's pushing everybody come on let's go it's fun and so a lot of spin classes are really that really competitive like mad about you see the peloton ads like but that's not what this is this is you do you're standing you're sitting you're tapping back you're doing crunch crunch is you're doing push-ups all to the beats of the faster the beat of course the faster you're doing it so it's it's like dancing but then on a bike when I like being yelled at in you know the dark room boot camp vibe so I don't have my hearing aids in it or my glasses on so I'm kind of like yeah you're blurry right now but I can't see so I can't see the hottie instructor of there doesn't make any difference but something about the vibe so I get into it yeah tell me about the hearing aids because you took him out when you got in Oh put the headphones on and this this is from listening to music too loud no that what you'd think you'd think they'd think no I have a genetic problem that I didn't know about until three years ago and so it's not and I you know went to an audiology here's what happened I started noticing Tina and I had been together for a couple of years I started noticing I was saying excuse me what I just I wouldn't hear stuff or she would say something that I couldn't remember hearing and and I brought it up to her and I said you know see what do you think I asked you to repeat something a lot just uh doesn't really bother me and then says but the TV is very loud so really the TV is very loud said oh I don't even realize that so I went to an audiologist and lo and behold my grandmother on my dad's side was completely deaf almost from her teens so I have some of this but it's been okay only as you get older everything the levels you know to see like here's here's a level where you can hear everything and I was already kind of there so now it's just due to age because everything goes down a bit and so I'm missing 1 K and 1 kilohertz something missing different different tones and so I went to an audiologist and said well it's very mild but yeah this can make you repeat stuff and it will get worse over time and what actually happens to a lot of men in particulars they they become very isolated from the world they don't even realize that they have a hearing problem and now the difference between having them in and taking them out is massive just you know I can hear how much less it is another clue was that I have a for my all my podcast radio work I've no headphone but I put an extra amplifier on you can see you could still hear it today sometimes I'm talking and it'll leak just a little bit because they have it so loud now that's not I'm gonna damage my ears but the problem with anything you put in your ears you don't you can't hear the sounds anymore I like that our processing our EQ it's very important to me so I can hear that without the hearing aids but not with the hearing aids wow that's interesting so the hearing aids give you a different kind of sound well so today's hearing aid is not your your Grandpa's you know geriatric brown goopy looking piece of shit that makes you look like a just a total moron like how dare you you did the face I did the face hey it's disability here I get a victim card okay you get a probably a plate boundaries asshole boundaries okay so these are the wide X evoke these have 35 channels of compressor limiter multiple settings it's an in-ear so it goes right into my ear I still have a little bleed through from the outside world but because of usually an audiologist sticks this thing in your ears and makes you do all the tests and then they'll sit there and they'll sit across from you and they're gonna program it so that you can then hear a normal sound which is very it's a very it used to be a trained professionals very hard to fix someone who has never heard what is proper okay now I'm a little different and I'm also weighing the sound and so it's a whole rack at these things at three and a half thousand dollars it's it's a huge racket and the way they do it is the manufacturer you can't buy from the directly or from retail you can only buy it through an audiologist so they're already getting half the money from the other 1,500 release and you have to have a you know appointment so it's all this money that goes on top and then you come back after a couple months and they tweak it you come back again so I said look see Who I am I've told you what I do give me the fucking software she said oh no no I was going to give it to you I just wanted to do one session with you said you have to have this so I have may have pre-programmed like six different programs so I can do one just for music I can do one for television one for social situations and I have one that and I so I did it all myself all these 50 35 different channels of compressor limiter so when I'm walking around what I hear on my ears is like a radio show like the sound like when I'm talking right now I hear my own voice and it all resonates because I've jacked all that up so I've made my own sound reality of sound but I also have one I can set it to a setting in the mall I can hear a conversation from 50 feet away whoa my my special my eavesdropping setting now the only thing that doesn't work is you can't have headphones because that that doesn't work having the hearing aids in with the headphones with the sound yeah because you're blasting into the microphone it really doesn't work that's crazy though that you could hear people having a conversation 50 feet away can you focus in on people well by turning my head yeah my tournament yes I mean there's a lot you can you can focus you can have it automatic so the problem is the way I've set it up you can drop a pen there if I don't see it I might hear it over there yeah now that's always going to be a problem they have they have an algorithm that will try to guess where the sound is from and tell your ears that so basically I'm not the guy you want in the battlefield Wow but just for yeah so it just doesn't work with headphones that's why I take them out it's amazing though they sound incredibly potent like oh yeah you remember I mean you know what real sound sounds yes yes everything sound real to you or yes there well what you automatically do because I was able to do it from having a common have different settings for different situations so if I'm at home it's relatively quiet or we have some music on or you know TV or whatever now I have Tina frequency which is you know kind of like 1 kilohertz and and that's where I hear her better and so that's jacked up a little bit but then if I hear you talk I can hear it'll be a little I can hear it's not exactly you it's a little too tinny maybe so but that's just me I mean that's not everyone's experience of course but to me it's the disability has become an incredible joy because I have like virtual reality on my head although I was just saying that you could probably fuck with someone's voice like a snapchat filter well you know they can sound l'heure it's really advanced I mean you can connect to an iPhone so you can you can stream wirelessly you can do like if you're driving with directions with the maps you can just be talking and in your ear all sounds like it the like turn right no one else hears it there's no wire there's no nothing I got you know you wouldn't even know I had them in unless you look yeah we're becoming cyborgs oh yeah that's all though I'm against it that is a part of the the the road to transhumanism right but how can you say you're against it where you're enjoying this thing this to me is more it's not a replacement it's an enhancement yeah you know and that's how they're gonna get us gets his legs removed for artificial carbon-fiber legs that you could feel but they can rub a little hex t miles and now when the first guy gets his legs removed yeah in favor of new legs that's when we're gonna go holy shit whenever I tell my radio buddies about my hearing aids they're always like oh that's fucking cool it's like I want that don't get it me wrong I'm just looking at the bleak landscape ahead of us by the way beware I just want to say something because there's a lot of they're not called hearing aids are called hearing amplifiers they have some fuzzy legal language that are coming on the market you know that you put all the way in year the rechargeables got a whole bunch of them they're much much cheaper from an audio standpoint I've done it for 40 years that's not the way you want to go if you seriously want to know how to if you want to hear properly again so see an audiologist is what I'm saying and there's lots of different you know it doesn't it's not all 3.5 thousand dollars it's more expensive but don't I just recommend it that's it self testing is not a good idea one of the best pool players in the world is a guy named Shane Van Bonin and Shane is deaf he was born deaf and when he plays he shuts his hearing aids off and just it's a world of silence and he's just playing in complete total silence and when he does that when he shuts his his hearing it off he feels like he's got super concentration like it doesn't matter what else is going on always doing is just focusing on the balls and there's no that that sense doesn't exist so he can he's focused on other things I noticed that sometimes when I walk with noise-canceling headset same thing it'll do similar I'll smell things more well that's kind of well known yeah different parts of your body compensate for you have something more tuned in more tuned like let's pay attention here the ears are off line amount line can be running behind you and you listen in the fucking exactly is considered and that's it yeah but that's all think about it if you can't hear the mountain lion frequencies anymore and today's mountain lion is you know car engines all kinds of stores you can't hear it it's dangerous and it's and you don't know it you just slip into it I had no idea until you know mm-hmm we have a new relationship you know so we've been living together for a couple years and luckily it you know we're completely open and honest like hey if this is fucked up yeah so cool that that exists though I mean that's an elegant solution and for someone like you it's actually gives you a chance to tinker with shit and I'm sure I'm sure you really enjoy that aspect of it yeah it's a small thing but if you talk about the apps on your phone you're so excited about that that whole band like okay do you use UNIX or Linux you oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah so think pad you think bad guy no I'm not I'm not that deep I actually love the I'm deep I'm not that deep and I used to be a Mac guy and then Mac started fucking up their USB interfaces and I got tired of it and then I went to Windows a lot of the top DJ's you know like the Danger Mouse and these guys are all going windows and the audio or my own check it out and you know some good device is available and so I made this transition and then I was kind of on Windows and like holy fuck Microsoft is spying on everything Windows 10 there's like a hundred different telemetry pieces of shit going out every single day they're just like Apple by the way they're they're advertising too you're like oh use word over here and try out this it's just I can't stand it I can't stand that that you know I have to have an account to use Microsoft Word right I don't want it it's just it's no one else's business and so I bought the surface go which is ten inch screen it's a tablet but has a on keyboard and I just load Lubuntu which is a lightweight version of Ubuntu and and I use that as Linux yeah yeah yeah it's Linux tell those people out there that don't know shit the only problem well the only problem is that there really is no good multitrack audio solution for Linux it just please don't email me I've been following this shit for decades it's not there you don't know what you're talking about you know it's an issue with companies not want to do drivers and there being no platform but that's too bad so I still produce our show on Windows but the rest of my life is is all Linux and my flip phone is that your desktop there it's just a little bunch I just picked up it's beautiful it's the idea I mean what do you use for a word processor if you don't use word Libre Office Libre before I can write we've tried to move to Linux so many times you know I feel like hey man I'm gonna 10 years ago I might install Linux okay the DRI couldn't get the screen to work you know whatever shitter was he because I'm not you know it's we're just hacking around and then like in the last year I said I'm gonna try it again and it's stuck you know like it work is good enough and now we like yes our official distro is Linux Mint 19 that's the one you all want to have and by the way you know have your kid learn how to install it on some old computer it'll teach the kid something and so Libre offers just been this running joke cuz Libre means free and you know I like this lovey-dovey because it is it's free as in free opens open source software yeah I think I know some people get attached that Microsoft it in terms of like office suite know different things but well I just use word that's really well and you can save in Word format you know it doesn't make any difference and I think it's really good you know as far as like a word processing for if that's all I think about like how well does it do it for me it's information management and email i i i use clause mail and you can really customize it survive filters and and like cording commands so i can by by doing this then it'll send back a message like hey man thanks for this and then it'll forward a copy to the back office and save it unread in the show folder you know like that kind of stuff if you want to get balls deep into the world of computer technology it's a long river there's a lot but up to now I've been using my first computer was the sinclair zx80 Sinclair's and I build my own modem which was I think basically like I don't know five baud I guess to commune with an acoustic modem you know so we basically ripped open a phone put the two pieces in boxes and then put another hand side on top here Jamie's got it that's it yeah that's it the sinclair zx80 judy you did that at five baud I remember when I switched from 14 for waiting before that and then my dad always had computers around the house and I was on line on a very early in that's amazing look at that thing so I was hacking with that stuff Wow and then you know the trash 82 you know TRS 100 which was a kind of a laptop on batteries vic-20 commodore 64 so when this first started happening and you started getting going on Usenet you know and you started getting a taste of the Internet like my experience was a AOL I gather I picked up an Apple home computer from one of them office stores whatever the chain was I don't think they're around anymore it was like so it was actually oh compusa course so computer superstore yeah my friend Robby used to actually make computers or sell computers for a living so who's telling me what to get and I got home and I somehow another connected to AOL and then I remember going to the first thing I did was go and try to find UFO FILES that's always trying to find like what are the government's files on UFOs I want to read whatever the fuck you can read I want you know I want to know what they know I was downloading all this shit from these like crude AOL boards and like these online searches we could online search things you just Archie yeah you would get all the paperwork number Archie the search engine Archie Archie and then you had Veronica they would search the types of servers remember gopher do you ever get into gopher gopher I don't remember either that was pretty so check this out Jamie does Jamie so gopher was basically the world wide web only there was no web and so you could log on to a terminal and you could use a menu system so basically with the arrow keys but it might you go to the right you might be connecting to a different computer at a different University ie a different server and then you could have a so it was basically all these information documents linking to each other and I started one I registered mtv.com which was Wow and I went to him and said hey I want to do this thing on the Internet we're a lot of our audiences and I want to register mtv.com yeah that's cool don't worry about it we have the AOL keyword so you go ahead and do your little internet thing there son do whatever you want so I had this girl and I'm promoting it on air you know go to MTV comm for my gopher server yeah that it was wild you could do shit then at MTV yeah and in fact at first I got an email from the University of Michigan or that the Gophers is that their symbol Minnesota oh my god thank you and they said dude you're using this commercially you have to pay us five thousand dollars for a license I'm like just for the server software which is open you know free but they do something in the license head I'm doing this just in my own they don't give a fuck I'm just doing this I don't have $5,000 really didn't I don't $5,000 said if you send me a t-shirt I'll wear it on MTV and they said okay and I guess my document you can see that there's a video on YouTube with me with the Gopher t-shirt on MTV and they're like oh man so anyway then that's cool on them too so I got this set up and I got an email from this guy in Champaign Urbana Illinois and it's like hey Adam see what you're doing with mtv.com look I got this thing that I've created this mosaic browser and can you install the server httpd 1.4 or whatever and that was Marc Andreessen the guy who went on to create Netscape Wow and you know I was now on one of the biggest VC in in Silicon Valley and when I saw that oh shit this is like graphic like a webpage when we used to images would take a long time to load this would be black and white progressively loading them become color like like a porn picture took an hour to download you yeah I remember the first time a friend sent me a porn video he's like look at this I was like what you can send a video what was it you remember what it was a girl giving a guy a blowjob and it only lasted like 15 so of course and that was you know and it took you two hours of down forever remember I'm using it you would download from 15 different things and you get like all these different files and you had a program that put it back together shit what is this they are the Gopher t-shirt oh there you are those days give me to everybody do those days feel like like a different human being when you look back at that like that's a long-ass time ago and because of the time yes I'm sure MTV was like back then and just life back then it means well don't you have that yourself just with age yeah I mean so of course but yeah is it's all still a part of me that MTV period is so definitively closed because it's just not it that will never come back yeah I mean it was a magical time it was fun and to this day it can be in the oddest places it's usually a guy in in a suit and tie oh that I have yeah I can catch things like people drop a a bottle I catch it on the way down that's my superpower you get arrested you get a superpower that's my catching silver it's super reflexes are good usually a guy in a suit and tie and all of sudden it's like and the tie comes off and like Metallica t-shirt I love that and we share that and you know that's a shared experience that that only only our generation has yeah and then you know once once be et started getting the you know Anton TV had to buy B et because they were you know getting world premieres from Michael Jackson oh so that was the whole thing there and you know it just got commoditized they were so smart to go on they did the smarter the people who are running at the time were very smart to go with long-form programming they saw it with the remote control and of course they already had seen a little bit of it with what's the first reality show they had forget what's called the real world real world yeah so they you know because the MTV ratings during the day were 0.5 basically and I was always proud that I would sometimes break one but I had interesting shows that you know people like to watch like dial MTV that was the precursor to Total Request Live Carson Daly show so I did that and you know that was just the top ten of the day but people had the idea that they were making a difference in the in the chart which they weren't because it was number one can you guess what was number one requested every single day what New Kids on the Block they it was the biggest problem in MTV the other sometimes they just did they didn't make it on Jeep or we're not playing anything under number five today Oh New Kids on the Block er 6g which it was it was kind of bullshit kind of bullshit yeah didn't that come up recently discharged her with like Twitter I couldn't Twitter trending top did so hard on Twitter they had to stop him from being number one what they would be number one better like Taylor Swift or Beyonce someone would be oh yeah well if anyone has any idea that this is fair these these rankings and fuck that it's it's all weird everybody's competing hey Joe this is really nice yeah they're having a really good time - I'm really happy here really I always want to be part of kind of the pirate crew out here and now I feel like I've kind of connected I swear to God we didn't try to be a pirate crew that's what's the weirdest thing about the whole thing there was no thought about it at all I just kept doing it there was never a plan I mean I mean as far as the plans making this building that kind of a plane right which is incredible and it's just beautiful to see I love you got a clubhouse you got it's a fun club that like an honest-to-god grown up dude clubhouse yeah it feels good in this place it's got good memories it's got a good feel to it mm-hmm but but through your show you know you've introduced and you know I would say mainly the comedian's it's been the best just and thank God for Netflix and all this stuff that's happening it's just this is kind of nucleus of it all yeah and and and it's it's a lot it's interesting to be able to see and watch and this I think comedians change the world when when they're good at it and when they care and I'm seeing more and more of it and I like it you know maybe time for a little bit of pushback here and there yeah it's I think what it is is we have a place where comedians can go and give you like from them to you for the first time and it's never really like the most she ever had was like a moment if you're a talk-show host where you could address the camera I just remember there's a really powerful moment when what's-his-name the English guy that just Craig Craig Daniels Craig Craig first thank you sorry is that English Suzy is the Irish Scottish sorry Craig I like him a lot but he had this moment where he's talking about Britney Spears mm-hmm we really looked at the camera and he said it was about her being crazy like when she shaved her head like what are you doing what are we doing like why I found this girl this poor girls losing their mind yeah I found her alone hounding her leave her alone yeah and that really is what it is is like once someone like that becomes a topic mm-hmm and it's a subject that they can get clicks on and views and and ratings they'll just hound that poor girl what do you got Bill Cosby in jail yeah that's right mm-hmm yeah that's right Hannibal yeah it's some talk about Peyton cancel I know the next level canceled yeah and he deserve that deserved every minute of it it's very strange right he's the strangest of all of them when I was a kid we would listen to his album where he he talked about God talking to Noah the conversation God know hilarious hilarious work it was great great comedy it's hard to imagine that the whole time he was doing that spooky it's hard to imagine how I'm going to drive back to the airport in a straight line like a wizard do you have no problem hang out here for a while - good good you could go work out music is hurt but how about that sauna though I like that oh you didn't sell enough that not it's a rave man yeah do you sauna at all no I love it I have I just have a play in Amsterdam I had a place with a sauna in the house that was nice it's so undeniably good for you if you do it all the time but then I'd be smoking weed in the sauna don't do that no I was right you could smoke weed and then get in there mmm that's not a problem that's probably good hey I like it a lot it's good experience is he done the flow tank I did that once I did not like that at all I lost your phobic no no I just was I couldn't I couldn't get into any kind of zone or vibe I just kept like I'm laying here in lukewarm water like I'm not hearing anything I was like no mi thing am i liking this it's getting a little cold Ordo it's getting warm right so I couldn't I couldn't well that is a real issue if it's not temperature control correctly and you feel cold it'll fuck up your experience you really want it in that perfect sweet zone but when you can get there it's really all about whether or not you know how to concentrate on breathing if you can just concentrate on breathing done breath work yeah it was very interesting it's not a difficult formula that I employ but I'll tell you guys if you listen if you also float when I get in there I touch the sides to Center myself so that I don't bounce against anything and distract myself because I'm floating you know and you drift into the wall sometimes so I wait until the ripples die down because when you climb in there's gonna be like a little bit of ripple edge right and then when you lay down once the water gets still then I let my hands go and then I just think about breathing and I thought I'm not a wizard at this right it goes in and out I think about I forgot to call that guy I gotta send that email oh I got a I got a book that I got to put that on my calendar I keep and then if I just stay vigilant and make sure okay okay get back on the road and the bat the road is thinking only of the breathing only of the in and out and in and out I just like visualized air coming in and out of my lungs and just that alone while lying in the tank would put me in a trance it takes a while but I can do it quicker because I've done it for years because the tanks a normal thing I get in I'm like hob the most I always think is I should do this more often that's what I usually think but I can get into trance by just thinking about the breathing yeah Tina and I did a breath work clinic I forget what it was called but you do it was like this tribal beat and you had to continue to breathe to the beat and wait and you have one person will be watching you and then you team up but we didn't team up together but it's just like that and then this beat is going and then you do the breath work and then all sudden you go into a trance it's different for everybody and I could fly and that was my just like 30 minutes I'm just flying and yet right after you had to draw what you were doing I mean it's one of these well yeah I'm a little I'm a little hippie - I like this stuff it's good so you draw it and then I just Joyce I was flying I was like but I like this man kind of yeah I got man but but I could just because I I'm a pilot so I knew how sure yeah I was like oh fuck this is all I need and you know the people had different experience with one woman who I was partnered with her turn and she just and they told me that she could get a little funky and she just kind of got out of it and picked up a plastic bat next to her which I had seen she starts hammering the pillows like really blah blah blah oh my god mm-hmm and it's just you know but fantastic you come out of it you're like wow I mean that was just such a great experience I bet that bitch does that Starbucks - I bet she's just wild just look pretty stupid she does the yoga class starts punching the walls through this pose oh maybe not maybe so but no thanks but holotropic breathing I think they call that that's probably what it was yeah I mean I know that is one of them I don't know maybe there's other methods that they do it but the people that do it say it gets your high as fuck see if we were live than Tina would text me now just like she knows all that yeah I think our Brees done that shit I think it's holotropic breathing right is that the only psychedelic breathe is there's a for sure method that people you could do so much with your breathing yeah do all kinds of crazy things I mean have you ever done you seen those yoga dudes you can suck their stomach in and do that yeah is the thing where there's autonomic kills in the side I don't find it particularly attractive it's it's very impressive yeah I don't know like I've never really understood it like what do you do I didn't know it was an exercise I just thought it was showing off I don't know what the fuck they're doing because even though it's it's impressive I've never attempted it it's one of those things where looking like oh yeah look at that like that it's impressive but but to someone who can actually do the thing is like I don't know what they're doing I have no idea but there was this famous Jiu Jitsu guy named Hicks and Gracie and he was famous for it he was one of the first guys to incorporate yoga into martial arts like really seriously and it's the greatest Gracie of all time right and he would lay there there's this there's this video for this movie choke where he's sitting there in a lotus position he's doing this crazy shit with his stomach I can't believe it's real watch this look at this watch this this is Hickson why do this like this intense breathing but then see he would move his stomach oh this from the movie choke but watch what he could do with his stomach oh yeah yeah yeah look yeah look at this crazy shit where I could pull it to the left into the right he has like ultimate control over his breath and that strength and control over his breath from all these breathing exercises that he did it was a big part of like how he could fight and how he could how was jiu-jitsu was so strong he had incredible breath control incredible body when you say why his jiu-jitsu was so strong what does that mean exactly he was what the mole dominant of the most dominant families fighting seals in jiu-jitsu okay he's alleged like a legit like there's there's very few Universal legends I should come during one of your like fighter talk things I would learn a lot yeah it's interesting this guy's one of the most interesting he's one of the most interesting because his family in Brazil was famous for creating this form of jiu-jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu that went on to win the Ultimate Fighting Championship and really revolutionized martial arts right but he was the champion of the family and not just by a small margin by a large universally agreed-upon margin where all of them would go Hickson's the king like no one's even close everyone says that he would go and he would get some of the best black belts in the world like a hundred of them in a room and he would just one after the tap amount one after the other fighting is no he's an older man now and you know he's teaches and he I know he still trains and he's involved in these big seminars because his opinion is very very respected because it was an intense level Jiu Jitsu that he was able to achieve but he literally at peaked he hit past everyone he figured something out to get way above everyone hmm and I think that had a lot to do with it I think the yoga and the mindset or meditation his mind was strong and then because of the yoga his body was really flexible and really like well conditioning can contort and these amazing ways to achieve submissions and then also his jiu-jitsu was so sharp like his family created it and everything was polished everyone knew everything that the correct defense the correct offense where you never make mistakes can't be in this position always be here abandon that and go to this you have planned BCD and you keep going with through mass just running like running these trains of techniques on people it's special to watch anyone else like him there's a bunch of guys now there's a bunch of fucking assassins now but in his day he was just there's no one person that stands out above like everyone this is kid Gordon Ryan who's this really elite submission artist who taps everybody in competition and he's trained what I'm sorry what submission artist mean well there's Jiu Jitsu with Aggie right with which is just you know jujitsu rules they vary depending upon the organization but you where the key and you can use the key you can choke people gears is your address your ass the white the white kimono or the blue one people have bolted a guy from the commercial says no this is my business key yeah yeah right but even a jacket you know like you're using clothes right the idea is like if you got into the fight was like judo yes exactly either that actually comes from part of Judo called knee Wazza which the ground I did a little judo's okay very very little jujitsu came out of judo judo is the original and Japanese Jiu Jitsu and then it became Brazilian Jiu Jitsu when the Brazilians legitimate changed it and altered it and then there's submission grappling submission grappling there's no key so most of the time guys we're like rash guards like skin-tight like surfer rash guards those kind of okay or you know or skin tight short can't really I can't really hold on to it exactly their ideas you can you can't grab close it's just about it's like wrestling mm-hmm but it's wrestling with chokes and armbars and okay in that world there's a guy named Gordon Ryan has a real prodigy and his his trainer is considered to be one of the all-time great trainers his name is John Danaher and they come from hens Oh Gracie's Academy in New York City which is one of the greatest to Jitsu schools like universally recognized ever and is this giant gym in Manhattan it is it just so many killers have come out of this one place so that kid is probably the top of the food chain today out of everybody but even his dominance is probably slightly different from Hickson's because Hickson was there was no losses there was no draws it was like it was just dominating people cuz everyone got dominated and everybody came out of it going what the fuck he just ran through everybody what what how did it end for him what was his last pixon yeah a big exit no well you had a giant fight against this very dangerous guy he began in 2000 and that was an MMA fight and he beat his ass and that's a nice exit that's nice he won out on top never nobody ever beat him in a mixed martial arts fight really didn't fight a lot of the there was a lot of opportunities for different people that he could have fought but he just didn't want to didn't feel like it he's just a free spirit but my point I don't want the fuck 1 point well here's it question a stomach thing deuce what it was that was anything that's where it was do you think it's a gene or is it the environment that I have absolutely no interest in fighting of any kind I don't watch it I'm not I saw the Thrilla in Manilla my dad got me up in the middle of the night you're living overseas to see it and I thought I appreciated that as a as a world event yeah it's just never I've what is it I'm some people I like I just don't I don't understand it I don't like it I think it's cool you don't understand it understand it's probably there's nothing in me that says oh yeah I want see like I beat the other guy's ass yeah that's that should be perfect you know in a perfect world everybody should be like that okay well legitimately I respect it I like where you're coming from never I'm fascinating I'm very interested as I said I did a little judo that was mainly because I was getting picked on at school my dad said here yeah going to judo and so I learned how to you know fall and how to we dive over like five kids and then roll and get up again after that got kind of a little I didn't like it you know like just I don't know I didn't like and they went fencing I was actually very good at fencing I liked that a lot martial arts for competition is a it's a strange pursuit and professionally for competition it's an even stranger pursuit like originally the martial artist gets into martial arts because they want to better themselves they want to be better at fighting they want to have confidence they want to be able to be competitive but just like you want guns to be able to defend yourself there's a lot of people that want to learn how to physically defend them against man right right right I've always said this like if people say like why do you do it why do you work out and what it means first health and sanity first oh but a second very important I want to be the one who decides if we're in an altercation and you decide you're some bully and you run up on me and you think you're just gonna hit me I want to be the one who decides who goes to the hospital not you I don't want you think I were seeing I grew up so sheltered I never was really ever threatened anyway every day all around the world it happens to somebody and if you're lucky you live your whole life by going into the right places and never get punched and never never gets just stole on where somebody just comes up to you and just starts smacking you around now you can't defend yourself because it fucking happens yeah people do it to people people are awful yeah you know and it's most people are not the vast majority or not but you know you do that shit the wrong guy like and you don't you didn't know better and you did that too bas Rutten who's a former UFC heavyweight champion is one of the nicest guys ever you might get confused and think like god you don't know maybe who he is maybe you think you're gonna bully him maybe think you're gonna fuck with them make them uncomfortable and next thing you know you wake up in the hospital I think I'm just reflecting here I have a childhood memory would make which may be where this started for me I remember and I went I entered Dutch school in fifth grade speaking almost know Dutch it was kind of a fucked up situation though um so but say around sixth grade and I was learning a little bit on the street and around but I definitely was not not really 100% fluent and I can't remember what it was is in the it was in the gym in the locker room and some kids something said something and he was much smaller than I was and I said something like well I can take care of you little man and it probably I should have said it in the first place but within like a nanosecond Wow and I'm like you know he's put me down you know hit me in the on the nose and yeah and I'm like oh fuck me I and that meant I think that was the moment where I'm like I should definitely be careful what I say into who I say it and I should watch my mouth but maybe that excuse me from right that from that moment all for sure that's yeah for sure that was yeah so I was like how many 12 something like that oh man for sure that that's gonna leave a stain yeah consciousness oh thank you for bringing this up yeah this is like therapy right this is great right I mean I think everybody needs to know why things bother them why things like conflict bother them does this has I don't know as I'm you're 50 52 yeah so almost we're same age basically do you have more of those moments now that you think oh shit that's that's what happened then and that's why I'm having those which means we're just you're doing something and you think back to a moment like I just had here hey that happened maybe that does influence me now today how I respond situation yeah I'm having more of those and my always having that too that's smart I like it a lot yeah it's very interesting I think oh god if I only known this mm-hmm 20 years ago you're the origin of your behavior is an interesting thing the origin of your idea yeah and where you are now you know it's a you know we're just the way we choose to behave about things it's very strange but anybody doing something like that to you when you're that age I must have been an insanely traumatic experience you wouldn't want to watch I didn't even tell my parents about it I didn't tell my parents about it yeah I was so ashamed yeah yeah it's hard no the the solution to that as strange as it sounds is everybody know how to fight right getting their way less fights if it sounds great it's right on I think there's you know it's taught I think it should be taught just for peace whereas we seem to be going kind of the opposite direction with the with a general mmm cultural education of young men at least yes in the United States I don't know if it's the same everywhere I think it may be kind of propagating out there some of the nicest people I know are martial arts people so of course because they have their ego in a good place in their sin to the general population they've been humbled in training everybody gets humbled in training it's so good for you it really is and it leaves you calm like you get exercise in and you get some sort of a weird therapy to from when you're a man and just knowing that you aren't you you know aren't helpless I've seen people that are helpless it's very sad I think it comes from anything you learn like learning how to fly yeah you literally helpless if you're doing it wrong and an instructor a good instructor will you know help you get into situations that you have to get out of and that same feeling arrives I think that that's a part of just the learning process yeah I should probably try it you'd love it yeah what should I try what would the well listen at Tina's laughing right off like oh yeah oh yeah after this and I'll find a okay spot we could go and learn and just you would get a kick out of just the learning just like you get a kick out of learning the dancing yeah exactly specially like if you take something like more tie more types of fun I saw I was I did a documentary in Thailand did you really how is really quite Slive oh yeah yeah I love the rhythm of the music you know it's all cute clued in to how they do their shit yeah I went up to the Burmese border the Golden Triangle stayed with the hilltribe whoa I've done a lot of crazy stuff documentaries what is that how come watch that it's called Veronica goes and Veronica was the the organization that I worked for in the Netherlands the broadcast company is it available online could someone find probably bits of it on YouTube Veronica goes Asia and so it was Thailand I mean we did a number of things we went into brothel you know where the girls have all the numbers and we film there I oh man I'm going to the longnecks you know would they have all the rings on and I was thinking oh this is gonna be great we're going to see the long next four and a half hours and the first to get from Shanghai to Shanghai up in the north then a four and a five or five hour bus drive because we said cruise right so we're 10 people with producers and everything and it's like it's gotta be around here and there's like a big sign almost a neon log next this way I'm like fucking tourist trap it really is you know but then we went up to the hilltribe I'm sure that they've done it before you know had crews over but it's only women cuz all the men are in the opium Hut and just completely stoned smoking opium the women run the whole deal and and they they chew the beetle nut root with uh with a white paste in it some kind of cocoa paste and so of course for the documentary I tried that no and their mouths are all red your teeth get completely red from the beetle nut oh my god and it's like oh shit and it's like like an elevator you got a DMT can be a little bit of an elevator vibes look guys I'm fuckin hammered spit out all the rest of it and it stayed with me for a good 45 minutes the sensation like a bit DMT but very very light version of it you know yeah so it's a psychedelic I guess so just just you felt this like you know it felt kind of clear yeah like oh this is kind of interesting but alright I'm pretty high just I don't know I haven't done a lot of different drugs so I'm not quite sure but it was interesting but I don't like the red teeth it's kind of awkward socially yeah it's a turn-off I think the Beatle root non-root night and cocoa paste or probably coke and some red stuff well knows what evil not root what's what's in that jazz Jamie do we find out you got to see the women's you got you got to see that you got to see they're they're red what of me I think so Veronica goes America Asia and Caribbean as like an 11 on YouTube oh yeah France got you we also had to drink Cobra blood yeah it's kind of sad because first they piss the Cobra off and they gonna get the venom and this is dinner restaurant they get the venom out of his sacs and then they slit him open and bleed it into a glass of alcohol and it's supposed to be very potent it's but except me that's not you but that's no but that's this guy's got the teeth of someone who eats that so he looks very happy yeah so leave that guy the far right no anyway do that one who the hell that's a lady look at her tripping balls it's happiest fuck anyway but we also shot a lot of Muay Thai mmm so we went to like these you know the small like village fights we just you know kind of this makeshift ring in the middle of the jungle and all these people and the music and just that would be something that would manage a feudal or magical you you would enjoy it I think a lot of twisty and kicky stuff yeah twisting kicking stuff common like know how to dance and move your legs around oh I'm an excellent dancer I bet you are it's actually my wedding video week so we got married in May and you know these days everyone has an iPhone so there's just video everywhere and I look at myself dancing I'm like oh my god this has to stop this video has to be illuminated I am actually that guy I'm so bad let's at least learn to dance some proper dances together because then I can keep my posture up my frame right and that just became a hey this is kind of fun we are doing this with each other yeah like some people go golfing you know maybe we'll go dancing it's a look if you watch like old Fred Astaire movies real dancing is very impressive oh my god yeah here's a strange thing like okay how did that get associated with homosexuality Broadway and I love Broadway musicals right and I think that's that's where he came but if I think about the those Fred Astaire type days like they're only men we're doing yeah that was a really manly man three gentlemen who could strut and they danced around remember where I do this it's the and of course we always say Fred Astaire was great but Ginger Rogers did everything backwards in heels so right I don't underestimate he's wearing heels - yeah dance do they think of top heels yeah her heels are bullshit though but when you're right at least women back then the days of the crooners you know Sinatra and the Rat Pack and hates pieces and when we cos call women broads and they ass you know hey some chicks still like that yeah who's the asshole that made women wear those fucking shoes you know like who's the first person that figured out stilettos well heels well you know why you know why why they're worn I mean the initial idea is - because of the angle and the pressure your calves pump up and that is deemed as more sexually attractive in fact I think it's pretty proven to work that unmeant attraction to women red lip lipstick is also part of the blush you have after orgasm blush on your cheeks all that stuff is sexual and it's just exploited by a huge industry yeah for sure it's just where they talk to checks into it they heal things especially like imagine men we're all I love it when the other ones you love it don't you think it looks fantastic I do but imagine if we went the other way and if men were the ones who somehow or another by our culture were tricked into wearing stilettos and the higher the heel like the the cooler you looked he looked at the clock we have entire swathes of men tricked into putting a noose around their neck every single morning with all kinds of weird shit at least that kind of looks cool it's a new citizen news it's in news I said they're coming someone who said said I wouldn't wear one cuz I know if I got ahold of someone's tacit joking to death with it exactly yeah especially if it's like a sticky tie and if it's the win if it's a wins or not the best weather ties that shit's preposterous what kind of time a leather tie strap work yeah we really have a strap murder wedding the murder around your neck and but also uncomfortable yeah it does look cool something about it mysterious men get pushed into all kinds of things in commercialism but that's cool if you been if you listen to someone who really cherishes a good suit talk about it mm-hmm then you kind of get it they're in love yes yeah yeah yeah it's nice yeah some things some people really in his suits they look at reckon like an art form well yeah I mean there's my Richie he had a whole thing he was telling me about it he came into the with a beautiful suit on mm-hmm and I was like look at that fucking suit man I told him about the tie thing and he just like shook his head he's a black belt in jujitsu too though okay he didn't he also like makes no sense to do that he said well it does make sense but you know he's like you know grab my tie right no I'm not gonna happen he's actually a black belt from hens Oh Gracie mmm that guy we're talking about earlier yeah but dude Guy Ritchie loves suits but the way he talks about it like you love suits to York ah I get it like the way someone talks about like a really well-made handmade shoe that you got from some Italian cobbler and you're like oh I get it right you're wearing like a piece of art like this is someone's are but yes it is a boot right right but it is also when you see that thing it reminds you of Italy it reminds you of a guy who actually made us yeah like there's something fucking cool about that that we're definitely getting away from in this like like someone who can make a watch like if someone makes a wat like they're taking all these things and putting wheels in there and or you could just get like a fucking g-shock I've had this watch longer than my daughter's been alive thirty years it's amazing and I and I have I've tried other watches but I just it's a piece of me now is it a Rolex yeah it's beautiful I bought it back in the old MTV music business days if you're a douche bag then you had a diamond bezel around it and now this is actually very popular amongst rich women go to a loss harder my former New York banker friend to go to his dinner party and is like mom and it's like three women here wearing my watch is like still looks great I love it it's not a classic but it's the goal just kind of melts into me now and it's a part of me and it's a reminder of a different time yeah when it when this shit mattered now is I don't care but it's beautiful I think it's a cool thing that but it's got a lot of sentimentality right yeah if you go back to the origin of wristwatches it's amazing how long they've been around pocket watches but the fuckers figured out how to do that shit hundreds of years ago they figured out when did they figure out a pocket watch like what was the year because that was the first one you get on a chain you pull it up I guess you had a wind it mm-hmm but the fact that it worked like they put a bunch of fucking gears together in this thing that you carried around everywhere and it kept time when both my grandparents died they died very close to each other 16th centuries holy shit is that a Hamilton 1510 in Nuremberg Germany um it's a Peter hell Peter henlon Henlein Henlein h en le I N and he created the first pocket watch in 1510 according to Wikipedia the Italian Italians were producing clocks small enough to be worn on the person by the earliest 16th century I'd be weird wearing like a necklace clock like play the place yeah just like Flavor Flav that guy is 60 years old and he's still wearing the clock around his neck once once you know what time it is remember those guys back in MTV and they be on there were nuts there in the street jumping around Flavor Flav just doing his thing with the clock like wow man that's still your gig yeah you were talking about Mark Wahlberg the other day and you know I do stat or with him I had a syndicated radio show and the stations would put it on if I came to their summer jam origin b-59 yeah a summer long MTV's Adam curry and then they had Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch sisters with voices it's sometimes ub40 I would be cool if they were there every weekend I go off to some bad top 40 radio station around the country and that was what Greg Lally put together my buddy and in Austin he he and I did that and he was promoting all the artists and so Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch it was yeah he was just like you said like a Calvin Klein underwear model cool guy you know nice he didn't seem to be calm and didn't cause a ruckus on the road or anything and we stated some pretty shitty places and all of a sudden he's like mr. Hollywood and doing well I did I liked it and never stopped no like you started doing well and like when the eighties yeah it's like it's like Will Smith I mean we use invented himself too we did Sega Genesis in launch parties together yeah and he was doing parents just don't understand yeah I know it was great yeah amazing that's him no I wasn't yeah 18 maybe wasn't 17 not just anyway he's been around forever yeah and still doing I mean the fact that he was able to reinvent himself too is a major movie star - yeah amazing fantastic good stories yeah when you remembered the birth of the internet when you remember first getting on in it and then seeing the expansion was there ever a moment when was the moment I should say well obviously now today we all realize it's out of control and it's just wild it's a very strange thing that's taking over our lives and then with I want to talk about neural link to its I'm sure you know something about that about Elon Musk's invention Doral Inc I know a little bit about but when you're when you saw it kind of getting away like when was the moment or where you were like this is a very strange thing that's never happened to people before well I had the online part figured out because I ran a bulletin board you might remember those you could call in normally like five lines and you go in and do your business and then get out all yours that oh this has got to be early eighties no maybe even late 70s so there's time for innovation there right there's big long stretches where things don't get any better well the speeds got marginally better people got more phone lines that the computers you know we're able to do more then there also some other things happening we had Windows Windows 95 came into play so now people were you know we're in a different world of computing it used to be Doss and people have you know WordPerfect and and then all of a sudden you know we have an interface on top of it yeah we didn't have that there so that started to teach people how to deal with the environment so that was all there but the Internet itself would be 1987 and I logged in to get on the unit you had to log in to a dial-up account launched a PPP session or slip and then you had to launch the software on your computer and then you could open a terminal and you could type things like telnet and then a domain name or in even an IP address you could connect to someone else's thing and kind of look around it was just all text-based but that for me was like holy shit you can connect from one to the next I understood the hyperlinking I understood how powerful that would be and if I just had a little computer today on my desk I had a Mac plus with a gigantic external 20 megabytes Guzzi harddrive 20 megabytes that's a that's an empty word doc yeah you know so that big thing like that it just lit was like oh my god this is this is this is going to be it so the second moment was the Andreessen with his HTTP demos a Brower browser the web and then the third moment was Carl Jacob he's a investor maybe even on the board at Facebook but he worked at Sun Microsystems at the time and he contacted me so cami I see what you're doing I wanna send you a computer you sent me as a son Voyager which is like a portable a luggable with a LCD color screen and this is you know 80 88 something like that a UNIX which is even crazier and so he started to show me stuff and he actually streamed a song from his workstation in San Francisco to my computer in Montclair New Jersey and it played I had him on the phone here I heard him started and then it came through and it played on my on my computer that I'd never seen this before or heard it I was like fuck broadcast we can use this to broadcast and since that moment I think that's the mission I've been on and look at my mama I have arrived here we are that's an amazing story man that's cool as fuck I love hearing it from someone who was there from the very first steps and you're we used to have the yellow pages the internet yellow pages which was a book I still have it it was published it was published here you can look up everything in the yellow pages that that was a business business what yellow pages got fucked right of course that shit fell apart he's what happened with newspapers here's where the newspapers fucked up with the news when the internet came around and there were I saw it other people saw it Craig Newmark saw it and it's classified because they were all hoity-toity about that advertising model but people they were really making the money off the classified ads everybody knows it everybody knew it and that's what Craigslist who who tried to sell it to Tribune was a Tribune or Hearst maybe it was Hearst for just a couple million bucks and it's like now we're not interested we don't need it not invented he or whatever and so he ate up there they're they're classified business overnight and they were left holding the bag saying well we have cool news to advertise on well-known I'm put some in there but now it was about the class-wise that's where the money came from Wow Dvorak can tell the story of Alice Alice makes a show you can tell the story about Craig Newmark and how they passed on it and he does that very well the classified ads do they even have them no newspapers are gone obits dead people is that still the good business yeah of course they have some but no not really how often do you hold a physical newspaper in your hand and read it whenever right whenever I'm at the airport I always buy the newspapers yeah because I don't want to be on my phone right just read the newspaper yeah yeah do use Android no iPhone I have a strip down I called cloaked no sim card VPN piehole there's a lot of different parts on it that I do carry it's iPhone 7 if I need to but there's no ignore other apps on it no extra apps just just blanket yeah so that's not that in case of emergency yeah if I need to do something yeah like I want to use the GPS and also has an iCloud account that's not you know it's not in my main iCloud accounts all right that's I'm trying to make that Adam curry and remove my other digital footprint I did it move it over a little bit so or something at least confuse it a bit Wow whatever happened to wasn't there a blockchain phone that was going to be released there's a number of of interesting projects that are Linux based I'm trying to think of the one that's on the a lot of its crowdfunded this company actually they make laptops that are completely they'd all all open-source Hardware shit Jamie can you find what was the name of that country it's uh I feel stupid now it's the weed it definitely they but they crowd fun but they've had very successful crowdfunding with Linux laptops with open-source hardware because that's that's really where you have to look for the problems because you know advertising it's an insatiable thing that these companies are hooked on and so they and the the data they have to keep getting data from us that's the system so you know when we start to cut it down they move to the hardware they move to different different types of ways of getting data and you know right now I mean you still can't hide from cell phone triangulation there's all kinds of ways people can find you that's really the biggest problem if you can track someone's location you can build their life add a credit card to that meanie john c Dvorak's wife she does the company's taxes a very family business and she kind of I think she used to do some kind of auditing in the past and she'll call up and say oh here's what I always see you do and she'll tell me exactly what I do where I go when I like to eat out she has all these patterns and she just does it for fun do you have GPS in your car yeah you can't get rid of it I mean there's no they no manufacturer after probably 2015 allows you to completely turn off tracking well you got an iPhone 7 once killer just 69 Corvette but that's the point everything everything is built in and yeah I mean I think that didn't really start until like mm well they sold it to us in a great way with on call you know like boom I'm upside down on call help is on the way what is this Jamie I typed in a Libra there you go Libra thank you what did what did you type in crowdfunded Linux fantastic yeah Brett here ISM pure isn't a they make a bunch of product yeah do you mean laptop or phone they make both so they make the laptops the phone they're coming but there's other projects as well it looks like a real phone but he isn't here's my problem he's my problem what it's still gonna bleep in blue right I don't want it right it's gonna be on you I'll buy it of course I want to have it because I have control over keeping it off and not using it when I'm on the road but as a basic thing if I'm at home and I just want to surf I'm sitting down yeah I'd rather use that saluté Apple I kind of trust Apple to a degree you know they're pretty good about not selling stuff they know so their Maps is would would be what I use I trust that yeah but only as far as I can throw them you know I mean I'm sure there's a million guys going curry you have no idea how they try I do so but I just try to make less data what do you think happen with Google that were they removed don't be evil I think it was do no evil do no evil that's right people get that wrong like which is which is which is Eve no I mean it's one of those things that it's like a Mandela effect okay right like the bernstein bear yeah like Mandela but for whatever reason well that's a they okay so these guys who grew up you know under you don't be evil mmm I thought it was don't do evil but that was in it was in the s1 document and I remember reading it and I thought okay I could be so it is either way it doesn't maybe they maybe they change that half way and we're from don't be evil to don't don't do you leo you don't either they adjusted from do the right thing no it was let's it says now I guess nicer Oh either way anyway whatever the word so these guys didn't grow up by accident this is gonna be my big Google conspiracy theory just I'll give it to you it's one way of explaining it maybe I'm foolish okay they had a lot of help from conspirators their main their main boost was the acquisition of keyhole and this was a you have to know that the company Inc you tell which is a venture capital company which is the CIA's it's not a secret the CIA's they would say our CIA venture capital company and they invest in stuff and they help the keyhole acquisition and keyhole is the mapping that's really what Google Maps was the most important thing you can have as a person's identity is where they are these guys kind of grew up young under oppression of Russia so they both come from and they kind of came into the system if you look at the universities and the people involved on how they were almost given some kind of prizes for things they did I mean there's an alternative story to the Gen narrative of how Google came to be so I think there was a lot of intelligence people involved in this involvement setting it up and the psychology of Larry and Sergey some psychologists have analyzed and I've listened to a lot of different people is that they kind of become what their oppressor was to them and it's not really I don't think they're bad guys but this is psych psychosis that happens if you grow up in some kind of stressed-out situation you know people who have been have you abused often abuse others right and so I think that's what's going on the problem is I love all the technology I love what all these companies and everybody's doing the business model is just fucking humanity it is it's fucking us by giving away data yeah influencing people not letting us is that data not letting us share in in the revenue of the data right or having some control over it there should be some sort of legislation that recognizes what data is and that they look at it in terms of like like its commodity and saying like selling and buying and selling well I think there is there is some of that is there some that really evenly balances it or or looks at it for what it really is like well what is data I mean what is my money is data money and money is not providing a service all data it's all data yeah it is all day you have to have it has to be a trust relationship and it's if their business model is what at it as it is now if they don't change it no legislation will stop them from getting around the problem or now it's you get free shit and we get your data you get a free browse here's the interest of your day here's the interesting thing the Internet is although no longer quite the same way with up upstream and downstream being equal due to you know the cable companies and how they've implemented your personal connection we can still do our own servers you know it doesn't all have to be on YouTube on Facebook on Twitter there's an entire was talking about mastodons No Agenda social calm is our own social network it's with open-source software without algorithm and you'll be federated all these other servers much the way the World Wide Web grew up and and there's this mechanism for communicating with each other and so it's kind of Twitter meets email only it's just it looks like Twitter just but you control a lot more of how it works and your community can be a small little community and you have no one come in you can block people or just say I only want these cool people to also connect or that server to connect it's all good so you have all these kind of almost like an ancestry.com tree that branches to all these different places called the Federation if we build upon those kinds of things and don't let other companies or companies at all there's no reason for them to get involved it's very cheap with a believe it or not a Linux laptop you can get started any kid can learn how to do it they should be teaching it at school how to set up a server how to get around some of the hurdles understand how an email server works and we will not need these companies we can have all the joy and a lot of the downside but there won't be a Twitter police there'll be only your own little community say hey we don't like this guy we're just gonna block you or your whole community or we would love to have you guys with us and we can happen to us similarly and that's how you build these networks and eventually you connect to each other on the back end somehow anyway how often do you think I mean how long do you think it's going to be before we're implementing augmented reality into our life in that way in like a social media context because you kind of got augmented reality already through your ears yeah so would be unfair of me to say that it it's mm-hmm it's augmented in that it's enhancing but it's not I have enhanced it in ways that are particular to me but it's not some algorithm really determining things that I should hear and I'm in total control of how that works and how it sounds I don't see the the case for augmented reality I just don't see it I mean when you think about with the apples trying to do with their glasses well I think it's trying to get people from doing this to doing this yes probably that is probably that's all that it is that's a whole that it is but it's also probably adding to the experience right if you can have like little animated fairies everywhere you go that you see through your Apple glasses everything else looks the same if you ever go to the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland yes look you know as a ghost sit right next to you if I see you as one of those glasses on learn some that fucking movie I'm gonna keep you on your fucking head boom like dhalsim what if it makes life so much crisper and brighter you put these babies on it syncs up to the little chip that you have in the middle of your brain it gives you this pleasure feeling and you all sudden different words flowers man I'm always looking for the conditioning you know this getting us ready for these moments and so I think a beautiful moment is this coronavirus where the testing is someone holding a gun like sensor to your head I mean that's preparing people for the for the barcode or the chip you know it's like oh yeah click let me do like a pet like hey they testing just to go to a hospital yeah the test and takes a couple of days that I think they have a test they'll go down a couple hours but they swab deep in your throat or deep in your nose like so it sounds kind of annoying this whole thing is very very spooky well it seems they're conditioned 100 years look Joe we're conditioned we're conditioned through horror movies for this I mean my favorite part of this script as it unravels was the Pope sneezing at coughing oh my god the Pope he's in Italy he has coronavirus World War II like if the Pope dies this will freak out the world and some we talked about on the show we're waiting like oh my god and today they announced the Pope is fine he does he's been tested he does not have corona virus so thank God I think this is sadly we're reacting in all the wrong ways this is completely theological what's going on it's very logical and this is there's it's the death rate and the amount of people who are infected that is misunderstood and so people just throw numbers everywhere and and meanwhile I mean even the New England Journal of Medicine which includes dr. Fauci who's on the on the on the team and who's been around in this business for a long time through the Obama administration Bush administration yeah he's been around said look this is probably going to be no worse than a severe seasonal flu now we know that seasonal flu is can kill quite a lot of people you know could be twenty thirty thousand so in those aspects it's kind of the same but it's being presented in in a sensationalistic way that were completely programmed to respond to remember we already have enlarged amygdalas because of all the triggering and woke neskowin on so give us a little it's true Joe give us a little bit of fear with this thing that were conditioned through all kinds of horror movies and Netflix just had the pandemic movie on just a couple months ago so we're primed we're primed to be suckered into something and part of it may be the Patriot Act which never what ever is going with the pandemic there's always something going on the background do you think whenever there's something going on with the pandemic then they use it as an opportunity to sneak stuff in yes I'm looking for the pandemic appropriate the spending bill someone was trying to talk to me about that with natural disasters or any college it always happened mmm-hmm that there's automatically an understanding that people are willing to do things they wouldn't normally be willing to do so this is when you move in with new registration it's the amendments so you have a bill and the bill will be financing for coronavirus whatever that means the president wanted two and a half million two million I think like a million half was already kind of there and you stuff a bunch of shit in that bill well exactly and it's like a piece of the patriarchy may actually get passed in that because it's kind of like you cannot vote against this shit cuz how can you vote against pandemic saver how can you vote against patriot truck the patriot well this is what a lot there are a lot of people in congress right now trying to break the patriot act apart because yeah this is the spying though or the government can just spy on you and we've been talking about some of that it's not cool yeah this all really was implemented right after the September 11th it was already really yeah it was gonna say Oh Benny from the CIA guy said look they were ready to spy on people long before then totally bring it up mm-hmm they crazy they Adam I hate to end this but it's 3:10 oh shit we've literally done this for three hours that feels so good it was awesome and it was better than I expected I expected it to be awesome and it was even more awesome I really enjoyed it we got to do it more often I'd love to and thank you so much my pleasure having me on thanks for looking creating this thing man you know you're a big part of it you know your your ideas of broadcasting for sure part of the seeds that led to the you know to meet me doing this so thank you thank you very much you're more than welcome but thank you and thank you know everyone who really is around your show and all the comedian's it's a I can die a happy man pretty much not planning yet stay alive I love you all right thanks bye everybody [Music] Wow that was a long chat [Music]
