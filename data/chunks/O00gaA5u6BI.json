four three two one hey fella what's going on hey get that quick quick fix oh my god it's so amazing how fast it came back to me like the addiction of playing that game over and over again it's a real problem yeah yeah we've been going crazy Jamie's been fucking me up too so today I got lucky that he had to help you get his shit together really kills us he's been fucking me up yeah nice you don't really play quick right you just it's from playing a lot night and stuff I tested myself a little bit cuz I knew this was gonna happen eventually so I had to get some practice with some Rockets at some point and yeah but it helped it honestly helps to warm up with quake to play for tonight or play pub G or something like that cuz the quick whatever it is of aiming you don't do it that much so like when you're doing it three times you've already done it 55 times playing quake just in one round right so like your global interaction you have with someone a shotgun you usually win so quake is so fast-paced yeah we're playing quake 4 it's like whoa Jesus Christ I haven't played that game in maybe 15 years see - you know we're never gonna do it again I probably shouldn't what I notice is my eyesight sucks now my eyesight is not nearly as good it's interesting from like 42 to 46 there's a big drop-off and at 46 the fucking floor fell out now it's like my eyesight's shit gamer glasses it takes me a minute when I play games - alright one room isn't enough yeah it probably takes 10 minutes maybe less but like - just trust our tracking things getting your eyes up to speed the distance you are away from that screen all it takes a little bit time to get in there yeah man it's we're right now we're just playing it on the local area network but once you start going online and playing other people that's when it gets super super addictive people that still play that game must be insane oh my god I don't want to be anywhere near Psychopaths if they're playing that game it's because they're really good at it probably yeah you know like who else like young kids aren't buying that game back in the day you even had a Joe Rogan level that somebody created remember has how many created a level that's right was that what game without three or four I think was four was it really yeah four was eleven though didn't come out in 2011 maybe it was thirteen might have been three wasn't wasn't right Rock arena arena for I don't know oh my gosh I don't remember I don't remember I know there was rocket arena for quake 2 and there was rocket arena for quake 3 because I started with rocket arena for quake 2 which if you played today you would think the graphics are hilariously bad but it's a good game it's a little slower the fast game was like quake 1 was really fast to quake 2 is slower and then quake 3 became more like quake 1 a combination of quick one and quick two it's pretty fast quake 4 is probably perfect miss it and you tried to play the new quake but you didn't you didn't like it as much as that the only problem is it's fun we had a good time the only problem is you have to do everything through their servers so it takes time it's got a load it's like it's not I'm impatient right I'm a fucking child that's crazy yeah and you you refuse to try any of the other ones right like that there are all just new addictions you know waiting to happen I just feel like once if I got one addiction this weekend on Saturday they had a concert in fortnight yeah marshmallow it was crazy yeah what does I mean I think it's it's tough to explain what they had it's called an event what they're calling it a psyche an event so at two o'clock everybody showed up at the game and this fucking concert started it was all the avatars are together like in a one gigantic the normal mode you know you played it just like normal and then all of a sudden like two minutes to go they took everybody's guns away and like you all just sort of congregated around the stage and the music started the show started they started doing interactive things with all the avatars and everything and like 10 minutes later just it cut off but it turns out it was actually alive he he was tweeting about it all day cuz for promotion whatnot but people were asking like how did you do that how did you work it out his voice was going live to everyone who was playing as part millions of people yeah you know it's just normal DJ voice stuff like hey jump guys hey was it just like hey guys come on he wasn't interacting too much as much as he probably does during a normal set when he was playing at 20,000 people in Vegas whatever it is so when he does it he probably has like a really microphone to like it's not like the microphone that you talk shit on oh yeah yeah yeah they had something else when we first started doing quick no you had a type yeah that's how goofy it was you oughta tell you couldn't talk shit like now people are talking and like they're all in a group together talking shit right I have a voice changer not to but doesn't the talking shit get in the way like if you hear people talking gets in the way of hearing sounds like sound cues yes you tell your teammates step the fuck up you can turn that off also oh you can yeah I like to hear the footsteps going around coming around the corner and stuff it makes it scary yeah it's part of what's scary about quake is like you hear someone running but growth and you know they're right around the corner you can control all that it's all up to you blood volume settings all kinds it's very very addictive game mm-hmm so we should talk about this the jack podcast because everybody got so upset about it and let's clear up a few things first of all the guy seems to be willing to talk about anything it's not that I didn't want to talk to him about those things it's just he was being I wouldn't say he's evasive but he was basically just saying what he knew based on the company policy I didn't know what else more to ask him and people felt like I didn't press him hard enough and he to his credit reached out to me and said that he would offer to do another one to ask more questions that's cool I said that we awesome so I said well this is the thing that people seem to be upset about they seem to be upset about very specific cases where our people showed like if people were right-wing and they were posting things they were banned whereas people who are left-wing or maybe people of different races or allowed to post racist things or more offensive things and even Doc's people and didn't suffer any consequences for it this is the argument my problem is I don't spend enough time reading this stuff I don't know like this is like when people get banned like Anthony Kumi is a friend of mine I don't really know why he got banned I don't know what happened I know there was that incident with that that woman that punched him and he wound up getting fired he was drunk and he said a bunch of really stupid shit on in and Twitter and then later apologized for it but I don't know that's what got him far kicked off of Twitter but he's my friend so what I'm saying is all these other guys that have problems I don't know what the fuck happened man I'm busy I really don't I don't know I don't even know what got Alex Jones kicked off which is why I asked him because that was one of the last platforms for Alex Jones was Twitter but something got him kicked off their take on it was it they never kicked him off before because he didn't violate their Terms of Service and another thing that's very encouraging that Jack said and I know it's it's fun to get mad at things it's fun to get mad at him it's fun to get mad at me for it I get it I'd probably the exact same thing I totally understand it but one of the things that he said was that he believes that the ability to communicate on the internet through Twitter or through these platforms is a basic human right that's how you look like I said do you think of it like a network like NBC like if you're on NBC they can decide what's on and what's not on or do you look at it like a utility and he specifically said that he looked at it more like that that he thought it was a basic right that's very encouraging he also said that he would bring on whoever it is in his team that's responsible for these things so we could hear from the actual person who decides who's getting banned and why they're getting banned and what what is what's the decision-making behind all these things so we can go over all of them I didn't think the podcast would create such a controversy but that's probably poor prior planning on my part because my thought about it was hey I want it like it's fucking crazy to be running Twitter like it's crazy that this thing exists the president uses a platform I want to talk about the dude who created this and what is this like to have this thing evolved to become what it's become because it didn't start out that way it started out like fun shit like at Brian read bands going to the movies you know I mean like that's what people used it for and then along the way it became this global method of distributing information where people use in war zones man they use it to to tell people where attacks are they use it for all kinds of crazy shit it's like it's a really powerful but strange medium I didn't think about getting into the weeds with all the very specific people that got banned I just wanted to find out why they banned people that was my take on it I know there's a lot of conservative voices that have never been banned I don't think Stephen Crowder's been banned I don't think Serna vich has been banned has he been banned there's a bunch that have not been banned right so it's not like they ban all right wing voices so what is it I don't know what it is I think it's what he said people reporting the tweet and then somebody's looking at it going well this does violate our you know policy and maybe you know all these people that that got banned violated the policy somehow you know it's probably as simple and cut clean as that you know it's it's not that simple right because they make their own policies and it's also not that simple if people are allowed to say similar things that are very racist in vast generalizations about white people which seems to have been the case and at least a few instances where people reported that people said fucked up things about white people but there was no repercussions and you know that's where the argument becomes these people are more oppressed and so the white people are thought of as the oppressor so you have this white privilege thing that people like to use now as a reason to to decide to like silence someone like check your white privilege that's a that's an interesting thing that's happening so if if there's this genuine movement where people think that it's okay to say things about one race whether you like it or not that's racism and if you're allowing that from any one side and not allowing it from another side it seems hypocritical look it's very distasteful the idea of racism against black people in this country is very distasteful to everybody almost everybody who's not a racist right because of the history of this country because of slavery because of all these things it's a different connotation but if you just allow people to say terrible things about any race it's racism you're you are allowing up like a predetermined attitude about a race some people have done this they have made generalizations generalizations racist statements about white people the the really weird thing that people are thrown around these days is that you can't be racist against white people because racism is about power and influence it's about using your your in the bullet that black people are not powerful the white people are power from the white people the ones who are oppressed so it's impossible to be racist against them that sounds like horse shit to me I'm not buying that that doesn't make any sense it's not beneficial to anybody to generalize this is what we got to get in our head it doesn't matter if you're black or if you're white or if you're whatever the fuck you are it is not beneficial to generalize to take a person out of the group that we think of as just human individuals you have to be an individual I mean I acknowledge the fact that people look different they have different Heritage's they have Heritage's they have different the different ancestry their different occupation there's different parts of the world there's all these differences but at the end of the day the only way we're all gonna get true equality and true kinship and camaraderie as human beings is if we recognize we're just all a human being that's it there are very big differences in the way we look and the things we like that's cool but as soon as you you can say shitty things about white people or white men that leaves everybody who doesn't fit that description guilty in this weird way or presumed guilty because of a racist statement that's all it is it's not good for anybody I get it that it's different than racism against black people in America a country that was built essentially in a lot of ways by slavery there's a war for slavery in this country and there's a crazy reality that it's not your responsibility it's not mine I didn't do it you didn't do it but it's real therefore as a person who's aware of his history the history of this country racism against people seems different but it still sucks to be racist against races against black people rather seems different but it still sucks to be racist against white people sucks to be racist against Puerto Ricans it's not good it's not good for anybody it's that's what we have to understand about this social media thing what actually did happen and what is happening why is it happening and if it's just some social justice warrior ethic that you're not debating it doesn't seem fair it seems like there should be a conversation about this and I bet they're super reasonable really intelligent people and it's possible they can come to a good place that we can all agree to that is possible I'm not a cynical person I'm sorry I know a lot of you like folk through them they just won't through so just want that guess what they already have it they have more money than they could ever spend and my dealings with Jack as a person he seems like a very nice guy and a very smart guy and and a very empathetic guy I just think he's in a crazy unmanageable situation to be running something like Twitter yeah and there's probably people that did something that they should have done in terms of silencing people moving things around it's probably happened it's a weird thing when people have influence over people and there's there have been videos have been proven where executives from a bunch of different social media corporations have talked about how to silence certain voices how to push down certain voices this is something that needs to be discussed like is this as a policy as a whole is it you know is it because you you think you're pushing the right message like as soon as someone thinks they're pushing the right message but they don't have it there's no debate about that right they just decide our ways the right way and they're pushing this and there's a radical opposition to that message from half the country like it like it but you like nobody know but this is the one that's in control of the narrative this is the one that's in control of social media it's this far left-leaning ideology and the other part gets pushed aside that's a very bad situation for all of us because there has to be conversation there has to be debate because if there's not it just Shores up the differences between two people and they fucking hate each other even more I did not take that into account and I fucked up that's my mistake that is my mistake when I made that podcast but I didn't take it easy on him because I didn't want to discuss those issues I just didn't think enough of it in advance I'm not as involved in it as other people are I'm aware that their censorship in social media I'm aware my my ideas going into that conversation were more about how insane this method is for distributing information for the people that have been banned and for the people that were fans of the people they're banned I can understand whether it be upset at me it has nothing to do with any preconceived notions that I had it's just how the conversation took place it's all it is and if you felt left down by that you didn't feel like it was it extensive enough I'm more than willing to do it and go further into it and we're going to and Jack offered it and he's gonna bring someone else who's gonna explain things to us I think this would be very beneficial for everybody I also think that there should be a road to redemption I think if you've got something that's important as Twitter or Facebook or Instagram if you're not stealing someone's stuff like you know you're using copyrighted music or something on an Instagram page or you get banned over and over again for doing it but you keep doing it if it's not something like that if it's if it's an ideological difference if maybe you crossed a line that they decide it was a line you should be able to work your way back you shoot there should be a way where you can sign up again I mean like get a new email address I don't mean that I mean be the same person you should you should be able to be the same person there should be a way but there should be different levels definitely every but people fuck up man they they fuck up and they make mistakes right and people also grow I mean there's this guy that was on Sam Harris's podcast Christian P Collini I think is his name he was a fucking white supremacist a full-on white supremacist and now he is the exact opposite he's he's like this very progressive guy who gives speeches on the dangers of racism in that and the idle ideology how it caught up with him now if he got banned when he was a young man and making terrible decisions and then became a better person shouldn't we give it a guy like that a chance to get back in a platform right and without making a whole new screen name like maybe it would be I mean I don't think there's anything wrong with the anonymous model there's some things that are really good about it right like people like Jack even talked about this that people can report news stuff and not worry about fear of retribution that they can you know they can whistle blow and not worry about fear of retribution if someone's life is on the line but they're trying to provide a service to the general public or they're trying to give people information that maybe might even save lives like could put them at risk especially in like third world countries or war-torn countries that could be a huge problem if you have to post you know Brian read ban if there's the only way you can get this information out you have to use your whole name but it probably better off for everybody if people had a way of communicating with each other like it's just person-to-person and I think the real problem is when people try to engineer these conversations and this is another conversation about YouTube people have said that we're deleting comments on YouTube we're not deleting anything we haven't deleted any comments I don't know how it works I don't read them I'm sure people say mean things have a good time the thumbs-up thumbs-down things look we don't have to have that on there you don't have to have comments on there YouTube gives you the option to have comments on and to have the thumbs-up thumbs-down I'm not taking those off you could have a good time with it but we're not fucking with that there's something that they're doing that's not it's not I post at 3:41 and Jamie posts at 3:42 and this is the line of the comments it's not like that they've got their own way of doing it the question is why does YouTube do it what's their what what are they trying to do is are they trying to block out Spain are they trying to block out hate speech are they trying to engineer conversation they talk about common order comments on no the comments disappear they go away a lot of times it's automatic if somebody Flags a comment that just take the comment away until it's like looked over upon only one person yeah on I think on YouTube that that happens quite often probably as little as 1 or 2 people yeah so that is probably what's happening to all you folks that think your comments are getting deleted no one's deleting shit yeah look I'm I'm not attached to what I do in the sense that I'm unwilling to look at what I do wrong I try to look at everything that I do wrong including this so if you were upset at this podcast because you thought somehow another I sold out because I didn't ask him any more questions I just asked him the questions I wanted to ask I understand you have more cost more questions and I do too I have more questions too especially upon seeing people's reaction to it and upon you know making myself pay more attention to all these various stories Matt sent us a list of them some of them are really fucking crazy there's some crazy things people have said and not gotten in trouble for whereas other people said things that really weren't that bad and got in trouble for it why is that that's a good question to ask so we'll concentrate on that we're just gonna work out a date so my humblest apologies to all of you don't not trying to let anybody down I always try to do my best that's it and and also here's another clear one no one tells me what to do there's no one there's no secret person behind the scenes if I fuck up it's because of me it's my fuckup I should have prepared more I should have thought about it more but I didn't realize like how upset people would be I think you did a great I thought was a great interview and I didn't even think of that I thought you kind of touched on it a little when you were talking about Alex Jones and I think that was like okay you know this is what happens well it's a very specific group of people that are upset it's right right wing guys right it's a lot of American flags a lot of Pepe the frogs it's all right people which black man easily could have been me at many points in my life easily especially being a troll online you know if you're working in some fucking job and you may can Pepe the Frog memes and you're fucking with people I get it I get it it's one of the things I like about the internet look I don't I don't want to be comfortable I'm like I don't want to be comfortable time I want I want a little bit of chaos I like the fact that just people like they're like that fucking I was upset that that radio that podcast they took it down where they were fucking with Shia Laveau with those guys from 4chan and the way they took it down was they contacted radio lab and said those guys are white supremacists and they support white supremacy you know and you just you know you've made these people that are awful terrible people that write terrible things you you gave them props but the thing about something like 4chan is no you might read some terrible things but you got to realize you're also reading terrible things from anonymous people that are working at their jobs most of the time and they're trying to fuck with people's head and they're trying to get people upset they're they're having a good time fucking with people if you want to take them as that that's like them like giving giving a talk to a dear friend or them giving an affidavit in court well you're missing the whole thing it's entertainment like half of the whole reason why they're doing it is entertainment they didn't go steal Shia LeBouf flag and go and go right to the camera go fuck Shia LeBouf by using coordinates from photographs of the sky where they figured out where the fucking where the the constellations lie and then drove around honking their horn so that they could locate where it was by using the webcam and listening to how close they got to it I mean it's fucking genius shit and it got taken down just by this accusation of them being racist but the thing about a forum like 4chan or reddit or anything you have so many fucking people you have thousands and thousands and thousands of people if you just have 10 cunts posting jokes about black people that's all you need to ruin the reputation of thousands of people so for someone to say that everybody that was like fuck Shia LeBouf is some racist and white supremacist that's a cheap way out that's a cheap way out I bet more likely it's some dude who's bored and he's sitting in front of his fucking computer and he works all day and this is where he escapes he escapes and types and writes things then checks him later and then goes back to and types thinking checks and it keeps him sane and this stupid fucking cubicle that's a lot of the people so they pulled that whole amazing podcast down because of that look what he with the Shia LeBouf thing was ridiculous he will not divide us come on stop stop we get a chant that everywhere it's funny what they did they mock something that's their way of mocking it nobody got hurt they made it out like it wasn't like awful crime they committed on this this amazing person who's just try to change the world no no they pranked chaila boo and they said fuck Shia LeBouf LaBeouf Shia LaBeouf sure he's a nice guy too he probably did something silly it's a little silly he will not divide us he went what they did was funny it's a funny reaction I like that I like that this is a is important part of this thing if it wasn't for people like that there would be no podcast now they like to dislike ratio that you see on YouTube videos is fascinating right because it's weaponized and they're thinking about trying to ban that now because so many people use it to fuck with people I hate to say this about you folks but every time we have a chick on here they get fucking torture the like to dislike rightly it's ruthless except for Annika Patrick separado Patrick but it's just it's weaponized it's that they're just going to dislike it because because it's fun it's fun because it's fun looks down it's also fun to throw a rock at a window it's fun yeah I mean and some of them probably didn't watch the podcast like thumbs down gives them a la disliking it gives a little bit of power in the algorithm of D ranking it yeah affected something and people who will liked it there's a probably a lot of them that didn't even watch it it's a button you can press people were weird you know but it's clearly it shows by the amount of dislike that people moved on it and they were upset about it so it's basically we'll see there's a lot of cool interesting questions that to ask him like I always thought shadow banning was a real thing but I think he came out and said that that's not the real thing I've seen it in my you know in person word I'll type somebody's name in and usually it's supposed to come up on the you know searches but it doesn't you know a shadow painting is if it is a real thing like that's another one like shadow banning for what like give it if it's not something that is if you're not doing something that you could get kicked off the platform for right you're not kicking them off you're just pushing them down weird place but if you're doing that like why are you doing that like what because like but what would be the justification from the ones that I have seen there used to even be a website that you could type in somebody's username to see if they're a shadow band so that's kind of interesting but like a lot of porn stars are shadow because they don't want if you're looking up Christina Applegate they want Christina you know apple bottom or something like that you know what I mean so it's it's like they're still believe that's a thing but I'm pretty sure he came out and said it wasn't a real thing technically shadow banning Justin Bieber from the training topics right I mean they had publicly said that that's not a shadow band that's a strategy well no they were kind of forced into it because Justin Bieber was so his fans trend so hard they hashtag the shit out of that thing and they just took over the trending it's probably happening for other equally popular celebrities too like Taylor Swift's and be on time yeah yeah yeah you're probably right you're probably right so whatever they're doing at YouTube with comments and whatever they're doing with Twitter the here's the real conversation right the real conversation is do we want that do we want them to curate do we want them to decide whose YouTube videos you could subscribe to and who it's gonna be do they unsubscribe people is that real or is that a glitch yeah who knows I don't think they unsubscribe I don't think so either but people of let's listen if they're willing to move Justin Bieber from the number one trending because he number one trends too hard and they think it's ridiculous not to just acknowledge that our culture there's certain humans in our culture is spending an exorbitant amount of time thinking about that beautiful man right there's a lot but why do we want to lie and pretend that it's not as big so if they just I'm not saying they shouldn't but if they did that just if they did that you go okay are we through the looking-glass now you can change the data like what what do you lend when do you decide who gets pushed here who gets pushed there when do you decide to definitely the trending page on YouTube is 100% controlled by a human I don't know if they've said that but there are videos that should be there they aren't based off of the data you see yeah YouTube's got some weird things going on with it like there's a the videos that they go you might like type thing they did it you might like to me a couple months ago where it was just videos of a guy towing cars in Dallas like out of their parking lot and he made these funny cute little videos with little commentary using videos from the security cameras anyways I don't know why I liked it but I started watching it I was like you know this is interesting so I tweeted it out like random video I just got addicted to on YouTube everybody would like hundreds of people like I just started watching that YouTube recommended that to me like how did that happen you know this little guy with a tow truck company he's now pushed on everybody's laps and now he just went over a hundred thousand subscribers the other day and it was like months ago that he was just had like 10 that dad that that's the argument some people have made that that's how fast the Paul Brothers they grew and that they grew so fast on YouTube that some people thought there was something up they gained like millions of followers within a week or two of being on there I think they were coming from another platform well it's also there's coming from another platform is giant but it's also all it really takes is one person deciding that whatever the fuck you did was funny or weird or crazy like that cashew outside girl yeah well there's that grows you know managed by the same people that owned TMZ and that's why you see it on TMZ I was gonna bring up if you watch the fire the fire festival documentary there's an explanation of this show how they they spread the like the fuck Jerry guys the marketing team spread that with the orange picture there's a coordinated event over hundreds of different social media accounts for her for the Cameo for the fire festival yeah fire fest to catch everybody's because there are a team of people there are agencies that have all these influence their accounts they pay them they don't have to accept the money or accept the offer except the campaign but oftentimes they do so it's like a talent agency on a person yeah yeah the interest they need to share a new person you know launch the next voice and it's like oh here's a new song here's a new movie it's a new way to surprise bro it's pretty cool watching how many people are unsubscribe to fuck Jerry and the Fat Joe though that's yeah but are they I looked at the other days they have like 14 million lost 500,000 in like a weekend really is a significant amount I somebody really was 14.7 then it was 14.1 haven't looked today oh that's coming from I think of video someone who shared this week I think Vic burger made a video they not just spread around and they took his video right I maybe yeah yeah I think that's what he said I think I saw it on Victor's page there's a few comics I have posted videos like hey you know fat Jew stole this you know and I tried to reach out they never got back to me he got 10 million what do you think about this idea though like that's kind of piracy you know like the end so Instagram is allowing and Twitter's allowing piracy well I think they're allowing these people to post videos because you don't really know where it came from there's no proof right like if you find a mean like how many times you posted a meme I pre post whoever sent it to me if someone sends it to me but sometimes I'll just find it in a Google search and you've got to figure out who made that meme and if I find their Instagram account then I'll try to find it and repost it but some people don't and I have it in the past like I did that one with Baked Alaska got mad at me because there was one with Alex Jones sitting in a hot tub and it's like when your friends are trying to chill and but you have to keep dropping truth bombs it was hilarious I didn't know was his I just posted it because someone sent it to me someone sent it to me in a text message I think but those things have a creator right and I know Pete like Eddie Bravo makes his own he makes some sometimes but he'll send some to me or post some online that he finds that are funny too and everybody tries to credit the person who did it right but now what they do is they they take it and they credit the person but they didn't for so long they don't attempt their crediting fake account so don't make there yeah absolutely we're not getting busted in the way you're just explained I've seen that too well what is that about though because that seems like deception it's just the way around the that's backdooring that that qualification of it needs to be on an account when you to point to somebody okay well we'll point to this account but it's not even a real account right and if they find like they'll post stuff and then later add the person because the person contacts them and so they're almost like that's omitting to piracy like we do I mean because it's if they just reposted it a lot of folks including me do that yeah but they're making the person making the money automate more or not yeah that's important I don't make any money off my Instagram right they're taking millions yeah I just I've been offered to post stuff up and not saying that I wouldn't if something was fuckin killer and they wanted to give me money I'm greedy I'll take some money but I wouldn't lie about it and I haven't yet I've never accepted any money yet yeah cuz it's also I think in instagrams you know law that you have to put that it's an ad if you're making money off of it yeah and so that's another thing that both fuck Jerry and fat you are not doing they're not putting it had is it I just wanted like devil's advocate this though is is there a place for them for those accounts like is there a place to have to be the re tweeter of the memes to be that guy to be that account you know like oh yes it is a curator position yeah it's kind of valuable but the question is like if it if it is valuable and it becomes something almost like redistributing your standup if you're doing a set like if stand-up sets were you know something that you just you could get everywhere and you could just repost it on your page but then your page becomes super popular because you know all these people stand up sets you know like a Spotify Spotify gets ads right but they don't really they pay the artists a little bit but mostly they make all the money ya know like if it's you use like say sorry later you just do it and say I'm sorry we'll figure it out after the fact or you these are all figured out business oriented things that have art in them as opposed to art oriented things that start making money they're two very different things so this is not an art thing this is they find other people's art and they sell it they're pushing it to create these accounts the accounts get giant people pass it around because they're just finding funny things and then they start profiting but all the people that created all the intellectual property gets zero money which is weird I don't remember but I only learned more about this when exit through the gift shop came out isn't that what Andy Warhol sort of did I don't know and I don't care I mean maybe maybe he did but the thing about it is that this is happening right now on the internet it's a totally different animal I mean Andy Warhol wasn't running around taking exact photo duplicates and putting them on his website for sale like these this is when someone's doing on an Instagram page is like you could within seconds take a piece and put it somewhere else it's seconds Brian post something I think it's funny huh I go to copy I go to the fucking repost app I put it in there repost it it's seconds later you could do that all day and if you hire kids I don't know he has people working for them but if these guys do they hire people for fucking 20 bucks an hour or whatever and these people just do it all day long they just find funny shit all day long they look for certain hashtags meme factories or what they're called yeah yeah yeah and there's some people like you know that have made some funny ones all their own you know a lot of people that are just doing that all I know D'Elia has done a bunch of them and then there's also ones that they do where they steal people's act and make a meme out of it and then post that on their page that's where it gets even more slippery because you're talking about like stand-ups acts you're making money off it how much are they making off each post I mean I don't know but these are multi-million dollar business and the punch line so now you have this ten minute joke that everyone knows the punch line cuz they saw it on Facebook that's like exploiter lira coin for sure if you're still doing that material yeah it wasn't on Netflix or a Comedy Central special or something for sure that sucks it's always happened though hasn't it TV shows have been accused of stealing a oh they have stolen it's happened on dude they did it to Kevin James I saw it happen Kevin James was at the he had a development deal for NBC back in the day back we were young pups both of us were like 27 or some shit maybe he's a little older than that maybe he's actually that was like during the Newsradio days so we're probably like in our 30s and he had this development deal nice development deal they're paying him a lot a lot of cash a lot of paper and they were setting up a sitcom around him so they had him do a set out of theater in Hollywood and I was there and he does his set and has all these writers from various sitcoms and the very next season one of his best jokes is on an episode of a television show that's very popular very popular yeah yeah yeah and they fucking stole his bit man I guess that's where I was going that was in the 90s so like we're now 24 20 25 years later the new popular medium is Instagram and social media yeah but different is that well it's different because there's accountability now because now people know that if you wrote a meme and you put it up on your site and then fuck Jerry comes along and steals your shit and doesn't credit you for it it just puts it up there you know what they did unless someone sent it to them and didn't attribute it to you which is possible but it seems much more likely that what they're doing they were doing on purpose for the longest time and they just did they thought that's what you could do on the internet it's a Wild West you could just take memes and you could become famous and look that fat Jewish guy did it I mean that guy became famous whether you agree with his methods or not it worked he's got his crazy hair he shows you you know like he's this crazy-looking guy and he has all these funny memes that somebody else wrote and they're all up on his Instagram page and it worked and people don't like him now there's a lot of people that don't like him people get real shitty with him in person they don't want him doing appearances they know what he did so there's a certain number of people that go hey man you're a thief like this is not cool like what you did is not cool but then there's certain people that don't care and then there's certain people who think well what he did was just what anybody did back then it was the Wild West no one thought about it and once he established that business model and it was effective it was probably very hard for to slow it down or to tribute things to people or to admit that he didn't do it for all that amount of time it just bugs me that companies pay these guys knowing that they do this or like as a fat Jew he's like he's like sign with CAA he's signed with a bunch of comedians that he probably took you know they're taken from the same basket see that's like it is weird right yeah now if he was going on stage and doing their acts he's been doing appearances right he's got a book he's been on TV shows well I don't know what nobodies didn't know he's doing like maybe he's showing with that but he's look he's obviously used it for profit he's figured out a way to profit it's weird he must be weirded out by this fuck Jerry thing too because he might be sick must be sitting there going okay all right it's um you know Comedy Central was advertising on the fuck Jerry page which is like Jesus folks I didn't know yeah yeah it was like Jesus folks can I just say it you guys down faith go over a little history or comedy well I mean mind him and see they don't learn then either you know well that was while it was happening though yeah they did learn eventually they'd let it go eventually but that was also because the ratings had dropped through the floor you know comedy is not fuckin easy to make up you know especially like meme kind of comedy that's done by folks that are working in offices meme kind of comedy some of the funniest fucking comedy on earth and it's done by regular people it's not like a just it's not like most memes are written by high-level satirist at work for The New Yorker no they're fuckin regular folks who think something's funny you know I think what's gonna happen is as technology improves the like being able to scan a photo and go well we could tell the first time this was every pen on the internet was from this little girl she took a photo of it has all the data in the picture and it's now used on this mean that's making this much money and this then it's gonna be kind of broken down like you know any kind of artist yeah yes I mean that's the idea for the blur and the argument for the blockchain getting involved in here because I had tied you cannot guess it can be in the data in the mints like now let me ask you this what if someone uses a picture of your band say you have a band these a picture of your band then they have a funny meme under the picture of your band who owns that then that's like the I think Beyonce tried to get that picture taken off the internet from her from the Super Bowl a couple years ago because it was like a bad picture she didn't like how she looked in it that's hilarious yeah how the fuck does that lady take a bad picture she needs to talk to her yeah go listen it's good it's not your best but you look fucking great like if that shit was on tinder you know you wouldn't be on yeah it's like said today who if someone was paying for that meme should Beyonce get some of the money or yeah that's the question you would have with like a corporation right which should someone be able to grab photos that are out in the public domain make something with it and then profiting that's the wit that's there's a lot of bands I'm sure that's why I said dance cuz they're like really good at protecting copyright and their logo and shit if you had like the kiss band logo you don't think gene Simmons would come at you he's coming at you with some lawyers 100% right that's just what he's gonna do but it's who owns those photos of it's like gene Simmons like spitting fire out and I think if you took the photo and cameras were allowed inside the event you took it that's right but it's not ever what did the case is though most of the photographs are people that are putting up they're just putting them up online and someone takes it's like say if you gene Simmons spit and fire and it has a joke about eat and hookers pussy or something like whatever it is like feeling make something funny there but if that's online and that becomes this giant meme that gets all these likes and that's somehow another someone proper the fuck do you profit from you from Instagram you don't profit from individual posts but those individual posts would boost your signal yeah some posts are profited Instagram yeah you have to say add-on right that's to say sponsored post right yeah what legally it's supposed to but not I probably say 90% of them aren't right a lot of people don't right especially if it's like Instagram monkeys you can get away with it oh yeah Instagram models talking about T besties yeah yeah it's a hope that the Instagram model is a fucking hilarious position it really is it's powerful position yeah it's hilarious though it's it's amazing how many of them there are and they make money you know it's smart it's amazing how butts are such a big thing now yeah and like when I was kid that no one cared about butts it was big but you were like dude lose some weight yeah we talked about this before I read yeah I said it sir mix-a-lot change the game yeah everybody's like what oh you like big butts hey I kind of like for whatever reason it wasn't even an issue like back then girls would have a giant fake boobs and tiny flat butts and they were perfect my grandmother would have millions of Instagram model hits fat bottomed girls was before that slightly but no one really did make the rocking world go around that's a great goddamn song I didn't see Bohemian Rhapsody did you did you see it wasn't that what the fucking I was talking about I heard was amazing did you yeah I did I'm a giant Queen fan though I love them that's my my number one cryogenics song when I'm in the crowd chamber is dragon attack because you gotta move around wondering that too in 40 degrees below zero it's hard to just sit still do a little dancing in there I'd read he did a ream a liqu I think is the actor's name that played him Freddie Mercury did like a job but before it happened Sasha Baron Cohen was sort of in talks for it but he wanted to take the character in a different direction that no one was really comfortable with I don't know see that's a weird thing man you can't cuz it's been said to that to get 'spicy talking but you can't just add stuff my wife yeah it's not an art piece like Bohemian Rhapsody although it is an art piece it's a documentary of a guy's life like in some ways you're documenting it right like it's supposed to be his life you can't make up things that never really happened or I forget what it's like it's the difference between like a biopic in an actual biography or a memory like what is the difference you're making a Hollywood movie right but what is the difference in terms of the story creative I think creative control like you like being created by something like we know this event happened in this event happened the day before and in the middle what would happen where what one is knowing only the Foxcatcher versus a documentary about Mark Schultz like yes parts in there that you specifically know yes are fucked with for normally six sake not just the parts that I know but I didn't even talk to mark about the movie but there was a bunch of parts that I think he was furious about where it made it look like they were doing blow and maybe doing some gay stuff it looked it was a it was a there's a lot of weird scenes that things were implied or it just seemed odd like how do you know this happened unless Mark told you and so and Mark was furious at the end after it was released and then on top of that I like the big one was that they changed his opponent when he fought in the UFC they gave him a Russian guy when he in fact fought Big Daddy Goodrich who's a legend like Big Daddy Goodrich is an MMA legend he was a pioneer he was in the early UFC's the giant yoked black dude with the guy I mean he would fight with the Gion he has one of the most brutal knockouts in the history of the sport where he fought this wrestle Paul Herrera and Paul took him down and they got into a position where Big Daddy Goodrich was lying on him sideways and he elbowed him in the face like 10 times in the course of like three seconds and it's so horrific you watched in his head just bounced off before they stopped the fight it's fucking brutal like one of the most brutal kales you'll ever see in your life so this guy wasn't a just a regular guy like you just substitute him out and make the guy's name Tom instead of Bob no it was Big Daddy Goodrich that's who Mark Schultz fought when he fought in the UFC watch this watch this boom boom boom boom boom boom boom I mean that guy is fucking pow pow and his arms are trapped in his legs a trap Big Daddy's got him in like a like a crucifix position and it's from Paul trying to take him down I mean that was so that guy Big Daddy Goodrich is a he's a famous fighter it's not like they took some nobody and removed him from the movie and changed the name of someone where it was didn't really matter it was a historical amit event in MMA that's the reason you think no one knows some crazy producer i think you should fight a russian guy because this is we're in the cold war again baby i don't know you feel about politics well some producer just wanted to jizz on the soup some writer just wanted to cut his own balls squirt one off into the fucking stew that's probably what happened yeah the screenplay to make it watch better who knows the only other thing that makes sense is maybe they would have had to pay cat daddy Goodrich right and they didn't want to pay him maybe i don't know that makes sense that makes I mean like Mike Tyson yeah you know he had that video game a long time ago to Nintendo and they had to pay him do you use Mike Tyson's punch punch out yeah and then after like a couple years he was like I'm dad like this and then so now dinner was just called punch-out it wasn't even Mike Tyson in the game anymore they they like take it off some new dude yeah just yeah have you done the VR boxing game yet I haven't done the VR boxing game but but it looks cool like the Rocky one is that what it is it's a whole bunch a whole bunch of them dude they're amazing yeah it's great like a regular boxing game you playing on TV is so stupid mm-hmm I mean they're fun but in comparison to a VR game in a VR game you're boxing right you're you see your hands in front of you the guys throwing jabs you're slipping you're like standing in front of them you can catch punches with your hands you can throw shots to the body it's crazy you get tired doing it like you could really get a workout doing it it's amazing and this is it right here this is what you would see mr. Nawrocki when they do something oh yeah mr. T's in it or is it just random guy with mohawk well that's clubber lang but look look how jacked everybody is I imagine if people were really that jack town I mean this is so what is that Drago and he's fighting there's Drago versus Rocky yeah but we can't see rock you want to see what it looks like from your eyes and this is a that's a regular video game or that is the arc and this is just a tease they showed I guess I was looking for the updated you want to see what it looks like when you've got those gloves in front of have you tried VR poll yet no no no I like regular cool VR so great I love it I just need to get it out of my living room it's just too much for my living there's things you couldn't do with VR pool that you need to understand if you're actually playing pool with real pool you need friction this looks great it's crazy a little bit of haptic feedback for this to get yeah maybe the next step look how he's using his hands to block - that's crazy the thing is man when when someone's swinging on you when this fake person in front of you Stran it's nerve-racking you think you're gonna get hit and when you do get hit and you see red or you see white rather look you just ko them it's funny watching the guy it's pretty amazing how VR really gets immersive like when you would like uh was it Resident Evil video game I mean that's scary as fuck you really think zombies are coming after you you yeah you really do you know that game the thing about that game though it doesn't necessarily think does not necessarily reward perfect technique you just you could kind of just do this and do that so you'd have to like if you wanted to use it as a workout you'd have to actually be disciplined and use good technique well you probably do is put gloves on put some velcro gloves on and put the the little fucking hand thing you know I love clothes - they're better than the next year - you could just duct tape it here or - it would be in the glove yeah itself yeah there's actually I think it's called the knuckle controller is the next version of the five controller it fits around your hand like a glove it's not doesn't mmm just goes around your knuckles cock right if you want to grab so we're in the same way right yeah because when you have your hands this way like with thumbs up thumbs up shows the the gloves like this on the screen for some strange reason so when you're throwing punches it doesn't look right they need to change that but other because I think it's like they want you to just do this but that's freaking me out but when you're actually doing it though if it looked like your hands in the same position as your hands it would be a worthwhile way to learn like a guy like Freddie Roach could literally do a game where he showed you all right I want to see the jab and they're like right here right here all right pop and then here comes the hook duck under and then we'll go to the body go to the head and you could do that and do drills with a guy and actually you could pick up real skills in a VR game especially with boxing boxing particularly kickboxing maybe a little less because you're moving your legs you're not just moving your hands like you'd have to have some sort of sensors on your legs so I could know what you're doing to make sure you're not showing bad technique like your knee might be down or you might be doing something funky but if you have boxing those two things are just like gloves all you need to learn is all the other things you need to learn how to punch and how to move around but you can effectively with just holding on to those things you're staying in the same position that you would be if you were really boxing and you can move around the ring too like it's a it's an area like the size of this desk maybe like a little bit more so it's not like you're in one place and you don't have footwork you could actually develop footwork too so they could have like Vasily lomachenko doing like foot will drills footwork drills rather well you would learn on a virtual-reality thing where to step that'd be fucking badass all that stuff that you could learn some shit from those things I like how the the VR is going like there's an amusement park or up buildings now kind of like chuck-e-cheese where it's just VR rides now it was like oh you're parachuting or you're on a roller coaster and stuff I like how they're doing that now a lot like what malls have that now yeah yeah I've done those I've done the little spaceship ones too you roll a dune buggy around on the surface of the Moon have you done the Star Wars one in Vegas yet I guess you actually have like five people in your group that you can see in the game and there's like you know everybody they have at the Glendale Galleria they do do the dopest one they have is that the Disneyland the same fizzy land village but the Disneyland village one is there's a start Star Wars one and then there's also a wreck-it Ralph one the record Ralph one is fucking amazing is the same company oh it is yeah that's it same place so they have the Star Wars once some time so though they'll have like one game set up for like weeks and then they'll have the other game dude we went to Disneyland and that was the dopest thing it did really yes by far the feature fucking amazing dude dude you wear the suit okay so you have this vest on so your feeling when you get hit you feel in your chest you feel heat they have new places where you walk through and it's like lava below you you feel heat the Star Wars one when you're getting shot you feel it in your chest now shit you pick the wall and you've got like stormtrooper arms you see you're holding the gun in front of you it's crazy awesome I didn't know that was in Glendale through they're getting so good there's still you still are super aware that you're in a game right for now but this you know go from pong to fucking what what's the best Red Dead Redemption that's probably the best graphics I mean fucking and searing graphics that's what is that thirty years thirty years they went to that these virtual reality games ten years from now are going to be insane no one's gonna want to be in regular life regular life is gonna suck yeah there's not gonna be a Disneyland or Disney Road anymore it's just gonna be VR it'll still be there you'll be able to get on every ride yeah I haven't watched this myself yet but the NBA makes viewing and VR available now whoa they have a home not every game but it's like once a week they have a particular game you can you can log in and watch they could they change the cameras a little bit I don't think it's perfect yet holy SH very cool though dude how about watching this on the floor yeah you're on the floor and no but the movie around so you can hear in the footage too I think they have a separate announcing team so they're talking about what you're seeing versus like listening to the normal TV oh it's quite not there yet we filmed a couple episodes of kill Tony and VR and we had some of the top of the line cameras for it and it still wasn't there yet it was more hassle than it was worth this seems like something that would be fucking amazing for the UFC though oh yeah I mean this would be amazing you basically have your view yeah except you the cage the cage would be in the way but there's got to be a way that they could film through the cage if they just had a camera in a reinforced position where it was far enough back behind foam that there's no way it could interfere someone crashed into it but yet close enough that I could see through an actual hole you could get the entire octagon if you did it with several several different ones of those they had or they had it at least that like it was ground like this isn't it I guess it was a ground level I think they call it the Phantom cam but maybe it would had a different name it was VR it wasn't VR no the UFC's used it a few times they always try out things they're very experimental they don't always show everything they're trying out though but problem would say be cool to try ID one time ideally you'd want it right in the middle like not above or two below okay and it would have to have can't because it has cameras all around it so you know that was that's hard to do with the cameras I guess I without getting in the way of everything yeah you would have to you'd have to find a good spot for it put it on a breeze buffers head and letting just go to town well they used to do that with pride pride used to have like they would wear glasses with like cameras next to the glasses and you'd get the referee vision yeah it was crazy it's a cool separating fighters and breaking it up and waving the fight off yeah that's kind of cool yeah it's pretty badass yeah it's I guess it's this little team marshall camp is what it's known POV cam that shit's played at me man sometimes yeah there's one like that that's pointed at me oh yeah I guess sure I've seen that there yeah that's they use that sometimes when uh you know when we go crazy when we jump up with fights happening I didn't know it was even I didn't know that's what they did it for until one day I saw it online I go oh that makes sense that's a smart thing to do because sometimes we do get animated there's been several fights where of me annek and and DC or dominant crews we're all standing up like well while they're like at the end of the commanded núñez when Amanda Nunez knocked out Chris Eyeborg we just we were like what up yeah like your whole body's like Jesus what the fuck did I just see sometimes you just can't sit down you just you're your body's just like God it just goes you don't you're not even trying to control it you just let it go when you see somebody do something fucking insane like there's some wild crazy Francis in Ghana knocking out Alistair Overeem type punch yeah yeah it's me and Dominic and John addict and anacs up and I'm leaning back it's a crazy job man it's a crazy job so that was the the moment do you see one and you see the one below it see that they go back to that see that one below it where I'm staring at the camera in the upper right no it that one there that it froze a video taken by John Wayne Parr John Wayne Parr who's a multiple time world Muay Thai champion a friend of mine a great guy who lives in Australia was there at the fights in Australia when Holly Holm knocked out Ronda Rousey and he filmed Holly Holm head kicking Ronda Rousey and then turns to me and I turned to him and I was like what the fuck just happened I was like woah woah but when you see it like in that moment when you see when you see something that is that fucking nuts in that moment you like I can't even believe what I saw like that was me like I looked at him and he looked at me and we're like whoa dude that was crazy there's no sport like that so some sports just you know they just have this this moment where everybody gets a jolt of a drug you know everybody just kisses you mean that didn't happen last night at the Superbowl for you I left before that ended I was at a friend's party I went to a Super Bowl party it was fun the lowest viewed one in the last 10 years are you serious yeah but not by a lot but yeah it's cuz they knew that that handsome man was gonna take his shirt off that's his name Adam Levine it's beautiful man's no nipples or everyone sighs Nicholas now he has nice brown nipples but then you're like Janet Jackson like Yeah right that crazy why is he love shows nipple show both this is bullshit sexist bullshit and his dick route this is my god ya dick root showing that is bullshit he just wanted everybody know he's got beautiful tattoos and a fairly good body yeah he does a lot of squats though right that's what's interesting he's around like the greatest super athletes in the known universe actually looks pretty good right there for today he was it was pretty good there's four today was I mean he's not always around the greatest super athletes right no no yeah yeah yeah he looks pretty good he looks like he's in good shape happy to take your shirt off with his California stomach tattoo but the point being that guys around freaks he's around six foot five 290 pounds super athletes who could jump over his fucking head they literally could run through a hundred of him like they were paper walls just that's what he's around he's around the fucking Super Bowl the greatest physical specimens in the known universe he takes his shirt off like hey bitches I'm here too they had an event set up over the weekend some people could test their 40 speed up against other NFL times whatever they had like it that's hilarious who's saying bolt did it and it's in his shoes like they said Street shoes whatever but he didn't have cleats on he tied the fastest ever NFL 40 yeah he's probably doing a full stomach he probably just ate drank a couple of beers fuck it no I'll show these bitches what's up yeah it's just it was weird like watching it on TV that's dude a shirt off you know like oh this is a different thing now now this is like sexy concert yeah for it was like a football that's what I think he's getting shit for because he didn't need to take a shirt off right you know he had his shirt on and then like after the second songs like you know wet let's get sexy in this Super Bowl you know no but I mean why else should I make a hashtag hashtag sexy in the Superbowl let's get sexy up in this bitch well he's a sexy man can't don't be hatin beautiful man yeah I mean but but that's the whole thing your your audience is a bunch of guys you know sorry with jagged on well it was cold out at first but then he started to warm up a sweat never trust white men with necklaces that's my message more than one he's got the little necklaces and bracelets the for the Falcons to land on wait a bit those are spiritual necklaces if you have wooden beads

were dead sock them as I was cold dead stuck dead stock dead stock oh do you know what dead naming is you know what dead name is is that a shoe bearing no no it's a new thing that's illegal on Twitter this is something I wish I knew I didn't know until after the podcast but dead naming is it's banned so say if you decide tomorrow to become a woman and you're like I'm not no longer Brian I'm Brian inna I kinda like Rihanna that's what you're if you thought source okay so I'd be like okay Briana but you're still a man and then boom that's dead naming you can't call someone something other than their preferred gender so like if they identify as a woman but they're biologically male you're not allowed to say they're biologically male you're not allowed to call them a man because that's dead naming you're not allowed to call them like you couldn't call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce if you called her Bruce you would be dead naming her but that's just like that's not legal or I mean like compander oh it's Witter Roth it is a new please pull that out huh I did not know this I did not know this search did it it's been around for a while don't check in the Twitter that's kind of weird dead names been banned for a while earthworm has been around I just found out about the term maybe a couple weeks ago it heard the term for the first time somebody wrote dead naming I was like what what is that and then I had a look at how Sara dickless all the new role is we have to fucking an article there's an article that I was reading good there comes a service it's directly word-for-word in there okay where does it say that okay dead naming of transgender individuals repeated or non-consensual slurs epithets racist and sexist tropes or other content degrade someone okay well hold on a second like what does degrade someone so if you if you contact me and say hey bro you're fuckin short you're not funny that's degrading yeah like is that not loud that's crazy you have to you have to have that be allowed we prohibit targeting individuals with repeated slurs tropes or other content that it tends to dehumanize degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category see that's where it comes from like white people are not protected this includes targeted misgendering or dead naming I was transit transgender individuals I love how they just went with this a giant corporation and they just went with some new word that's only been around for like a month how long has dead name had been around for the urban dictionary added in there from 2014 really never even heard that they're on the ball tell you that but yeah there's a stay ahead twitter still allows goat season in all the porn you won I was interesting to me yeah well porns consensual yeah I love that uh that's just hilarious I love that that's all it I love the I do love the chaos of it all I love the fact that they're trying to sort everything out I just think it's the whole thing is crazy it's so bizarre that that like they're trying to in that sense with that like that's so vague to dehumanize or degrade well every joke about someone every joke about Trump every single joke about Trump that every single comedian and or commentator and or person makes is in some way degrading when you talk about how fucking stupid he is like Rob Reiner had a joke about him called him a piece of shit or called him a piece of crap yesterday and said he couldn't believe how fucking dummy is Trump talking about Hillary though he's doing it two hundred percent 100 percent hundred percent so that's so vague yeah that's so vague and dead namings not a real word so like how are they using fake words in this shit they're trying to say it is now it is a real real word yeah man I don't know if your name used to be Bruce and you change it to Caitlyn I can't say that that seems bananas yeah that seems bananas so like if you're fuckin with somebody say somebody became a woman and it's still an asshole I you can't call him Mike you know hey Mike look I'm sure you bitter about this whole changing your sex thing you can't bring that up but you're still an annoying guy you just don't have your dick anymore bye like if someone says that they can't say that why can't they say that they shouldn't that's to me stupid Wow well I'm not saying but that's hurtful I guess to transgender people I sure and that's considered hate right speech or hate whatever but only but only when it comes to like gender right like if you could you could tell someone hey you're short and fat and stupid and they don't no one cares true right you could say you you're ugly as fuck your nose is disgusting what happens there is that the same what is it the same thing it might be if you do it repeatedly right if you do once you just throw one out there probably okay probably one time you could shit on someone's looks get one but it's like what like in deciding what you can and shit on someone for like what I'm saying is if someone's an asshole and they're like here's a perfect one that woman who used to be a man she's a transgender woman who was in a store screaming at this kid behind the counter that it's ma'am it's ma'am this is a perfect example of that guy was terrified she's fucking huge and she used to be a guy and clearly still looks like a guy and she's saying it's fucking ma'am like Jeff knock some shit over and she got violent yeah in that situation you telling me that's not cool to say how about you settle the fuck down because you look like a guy you're acting like a violent guy and you used to be a guy pardon me if I think you're still fucking guy that's dead naming but that's a good thing to say in that particular instance so without new ones right without context but it's saying you can't say anything to degrade someone well clearly that would degrade that guy but if that guy was saying fuck that kid he did it on purpose on Twitter you think someone can't respond hey man I'm sure you're really upset that you got your dick removed and you still look like a guy but fuck you like why can't someone say that because that's people communicating how they feel about you being a dick like if you start out being a dick and then they communicate about you being a dick by being a dick as well are we banning this it's their pride just covering their butt so there's pride not you know what like kind of like Jamie said it's dangerous in a lot of ways it's dangerous to control people's thoughts and behavior because who are you to say and when does it end you know it just keeps going and going and going and going it gets it gets very slippery when you have one group that thinks it's right and they're trying to control another group that thinks they're right man that is it's it seems so simple when you just talk about dead naming transgender people or not degrading people based on their looks or their ethnicity or their with this or that but what you're doing is you're trying to dictate how humans communicate with each other and people don't like it when you tell them what to do the problem with telling people what to do is they and want to do the exact opposite this is one of the first things you realize when you have kids like oh they don't want to listen to me like I got to figure out a way to sneak information into them you know or you gotta you got to figure out a way to not be too bossy people don't want someone telling them what to do this is what I missed when I was edited headed into that conversation I missed how other people looked at that guy and what he stands for I don't think it's correct I think it's way more complicated I think it's an insane business to run it no I don't think he really knew why Alex Jones was banned or what anybody else was banned I don't think he really knew I think he's dealing with a giant corporation and he's a young guy anywhere sandals oh wait wait what kind of sandals there's some weird ones connected a nice guy like let's just choose when he runs a couple different companies he's not he's not sitting Twitter that's nothing that Alex Jones brought up today that he sponsors the podcast through the the cash app which he's also he also runs it's 100% true but I would have and I think we talked about it on the podcast we even talked about the cash app being a sponsor and about how it's helped Justin wrens fight for the Forgotten charity so Alex Jones erroneously said that I didn't mention it we did mention it it's worth mentioning and Alex Jones is having to like respond to people that want to know if I've seen what Alex Jones has said about me lately is one of the weird things that I've dealt with because first of all I've always had good dealings with Alex in person person to person but he's obviously in a world of shit right now there's a lot going on with him with the Sandy Hook stuff and he wasn't entirely honest with me about what he had said about Sandy Hook maybe he didn't remember maybe he was trying to phrase it in a way other than the way I interpreted it when I saw the videos but there's a Media Matters video that shows all the time where he said that Sandy Hook was fake this is very complicated to me this is one of the reasons why I struggled with bringing him back on the podcast that's very complicated it's that is even though I'm I've known the guy since 1998 and if I'm around him I'd say that's my friend Alex Jones he's a friend he's awfully he obviously did something fucked up and the parents that had to deal with what he did there's parents that had to deal with people calling them a crisis actor they had to deal with people harassing them at the courthouse and harassing them if they met them in public because they were saying that they were lying about their kids being killed so not only the kids being killed but they have to deal with someone harassing them and saying you're a liar and you're an actor it's insanity and I wouldn't I would think about it differently I've definitely think about differently if I wasn't friends with Alex but I would also think about it differently if he hadn't made shit up about me he said that I was told to stop talking about conspiracies or they threatened my family that's a hundred percent horse shit and he has my phone number he could have called me I called him after I heard about it he told me that someone told him that I talked to the person who told him that I'm like this is fucking bananas like you out of your mind call me this is so stupid you think I'm not talking about whatever fill in the blank whatever ridiculous conspiracy the Rothschilds the fucking Rockefellers whatever it is I'm not talking about that because the government threatened my family that is fucking wrong it's ridiculous and now you put it out there so Alex Jones went on afterwards and he apologized and corrected it then recently because I haven't had him on the podcast he decided to start saying that I work for the CIA and then I'm George soro talking points which I don't even know what these fucking talking points are talking points about him and specific not talking to anybody no one's giving me talking points not George Soros that's not what Eddie Bravo has been saying good he got good information through even say that so stop for a while though but but the point being the point being Alex if you're out there I still like you as a person if I saw you I'd still give you a hug but you're making shit up and this is this is not helping anybody wants to defend you it's not helping me as a person talk about the good qualities in you and you know these things that you're saying are made up you're making up the fact that I'm in the CIA you're making up for the fact that the Hollywood insiders have given me information and tell me what to say that's not true you know it's not true you know me I don't have time to be a CIA insider I can't take on another job in between doing stand-up and podcasts and UFC commentator or running a family I can't do it I wouldn't do it I'm not interested I'd rather stop doing everything then work for any government organization no-one's ever approached me no one's ever approached anybody I've ever heard of I don't even know if that really happens I don't know if that's real thing the thing is they always say is that the CIA would talk to the people in Hollywood and tell them what to say in terms of propaganda maybe I don't know I don't have any personal knowledge of it I'm sure someone has decided that if they're gonna make a movie about like zero dark thirty that they have to get some sort of approval and I'm sure that a lot of movies that are very inspirational that have to do with the military would be great for recruitment so I'm sure there's some involvement I'm sure there's also some Patriots that work in show business that want to put out these movies about the government and about the military in a very positive way that's probably the case in some instances too but not everything's a fucking conspiracy and this is why it's stupid and why it's stupid is some things aren't fucking conspiracy and Alex Jones has talked about some things that were real conspiracies that 9/11 documentary the road to tyranny details the World Trade Organization protests where they sent in these agent provocateurs that which are essentially soldiers they send in soldiers and military people dressed up in all black and cover their face and they smash windows and tip over things and they take a peaceful protest and they turn it violent so then the police can move in and shut down the protest and then not only did they do that but they made a no protest zone in the United States of America a no protest zone what's it the United States of America was it Vancouver was it was Seattle I think I thought Vancouver no I think it's Seattle World Trade Organisation protests out with the boots and the shoes yeah that shit but Alex detailed this in detail and it was real when he makes things up like there was one recently the David Pakman show had on about Alex talking about people eating babies pituitary glands and scattered vans and of downtown Seattle yeah Seattle see the enforcer no protest zone that was in 2009 in 1999 rather was it 99 yeah December 1st 1999 the October 27 2009 was the article yeah Alex did that that was real that was legit and it was very informative because I didn't know that that is how the government operated sometimes did you contact him in the second time and go with the fun Stockton I sent him a text message said this is why I won't talk to you you say crazy stupid shit like this but I don't hate the guy he's you know he'll scream and yell and call me a demon he's not a good place you're not in a good place when you're defending against that and what all these other conspiracies like it's all fun and games until you're talking about people's kids getting murdered and then all of a sudden people are like fuck you and that's basically what happened with him if he was just ranting about government conspiracies or you know who shot this guy or who's stealing money from here some of what he talks about is beneficial but alex is not I don't think he's in a good place I don't think he's in a good place mentally and I don't I don't think he's in a good place in terms of his situation with the law I don't hate you Alex Jones if you listen to this if I saw you I'd still give you a hug I'll still even do your fucking show when I come to Austin I don't care you can we can come and hang out but just stop making shit up it's silly and you know I'm sorry if there's bad stuff between us I'm more sorry of what you said about those kids I'm sorry about everything I'm it's it's unfortunate it's all terrible now something like that what's the road to redemption for someone like that because some this is the thing about people is and I think this is also what's going on with Alex people need a road to redemption like if if someone fuck's up horribly and does something terrible should that be the end of them this idea that we don't need them anymore no matter who it is I mean what what does a person have to do to grow and learn and for for people just accept them again and let them onto all platforms again what what what does a person have to do it's a real good question I think it's per person no like somebody like Alex just seems like he's getting worse and worse like this seems like what he did teach us U is doing it to me anatomy because I haven't had him on I'm sure he asked you or if he was in town I'm sorry if this is snow no do you not listening I said I didn't want to have a bond I was trying to figure out what would have him on but when I watched the Media Matters video it was very clear to me he wasn't being asked him if he had said that it was fake and he said he questioned whether or not it was real but then eventually he acknowledged that it was real which he has done but there was many times where he said it was fake not one many times it's absolutely fake it was 100% fake there's video of it I didn't see the video before we did our 911 podcast I've seen it now and I still thought about having him on I still thought about talking to him about it and talking to him about all this shit and what it's like I think it's he plays a character honestly I don't think so I mean with the reptile guys and people and the things that he says none of it half of it's just like what the fuck are you talking about I think he he definitely goes goes crazy with some things but I don't think he's doing well but he was talking about eating babies pituitary glands but see if you found a David Pakman video David Pakman who's a progressive commentator online he he was going look something's wrong with him like he's playing this video like what he's talking about them breaking into morgue what is happening now Alex jump yeah see if you can find the part on the video where Alex is talking it's early on sounds like schizophrenia it sounds like any episode of live PD or cops you know and people are talking like I saw aliens upstairs in the house you know like the other guy Owen Benjamin look at him so you play this place real quick it's all in plain view of these people they're just put in our face they want a system where we can't do anything to stop them that's like Bill Maher the name of his production company is a kid love which is an animal slogan basically then he makes show just about having sex with kids all the time and then it says it's okay to have sex with you no kids didn't have sex 35 year olds under 12 just incredibly outrageous evil pathetic stuff of these soulless demons but like Bill Maher but Josh was saying he had a theory the only what walnut sauce is and irony you say it's the pituitary gland because they confirm the jimmy savile and would torture all kids to death but if they couldn't get regular ones to kill if everything was a grab a kid run over the cars they could say oh there's a police reporter on our but they would hurry to the morgue they work with different different governmental morgues and eat the pituitary gland as quickly as possible and get high off of it so yes yeah okay okay that's yeah this first of all Bill Maher is not a fucking pedophile this is this is crazy this is like a weird rambling and this is not Alex that I knew from 1998 it's just not it's not the same guy this is a guy's not doing well so my apology as a human being - Alex Jones if you were hurt that I didn't have you back on the show if you were hurt that I occasionally poked fun at you I have - you're hilarious unfortunately but I don't hate you don't wish you wish you badly and back in the day I enjoyed a lot of stuff people lose their way you know so I think that it's a real bad feeling being stuck on the outside - when they all band together and kick you out and everybody kicks you out everybody Twitter or Facebook and everybody and YouTube and Twitter was the last one but uh that was Jack Dorsey didn't even know why Alex Jones got kicked off of Twitter and people like will let him back in then like yeah but somebody knows yeah like somebody like I don't think Jack Dorsey is really the guy who's looking at each individual person that gets banned I just have a feeling that that stuff is compartmentalized right 7 million monthly active users yeah right but how many people are responsible for banning people and real high-profile people I'm sure there's a whole like maybe 12 people they have to have a meeting then they you know maybe they talk to Jack maybe they don't maybe they it's a positional who yeah right and he maybe he doesn't we don't know I'll ask that for sure but maybe he didn't know when people got banned until he like maybe got a company memo maybe he wasn't involved in the of course maybe I don't know maybe he's the one who called him up and said get rid of this motherfucker that's possible too look here's another one right here's one that people had an issue with and one thing you could say okay like when Kathy Griffin held up the the Trump head remember that mm-hmm did she do that on her own Twitter account uh yeah she yeah well I mean she always did a photo of it when she posted it supposed to an Instagram Twitter I think it was on both I'm not percent sure right so that it's is it allowed it's allowed because it's newsworthy because it's a celebrity and the celebrity is threatening a public figure who's also the most powerful person in the world so it's okay that why that is I think she posted it cuz it was an art piece that was kind of controversial oh no no I know that that's when I'm sad why they're saying why is it okay why is she still allowed to be on the platform and Alex Jones gets kicked off that's a it's an interesting question right like what do you need to do to get kicked off cuz that's not the only thing that Kathy has done recently she was one of the people that was calling for the name for that young boy who was with that Native American in front of his face beating the drum she's crazy responsible you know I'm sure she feels bad about it now in retrospect especially if she's watch the video but she got carried away and she thought what we all thought we saw the picture there's smirking cunt of a kid that got in the face this beautiful indigenous man is singing his his rain dance cry whatever the fuck he's doing yeah that's not what it was though we we found out afterwards it was much more complicated what is their song what were they saying it sounded cool they should make a record yeah like this do you like that shit that shit's cool to listen to when you work out if you get like some some legit Native American chance like that put you into a trance right if you don't know what they're saying you just go running a list of that take a little couple topes go for go for a jog in the woods listen to native american chants and your ear pods that was an interesting video that because i mean i was a 180 and after just hearing the second side of the still 12 hours later and people still we're calling for that guy's head yeah and people I saw someone who said what's his name Ron Perlman no who's the guy who was Hellboy yeah Ron Perlman Ron Perlman was like motherfuckers are telling me that I'm not seeing what I'm seeing and she said something about some white prick or will white motherfucker like people try so hard like you you are seeing what you're seeing yeah you're seeing what you're seeing but what you're not seeing is a video it shows how it occurred it's all it is yeah you know so why is that okay right why is that okay why is it okay for some journalists to say horrible things about white people why is it okay why is that okay seems weird what if it encourages violence against a innocent white person just one should you be responsible what if they say why did you do that well I read blah blah blahs tweet and I was like you know what I am gonna go out and punch a white person fuck that I just found some white old lady not beat her ass like if someone decides that you're not responsible for that are you probably not but you gotta kind of feel like you played a part in the way people look at things especially people that are very easily influenced you know it's just also it's gross you read something really racist against white people like that's gross like you think all people are like that a whole group of people that don't have as much melanin they're all shit that's a ridiculous you're a ridiculous person I don't care if you're brown or black or yellow and you're ridiculous that's silly so we have to decide it's got to decide like what the fuck we're doing if we keep letting illogical behavior be normal like breaking us off into fucking groups like that and thinking that you know all men are great or all women or gray or all gays are great and never all straight cisgendered men can go fuck themselves all right that's that silly talk I don't care who you are you're not allowed to do that but we let people do that if they're a part of a marginalized class if someone's a part of a marginalized class then you get to shit on everybody in a weird way you get to like reinforce racism it's really it's so fucking counterproductive to because if you do that then it just makes people just get defensive on the other side they don't want to even think or empathize with how you are social medias really made everything annoying hasn't it I think great too though yeah both do Twitter it's like like we're saying when someone says something dumb like Trump will say something dumb sometimes and I'll just go there for the memes and I'll just read his post and it'll get me going the more I'll get like 15 minutes of haha probably missed this story yesterday if you're hurting that 21 Savage News got deported right because everyone found out yesterday that he's apparently from the UK and so like the story there's two stories that is part of the story but memes of him being from the UK and a British rapper that's supposedly from Atlanta really took over to the fact like Demi Lovato tweeted it and she got shit on and she's deleted her twitter now because of the responses did you know who this guy was before no but I'm 51 years old oh man number one I know shit number one right record and now like in the country really yeah but you're on black Twitter sure sure yeah oh yeah my follow a lot of them I don't know any of these like tech nines and sushi for I got fucked that dication six nine he's fucked maybe what do you mean made what if and he's he's talking to my colonic he's still fucked he's he's he's going to jail for a long time with a tattoo of 6-9 on his face he's going to jail he's gonna have real problems that ain't good there the man do you read the list of charges there's a murder involved yeah murder conspiracy love him supposedly calling a hit on someone oh Jesus Christ oh my god oh he's fucked Matt even if he cooperates if they put a hit on someone cuz he said it Jesus he was you know he won't get like the death penalty but now he owes me like life in prison you know say someone's a flashlight yeah yeah it's a real problem soldier boys in jail too isn't he is for what got arrested I didn't he beat up his girl and his girl beat him up oh no no that was a little bow-wow you son of a bitch you just shamed Soulja Boy for no reason with your shitty pot addled memory he's right I know his little bow-wow no there was something else he's accused of kidnapping a woman Oh kidnapping I'm sorry so you got the stories completed kidnapping is even worse he tied a girl to a chair using an extension cord and kept her for six or seven hours in his garage whoa yeah oh he's going to jail forever from what'd he do that for that someone's daughter wouldn't do that for jealousy I think it said this is apparently according to celebrity news outlet the woman whose name I will not say apparently was backing out of a driveway and her car hit Soulja stelae home when she hit the curb at his house when she hit the curb from that point on his assistant reportedly became upset and started fighting with her from there Soulja allegedly stepped outside and tried to break up the fight the woman says that he began punching and kicking her when she was on the ground and then tied her up for six hours God Soulja Boy well at least Nintendo one wish that cooler heads would prevail but that sounds like that sounds like a fucking disaster yeah Jesus Christ you never hear about the spin doctors causing any problems right guys she hit a curb this whole started she did she hit occur with his car something she's curb one of his wheels wasn't enough information on there yeah yeah she probably curbed one of his wheels probably was a nice car and she did know what the fuck she was doing a good job as you can what a dick tied her up and beat her up that's crazy allegedly allegedly right right right you got to always say that denied by this did you see that video that old man putting the ice on the ground and then pretending you fell oh that's yeah allegedly brilliant allegedly allegedly there's no allegedly led for that it's amazing it's amazing to watch because you didn't know there was a security camera there try to collect yeah there's a lot of people that do that man I've seen videos and people doing that at the mall they like throw a drink down and then slide down on the drink we had a guy do it once at a movie theater I worked at and we had it on video also and we just showed him the video and then he left and never heard anything about it but he was bitching up a storm like he was hurt watch me sky he's guy's hilarious so he's walking he looks around Chuck some ice in the ground a little bit of iced and no big dam just gonna go over here la-dee-da duh okay I love this she'll watch this he looks around make sure no one's looking oh even felt like a bitch my back that cloning is the most ridiculous look at that silly silly silly man the thing about those guys is like anybody that does that kind of shit I think the cops all they have to do is go sure what's your social security number and they they look up all the shit that he's also done yeah like you don't daddy that's just a little bit of a scam that's a guy's been scam and it's like like in Russia and stuff for other countries where everyone's doing the insurance scams and so it to the point where everybody has to have dash cams on their car now yeah just triggered a story I heard over the weekend there was a not it's I think this is a story happening in Houston where the cops broke into a house where they had heard that there was there they think they had a warrant report was that neighbors had called in black tar heroin sales or something like that at this house so they broke in without knocking it was like a no-knock warrant the guy is like 57 in the house here's someone break into his house it's a shotgun shoots one of the cops they kill him his wife is like what the fuck's going on she goes to try to grab the other cops gun that had just fallen she gets shot Oh two people are dead and they didn't find any heroin Oh Jews there's like some weed in there or something like that oh and some people are like they didn't have a history of doing much from what I rep that swai I thought of it because they looked back with these guys do they have an arrest history or anything and I wasn't anything that they had found at least when I read about it do you remember the one where there was a mayor outside of Washington DC and he they were using his house as an address and it was something with the mail delivery guy was running and so the mail delivery guy would come by and the package was addressed to him but he would just keep the package because he knew like that that this was this guy's house it was on his route and that way you know as the package came in the mail would be his to deliver but instead of delivering it he would hold on to it so they break into the mayor's house no you know the holster sold a shoot his fucking dogs shoot his dog and he had like one of my dogs like Marshall she's like a super duper sweet dog either yellow lab which is real similar I think was yellow lab might have been golden retriever either way they fucking shot at least one of his dogs how they not know it was the mayor's house you think that would be like like Google shit or maybe people did maybe they thought fucking the mayor's a drug dealer yeah maybe they really thought that but that kind of shit is dark man we just go shoot a golden retriever come on you're not a pussy and I know you're going in there because you think this is a real drug running operation cuz the cops just got bad information right but you're not a pussy you don't have to shoot a fucking Labrador stop you think that thing's gonna bite you well when it does shoot at then so I'm gonna buy you the fuck out of here that's a weird power trip shit thing you shoot all dogs no if look if a guy's got a wolf and it's off the chain it's running at you yeah shoot it right oh you're breaking into some guy's house and then you shoot his fucking dog what if you're wrong like you are a lot you cool with shooting someone's fucking dog in front of their kids that's what happened to the the mayor of this town the fucking mayor I bet the guy was the mail carrier just thought it was cute to use the mayor's address get all the weed delivered maybe didn't maybe he voted for his opponent thought it was safer to do it that way oh did you get a Tesla you just driving around it I got one tell me how do you like it do your loss truce I had to get one I told you long Moscow would get one guy did my podcast I almost saw it mm-hmm I'm a man of my word it's a fucking spaceship it's the weirdest thing I've ever driven in my life it doesn't even make sense it's not even not even there's not a single car that I've ever driven this even close to as fast nothing like my Porsche is so slow I have a gt3 rs it has 518 horsepower at least 3000 pounds it sounds like a dragon and that Tesla would leave it in the dust I mean leave it in the dust like zero to sixty two seconds quicker it's fucking insane it out of uh no Ludacris no yeah I did I put it in chill mode for a little boy but you could drive chill with ludicrous mode always available you don't switch him back ludicrous mode is just crazy correct like the fastest and it kills your battery well it kills your battery quicker but the thrust that you get is a rollercoaster ride it's insane I mean you can't believe how fast it is it doesn't even it literally doesn't make sense it doesn't seem right it seems like like it's punching its way through a wormhole using alien technology meanwhile I posted it seems like something Bob Lazar snuck out of area 51 I get all these messages from people Bob Lazar has been debunked that's controlled opposition that's a fake story it's fake news bro they got you with the Bob Lazar story do you like all the tech in it I mean that's the same one it's too much almost because it's this giant screen like I had a dim it way the fuck down because I was just looking at like it's so pretty my dream car it's very comfortable how long do / comfortable now do you have a supercharged station at your house yet or do I look thing on the wall at my house that I could plug it into it's on a supercharger it takes like eight hours and hours more and how many miles but I'm gonna get one of those I'm gonna get one of those fast charger in the house yeah it goes allegedly listen I mean allegedly 311 miles you have that fuel but there's a problem I Drive like a moron so it's not going that far did you get is there a fuel option for that model it like are you I think is a fuel add-on that gives you an extra like oh that you that's an option I thought you meant fuel like gasoline yeah there's a less I know what are you talk some models not Tesla okay yes making shit out bro some some I figure which car it is electric cards like yesterday extra for like one gallon of gas so like if you ever lose your battery I have heard of that yeah yeah what was that I thought Tesla had that no no no there was like yes my Priuses are mixed they're hybrids Priuses used gasoline but a very stingy amount of gasoline and they run partially on electric motors so do the Acura NSX the Acura NSX has two electric motors but I think you don't ever charge it I think the electric motors are powered by the gasoline engine and electricity in the car if I remember right that's supposed to be the motherfucker like the Acura NSX is supposed to be the car that people are under look under looking for whatever reason it just doesn't get the love that it deserves and apparently the 2019 model is even more insane I can't wait to the day where like your garage floor is like a wireless charging mat you just pull right up into the mat or they what never would be because it's rubber well there I'm sure you'll find a way because like there's that there's there's like if you if you take your phone and put on a wireless charger there's like a little room that if you don't you don't have to touch it like maybe that's the whole reason why you're safe from getting hit by lightning bro yeah like that the rubber protects you from electricity Park though a little thing comes down to the ground like a little baby yes that thing falls out while you're driving a little bollocks your car over order like if the streets like if somehow like if you're riding on the highway and if you'd want to fuel up that you can like fuel up using the road yeah I paid like a fee or something right well really ideally it would be great if solar panels had gotten so powerful they can charge it just with the Sun especially because Southern California is always fucking sunny except for today but it's a matter of time that the car is the future that's what it is it really is look I'm a giant fan of American muscle cars they're my all-time favorite cars in terms of like to drive to hear the rumble of the engine and that I love them I love them maybe I'm some crazy old dude from the fucking 80s that still loves 1960s muscle cars maybe I don't care I love them but that fucking cars the future that Tesla's the future look when you drive it you realize oh other cars are stupid is theirs that that's that new aroma new crazy rocket they do and shooting Rockets on his backyard is that his house is there anything that you don't like on that were something that kind of bugs you you that you wish was like I don't you know I don't like how there's no door handles you know no no no nothing you just got to figure it out it just takes a little while to figure out what all yeah different buttons do and how to how to get things to happen but it's really well thought out it's it look he's a legit genius you know and what he's doing is unprecedented and you know this is gonna sound like I'm kissing his ass cuz I like him because he did the podcast and I became friends with him no but he's important the guy's got ideas that are of a magnitude that dummies like you and me are never gonna come up with any of those ideas ever if we lived a thousand lives we would never figure out SpaceX it's just not in our wheelhouse we would never make a fucking electric car we never make one of those things never may get that Tesla Roadster that's going to come out that goes zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds and and looks like like a spaceship like a like a race car spaceship from the future we're not doing that to it we need people like that those guys are super important this guy is a he's like a culture changer like a legit culture changer he got him to smoke weed Jesus he wanted to I'm looking for it the new Toyota Supra Supra the new one looks dope so this is the SpaceX rocket yeah so Speight what does it say at the top it says built a stainless steel rocket ship in Texas that looks like liquid silver and might launch in February didn't it whip year what day is this article January 11th companies yeah okay it fell over yeah I know that they've been doing stuff more with it but how cool it looks it looks like but I mean it Janelle it fell on the ground yeah yeah it got blown over the wind it looks like a drawing for a rocket from the 1907 if you did on purpose but it looks just like a wrong it it looks like a fucking movie like Buck Rogers that's a book Rogers rocket right it looks dope though dude that driving that car really feels like like the future and did you get the best model or is what that one of course you did but uh yeah I got the model SP 100 DS what it's called I paid off my car I might just sell him mmm get one of those so people have a place to park it that has a little charge boy yeah I mean I have an hour outlet how they could probably invert it yeah yeah there's a couple super chargers in Burbank yeah there's one across the street but it's always taken I don't know what though you know what's weird man passing by gas stations and going I'm never gonna use you with this yeah I'm never pulling in there unless I want a soda look at that thing that's like a tall 0-60 in 1.9 seconds and I'm telling you man that's not an unrealistic number 620 miles yes wait when's this come out a couple years oh it's gonna be a while I'm gonna get 100% I'll buy your old wing this is such a dope car man it doesn't he makes it why does it not have a side mirror it's got no side mirrors as cameras fuck surrounding of it probably does shut your mouth I tell you goddamn side merry sons of pies I love my camera cameras on my car I don't even use my side mirrors it's so much better having that look at that thing how much is that 620 mile I don't know probably stupid expensive look how pretty it is it's too pretty to be cheap look how fucking sick that thing looks look at it God I mean it look it's like the ultimate sports car like that looks like a that easily could be a new 911 like from that angle particularly and then the roof comes off I couldn't say gamer seats look at those gamer seats right there well not only that but well that's what racing seats anyway but that's why they were racing seats first and then became gamers but the steering wheels wonky the steering wheels like like a f1 like a Formula One car see it oh it's like square yeah yeah it's like you grab it by the handles maybe they want to make sure that you don't do this kind of shit like you this is so fast you probably need to hold onto it in a different way dude I'm telling you that the car that I that I got I've never experienced anything like that before you don't think it's real you don't think a car can do that doesn't make any sense well I should went at $45,000 oh damn drop that chatter oh my gosh that's 5 plus the $5,000 Oh 250 yeah yeah it's probably gonna sell out in 5 seconds to pay it every every dickhead in Hollywood will have one look at me I'm environmentally conscious but still sexy look at my beans they're gonna open shirt I went into a vault the other day as an uber now is amazed by that yeah they're pretty sweet I think that's a hybrid right yes they know yeah I mean I had like 5 different cameras and it's pretty sweet did he ask him how long the range is yeah it wasn't as good as I think it was like 2:30 I think he said that's not bad though if you're driving around Hollywood you could probably get a whole night yeah and you know if you're a Burin howdy just announced theirs yesterday with a Super Bowl commercial oh it looks nasty I've seen it looks for honesty yeah it looks nasty like Jackie Jackson nasty or bad nasty miss Jackson it's like I'm thinking of the r8 look at stupid crap that actually looks like a regular Audi's what it looks like but uh howdy Google outtie electric sports car there's one that doesn't look bad that looks like a standard SUV that looks pretty good it's the mile on that thing what's the mileage the range the range is everything and these fucking exactly cuz if it's anything below like 300 miles comparing it it's offering the amount of time he charges and what it takes to harder to get certain things oh the Model S trying to final model excellent does 144 miles and does 160 miles that ain't good and it's on that trip on that's kind of charger something dude there's your estimate that ain't good after 30 minutes that's only after 30 minutes oh how much you get in 30 minutes well that's not that's pretty good okay so you can get 160 miles where the charge in 30 minutes that's not bad fast yeah that's a long time though if you got to go somewhere if you're in a rush you can't just pull it and get gas but you don't want the kind of power that would it take I mean you imagine how many dipshit that's it that's that's the Audi look at that thing Brian okay I like that like that better now that's that's the e-tron one so it's basically an Audi r8 a next generation Audi r8 go to that yeah and the one yeah that's what it looks like that's a nasty-looking car it's a dope electric eat Ron that says night that says mm six inches with when they announced it back it like the car shows and whatnot it's probably what they're calling see Google see if it actually is a real thing or is it still just a concept because they always like there's a lot of those cars they'll disappoint the shit out of you 279 me up miles oh so it's a real thing when is it available I wonder when that's coming out and I said 2020 right there hmm 20 22 yeah so that's probably the same time the Roasters coming out but look how they get your dick hard years in advance yes you could have ordered it in 2050 so rude though man so rude to get your dick hard so far in advance yeah you know like if you like yeah I'm gonna be fucking super environmental but I'm gonna just show everybody what's up I'll be stunting just do you see the new Volkswagen dune buggy that looks pretty fun no what is that it's a it's just announced I'm not sure if when it's for sale or if it's for sale but it looks pretty fun it's it looks like a classic dune buggy but they Volkswagen date and it has no roof but it looks like a little fun car I don't know third see a picture of that and I yeah all right it's a new one yeah so it's looks kind of cool right whoa you could drive that on the road yeah so it's a road car but is it still a dune buggy 20 25 again teasin you sons-of-bitches that looks fun well they were supposed to announce the new Bronco everybody thought it was gonna happen at the Detroit Auto Show yeah but it came and had it came and went with no Bronco that makes no sense though because it's actually on their website like they were gonna announce it soon for sale I thought I don't think they said that they were gonna we don't have it down you know sometimes when they were working on these experimental vehicles they they'll develop something but then they don't like certain aspects of it or then maybe they're aware of a competitor's work that might come out with more horsepower so they have to like for instance like the the gt500 from Ford it was on its way out they were they were gonna put it out the new one but they were saying that it has over 700 horsepower that's a they never say that they always give you the exact specific number they always say 750 horsepower is coming in 2020 their website okay but they didn't it didn't show it I'm not gonna make a special day for it dad that I might be interested okay it's gonna be nasty looking see what it looks like yeah it looks cool as fuck their mentions of it right it's the Ford website doesn't have pictures of it because they haven't released it yet but was they just saying what was I just saying I said we're talking about what before the Bronco the Volkswagen Beetle Bug no you were saying I don't remember Jam you fucked me about how that's King pushed back because you know somebody who might like this car is faster yeah that's right the Shelby the gt500 they said it's only set it's over 700 horsepower the reason why they said that it's because Dodge came out with the demon and then they came out with some other version of the Hellcat that's also like 800 horsepower so if you come out with only 700 horsepower it's hard because as ridiculous as that sounds some people gotta think yeah but it's not the zero or one that's got 750 or it's not that this sort of that so they they haven't said exactly what the horsepower rating is because they're still trying to juice it up that might be the case of the Bronco - they might be trying to fix things and juice things up but look how good that looks red with the black stripes and good luck see that car is a reckless person's car that's the difference between that and like a Tesla what's exciting about that car the way it looks that is a ridiculous person's car that's how you drive around every day you a fucking madman you're probably a little tipsy sometimes you drive you know you might smoke cigarettes you definitely smoke cigars you know you probably order shots right that's a ridiculous person it's a fun ass fucking car but yeah keto on weekends look at the transmission not only is it an automatic it's a wheel it's a wheel they spin to drive like fuck you first of all give me a goddamn stick shift like an American I want a stick shift with the fucking American flag as the boot of the stick shift it's one of the last places on the planet we could still get a goddamn stick shift sports car what is for do they're released at gt500 with an automatic how dare you don't talk to me about paddles well you can shift it manually with the paddles that's not a manual transmission sir that's shifting and with the paddles what's my left foot doing should I pretend how about give me a fake clutch fake clutch where I could pretend they look dope though okay good that silver look sexy silver with the black stripes goddamn it the red one with the black stripes too so these come out later this year at the end of the year kind of yeah I think so are they I guess they haven't announced it yet so I don't think they've announced a specific data comes out but it looks like it's got wider bodywork too doesn't it like the fenders are wider in the rear in the front but you if you want if you don't want to wait you can get something even more powerful that is available right now with a manual transmission you get the Shelby Super Snake Google that you want to see America at its rock-hard finest mm 19 or 18 Shelby Super Snake 800 motherfucking horsepower wide-body Mustang with a manual transmission and they say don't even fuck with the automatic because the automatic transmission is the transmission from a regular automatic Mustang and it just doesn't know what the fuck to do okay I mean it's just it's it's confused by this thing the car is 800 horsepower turn that volume up whoo yeah that's not to me that's sexy but not worth 117 pounds communist mouse that is a monster of a car good lord that's a beautiful thing and your Tesla can you download sound effects that sounds like that no nor just farts you don't want that you want to just just be cool just chill Tesla's like you're you're a man of leisure you're a man of leisure and driving around comfortable and quiet as it flies around it's like it's going through a wormhole everywhere you drive it very strange car register you tried the self-driving it um nerve-racking isn't it happen Pereira took me on it once and it's pretty scary yeah Brian Cowen does that things beating off a lot which driver put porn on that big screen I hear you can no I think that's great you imagine just driving people around autopilot is beating off the porn in that giant ass screen does it have a web browser in it and seems like I haven't even looked man I'm sure it does something yeah you could probably get online if it's parked or something ridiculous like that it's a crazy car but it's it's it seems like such a leap from anything that I've ever driven before like I've never I've never experienced anything remotely close to it so let's go fucking play some quake Hey so I said everything I wanted to say about the the Jack Dorsey thing I've said everything I want to say to Alex Jones so my olive branch extended to you mr. Jones I wish you well in this life and everybody else will do better we're gonna definitely have Jack back on and we're gonna have Jack back on and review some of these cases with some of the people that are in charge with it of it rather and we're going to compile a list we're going to try to get someone to compile a list of what they think would be contradictory cases or hypocritical cases or interesting cases or just fuel for conversation and we'll figure it out and and yeah the cash apps one of the sponsors of the podcast I'm 99.9% sure we said that I'm not positive we did because we talked about Justin Ren's fight for the Forgotten charity about what that code word Rogan is doing for pygmies in the Congo when they do that I swear to you even though you don't have to believe me that did not affect how I talked to that guy I don't have a problem getting sponsors I got plenty of sponsors it's a good sponsor I like them they do good things they donate five dollars to UFC fighter Rey Borg sons medical bills for every time someone uses the code Joe Rogan so I like them if I had them as a sponsor and I couldn't talk freely with him I would be happy if they dropped me I would be way happier for them to drop me then I would for me to say something different or not say something because their sponsor the begin that sounds very self-serving like you would say that right but it's true that's all I can tell you all right so that's it for today bye see you bite everybody I [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
