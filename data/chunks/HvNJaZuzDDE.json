phone calls nothing to hide yeehaw and we're live ladies and gentlemen so I guess message just like that just like that bitch is I get a message from friend mine who says that while he was listening to the show we were talking about something and then the ads for that thing started showing up yeah oh god it's it's falling from plastisol he says you guys were talking about slouching with Theo von today and this popped up on his feet just now I never googled it before and it's some fucking alarm that goes off like when you slouch forward have you seen those things you glue them on I've been getting an ad for that too oh you have yeah so maybe my TV is random coincidence could be that or they could be targeting Joe Rogan listeners yeah which is what they do yeah way it works so they found out that we were listening oh that could just be going I mean maybe that but like there's a large audience here so they could just be going after like right but do you think like what Adam green she said the other day that happening yeah talking about he was talking about Toyota trucks yeah and then all of a sudden his Google ads started showing up Toyota Tacomas and he it names like dude he goes they're listening the robots are listening someone's listening but they're also looking for like key terms and stuff like that but they're listening to your phone as you're having a conversation you think yes I have a few instances I took screenshots because I was it was happen it happened three three consecutive weeks I touched something I'd literally like held the object in my hand and within 12 hours I was getting an ad for it maybe your magic bro it's very strange one of them I have so many problems you're like they're so weird is like how the fuck am I getting an ad for this thing now I've never even seen this I've never talked about it to anybody I didn't tell anybody I was holding it yeah you got out for it always be careful of like this idea the you know because sometimes things are just a coincidence and this idea that there's some grand conspiracy when it could be easily explained by a coincidence but the thing that Adam said he said i-gos main and I never fucking Google Toyota trucks is that a good let's try to get out really not bad not that good little British hey might but he was saying that a they start popping up right after the podcast immediately so that's the case they had to be listening to his podcast or their listen one of them's list gives you thought you have a large audience someone from theirs listen to it live right and then they're just like dude they launch those ads yeah but how does it get on his Google feed yeah you think they'd spoiled more fucking arriving stuff if they're listening nah you don't make money spoiling crime bro make money sound trucks I don't know I mean I feel like for sure when I google something starts popping up we know that but that seems normal dude if you go on my phone right now because I've been looking at dodge vipers anything I click on dodge vipers pop-up yuvan ads on Instagram really yeah they just want it some they're just trying to get you we're like when I look at houses you know certain house markets pop-ups wait they know they know someone the fuckers looking to spend some money yeah speaking of spend some money Ford why do you hate America they've released a new gt500 only an automatic oh my god what a shame what a shame he's it only automatically automatically posted on my story cuz some dude was like shop when you get one of these all the kind of thing is dope I posted with like a thinking face now that's automatic ain't happening Pingo will you have a PDK gt3 RS it's def friend well it's also that's the only way they make it well you see the way they make the gt3 RS ors yeah i mean you get a gt3 or are i you know i get it people don't want a shift they get stuck in traffic I get it but there's a lot of other cars and get the gt500 the whole it used to only be stick like the gt350 well you know why they're doing it because they want to compete with everyone up because on the track yeah the P decays beat the best racers in the world you know like my brother's telling about this article he was reading where I think it was the the new gt3 RS and maybe is the new gt3 because there's one in PDK there's one in stick they had one of the best race car drivers in the world driving the state shift then they had some average dumbass driving the PDK and they're going around the track and the PDK smoke this dude the guy with the stick shift smoke them yeah but what are you trying to do if you're just trying to buy a car for the track I get it but how many people are buying a car for the track you're looking at him bro I race on the track now I don't have no idea I don't give a shit I just like the feeling and it's kind of lame because I have that slingshot the polar slingshot and that stick shift and that's like a tricky stick shift well that's that little tiny cage dang wheels dangerous as shit but because the stick shift I like not being able to pay attention to my phone I like to having to worry about all the cars around me like I like that feeling yeah I like the feeling of the road and the stick shift and yeah I dig that I want that in a car now yeah I that that's how my Corvette is my court that little 65 Corvette that thing's so small pump some life into you though Oh God do you drive it to the store all the time Yeah right yet wakes you up well it's so loud good side pipes it's a stick shift big ol Hurst fucking cue ball on the top yeah that's what you want that's what they used to have with the GT 500 I had a GT 500 way back in 2012 it was glorious big ol rumbly fucking I had a convertible - hell yeah damn it was great put the top down loud as fuck but awesome I think we get too comfy with the with the you know if you have you you drive your freaking m5 so cushy and everything yeah there it is that thing looks dope as shit look at the front view the seat go with silver gt500 pulled out there's a shitload of carbon fibre in it now yeah yeah yeah there's a bunch of shit like the splitter and a bunch of the Aero stuff they leave that with that one right there look at that oh that looks so dirty that looks so good I love it it's a goddamn automatic like why'd they do that like just to compete man so when you look at Motor Trend it says an option I agree I bet to have it as an option yeah have it as an option and they give you a skirt when you climb into it it said the transmission was made specifically for this car that's just to get performance out of that that's all they want is the performance so they can say hey this competes with you know I would still drive that even though it's an automatic driving as a daily driver yeah I agree 750 horsepower daily 757 it says so it is that thing's probably pretty light yeah with all the carbon-fiber things up no rocket I don't think it's a bit at all check that way Jimmy I bet it's three thousand nine hundred pounds easy do you think it's almost four thousand no way yeah have all the cushy shit in it you know mid three second zero to sixty yeah I bet it's thirty nine hundred pounds Google g-53 v GT 350 our they'll have the kerb weight on if there's a bunch of carbon fiber so they can be bad and yeah that carbon fiber that's pretty cushy for looks no yeah it's so strong dude yeah light but it's mostly for looks like it's not making it that much light at 3,700 pounds and that's the most track-ready one so this is gonna be heavier than the GT 350 because it has a supercharger on it the supercharger and all that other jazz is probably about a hundred pounds so yeah thanks Roger to 800 pounds 3700 yeah for that one but that's the 350 to 3 the gt500 has a big-ass whipple supercharger on it to make it even heavier sounds so good though you're here supercharger whine fuck yeah that's American power though you know they're not light they're heavy you know big ass engines well that's the thing it's like that's what you want kind of in there they're trying to make a muscle car a precision scalpel instrument like a 911 gt3 it's not that it's a different things not where we're looking for like that white car that I have that gt3 RS the shark works car that car is a scalpel it's precision it's effortless the way it handles and maneuvers and it's just a different experience but a muscle car is supposed to thrill you it's supposed to be exciting yeah you don't want it yeah it's not gonna beat any fucking tract I know you care you're not trying to I mean you know woody Nicholas Cage and gone in 60 seconds my brother always says that any car I'm like my thing would beat the shit he's like not on the track don't look like on the track it's so irresponsible to even be able to sell these cars like when they're selling these Corvettes these new Corvette zr1 that's 757 horsepower and they they have a sub three second zero to sixty it's like 2.6 seconds there needs to be like an IQ test for that thing then a driving test like what do you believe in flat earth you know say like about a pizza gate that new Tesla Roadster is gonna be 0 to 60 in under two seconds that's trouble because every moron that doesn't know cars skin tests look you had like the new Prius cool thing to do and so they get those things and they're fuckin lightning rods lightning like I can't I just I know I'm super old who I can't fucked with them I don't like them I getting talent it bums me out it's just not for me man I just I don't I like the sound of an engine I like I don't know I don't like yeah you feel like you're driving an iPod I don't care how fucking fast it goes it's just it does nothing for me Kalen goes back and forth from complaining about it to tell you how you should get one I know it's very strange depends what - it depends which day this it's like he's trying to talk you into it it's like he's so he doesn't feel alone now cuz

ego won't let I mean he's a big car really oh he won't get a small car now why does he need a big car you know K its Callen man what is a big car well yeah he wants to be manly you know he's not gonna get just a manly for it to him it's bra he wants to be manly why would he get a cart doesn't make any noise because he's like think about that he doesn't care about like do if you ask him what dual exhaust is he'd look after no idea he doesn't know what to exhaust no it's it's fuck he's not into that time you know what happened he took a chance the way back in the day I want to say like 2,000 fucking two or three he had a Ford Bronco like 1969 other hell yeah it was badass but really yeah yeah but it's stunk it was one of them old school ones it wasn't like an icon one it was an old school one with a carburetor and shit so he smelled gas fumes everywhere he loved it didn't have any doors and it didn't have a top Kalin had this yep it was dope yeah did you give it to him yeah no yes he did mm yeah he decided he was a wild man and he's gonna drive around it um it was a stick shift stick shift a pretty sure stick shift ford bronco early Bronco and put his pit bull in the back yeah tank top wild man living on Venice Beach single single garage taking down everybody in sight just out there on the on the freak prowl just droppin loads all over them and couldn't couldn't keep it up this is a outies new thing that they just announced it's called the PB 18 Jesus Christ that's an electric car gonna rival the Roadster same speed is what they're sort of claiming it will go 0 to 60 in just under two seconds Jesus cards you getting too fast oh look how good it looks though it charges in 15 minutes gee what yeah what yeah how the fuck is that possible yeah cuz the German said oh Tesla you're making cars very cool let us try this coming out there's only gonna be about 50 of them mate bitches again even that I'd like it looks dope but because I'd rather have you know da rate with a gas as a beastly looking spaceship of a V looks pretty much like it's got a smaller sorry so it's got a seat in the centre it's gonna make going on there yes yeah you get one seat I like that yeah if you got a girlfriend you tow to sit in the backseat and rub my neck not kick rocks bitch see get an uber meet you there I still have a back seat shhh we take off you can't peel rubber in those things you just go like this that thing she fucking filthy though as it dirty it's on all right yeah I bet they're gonna come out of the gas pack alright looks just the same apparently people are taking the Acura NSX and they're replacing they're doing something to the boost to replacing the ECU so they're changing the the program that they used to you know and using the exact market exhaust and just jacking a horse source what you do with those yeah that fucking new NSX is a beast of a car man they're cool dos I didn't realize how small they were though I've one pulled up to me the other night was like revving this engine like dude we're not doing this I don't know I'm 35 years old whatever and he was a grown man - this is off sunset from the store meadow brag about it - yeah I blew him off the line at the red light I don't think we're gonna do man I don't get this but I didn't realize how small they were now yeah they're pretty little yeah the old ones are real little that's what it looks like now that's a deep that's a deep red I like that what's a guard's red that's a Porsche good-looking car god damn it it's cool that's very McLaren ish yeah a little bit well it's there they're making them spaceship II you know do that there's a I was in Edmonton this past weekend freezing at the giant mall but in the middle of the mall there's a McLaren and you know that malls filled with kids because there's wave pools and dolphins there's all sorts of shit there it's the biggest mall in North America and this poor McLaren is hurting my feelings because there's there's kids everywhere they don't give a fuck about the McLin they're yanking on the fucking side mares there's also I'm kid kick in the back I'm like the hood what are you guys doing I just parked in the middle yeah just says like you know like a showcase car don't even matter all the no ropes nothing kids wiping their shitty sticky fingers in it picking their nose Yeah right boogers are taking Legos just fucking add their names in the side and shit oh I know I say come on Michelangelo pride on why would they let put that test is there so they really sell on a lot of MacLaren's in Edmonton I don't know is that oil money starts burning hole in your pocket a lot of those guys up there in Alberta they get those jobs which are tough fucking jobs though we'll all my great hard work hard work but big money my friend John rivet in his wife Jen there their son was doing it for a while kind of a bad business to be and though right soils kind of on the way out not up there I think I think it's down though I know I know it's down because the economy there one of the drivers was telling me is the cow is just not what it's you know it's a fraction of the price than what it was a year ago to two years ago oh really so we're taking hits from it I can imagine if that was like your business and your business could just fluctuate that hard like all this hump and down yeah it's just useless well kiss event she it's gonna be useless pain I not our lifetime well not with assholes like us it don't want to drive electric cars I know I think about thought I think about it with my son like God help this little prick isn't just driving Tesla's everywhere you want to educate them on the Topaz rights but that's fucking of them plan it but also is it it is you think yeah for sure yeah it's only should be in electric it's having an effect yeah but the question is how much of an effect how what is having the most effect there's a lot of different things that are having an effect and what's our footprint in that effect you know I'm saying yeah it's there's a lot I mean human beings there's a lot of us and we're definitely burning a lot of shit and putting a lot of carbon into the atmosphere and there's uh there's definitely an impact well it's not an impact it's crazy the question is how much of an impact and can it be turned around and how much how much of a bad thing is it actually cuz somewhere in the it's in the middle of there's you got your ultimate doom and gloom people they're saying all they're saying that all of the city is gonna be under water the fucking East Coast gonna be under water the West Coast company under water everyone's fucked and then you got the other people that say no we're just gonna be able to move it in northern Canada Jesus Christ people who think you just we're just gonna have up their beautiful spots in Antarctica yeah I don't know right somewhere in the middle huh it's somewhere in the middle somewhere in the middle I'm the middle guy the real optimist think that we're going to be able to take some of the carbon out of the atmosphere and the way they're going to be able to do it they actually invented this giant machine that looks like a building it's like a building size machine that's like a huge air filter that just sucks carbon out of the air I think they did it sense I think it's a Chinese thing I think they they're installing them somewhere in China because you know like when the athletes were in Beijing for the Olympics they said the oh my god her quality is like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day dude you don't realize how important the air quality is till when those fires I was doing shows in Sacramento I didn't think of it I Pete and fans are DME are you gonna do are you gonna cancel please don't cancel like I the fuck when I cancel at night I don't cancel shows I'll see you soon man then I fly in and I was like oh shit you couldn't see a foot in front of your face you send me a smoke you sent me a picture from your hotel room and I was like is there a fire in your room dude I've never seen anything like it and I did not feel good I was sick the whole time they're my shows I was lightheaded everyone had masks on like Asians at airports everybody except for me and my brother and guess what we couldn't get any mass because they're all sold out did they help you no masks I think so they filter some of it but I didn't realize how big of a deal it was time went up there I'm like holy shit man this is this is serious those fires were so big I mean the fires down here were big but nothing compared to the Northern California fires because the area of Northern California that got lit up was like woods like huge huge wooded areas the whole town was just it's not there anymore yeah it's a paradise yeah done game over there's no door left not going nothing's nothing the whole town burned down pretty sure go to that pull up paradise California calm data is that a place that might look down now you see they fired the freakin some of the firefighters and like relief people because they were taking pictures like not even mock and I don't think they should have been fired because it was like you all burnt down the house and then there's like I don't know let go a wooden horse and they're like firefighters like on the wooden horse like oh you're mark mock and the people lost their homes and they ought and they lost their jobs that's crazy come on guys are fighting for their life out there that's them to do with it not only that the the the horse is there it's like what do you give a shit why the house is burnt to the ground I know you really think it's that in that poor taste for these poor guys who risked their lives to save people's houses to have a good time why was that real this is crazy you should have made it out of those trees trees are still standing some trees are pretty gangster what's going on like at a certain point in time we're gonna have to make fireproof houses but you know does that exist yes make a man a cinderblock oh yeah I do what Kayne didn't just have your own freakin fire department just surround your house just in case that's a good move in my neighborhood there's a house that burnt to the ground I put pictures of it up on my Instagram there's a car in the driveway but the whoa this picture is terrifying oh dude you're talking Armageddon style this fixture is terrifying is this what we're looking at as rows of houses that are gone that looks like it goes for an entire neighborhood the entire neighborhood lights up a mile and just there's nothing left everything's burnt to ground but it's amazing those trees are still standing look at those trees there I mean there's torch but yeah they're there but it's weird lack is fuck isn't it weird wouldn't you expect the trees would be burnt to a crisp yeah they're so thick the other thing is uh where's my photo coming from Edmund I flew down so from north to south and when you go over Malibu and like in Woodland Hills and where you live you wouldn't belk it when you see all that it's insane from a bird's-eye view yeah just see all the black yeah flying into it well I flew over Malibu with BRR in a helicopter so we got real low it's crazy crazy look at this McDonald's burnt to the ground that's crazy you know that motherfucker burned when cheese Wow so you know that bridge burnt like this on a bridge after steel what's nuts wooden that was a what was it a wooden wedge wouldn't look at this like the whole everything's gone so is that the case that the whole town is evaporated ice is gone yeah pretty sure paradise is Wow fuck those people do now do you don't rebuild right you like well Jesus and then us also a lot of it and this just from my own experience down here looking at homes in areas where there's chances of fire that were caused by fires banks won't give you the loan or you have to put a higher almost all cash payment down Bri and also the house insurance on a fire area they're not gonna do it these days but what are they gonna do with a place like Malibu cos malleable got hit harder than anything they lost 600 plus houses fine if that's true I know they said they lost like 1500 structures but someone told me that 600 of those were houses and if you're talking about Malibu like when Burr and I were flying around the coastline over by Zoo Point Dume you know those do to abuse there well James Beecher I don't know it's the cliffs I don't know time out though who's the fire worse fire to hit Malibu with home losses topping one point six billion billion I feel like here when a structures destroyed I feel like we don't hear so much because I think people assume everyone Malibu has money yes they are higher tax bracket so like I'll figure it out it's still super fucked up man well I have friends that don't have a lot of money but they build houses and one of them one of the houses they were living in and the other house they were building and they all that both houses got torched 400 single-family houses with an estimated market value of 1.6 billion so 670 structures 400 of them were houses that's horrible man whoo it's weird to fly over man when you fly over it because in the with a helicopter you you know BER was pretty close we were we were you know right above it and circling you know just outside bread over the ocean and as you're doing it flying over the ocean you're looking at these compounds they're probably 50 million dollar houses I mean these fucking massive massive compounds burnt to the ground just gone no goddamn thing they could do about it how good of a pilot is BRR terrible we almost died three times Jesus Christ no he's great is he yeah he's crazy he's really good for a while when I saw that pics on myself I trust that guy a hundred percent if he told me that he was gonna take me up in a helicopter he knows how to do it yeah it was a good time man we had fun we had a lot of laughs is it fun so much fun you're you're up in a helicopters when the greatest comedians had ever lived yeah we're having a good fucking time we're just howling me and him he's hilarious and we talking through headphones cuz it's like jewel so you got a little little fucking the commando shit oh yeah that's a microphone in the corner I don't helicopter scare me man there's a good time yeah I saw that scared the fuck out of me it's weird how close you can get to downtown LA like you're not there's no real restrictions you just fly right next to the building so I'm like this is okay because it's a helicopter yeah yeah that was us right there yeah we just flying around I mean we were just flying right next to these buildings and we were the height of the buildings and all those new buildings see those flat spots and all those buildings those are all helicopter pads landing pads huh yeah and some of them are real narrow and bill was like I wouldn't want to land on that fucking thing on a windy day and I'm like oh my god I'd even think about it was just you and bird there's no that it was a third guy lies a third guy yeah the third guy was a you know an instructor he's a guy that okay bill that teaches bill but bill gotcha but bill can fly solo he has a license to fly solo he flies a lot right yeah he flies god I just not into that I think it'd be awesome to get up there and do it it's just not pros and cons man promise you fly around a little bit get real high con too high yeah but it seemed pretty controlled it really does but there's no like there's no room for error you know I'm saying like unless you're Harrison Ford then he crashed in Santa Monica to be crashed a plane straight up plane yeah yeah Pelican Santa Monica crashed yeah where'd he crashed I forget looked at up Jamie he flew out of Santa Monica Airport and it was like a fucking went down because he's so high all the time I hear is he really oh dude he smokes like fucking Cheech and Chong bro really mostly for years and Ford blazes it up I think when you get that famous you probably just want to be high the time cuz life is a dream anyway you just like I just think there's nothing else to do and he's just like I don't know man han Solo doesn't keep you busy thirty years ago we just did a one couple years ago a cameo in it not like the main guy that's why people were pissed right he got murked did he I'm not Star Wars guy came up forever ago yeah spoiler there is for everything that's a spoiler now dude people are seeing Game of Thrones now for the first time yeah there's dragons assholes it's like with that Dannemora escape I've seen that in Showtime no it's a buzz you know those two guys Harrison Ford saved several lives by landing plane on golf course they don't what the fuck does that mean scroll down well that kind of fucking Santa Monica aim there you go fucking Han Solo Indiana Jones but you know what just walked away went fuck this noise looking where he crashed how the plane went down I'm sure there was a moment where he said I'm not gonna risk lives whatever happens happens it's gonna be just me seventy two year old actor suffered moderate injuries after crashing the vehicle the vintage two seater flying a fuck an old plane a vintage plane that he was piloting on the green a golf course Thursday afternoon he had lacerations to his face and possible fractures television news footage taken showed him on a stretcher being taken into an ambulance dude he risked life and limb by putting it down on the golf course instead of trying to go further try to get back to the airport notice how Harrison Ford he's not quoted anything he didn't give a fuck how about we're on the Fox lot Brian and I were when we worked for Fox and this Tesla pulls in and it's all tinted windows and it rolled down the window it's Harrison Ford and I go uh Brian oh shit that's fucking any other Jones like joking around and Brian I didn't know how big you mean Harrison Ford famous Brian it's super and never seem like this gets super nervous and here's some excessive writers like this gives them a peace sign I've never seen a grown man give another grown man a peace sign here's Sephora like seven just goes so I can totally acknowledge the peace line just keeps on going yo bro you just gave deuces to in Indiana Jones I'll do that it's so great there's a Ford Gillian they were coming piece like this I'll do that up you know I do those good I do like this doesn't really came well no this is kind of like yo like not a way of this but this this is kind of halt this is I'm reaching for you I'm reaching for you and they feel too high it's the Heil Hitler you don't want that so you can tell you man I'm now I'm thinking I give peace signs of people all the time you do this all time like a 14 year old Korea teenager girl yep exactly 13 13 year old teenager girl peace peace out nothing wrong with that my kid all the time but they do sideways like this to take pictures they go like this that's cute lifts out though they'll do like this hand forward this hand backward well that's what Brian did Harrison right there that's me bro but imagine running up to Harrison Ford of doing that freaking the fuck out I do and he's high off his ass right yeah driving that fucking electric dune buggy it was great man yeah he's um I wonder what he does with his spare time other than fly planes look can you make that much money and you're that famous and then you just sit around what do you do I don't know but there's there's certain guys at that level right like he's so famous he's a whole nother level but I was thing about last night datian when Dave Chappelle walked in yeah and it was like you know you're around birds around there's some of the greatest comics in the world then when Dave Chappelle walks in I wonder if it's weird for him because I can feel the room like everyone just stares at him you know he was in the oh our and I was in there before he went on and there's I mean there wasn't a seat I mean people are in the hallways there's just watched him do his thing he's just he was up there I don't know an hour two hours just not really doing a set just feeling it out I went man that must be weird at where he's at in life that he just goes up there and it's like the everything shuts down for him was a comic well I think he's not working out right you're not saying no he's definitely working out not that's not me put it out correct but it's different than if somebody else like all eyes are on them all the time non-stop so even him working out it's funny as fuck you know well he he handles it remarkably well like the way he just around people like even though he's super duper ridiculous famous he handles it like he's not like you wanders through but man when people start grabbing at them and wanting pictures and shit it's so embarrassing wow they just they won't let him talk to people like say if you're talking to them they don't care if you're in locked in a conversation about your mom's cancer they don't care there's your bro I get a picture they freak out just like this is my time to dress up my facebook page and they get there with that kid maybe the likes they move in on him like a fucking hawk it's just it's embarrassing it's embarrassing like people don't respect another person having a conversation they don't wait like no one sits around in wait it's like in their head if they don't grab him right now they're never gonna get that picture so it doesn't matter who he's talking to these I've seen it - like I was talking to the rock once and this dude literally slid in between us Jesus and held his phone up to the rock slid in between us it just didn't ask he was taking the picture as he was asking he's came into picture with you and just like in between us like I'm talking about what's up man you have a good time Bubba and then this guy slides in got the camera like no thought whatsoever for people's space and what did the rock do he's probably used to it by swallowed like a man it's just such a bummer man it is it there's a certain point of Fame with Chappelle the rock yeah you're probably pretty fucking close that where you came go through the airport I got to go through the airport one time with Tim Tebow right I think right right after he won like this huge playoff game does he get on me before he gets in a plane no he assumes Jesus is taking care of him oh yeah jesus take the wheel and I knew I was safe as fuck next to him so I think in the fuck so going through the airport with him and I I felt bad for him I mean you're talking you can't you can't get anywhere there's just like these this mob yeah this is exhausting exhausting there's to be a certain level where that's just not cool man well when what changed was phones cameras on phones and then social media because everybody wants a picture whereas before I guess people would just want autographs and no one had a camera with them yeah now the autograph is the selfie yeah there's no moron oh nice to meet you like there might be a few yeah I had a show log but once I say literally sunk in with your nets for an autograph the other day but it's like a hundred to one pictures for a selfie oh it's also yeah that's also visa yeah it's weird this is the life we chose this is a weird world we live in well take it easy you know I'm not Tim t1 Joe Bob Don yeah I could walk through an airport yeah it gets weird but I can do it like Chapelle it'd be tough yeah well Tom Cruise that motherfucker can't walk through the airport yeah but you're Tom Cruise you get Tom Cruise money you're going private fuck yeah LAX he laughs he laughs that's the best joke he's hurt like you bring up lax or Tom Cruise what the fuck bro well we flew over there with bird yeah yeah the Van Nuys Airport floor the Tom Cruise experience feel like he autographs his jet does have like his signature is jet as a button Egan press and then it's all covered in screens and it turns into the clouds behind it and comes under woman makes sense it's fucking Tom Cruise man but don't you think that guy has probably a lot of expenses I always assumed that a guy like that not only do they have a lot of money but they burn through a lot of money so they have to keep making a lot of money is that true though or are we assuming everyone's Johnny Depp and has 19 houses and buying old pirate ships for thirty billion dollars you know I'm saying and there's making horrible life decisions I think that's the same thing with with like athletes or even comics or entertainers like if I post something say I post my car somebody that's like good luck bro in three years when you go brokenly now I know the bad stories I get that man I'm a smart dude like yeah I think I've made it this far listen those people they just hope you're going broke no but it's there's that stigma of like the 34:30 SPN broke it's like not that's not everyone's like that man I hate to tell you not all entertainers are fucking rappers we're we're just blowing through money it doesn't work like that I'm in a business where it's not you know it's not just like you know it's it's not the UFC where your average careers a year and a half or two years you know well world of podcasting podcasting is a weird thing right it's like what are we doing we're just talking you know this is what our art form is shit people already do you know yeah that's weird if you think about it's very weird you know there's no other art form where everybody does it yeah everybody everybody does it not everybody paints no but was last time you painted well I paint with my son write on your own most last time you went down to Michael's nervous never because I don't sucked it out I can't paint a lot of painters that don't suck dick you so you'd be surprised but there are it's but I'm talking about like you like taking time out of my data there's a flower there are sexual male painters that admire you that are listening this right I love you guys man thank you something cool bro they're paintbrush in their hand right now annoy fuck this guy I'm gonna paint shop with a big old dick in his mouth do it yeah I don't know man I with podcasters it's weird but it's also the gateway to an unfiltered medium where before with TV and movies and stuff like you know with like name any big guy who's I'm trying to think of a like Dax Shepard right he's a he's an actor he's an actor and he has a podcast well if you just watch his movies you don't know shit about him well I was playing a character but you can go on his pot get some talk like I'll fuck weren't a lot of the same things mmm oh damn he's struggling with his wife god I have the same issues oh damn he's struggling with his kids and then you find out for all the exact same but you never get that if there weren't podcasts you wouldn't you're not gonna get that off a ESPN interview off a 31st you're not gonna get any of that ever that's nice podcasting is taking over I think well it's also cuz no one could tell you what to do you know you can have conversations that no one can know one can steer there's no executives gonna come in and stop you if you fuck up it's your fuckup and then if you apologize it's an apology that you make yourself you you don't feel good about what you did you want you you express remorse which I do all the time you have to that's the way to go though yeah I got tuck a lot of I wouldn't say shit I just I go and then then I'll think about something like with Nowitzki right I like Jeff Novitzky I really like I met him the one time Adam he's great dude we had a joke about it the nickname the goin snitch like good dude look right there right next to you oh this the shirt yeah oh dude things you do I will rock the shit out of that look at that that's pretty dope hold that up for the camera it's pretty dope for sure let Joe design their shirts but that's a good shirt it's a decent shirt I like it a lot yeah it's cool but like with him right like I'd go off on something and then when I talk to you about I'm like I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings yeah it's just like to me it's a it's a it's a game right you know and then when you think about like he might have to deal with it in the office people like dude your job this or gets DM this or you know I'm like I don't want that it's the last thing I want well you just you made an error in that you thought that he worked for you sada and he'd never worked for you solid that worked for the UFC you said he worked for you sada now he works with UFC but he never really worked for you sada he wasn't the guy very closely with you sup he worked for the UFC work with UFC he brought he wasn't now he know he coordinated the UFC's meeting with you sada and he put it all together he's the vice-president of us of athletes safety Health and Safety so what it is something like that for the UFC now that's what he's always had no that's not true before that he worked for the government yes but he's worked hand-in-hand with you sada now doesn't him not as an employee rather he never worked for you sada no he's our charissa you saw he went from I think he was working for the IRS pretty sure mmm yeah my point was yeah he's not he's never got it I don't know if he's ever gotten a check from the sada he's been in cahoots with him they they work hand in hand FDA FDA that's it yeah that's when he's good at his job I'm strong right yeah that's really every time I talk to novice key I get text messages from Lancer I'm sure it makes sense though right it's so salty why wouldn't you be I mean you kidding me brother I I see why he would be salty but I also yeah he has to accept I think that he did some things that he shouldn't have done and I'm not even just talking about the steroids I'm talking about suing the people that came out and said that he took the step that's where he's fucked that's where because just doing peds and you know cycling's of dirty I don't give a fuck do it bro and you're the best at it he still would been the best of the level playing field I think so too so but the way he fucked up is use mean and bullied the people that we're trying to you know snitch on him or or if they weren't into the peds or if they were gonna tell him kind of fucked him over that's where it gets dark and that's where people hate him so I get that but in his defense and then this is a shaky defense they went after those people to get to him they went after those people and they broke those people down they made those people rat on him and then he was threatening them with lawsuits it sort of to protect himself but even before that right I did he there's a little bit of a bully culture coming from him which is why every one competitor is a mean guy you know a lot of like most people oh yeah yeah right you're right about that I was just lying about this the other day and it in this TJ Dillashaw was a great guy to fight Saturday great guy but he's mean correct great guy but if you say hey TJ if you knock him out with a head kick his family won't eat tonight in order for you in this fight he's gonna knock you out with a head kick he's the most ultra competitive guy in the world and it shows in training shows in practice I mean he's a nasty motherfucker do you know I never spent 35 pounds right now oh yeah he's ready to go but he got his body down to 135 pounds before the weight cut yeah crazy he looks so thin freak I saw him on ESPN last night and they were discussing it he might fight max or he wants to fight max next that's a tough one he wants to fight 145 afters but that's a 20-pound jump in weight and max is a giant 45 er yeah that's a bad idea but you never know what TJ hey who knows I mean if he can get his body up to 165 dude have you seen Henry who know though Jax Pico on Pico just kidding he's gonna clear the test I'm just joking looks like he's pulsing yeah he might not make weight he's Jack City bro yeah I don't know if he's gonna make the weight I bet he makes it I bet he's never he's missed a bunch of times Henry cejudo yes I've 125 yes that's why they made him fight at 135 for a while mmm well you do know a shit a bunch though more than once mmm that's a problem look at him looks pretty stacked good-looking kissa thick dude just short do didn't he's probably walking around at more than 45 I would say it's more than 40 I'm so short I don't know yeah I still think he's more than honored do that it's that tough life if you're that short you're not an Olympic champion yes he's right like I was looking on the other day in a video my god damn he's tiny what is he five two five two five three I'm only five inches away from that I'm barely five inches that's a lifetime broker those five inches you know what's money they would pay that five inches they do pay do you ever see what they do they stretch your bones where they break them and then dude you know how crazy you have to be to get your shins extended they cut your shin Se they sawed into you and then they put this metal brace all around you like a halo brace and then you crank it a little bit click foot Y took click cause you ever get a couple inches taller come on bro for what so it's an ego thing no so you can get laid I was watching this documentary on Chinese guys this guy was like he had these braces on his leg and it's like my my girlfriend she you know she wouldn't marry me because I'm too short but I'm gonna come to her and I'm gonna be over five feet tall for the first time she's under five feet tall get another girl fuck that ho it's hard to get a girl when you're four nine the biggest problem is if you have a short dick yeah but the biggest problem is if you're 49 you don't want to see your dick oh Jesus look at this guy he went from eating 6 inches 5 6 to 6 foot ok let me see this Oh God he's a thick e on the left gained six inches from stretching his fucking bones out let me see what it says there how unhappy do you have to be with your body go up there nip/tuck grow five foot six inch man underwent astonishing leg lengthening procedure because he wanted to be six foot tall oh he started at five six and he got up to six feet tall Jesus but how fucking damaging is that not well help me see the procedure in which both legs are broken then slowly stretched bears more than a little resemblance to medieval torture let me see what this fucking guy did to his bow oh my god oh my god it has to be some mental health issue yeah a little bit the trim well maybe if you wanted to really play football the trend for ling-ling limb lengthening surgery swept China where minimum Heights are often quoted on personal adverts and job advertisement says the country opened up to the west a decade ago look at that fucking thing on his leg man oh my god so his what we're looking at here it looks like they stick cut an inch out of his bone but then they have this bar that runs through it so that's his femur man that's a leg bone that's not even his shin how do you think he's gonna feel when he's 70 that can't be good oh if you wanted to be 5 inches taller dude get a skill you know what chicks dig over height skill man yeah funny get a fucking 650 leg-lengthening procedures in West Palm Beach Florida not all to remedy deformity some of them to remedy deformity switch make sense see there's something now how long do you think it takes for them to fucking recover from something like that a lifetime oh they have height dysphoria so it's sort of like anorexia with their height it's a mental disorder oh it's one of the few psychiatric disorders that you can actually cure with the knife says the surgeon oof what I says the surgeon trying to sell this bullshit director uses the term knife are you really using a knife bro don't you have a scallop why not go into that guy what I can cure with the saw it costs 85 grand look what it says he does here it's surgery's not for the faint-hearted the leg bone is broken into the doctor then implants a state-of-the-art telescopic rod into the cartilage of the bone which then pulls it apart very gradually one millimeter add a new living bone grows along it to fill the gap and muscles our nerves the arteries of skin also renew themselves the cost is prohibitive $85,000 takes at least three months to complete grueling physical therapy is essential huh look at that one look at the gap in his fucking leg look how big that gap it you're playing shower works man walking up that kind leg kicking them yeah it's just think of that imagine if he decides to do muy Thai I bet you his like where your leg is vulnerables changed right dude if your little geometry or leg is like if you if your leg is a certain like if you your bones are a certain wit I would imagine there's like a like it all make sense pretty much in terms of like mathematics like how long your knee is or how long your femur is it would be a certain thickness but then if you spread it out it's like the thickness of a shorter one but now it's long it's probably more really safe like stilt then make me tell our community I just found oh wow there's a whole traduction two leg lengthening and frequently asked questions holy shit there's only 30 posts though dude thank you this one's got 300 post this is 3,000 posts down here it's taken tire not a ton note of what I got here I'd be more worried about one thing like I think those guys is there a lengthening dick community fuck yeah I know what they do they're all age they hang weights on how dare you what racist no its life there's gotta be some Asians with giant augs out there mmm I feel like we'd know about it right cuz that got to be flaunting his shit make me longer community than their yeah make me a bigger cock community cuz there step this procedure you can do like to cut it right just Google how do I get a bigger cock is the pumps there's a pump and thing is you like if you everybody if it was something that really worked everybody would know about it yeah fuck yeah they would you want any broom you walked in with a bunch of dudes like dude you see that new fucking device big dick bigger everybody once he devices and dicks those two words don't go together like a device I think of my clamps and screws dude you ever seen a penis pants like from Austin Powers I've seen one I've never seen one in person like being used like with a blown-up dick inside I've never seen it being used but I've seen one in person hmmm and it's very I mean it's intense dude I've heard that some guys like especially old fellas they use one of them penis pumps to just get hard-ons oh yeah this hatch to it no they they have that too like that was in Liberace in the candelabra I love that movie so goes banging Matt Damon 24/7 right how do you stay hard that's right got an implant that's right yeah do that movie so good that's a crazy movie man that'd be a weird movie to make if you're Matt Damon cuz they're like he talked about to there's a scene where spoiler there's a scene reason a speedo and Michael Douglas is just like laying out in the pool and he straddles him and just full-on ah you know might demonstrate a shit playing the character that'd be tough though I give Hollywood kendry is like Brennan we need to play the new Batman but you gotta go at it with the Joker mouth to mouth like you guys are bonkers in the movie yeah you'd be like yeah be a little bit of a struggle that's a hard pass but how much you say do you think you could live in Las Vegas like that do you think you can do a residency in Las Vegas no look what if they offered you the the the big brown boom-boom room like a fucking what is it at like Mandalay Bay like Jay Leno type of shit yeah we getting thirty million a year yeah something crazy like that like Britney Spears type deal I don't think so I'm and this is different for me I have such a stressful connotation when it goes comes to Vegas because of fighting it's like whenever I think things I think of stress stress stress so as soon as I land in Vegas I get all introverted and I search sweating it's just not so much worth it well yeah I was on The Ultimate Fighter there for eight weeks I'm you know I've had some huge fights there so for me when I think of Vegas I think of K like stressful stressful Don jr. yeah yeah so it'd be tough for me to live there for be really tough because people do residency for like two years could you do it I don't know I don't think I could well I think the thing about Vegas is you got to not live in Vegas like you don't want to have like a suite at Mandalay Bay or something like that I think the move is to live and like Henderson or something like that like by Red Rock yeah or yeah one of those places and you just drive in I think that's the move because then you're just living in a town well not even a big town see I would say fuck all that noise and I probably if they offered me thirty million I'd probably hire a bill burr fuckton helicopter pilot type of dude and I'd live in LA and just fly out there on Fridays I think it's a long flight no helicopter doesn't toss you something like that or used to it when he was going there you're just flying like Friday night on a plane that 25-minute flight is what was he doing there a lot yeah he was used for a ride a Saturday or stuff like that they might stay the night but they'd be back within 36 hours or something my phone I can I cannot live there men there's no way just because you're past experience that and just in general it's just not for me it's not my type of living cuz Ralphie may had a residency there for a while and he was doing but that's where he died I know Eddie Griffin has a residency dice had a residency there for a while Seinfeld did too I think he's still going yeah he's mine films I Vegas yeah really yeah it's just there's a lot of great stuff there right like what do you like to do do you like to go to restaurants great restaurants what do you like to do do you like them go to the movie theater there's plenty of Moo these great shows yeah there's plenty of gems amazing places to work out there's a lot of stuff there I just I don't know man you know I know what that's what I'm saying it's like sweating talking about I don't know what it just my hagas I have some great friends who live in Vegas and some of the best people I know live in Vegas some of this we got no work in the nightclubs you know you know what we need to do we need to sit down before big events and make a YouTube video where we're just breaking down each event like fight by fight as it comes up I think people would really enjoy that but you and me breaking down there the big fight yeah breaking down big events you know the idea like if I didn't work for the UFC I would love to go there and just like cover the weigh-ins as like a spectator but as as unfiltered no production you and me just talking sure yeah yes like I don't like doing the weigh-ins stressful I try to pronounce people's names Pele Troy Yan like what there couldn't be a worse job for me if you ask me I pronounce everyone's names correctly some of these Russian cats their names are off the charts and it there's more Russian guys G and a Z but you gotta use a why not to say it like a why you're like what not for me what is the name yeah I have to write it out phonetically how much long do you think you'd do that I don't know just between me and you no one's listening no one's listening I don't know I do enjoy ever thought about it yes all the time well I cut way back because first of all I was doing too many of them one point time I was doing 24 a year was way too many it was like half the year I was half the weekends in the year I was flying somewhere to go to you you have seen but that's when you did international as well yeah yeah I was too much and that was before the UFC really they started adding a bunch of people yeah that took a lot of the weight off of me yeah I'm sad they got rid of Jimmy Smith I think Jimmy Smith's really good I think he's really good but sometimes it's just not a fit like I didn't see I didn't find him and maybe he didn't get his fair shot I think he's one of the best commentators in the world but it never felt right maybe because he wasn't he didn't get to do it enough he's brilliant at his job but there was that I just didn't in ever felt right to me it was like watching Joe Montana play for the Chiefs well I'm selfish he's my friend I was happy he was there I think he's really good I love Jimmy I'm not saying I think he's great I think he's been gone since whoever finds him can be lucky but they never liked the writing was on the wall cuz you would see DC who's amazing and I see Paul Felder who's amazing that Dominick Cruz you know michael Bisbing and then of course Jimmy's not gonna have a job like they're gonna use they in-house guys then the winds the direction they're going yeah I guess so I wonder if he could do play-by-play you know like when though the ones on anok doesn't want to do and in the panic does all the hey anak go home to your kids don't you have like seven daughters go home to your fucking kids Jon knows I love him but I see him at Brazil post like two days sleep but you know been on the road 19 days in a row I'm like you go home bro you can't he's he's the best he's really good there's not a better commentating team in the history of combat sports when it's you DC and John annek that's the best it's fun to fun DC's himself yeah one of the best fighters of all time John etics very fucking good he's a brilliant dude and then you do your thing and that's he's a DC's so loose too like he makes it silly he's a special dude like when when Rose knocked out Yoani MJ check he's like thug Rose what you want thug Rose you can't be care you can't pay for that no that's natural that's yeah no you either got it he don't he has it yeah that's his future man yeah it's his future yeah well that's why everybody kind of wants him to retire you know that's why I think his family's kind of pushing for him to retire and I know crazy Bob cook he's like I'd be happy for retired right now I and I don't think the UFC is gonna let him retire without facing John John's the heavyweight division he certainly can retire if he decides to mm-hmm not happening you don't think nope throw that big knee sit down and you sit down make a deal with the devil like yeah think about your time very cool here's the thing we're gonna pay you this much to fight this monster they're gonna get out that pan ago yeah and they're gonna push that the piece of paper crossed and go through my return what is it just look do me a favor just look at this that number red strip steak house in Vegas we're talking about two million pay-per-view buys and this is what you would get set for life he's probably set for life already ah anything so he made four million dollars with Derrick Lewis they're not sad well know yourself who knows how much you made for Steve Bay who knows how much he made I mean let's say after taxes 10 million in the bank is that set not why do you live you went gold watch bro dude that's not that crazy Louie CK has a joke and his uh his newest set about buying a cold one Jesse what's he say couldn't be more upset yeah yeah gold watch gold watch it's a gold Rolex the fucking gold Rolex me yeah so I'm saying ten million dollars isn't gonna last for you YouTube now it's ten million would last for I'm not that crazy everyone thinks I'm okay how long would it last for the rest of your life do 10 million I'd be set with my investment stuff like that buy property I'd be I'd be panic and count well don't get me wrong I wouldn't stop working you know I'm saying what if you wanted to stop working if you wanted I don't know do you have you ever thought about have you ever put a number if I get here I can chill out and like I don't need to do I have 17 podcasts I don't need to do all that work I don't need to do mine sets of week it you know the comic stores if I want to get good I know but I'm what if I want to get a hundred percent if I only get a podcast and do that if I only get get it but there has to be some material level financially where I can get to regular I can chill out on this but I'm not I'm not built that way every morning I wake up like ah fuck man we ready to get going better get going I don't I don't think about retiring because I like what I do so I don't think I don't think like oh I need to have X amount of money in the bank so I'm not gonna do this very much long I'm not saying retiring I'm saying maybe cut back on all the shit you do mmm I like all that stuff I think it keeps me from going crazy too I think being active keeps me from losing my mom yeah if Isis just around the house just following with my demons oppressed I don't think I'd ever get depressed really no I get depressed from that if I'm not busy if I'm with my son I'm good but do you leave me alone now I'm like a gremlin after midnight don't leave me alone man I don't like being all by myself all the time well I have so many different interests that are sort of one of the patterns that I've picked up my whole life is that I like to do I find things that I like to do and I do them as much as I can I would I mean I have so many different things whether it's archery or martial arts or I would I joined the fucking pro pool tour I would do something see but everything your time out it would you wanna hear good about to those you're doing that with friends like so your friends are the best in the world at those things you just mentioned that's hand and that helps having well yeah if you were alone with no friends that shit is very that's when I can get a little dark if you leave me like that my brother goes on the road to me all the time I've done tons of dates and when he's not with me I'm in that room all by myself yeah for like three or four days like oh I'm not I'm not happy man I'm not doing well I don't know I try so many talks on about but I don't know that is a depressing thing when you're alone on the road I used to do those gigs on the road with no opening act like way back in the day and work with a local guy and it was just not fine if the local guy was cool it was great we had a good old time and it was fun I hope and you know I like everybody but if if I'm all set on friends so if you're not my group I don't want to spend time like I'm not gonna go to eat with you I might I'll see you out see at the venue man like I don't want to get to know each other anybody no no not really your books closed it's a lot of energy man I talk for a living so if you didn't have to work ever again what would you do with your time like would if say you know you hit the lottery you want five hundred million dollars you never have to work again I would still do stand-up in podcasting really guaranteed yeah if I'm not busy like I like been stupid busy like I didn't like you don't see you and I have a new podcast I didn't you do that I already have my show on Showtime but yet you did need to do that because I love doing well it's not finding it works good like I love Theo by himself like his podcast by themselves really good because he's better with other people yes cuz it's because other people get to respond how ridiculous he is out of this world who did yes half the fun is people go what the fuck are you talking I'm a crazy shit it's some crazy shit mean you know medium talked about doing it but for a long time doing the king is staying a long time then we even made an announcement and then months late like even months later just because you know he's a busy guy I'm a busy guy and it's

cejudo who else is on that card pull that card up good card was the first card ever for ESPN Plus yeah ESPN Plus so it's a streaming thing you watch cowboy Cerrone though on the unregular yes PN the he's the main event in the regular spend then you so it's weird because the prelims are on the digital device then it goes regular ESPN for the Donald Cerrone fight then you got switched back to the digital and he's gonna take a little while for people you said well some people are super bummed out with my friend Brian Stephens he lives in a rural Texas outside of Dallas and he's bummed out because his Internet's not that fast it's like you know in certain places you can't get my best Internet freely yeah we got nineteen he can't get Wi-Fi if you want to live on a ranch the own live on a fucking ranch you know get slow ranch fuck bro there's something they can do some stuff bro they can do some stuff right well you can if you really want to be you know ballin you got to spend a lot of money like it took four months for us to get legit Internet at the old place that I chew up the streets and we're you know we were in you know the Canoga Park area which has all these businesses doesn't really legit there yeah they it's a fucking it's a grind to get legit Internet in some spot so hopefully can't get it so he's bummed out it yeah so he's you know they used to be able to watch all the good fights on regular TV so here we go gregor Gillespie versus Yancy Medeiros Gregor Gillespie is that guy's a fucking beast - 550 you look at the a he says intimate is whelming favorite dick that could be by the night I love how you skip over the Greg Hardy we all recognize that's bullshit and then let's keep going is it bullshit I mean the guy's got fucking serious power with the only thing the times he's fought Kansas is Ryan oh so on the party's disco main event well he's dead because of his name he's depth well Alan Crowder I don't know him I don't know who who Alan Crowder's and he's Greg Laughlin giant favorite 600 yeah he's - 600 the way I mean it calls himself the prince of war hey bro whoa no he does he does Greg the prince of war hearty Wow don't do that I absolutely do not do that do that these nicknames are so bad like someone needs like a nickname coach the UFC should provide you know how they have like the athletes the Performance Center yeah athlete Center yeah they have an ignition have a nickname Center like Greg or the gift gillespie that's a good name dude I love the triple cheese that motherfucker can wrestle holy shit can he run fish too he can fight yeah he's a good fisherman yeah yeah so fuck it's serious wrestler though this is a good fight does the opposite of EDA is a good fight yeah they did fight before and Benavidez won yeah benefit is a motherfucker yeah love Benavides go over to share and call Roberson that's a good fight Carl Robertson is a fucking beast man interesting is he say Robertson Robertson Carl baby Kay Robertson yeah that motherfucker can fight he's good striking is very good yeah he hurt his foot in his last fight like early on but this is a big step up for him clover it's getting a little long in the tooth yeah a lot long in the tooth but he's still tough as shit if this cancer could get dicey and then the next one boys did you takes out Van Zant do it Rachel most of it'll die me die meas of all diamonds they're better looking than the ring card girls well most of which has the most redonkulous body and her face is rishis beautiful - he's dying she's so beautiful her body's so ridiculous it's like are you all right person yeah yeah I'd risk it all for that girl and then you got Paige vans in who's why does it say 155 she's not 150 fat that's a title on UFC you get your fucking people on the website damn it someone's an asshole they want to make fun over 155 they could also do another picture of some girl who works for the likes of the girlfriend of the web designers like rays 155 fuck that I'm 45 B 55 yeah she uh yeah she's easy on the eyes too yeah she's beautiful yeah they're both gorgeous women it's crazy though the oast of it's coming off of that domestic violence thing were have you seen the Oh of that no it's disturbing that's her husband saying he's gonna kill her it's super disturbing if you need security Rachel I am here for you so sad they have kids together - it's just so fucked up it's super dark but to put her on the card with Greg Hardy that was a giant a lot of people criticizing that and the UFC does not give a fuck well the thing is that Greg Hardy was on the card the card was set before she got assaulted by her husband so it was already in place she was supposed to be on the car they pulled her from the card when they thought that she had a broken orbital bone she went to a different doctor I guess she got some actual exams and MRIs and stuff turns out she didn't have a broken orbital bone they cleared her to fight she begged them to let her fight because she just she doesn't want this to take her out of fighting is what meets a gigantic catastrophe a horrible dilemma in her life hard not to root for her husband hits her beats her up it's it's awful and she's like I'm not gonna let this guy stop my career I'm not gonna let this guy change the path my life I'm done with him I want to fight and she begged them to let her fight and I'm just saying if I'm the UFC I go all right Greg Hardy he's not a big draw he's not he's not a veteran there's nothing going on here let's just move them to any other fucking card we have we're sensitive to this we don't know what's tuned in just oh and it's not a big deal moving to the next car I think they want some controversy I think they like controversy I think any sort of press and they live and die by this negative press is good press well look at what the jojo's thing they don't give how about O'Connor khabib thing they kept showing him throwing the the the dolly at the bus they kept showing it over and over again the promos until they're pointed you know it kind of works fuck you at work that was a joy and pay-per-view I mean that was giant it works so you can't no this one's a little different like to throw on a dolly through the window with other professional fighters all right whatever I watched that I hyped that shit too with this one I can't I just can't I come out I'm not hi Bennett I can't get on board for it well it's not like Austin bitch is fighting her boyfriend her husband I'd be cool she was I think he's a fighter cycle between Safari okay looks pretty charred yeah that's trouble not good the whole thing's so ugly it's um what are the fights what are the fights were cowboy oh that's an Alexander Hernandez is a fucking beast that is a good fight that guy is super cocky too Alexander the Great Hernandez he is a bad motherfucker boy being cowboy just taking a random ass fight yeah well this is his first this is Hernandez his first fight in the big leagues let me look at his record they show his record no but I mean look at it the actual fights doesn't show who he's fought they don't have that one oh wow he hasn't fought anyone know where did on the website um on the fight card I don't believe but maybe on here on his page Wow how weird I mean be are you shot I doubt Mercier how dare you she's a motherfucking he not he starched him yeah he starts Darius and he beat album RCA those are two really good writers yeah but the way he beat Darius I was like holy shit he's fast as fuck he's got serious power he's really technical too and he's really hungry like he he views his cowboy fight as the breakout opportunity he's a young line man yeah yeah he's got real future championship potential and he's one of those guys you look at you go let's see totals there and yeah with with cowboy it's just like makes zero sense in the world but cowboy just wanna stay active he's a savage man he just loves it and you know what man I mean if you look at his last fight against Perry he still fightin smooth and smart he looked fantastic in that fight short work of Perry yep Perry's a dangerous guy powerful guy got what you gonna cowboy him in it's very interesting very interesting fight I'm that might be one of the fights that I'm most curious about for sure for sure yeah I'll tell you some other fuckers should go down the first kid and I've seen this kid since he walked in the gym at thirteen Khorsandi Hagan he came to Aurora high altitude when I was fighting and he was a basketball player in high school and came in there and he is a mother fucker he is damn good he Swiss fight John lineker but John got hurt but he this kid is standing by super-special 511 1:35 that's a tall gentleman for that weight class he's a protege of Christian Allen he this kid has skills man damn I don't know I know nothing about Mario Batista I have nothing see if you can find a video of Corey fighting Corey Sammy and just his movement you'll see how fluid his movement is and how on Orthodox he isn't he's good in all he is the one downfall might be his wrestling but he's fucking good man yeah it's a fun time right now for for up-and-coming talent there's so many good bass as far as combat sports including boxing in an MMA they're gonna yeah and the business were in that couldn't be a better time I know right it's crazy yes I always it's a it's a male soap opera I always have something to talk about the only thing that's left out is kickboxing kickboxing still is not getting any traction you know what it's just like jiu-jitsu like it's never gonna just blow up like he's not because it's it's the way the world is Joe don't gives up I'm sad yeah I think that's the one thing that I think is missing is kickboxing blowing up again I love combat sports but it's like I'm not gonna jump to my couch to watch kickboxing or Jitsu and I love jiu-jitsu but I'm not gonna look if it was a big kick boxing card like I watched Overeem dahari didn't we go to see Joe shilling fight together did you come with me into that event I didn't go with you anything go with that all speaking of that Coker text me last night I didn't get back to him sorry she's got phaidor yeah he's like dude you don't say fader baby get back to me yet either I was gonna ask you yeah oz wait you want to go should we go is it next weekend it's the 26th of the weekend after your your event it's at the forum I feel like we should go to see fate or fight live - because if specialty loses probably the last time well it's just that the opportunity is see if there's five all-time greatest fighters in history he's on that list have you been to a live Fedor never I've been to two went when he fought Ronnie Coleman Vegas and when he and then I worked at the Bellator when he fought Mitrione here's San Hagan we give it change guy he's so tall 4:35 he looks like a vegan that like but see how smooth he is when he searches he got lit up there and this but he's very smooth man oh he fight iuri Alcantara that's a tough one whoa Jesus all this this is one of the rounds of the year he gets in trouble and you think you submitted his artist and his arm he goes on to win this fight I'm pretty sure Jesus Christ oh my god how does he not tap here this is crazy he's triangle he's in full-on armbar game he's getting his arm fucked up he gets out of this oh my god how does he get out of this no idea what a heart yeah here's a special town oh my god he's got some rubber arms look at his arm his nothing looks broken man he's that little broken look at it look how far it's bent back and I'm surprised the ref dents not oh I'm surprised the ref didn't stop bro oh no no it's turned sideways now see the way his wrist is yeah that's actually going with the joint because he's doing this now so he's actually in a way better shape and then he's bleeding now he's fucked oh no but he bent it down dude he's safe he's actually doing he's actually doing his shoulder she's not doing well defense well shoulders not in danger there he's doing very good with defense look he's getting cut up from this this is incredible yeah he controls the leg so you can escape oh my god this is horrific to watch how does he get out of this that's incredible how cantar has got to be like what the fuck now does that kind that'll break your will nope when you when you do all that and he's still there and look at him and meter smashing you and then you're tired and you realize like oh my god I should try to choke him he should have committed to the triangle I mean the triangle is fully locked in dude that's our meeting tomorrow bar was nasty it was nasty but triangles put you to sleep the thing about arm bars is you can let your arm snap you really can and guys have there's some crazy savages out there that will let you break their arm know what time they stop it but when you get put to sleep you get put to sleep yeah you're trying to wear be fucking good specially this days trying to besides fucking Brian Ortega like the triangle better be goddamn good man guys are so good with their defense with triangles these days mmm yeah triangles aren't that special you know Corey's a black belt right but it's like who's who's who's triangle is that good like trying to defense or try out some issues or take is right the best things yeah yeah tee city transitivity that's what it stands for you people you know people have seen him in the max Holloway fight if you've only seen him fighting that fight God you know back and watching him do your homework these submissions are so nasty just flying triangles san Hagen's is hagen san hagen or san hagen thin hagen san hagen it's just smashing down on them Alcantara seems spent again came to the gym basketball player no experience that's zero at 13 young you ever see the 13 court doesn't learn shit yeah just think about 13 walked in the gym and you have you know this work ethic from basketball and you know I'll try this stuff out and you walk in the gym you got Christian Allen he's a ninja and then he just downloads all his experience into you like all right Danny in the fucking UFC amazing that is and he was gonna be an underdog against John linacre and he would have beat linacre men to he's smashing Alcantara how does this fight end do you remember Corey wins he's beaten up and sure yeah if you get a bonus for that night you will think Alcantara is right after all that he's like Jesus Christ dude he's not even defending himself well he's exhausted from but he's like trying to Pilates yeah shoulder the way he's defending himself is the way he's what he's doing it's almost like he's confused that the guys still there and he's pounding on him now okay this is like letting it he must be exhausted he emptied his gas tank he get stood up yeah he's getting fucked up dude hop out that's like you can move right now he's so exhausted been tried for that note Gareth sweet mmm the deep half yep no one better um yeah man that's it that's interesting and and that is on what is that on fight pass no pass no no fight pass that's uh this is on ESPN plus o kzs fan plus then you gotta jump to regular ESPN to watch cowboy I think I'd get jumped back to the digital platform to watch the rest of the card what terrible idea whoever did that really terrible idea really terrible idea back and forth yeah that doesn't make you sit not on an app though like if you have yes a it goes it goes app regular TV to watch like you can watch ESPN normal on the app I believe that's what I'm asking but I'm not sure hope hopefully said Luke Thomas is talking about it and so can you get the app on your television can you do it through like Apple TV and be able to should be yeah so you can just watch all of it yeah have you seen also the nd stop them yeah crazy dude hop out fucking Cain Velasquez verse Frances in Ghana oh that makes me nervous for who for Cain really yeah it's amazing fight for Cain it's a great fight for Cain if he gets that guy to the ground it's a great pipe for Francis to what makes me excited it's a I mean I say nervous anytime I see Francis not fighting I'm nervous for his opponent because I wasn't nervous t Bay fight other guy fuck you weren't nervous in the Derrick Lewis fight no I thought if he fought the way he always fights that would be a crazy fight but he was so nervous from that fight from the Steep a fight that he just did look terrible he just couldn't pull the trigger well then there was Derrick Rose out of her back yes he got a complete shit show out of two knockout artist I just think that um that uh you know Cain's been out for a long time he's that motherfucker though oh he's the best I think he is the best I think he's the best in terms of like physical ability you think is the best heavyweight of all time I think he's the best I think yesterday I just feel a little more work think he's the best in terms of what he's accomplished I think phaidor is the best heavyweight of all time in terms of what he's accomplished maybe maybe you can make the argument for Fabricio Werdum because we're doomed but I think for doom beat of phaidor that had already been through the ringer and pride and you know the other chaos over there I mean he had been those wars with fucking crow copper doom beat him when it was still the aura Nate or he's the first one where you realize he's old enough cuz Brett Rogers kind of took a little bit out how did he starched fucking ko'd him but before that he had trouble with him it was it was an easy fight it wasn't an easy fight it was me respect Brett right he did a pro cop like I mean your curl hop fucking punch yeah leaped and no fucking odd him with that right hand that right hand was redonkulous though I yeah it's it's it's tough to say greatest of all time cuz it's the greatest of that time period cuz when when he was doing it they were specialists that he was great there were certain things that made him great he was undersized because if you put his skill set with his frame now into the the pool it's I don't know if he's the best but then Kane at his time when there's JDS and he's in his prime Brock Lesnar he's beaten those guys what Kane would do to people he would overwhelm you in a way that look like you were drowning his cardio in and pace was insane insane like the Junior dos Santos fights I think took so much out of junior both of them I think it took it both of them paid the price yeah it was the same thing as I was listening to who's the box you just had on from love Kelly Pavlik yeah how are you saying he doesn't want you to rematch with Canelo triple G because it takes so much out of those guys that they're never the same I'm usually on the same thinking path is that where my god if those guys go out again man we're never gonna get a good product but Cain Cain jr. for sure I mean especially the third fight in the third fight with a second one - no the second one - both of them then JDS steep a yeah that was that was deep I mean JDS has had some more than steep-ass has had some wars and you can you can tell that they're just they're just different in life yeah I'm not saying it's brain trauma whatever it's just they're just different they're not they leave a piece of themselves in that in that octagon well it's for sure some brain trauma yeah just trying to be nice try to be nice or getting hit in the head that much like they leave they leave a little piece of a mint in there for our entertainment and I feel a little guilty about what's crazy Oh talk about steep a steep 8 the most accomplished heavyweight of all time he's the greatest in terms of like his accomplishments he defended the title more than anybody he didn't fight the best guys in their prime when he fought junior and junior was definitely past his prime that's the knock on him right that's his it but again when when it was his run during his era steep pays the best when it was Kane during his day he was the best right phaidor was the best it's hard to say this dives better than this guy because it's just a different time period right Jordan Bennett and LeBron Jordan during that era by far the best LeBron right now by far the best right it's stupid we don't know each other I don't know so that's that's the question about ste pays like why why is there no talk about him fighting again like why have they not said that he's trying like he's not like he even tweeted he goes DC before I retire let's do it man yeah like quit waiting for John let's do it well he's being really active on social media trying to print but it doesn't seem like there's a lot because he has to be yeah you know why it's not in his nature we know that's not stupid we know that it's not he pays a firefighter humble blue-collar dude he's getting to put in work comes to fight all the time so Derek Lewis explains turning down steep a fight Derek says they wanted me to fight steep and short notice I wanted some time off I would still fight steep a but not right now not so soon especially after fighting a guy like DC who's more of a wrestler than going to fights deep a I know I wanted some time off hmm so they're try again steep a fight so they were trying to get him for the UFC's Brooklyn card this weekend not was that this weekend see but it's smart of Derek Louis when you go DC then Steve a there couldn't be two worse matchups for him he's not paid yeah there's two beatings you're gonna take but yeah you know slightly unless he connects like you know Dirk Lucy is doing it for the money he says that you know I'm trying to make cash man so that'd be the best way to do it but she's not healthy it's give me an ass-whupping from Steve Bay yeah or he connects cracked once early on but even Francis connected with steep and steep eight give a vice that's how freaky is yeah he's tough as shit which is more more incredible even that DC took him out so them offering ste pay black beast you can tell they're not even thinking decease tp8 rematch i know he sees getting jones lesnar that's that's it I don't think Lesnar's fighting I don't either I think some suspects going on there I would be willing to bet DC's last fight is that heavy weight against John's against John Jones on it's the biggest fight of all time that's such I like and I'm a Brock Lesnar fan I like like I like when he fights he's such a freak I'll celebrate the guy I don't know fight let you stop hate Nowitzki go get a cup of coffee on Brock fights I don't give a fuck but when when you talk about John Jones DC that I mean no one's even talking about Brock Jon Jones DC that's the motherfucker but I think that's bigger than Conor could be - I think it's there's so much history there it's for fucking the heavy and I think DC at heavyweight fight and John the the gap narrows yeah but at light heavyweight DC it's not for you at heavyweight though I think that's why John's kind of like I'll fight him has to be at light heavyweight because DC does have some advantage that heavyweight now but let's let's look at what they've done with TJ Dillashaw dropping him down to fly wait why can't DC do the same thing when he gets down the light-heavyweight what do you mean oh you saying what do you mean well he struggles so hard to get down the light heavyweight that it fucks with his cardio his conditioning he just doesn't feel the same he says it takes too much out of him he feels so much stronger at heavyweight because he doesn't have to go to that weight cut big dude man naturally no no he's got body fat on him got extra body fat that's not it doesn't aid your performance now weighs that doesn't diminish himself or is he a mesomorph where he's different because sometimes like a fade or noir or Roy Nelson if though you should if you make those guys shred it that's not in their DNA they're not ectomorphs that's not you can't do that but because we see guys like Francis and Gahan oh we assume that's you know I'm saying like the ectomorph is the like like real skin super skinny I think I'm saying mesomorph is what you think that's in the middle that's why I'm saying don't like I think DC's a mesomorph and amorphous fat right yes where I think for DC you like being shredded his body doesn't function off it doesn't have to be shredded but he's carrying around so much extra weight like every watching dudes well he starts really get look at Cain Velasquez he's two guys he starts t pay who he just connected with a beautiful shot in the clinch that's a skill as wrestling I think what's going on it heavyweight with DC is he's not weakened let him eat whatever the fuck he wants and he's not weakened I think that is critical for him and I think when he gets down the light heavyweight I think he's weakened I think it takes something out of him but I wonder how much they could mitigate that with great diet and planning it out the same way kala Vitas done to teach it smaller guy naturally in runners at 100% but still they leaned him out further to get him down 235 pounds before the weight cut I just don't think it's in DC's DNA to be that leans just not for him maybe it's just not you know maybe but I think everyone benefits from scientific planning meal planning real analysis of your calories in calories out nutrients I don't know maybe he does that works up some yeah baby he does that some degree but some guys I think do better where for a guy like DC where he just that extra fat and it just that's his thing I hope that they fight if they do fight I hope the first fight is a heavyweight that's what Oliver's because we've seen the light heavyweight because they've talked about doing it at light heavyweight we've seen the lightest Jonathan at light heavyweight yeah with John Monson at light heavyweight so that it never has to appear that he picked up a title when they took it away from the champion that they didn't earn it from the champ and I get that but how great would it be if you're John where you know most people clearly know he beat DC then you go to heavyweight and take that from them it's just the ultimate fuck you but I also think DC is it differently I'm a heavyweight has powers difference if John does get hit and you see a heavyweight could land some shit yeah the sea bass not easy to knock out at all no that would be the fight but it's also like they get so emotional with each other they get out yeah DC fucking hates that guy that's why pay-per-view ghost that's what you want a special heavyweight it's hard to sell a trilogy at light heavyweight July July 4th that's at once we can see DC versus John Jones the heavyweight championship of the world champ champ champ champ boom the giant pay-per-view three million buys prey around there's a lot of papers but yeah there's a lot of big it could be done and that's what's gonna happen Dana's gonna make a offer they can't refuse well we're in January February March April May June July six months from now you see one to return March I don't you know what it's like an angel I he's not gonna retire and more and that's he said he's forced what it's 40 birthday he's gonna retire that's why steep eight tweet him was like dude let's do this before you get out what is this this is from a promo for the wrestling event this week because he's in the Royal Rumble at the end of the month right does this new him was just like current him do you think or well that's crown him he ain't passing any tests you know it's just a couple Pecos bros relax okay the size he's a freak though you know well he's definitely a freak but is he physically the saint like look up Brock Lesnar lean just trying to find a new page but you ever seen a picture of him in high school gives jacked huge yeah he had a giant that actually giant dude yeah ultra large size a can of paint for a head he's so busy tank he looks like every bully of all time in high school he's actually a nice guy yeah like there he looks pretty lean that's old dude you ever hear about the story Pat Bayers Thomas he used to train with Brock good god that's a freak when rock they were there in between camp and Brock had his daughter in his hand and people saw him and went to grab him take pictures and he's holding his daughter and they grabbed the hand he's holing his daughter and he just went off on this dude he's like the nicest guy ever Brock's always great but I guess this family oh my god Brock Lesnar and he's like yeah I'm with my kids man don't bother me and some dude it was like knowledge to get a picture and grabs and they sold his daughter and just went he just was like what the fuck are you doing man grabbed his arm while I was holding his daughter this guy water that's all yeah yeah grab music what the fuck dude I get my daughter here man and I'm Brock Lesnar you want to twist your head off people want what they want and they don't care yeah I just don't see him fighting again I'm be happy if I was wrong I think definitely wants to get back in there again I mean I think he has some some fights in his mind that he would like to get back I think you mean I think Cain 95% of the division - he's a freak man yeah he is a freak kid you know picograms know pika great he's a fucking freak dude he crams that's just my reference for fucking steroids now a Piko Piko so hot right he's such a freak he is do you want some skeptical hippo eyes for your boy Nowitzki how about the test results for Lesnar showed up then went away on their website and they're like oh it's just a just a random mistake it's just a glitch that $50,000 took care of how funny is that I wonder what happened what do you think happened I don't know I love me I do not know there's some sort of shadiness there I think so oh come on man if you think you saw this end I'll bill you goddamn ansata says technical issues caused online blocked Brock Lesnar drug test number discrepancy here's my prom Joe here's my prom with this so let's just assume Brock I don't know has yet a needle in his ass maybe maybe I'm not I don't know you've never done it 100% I would guess well he tested positive in Mark Hunt fight correct and Mark soon for that so so he is not suing him mark soon the UFC stealing he's still legal actually with interest yeah and it sees his contracts up with UFC so it could probably get even gnarlier now so good luck two more cut but so Brock Lesnar we know steroid user his test what just doesn't show up man that's random but what that's coincidence right John Jones greatest fighter of all time you saw the issues picograms that's just a coincidence it's too much of a coincidence for me okay but wait a minute the John Jones you saw the thing they tested him positive correct like what are you saying I bow by the way did test negative after the fight even for the metabolites so heat for the picograms afterwards there's no people against you're saying picograms picograms a unit of measurement correct what he tested positive for there were no peacock light for this this dis ter ID which and after the fight there was nothing correct right okay because the numbers that what they're saying is that what he what his body has in it is a response to this terror it's neither detecting like anavar in his system what they're detecting is it's a metabolite corrector detecting is the body responding to the fact that this steroid had been in his system previously yes but they just coincidence yeah it's not that it's a coin you keep saying it like it's a joke because it the situation to me is it a look at okay why don't you tell me why it's a joke this is why it's a joke because have you ever heard of any and before I say all this Jones is I think whether he did anything or not he's still the greatest fire on the planet he doesn't need this stuff the reason to me because it's a joke is because the greatest fighter on the planet to ever enter the Octagon has all these issues there's too much of a coincidence to me okay he has plenty of issues outside of that when you say all these issues you mean steroid ish correct right now first one being that don't mean to cut you off but the first one being the excuse of the dick pills okay but but it was like they actually got the dick pills they tested them this is all documented is it because well those data analytic pills gel they found what they found were the precursors that can be found in dick pills so if it's clenbuterol and what do you mean to be talking about so so the the thing that he flagged for those do show up in dick pills yes they also show up in a lot of other things right but he got them the dick pills that he took and they had it in them correct so that means he so that unclear but the image isn't in the amount that he had in his system what they're saying is the only way that could exist is through a tainted supplement the way they tested them before the way they tested them after the what the small window of time where he was positive for that thing there'd be no performance enhancing benefit for him to take something in a micro dose or whatever and that it's in such a small amount that it had to be a tainted supplement they got them the actual supplement that he took the the DIC pill supplement it had it in it that contained that second he got punished for that this is not like a steroid that he took where it made him a better fighter or made him a better athlete so to play devil's advocate here so that that stuff that comes in those dick pills you can get from other steroids but it happens to be in those dick pills you certainly can yes but but there's one narrative that you that took clear that you could say what's in these dick pills I'm not saying I'm can do that that's true but it's in such a small amount in his body and it wasn't in his body before and it wasn't in his body after which showed that it was only in his body and extremely small amounts for a small window ultra amount yeah but a small window of time so it's not like he had it's not even like this stuff which is a metabolite which is showing a response to the body you'd be the body responding to the steroids then let me ask this Joe okay why does no other fighter have any puker picograms that this pulsating effect really well that's not true I mean other tests admit Frank near tested positive for something got two years Tom Lawlor tested but Frank Mir didn't go through the same steps that John Jones did he didn't provide them with I forget what the exact there was there was something that John did also that lowered his sentencing and it was remember he's a foreman yes it was cooperating with you sada yeah or or agreeing to cooperate with you sada yeah that we're just cool with that listen I don't even know that mean I don't either but let me ask you this if I agree to you sada to be an informant till the snitch that stitch is correct but unless you're John there no one can beat you up so you're fine but the thing is is the only way I can inform you is if something that of that I'm knowing that I know of I can't inform you if just off that's circulation that was what I asked Nowitzki I was like if he didn't do anything wrong like and what is he gonna offer cuz if unless he took something unless you know what you're doing like if I'm an informant for the FBI or for the feds for cocaine right I know my cocaine we're not gonna get Joe Blow that makes my fucking expresso get the guy who knows the end amounts of cocaine right that's Jim again that's all my guy cool or they have a conversation with him and he says he can provide them with information well how guys are getting away with passing drugs and how would you know about that unless you're in on that no I don't either again to me all of it is a little too much of coincidence that the best fighter on the planet has these issues the best fighter in the planet Earth also ran away from a hit and run smashed into a girl and broke her arm he also drove his car into a tree he's a reckless person who takes a lot of chances and he does some at least in the past has done some things that are not very wise this could social under that or it could fall is correct or stop again it's late Dale is out I'm like using them of anything play devil's advocate or a guy who is that loosey-goosey outside gun might have taken some performance-enhancing things because that would be the similar traits look could have except in this situation it doesn't line up with the facts of what he took in terms of long term metabolites short term metabolites and medium term metabolites the only the only law only long term metabolites existed which means that whatever he took he had to have taken a long time ago now the problem with this is this all comes from that guy Gregory rich Anka as I say his name you're talking about the one test the what I'm talking about is the study that shows these metabolites is all from this one individual this guy Gregory were chenkov who was the man from that documentary Icarus he used to work for the Russian doping the state-sponsored doping program he's the one who established these tests and the way he established these tests is very highly criticized by people because well it's not suspect it's but it's criticized by people because he injected himself and and tested all these metabolites on himself and this has not been done on any peer-reviewed test outside of his research it hasn't been duplicated the problem is it's not legal to perform these sort of tests on people in America you can't just shoot people up with illegal steroids in America and find out what it does to them and so they don't know do that they should I told them to get Sean Shelby whack them up with a bunch of steroids just shot support Sean's down for he wants to get bigger just do it or just do it to Vitor Belfort wherever he's fighting just said oh yeah tell him look Vitor we got an extra couple hundred grand for you on the side just do this and let us do some fuck up with dick pills see how it goes bro fucking cocaine tainted creatine forever you would do it yeah I don't know man I'm I maintain an open mind I do too I'm not accusing John to anything but again for me and this is just me it's too much of a coincidence for it to raise some red flags for me go I try to to independent scientists outside of Nowitzki where I was sending guys information they were sending me back or sending them all the work that they did I send them all the relevant studies and one of them who was suspicious initially after reviewing all the stuff decided it doesn't seem like it's likely that it could be possible that he could have actually cheated he said it's more like he did during that time more likely that the actual the tainted supplement excuse is and by the way the team tainted supplement I'm using the air-quote supplement was never provided that supplement was never provided so unless they did it to you Saudi he sada didn't want to release it the number one question was was it cocaine that was tainted with creatine that was that that was where people thought it came from yeah because it's really calm according to Nowitzki when he was working for the government that would be a really common thing that creatine was used in cocaine to cut it because it looks like coke it cuts with coke it's normal it's not toxic so they would always mix in cheap creatine with cocaine to make more coke make sense yeah it makes sense and he that's what that's what Nowitzki believed but that's not what he believed but he believed that was a poss ability I've heard all sorts of possibilities yeah it'd be answer to know the actual truth yeah well you know we're not gonna know that I think we know as much as we're gonna know unless John comes out was John retires and like you know I had I had a doctor and he would stick it in my fingernails and see him slowly release you know some high advanced microdose he would never admit that though nobody ever admitted wrote it unless they get caught it tarnish your legacy unless it's like an MLB thing but so many people were quick to jump on the he's a cheater bandwagon I'm like man you got you gotta be careful of God careful with that yeah be careful that but also you got to be careful with that but also you should be suspicious you should be suspicious I don't think that if when you sada Nowitzki go it's all good man it was the dick peel you go cool man I don't I don't think you can do that well they definitely didn't do that he lost a lot I'm saying that's what the fans do that's what the phone you know some people can do that I think it's okay to go Ghana it's just I don't know man like it's too much smoke here for me it's okay to do that what it's not okay to do is to say he was cheating he's but you know he's busted why do you have the stuff in his system it's fine to say why is you have the stuff in the system well that's what I said right but they showed why you had an in system yeah but doesn't mean you should have it in your system no you definitely she's not cool - assists - no no so it's okay to go why the fuck is in the best fighter in the world system what are you doing dude that's fine sit there's some shit that's going on right now that they haven't figured out yet that's going to be revealed yeah I think so the the the the drugs and those in that underworld is always ahead of the of the testing oh he's always always that's what Nowitzki said at first but now he thinks it's reached this point where the testing is so good do you know the testing threshold that he tested positive for for the picograms is five two to five thousand times stronger than the water threshold yeah so we here to have 2,000 to 5,000 times more of it in his system or two thousand to five thousand two thousand percent numbers are tough to keep up with I don't remember Andy Foster told me what it was either way but an insane amount of much higher quantities this shit for him to test positive in water like these these tests that they use now are insane so where the doctors will in the Underground's know this is the thing they're doing well maybe but this is the thing they're doing now well the thing is like if it's so low you're not gonna have a performance enhancing benefit it has to actually be in your system in order to have a performance enhancing benefit but now in 2019 they're actually considering lowering their standards so that say if you do take some creatine and does have the tiniest trace amount of Austrian or something like that that's not going to show up positive any which is how maybe they should do it because it's so strict now we're right it's tainting guys legacy you look at Josh Barnett you look at Frank Mir you know that's another one where they eventually cleared him but Jesus Christ took a year fucked up man and then on top of that everybody knew that he was under suspicion and josh has tested positive for four so everybody assumed that he was doing something but though novitskiy told me that the stuff the testing is so good now that if you and I were in this room and I had a jar of creatine that had steroids in it and I popped it open and the fucking dust got in the air and we ingested that dust we would both test positive from opening a jar in a room and that's crazy good for them but I think there's a Elon Musk of steroid peds out there who's like yeah cool man you guys are testing for this we're over here you dumbass daddy's got a lot of Y's and Z's in his name yeah geez yeah yeah it's just fuck it was like a glasshouse hell yeah probably dead as we're speaking they probe shot him and sleep now yeah I mean they think did you see a Chris did you see insane men I know the lengths people go to well the whole Russian anti-doping program was horseshit they were just doping people state-sponsored doping and that the fact that they had rigged the Sochi Olympics so that they got fake pissed do you and you think that the only country doing that China did it for sure they say we did in the Beijing China's like they were taking gold gold medals and I think it's funny how people like this is ridiculous how could Russia doing like everyone even with John like I don't I don't let's say John did do some illegal shit that we don't know if and he got away I don't give a fuck dude I really don't I think a lot of guys are doing things I did I think it's part of every professional sport NFL NBA NHL especially fighting it's just that's the nature of the beast well it's certainly a nature I mean it's definitely comes with a territory it's definitely part sports because it works you know what's interesting is like why is it ok to take regular creatine regular creatine works probably as good as micro Durst dosing any of the bullshit won't be surprised but yeah yeah III think there's some micro dosing shit out there that the NFL guys can get their hands on our MLB that you like goddamn well they say that micro dosing actual testosterone is more effective because micro dosing actual testosterone doesn't produce any random weird metabolites yeah and that's what a rod was doing here like your gummy bears we're right before he'd bat he's like pop this gummy bear in this bag hold on and then by the time Testament for the game he's good that's so crazy so crit and then how much did they take away from him after that oh my god man his the whole legacy was tarnished yeah were you with me in Vegas time we at strip steak house and or a rod was there and he was like to smoke shows and no one like he was like really that fucking guy were you there with me oh no I forget everyone that tables like fuck that game like why he's awesome like do all the steroids something yeah play baseball everyone's on steroids you hate him because of that that's a funny thing though that you're a cheater thing like that was the thing with Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hate to tell you the guys pitching the ball to them also juice to the gills if fuck with Sammy Sosa so much he turned himself into a white guy and went fuck this noise I'm going white going super white went ultra camouflage yeah not working cuz he sticks out even morning well he's still doing interviews and she just never saw what is going on no he does interviews but just assumes like it's all good yeah he's like dressing up like the plan any sense man and then when someone brings it up he's like what what do you mean what's wrong with my skin I just use a lotion P were like would your white bro like what about it yeah I like to look like this like no I know but what the fuck are you doing he's like leeching yourself with just straight-up lotion do you think he has spots on his back that he can't reach no I bet his girls she's like dude we can't have these fucking spots like your goddamned animation back of his dude how about his dick there's no way all his dick wrinkles aren't black hmm like you're not gonna get all that probably looks like like I'll jerk off with the the whitening do you have to to get all the nooks and crannies that you give the taint do you get your asshole bleached good match if you have a black hole for an asshole how is his spots all over something to think about row it's just oh wow look how wide he is you don't look bad there but it looks like he's wearing makeup good he looks like a goddamn Dick Tracy character it looks weird because you know what like the the inside of his eyelids like that's dark see I'm saying because you can't really get the whitening cream dude he looks like a goddamn vampire you can't get the whitening cream to your well if he was a regular guy and that's what he looked like that'd be normal I mean that's like Joey Diaz his skin color but it's like you get to his eyeliner go to his eyeballs make that larger like look around his eye is dark and if they're loves oh that's weird the earlobes are freaking me out yeah and the inside of his nostrils oh yeah you can't look at nuns darkness it's a nightmare well he's strange but he digs it I guess how abouts happy how about how hard were we howling at Joey Diaz story the other night at the comedy store my god I'm telling you fucked up my rib that's what he used to look like he was a Parker oh yeah black cube dude he held court last night - same spot oh my god she told the story about him taking a shit I sent me a picture of his shit me too the next morning woke up he sent us pictures of shit you guys check out who knew stick he's thought about how he how he's eating this isn't a bit right he's not he's eating sauerkraut and farting on the plane and Lauryn Hill was like what the fuck man dude I was sweating I'm telling you that's why I woke up I'm like did I get punched in the ribs like no no fucking I texted her I'm like dude your story fuck my ribs up last night yeah I had a runaway I was about to go on stage I had a run away from him before because I wouldn't have been able to think about my material what's he talking about I was laughing so hard he's the goat we gotta wrap this on I bet you get the fuck out yet the FBI guys CIA CIA yeah a little different than me huh maybe talk to him about fucking peacocks see what he says I'm all about pecos right now I don't know why I can't it's just in my head well it's it's a fun thing to run with the bits he's like Jesus Christ show shut the phone Saturday night San Diego you'd be surprised I know Brandon buy the fucking shop special that's right I'm running my one hour at flappers in Burbank the night before on
