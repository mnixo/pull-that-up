hello freak bitches can you keep it real can you keep it 100 look at that lady ho what is she doing is she doing the dab or she's a putana yeah are you sure she's dab it or she just doing Taichi in the park no it definitely says it on her shirt I'm assured that she doesn't know she's wearing didn't realize I can't read no fifty thousand years old I just I keep pounding how we think it's so funny when old people talk as if they were ever young and fucking like as if they've never had sex oh right like that lady probably at one point in time was a dick connoisseur know she's out there in the park not knowing what the fuck she's wearing yes so we had dick connoisseur in the park that's probably the best place probably to be sampling dick probably hard to get a good one though at that age this is probably real tough cause it's all about enthusiasm I feel like dudes are pretty down with old ladies like old dudes oh yeah well that's an issue a friend of mine come on one of his buddies worked at a old folks home and said that one of the big issues was these old guys would get viagra yeah and these old ladies they didn't give a fuck and a lot of them are on antidepressants so they're like lalala who gives a shit like they're on xanax and getting STDs well I don't know was that that's something that I heard about like it's rampant because that's happening that's probably really bad when you're old right oh my god like your body doesn't feel so good no I mean if you US when you're fucking 98 well herpes is like an attack on your immune system there goes the new erotic frontier sex in nursing homes until recently nursing homes frowned on sex now increasingly they smile oh well it makes sense why why shouldn't he have fun look at this when Aubrey Davidson age 85 met a special guy at the Hebrew home in Riverdale in the Bronx New York they did more than sit next to each other in the dining room then he invited her to his room they hung a Do Not Disturb sign on the door and at breakfast the next morning they both sported broad smile terrible writing like like a fourth but also calling it what is the top say the you see the new erotic frontier you're like ooh and it's like sexing nursing-homes you like oh there goes the boner well it sounded so hot yeah that's not it's not exciting for me but there's a whole category on youporn now that so yeah old people they do some people do like watching old people fuck you know when I watched the other day I'm not proud of it but I will admit to you I watched an old thing my special force I watched an old porn stars still exercise this topic at the time of life when many elderly feel cold sleeping as a pair provides warmth okay that's cute look at this though go back to that relationships make people happier and the happiness reduces stress and irritability and improves mood appetite sleep sociability and immune function so do plants read that first so how dare you I read the first sentence is the Hebrew home that first one at the bottom the Hebrew home does more than tolerate resident Nicky who wrote this the faculty hope probably someone who works at the Hebrew home it's propaganda the faculty holds regular happy hours dances and even organized a dating service for residents G date G for grandparents right I like it I didn't mean to force you into bringing up that subject again well the other problem with the second season of Fear Factor and I could say this now because it didn't happen is I was worried we're gonna kill somebody I was really worried it's a it seemed too dangerous like they were ramping up the stunts and they were making things like way more spectacular and you're just taking bigger chances and there was a lot of downtime in between stunts there's a lot of preparation there was a lot of like checks and balances and they they really wanted to make sure that everything was tested and double tested and they really mapped it out well but it was still there were some hair-raising things he's fucking people had to do maybe fear was too far maybe it should have been like mildly uncomfortable factor where you put people like in mildly uncomfortable situations like hey I want you to go over and talk to that woman she seems kind of attractive I mean and so it's kind of a melding uncomfortable and they you know no one's gonna die no one's gonna leave mind if she kills you there there's um they're doing a new one with Ludacris it's kind of that way there's a new Fear Factor and Ludacris the rapper yeah host all right and like some of the fears like forgetting your cell phone somewhere like for like right isn't it something stupid like that and they don't have to eat anything gross which was this is really dumped and keep that out because that was one of the most popular parts of the original series that was gigantic like the eating gross shit part that's huge I I have to be honest with you that was the eye I couldn't watch that that was the hard part for I don't I hear ya you know it was hard for me to watch somebody do something because I wouldn't eat it or drink it and I don't want to watch somebody else do that but yeah I'm with you I mean I wouldn't have want well that's not true I watched somebody sent me a clip of steve-o with a gas mask on and I tweeted it some guy farting into a tube and it goes right in the steve-o face and he threw up into the mask and I laughed so hard that i retweeted it and I ascended to me is actually quite rude of him but it was in response to iliza shlesinger as appearance yesterday podcast look at this look this guy's getting a fart into this tube and that the tube goes right into steve-o's face look at this he farts and steve-o blah I liked it I almost threw up right there I almost threw up I'd like to bring like revive from the dead like Edgar Allan Poe or Mark Twain and put him in a time machine and bring him to now and go all the stuff you did was something really cool check out what we're doing now show them that video well they do video back then cell phone camera all this Raven stuff nobody's buying these these black bird poems does anybody have like a gas mask yeah a fat guy and the radio program director came into my town knew and you know if you've ever been in radio when they come into town new the first thing they're gonna do is change everything is they got to put their own stamp on it or why are they there so this guy comes in and he goes we're gonna rebrand you he goes I want everyone to think of your name and instantly think of the brand and I'm already you know brand yeah okay so here's what he said so I hate to say this because this will become a meme online that I have to live with the rest of my but it's an absolutely true story so the guy says to me he goes listen I imagine a billboard that says Dan Carlin he fucks chickens and I said excuse me he goes yeah I mean so that anytime anybody thought of you they would think okay he's the chicken fucker and I'm going what really he really said that yes and I said I've said to him I said I said two things dude I said the first thing is I gotta live in this town right so really you want that to be the first thing people think okay the second thing is I gotta have a career after this stupid idea of yours fails right no you don't understand we're building a mental image you you'll be a household name I said yes I'll be the household name the guy who fucks chickens I said fine you know he was after that I said dude do you want to step outside right now I don't mean my wife laughed at me because I'm already an old man when I'm that would have been great I said no this this guy was as old as I was but I mean I was so incensed and so angry that this guy would would be so cavalier with your future well yeah and as a human being family I mean my fucker how are they gonna spell fucker on billboards you know what that's a really good it might have had as euphemisms yes but I mean you think about that you think okay as you said this guy's career depends on him making a difference I'm just a tool in his career Yeah right so you start to realize that when you did the podcast and it's your podcast the person that you're worried about here is you and not just that the ideas that are coming from you are not just yours alone but you own them right so so when I say something that's stupid I own that it's not like some station said listen push you know I got a no fight over the OJ Simpson thing when the OJ Simpson trial is going on and everybody it's all you hear anywhere so I didn't talk about it and so they got on me about not talking about it I had a big fight and I walked into the studio and I said fine I'll talk about it I said you know the whole topic was isn't there just too much damn OJ Simpson everywhere you go oh they were they were they were at the you know there was a window we were like zoo creatures and they had this window they could bring all the sales clients to watch us perform and I'm doing there and there's like five executives in the window just waiting til the next commercial break because we're gonna be we're gonna go but I mean that's why radio was so awful for me and I didn't get fired I must have done a good enough job to stay employed but it was go home and pull your hair [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
