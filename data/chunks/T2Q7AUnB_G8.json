hello freak bitches this is a quote from Ray Kurzweil which is things aren't getting worse our informations getting better right and so with Hillary Clinton who is a career politician right and we've all known since we were young most people I think when they think about politicians they don't think those are some honest people those politicians they usually are telling the truth I think most of us think politicians they lie they warp things they fabricate things they use a form of deception to gain control of various power structures that's what the animal does so that's not new information when you find out that Hillary Clinton and the DNC and I don't know if they completely connected those two but when you find out that they they they were not they didn't do what they're supposed to do they helped Hillary Clinton become the Democratic nominee and they actively tried to fuck up Bernie Sanders right that's creepy but it's not a new thing I know but it is creating it's creepy and it's even more creepy that the woman who was in charge resigns and then immediately gets hired I got a great job Hillary Clinton's like fuck it I'm gonna hire you and it won't do anything she hires her she's so fucking unafraid of what's gonna happen that she hires the woman who did such shitty things she had to resign booed off stage hires her into her fucking party cuz she's like fuck you I'm getting elected you are not stopping it right but this is again yes it's gangster too though it's good it's also a move in on her part where I mean she's looking at like what Trump is calling her crooked Hillary well yeah it's a gangster move and well you have to hire a woman like that like right in front of you yeah Wasserman Schultz top post mission accomplished at DNC but this is this is not a new this is not a new thing man this is what exactly well let's go over this because what exactly did they do that's so awful about Bernie Sanders what did they do so they apparently came up with a way to disseminate and nation of the press highlighting certain aspects of Bernie Sanders that would be unappealing to the voter and they did this and this has all been confirmed can you can you google that find out what they actually said let's find out what they actually summarized the wiki see if we think they're being a bunch of whiny bitches but for sure they wanted hit look she's got way deeper arms in politics she's way more connected than he is for sure there's and this is what we're seeing - it's like a big part of being a political candidate is how many favors do you have how many people you are you connected to how deep does your influence go right and obviously her influence didn't just sit within her or her own little group of people that were working for it had gotten to the DNC itself so she's she's deeply embedded in this whole system where because of friendships or ideologies or people just wanted her she's the chosen one whatever reason whatever deals were made or whoever who knows who knows what it is but when you find out that an organization that's supposed to be the head it's supposed to be if we if everything was yeah on the up-and-up it chose to be objective and looking for what the people want or has the best party but no they're actually actively steering it which is massively corrupt and kind of scary as if these people are deciding to steer an entire party yeah which is 50% of a political process because there's no look you we've got Libertarian Party for the first time people are taking Gary Johnson seriously yeah do that Town Hall debate on Wednesday or Town Hall one of those Town Hall things on Wednesday on CNN but for the most part it's Democrats and Republicans in most people's eyes so what they're essentially doing is rigging half of that process yeah that's scary we just we don't think anything's wrong with that but we put Martha Stewart in jail for not telling exactly the truth about where she's no no way oh I haven't sold stocks or whatever the fuck she we lied about we do think something's wrong about it but we can't do anything about it we do think something's wrong but right now look okay so if like that institution is corrupt and if the Republican institution is in some ways corrupt I think it might be safe to say and I don't think too many people would be outraged at the idea that there is a institutionalized corruption in the entire American political system and it's very similar to the problem that happens in bike racing if one motherfucker rigs their bike or gets on fucking doping stuff that can't be detected if you want to have a fair advantage you've got a rig your bike and start doping - or the person who rigs their bike will always win so if politics is a competition which it clearly is and if members of the competition are using nefarious means to achieve their goals which they clearly are which they clearly are then that would imply that if you wanted to survive in that system you would also have to use nefarious means this is not new this is old old old shit what's new is technology what's new is now people like Julian Assange are shining a light on the corruption and his whole idea is if I reveal this information it will force reform via the outrage of the people who are supposed to be represented by a person who's breaking the law that's his idea we need reform and right now we're at the point where it's very similar to when you're in a family and this is one of the worst things can fucking happen man in a family if there's somebody who's molesting somebody it happens all the time where a father or a brother will start fucking molesting somebody right but in people in the family know it but they don't do anything about it because to talk about what grandpa does every couple of years means the complete disintegration of the fucking family and apocalypse for the family in the same way as more of these revelations become clear which we always knew but you could always float into a happy place and be like nah I'm just being a conspiracy dude I'm sure the stuff they're doing up on Capitol Hill is all fair and square hey you know you can just believe it kinda you just pretend to believe now it's like well no you're wrong look hey here's the fucking proof and here's going to be more proof and there's going to be more proof and there's going more proof until finally the American people are gonna have to either just be like I'm just gonna believe that four is three and three is four because I have a nice comfortable life and I don't want to fucking deal with this shit man I'm just gonna trust the banks cuz the banks like they like money oh my job and as long as I keep my job I'll keep my benefits yeah and and by the way PS man when you consider that it's like there's something pragmatic about that as sad as it is there's as as depressing it as it is but they're the real awful problem is that this country I think is like a metaphysical machine that was built by some very intelligent people who understood the energy flow that comes through a society and the elections were supposed to be an outlet valve for the pressure that builds up when people feel that they're being repressed right and if you start fucking with that output valve by putting up fake politicians that don't truly represent the people and hope that the people will believe that they have elected these people if you put too shitty choices in front of us and we're supposed to look at that and be like okay everything's fine then you're you're missing the point which is that there is an energetic system that needs to get released it you know at some point the Energy's got to go out if it doesn't go out you get revolution that's the way the energy goes out the wrong way the ideas let's fucking the American Revolution brutal bloody awful fucked these geniuses many of them Freemasons got together and they were like you know what is there a way that we can program history so that a society doesn't destroy itself intermittently with a fucking revolution because if we could do that we'll build one of the most powerful never-ending societies on earth because we figured out a way to outflow the pressure that builds up so when you start fucking with a goddamn political system and pretend that everything's going to be okay you are missing I think the the point which is that people who are very smart maybe a lot smarter than the politicians we have today recognize something built a thing and said let's just trust the fucking people let's trust the people release the steam and voila everything runs according to plan now the gears are a little fucking gummed up man a little yeah a little how gummed oh how come dad I think the gears are really crazy gummed up I think this is the first time we're realizing how much money people make by running for president how much you know money cost to run here president but how much money top political figures make in donations and in speeches yeah have you have you paid attention to how much they make in speeches like Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton you may make ribes well this is what it is these corporations can fund various universities they can donate money to all sorts of different programs where they would have someone speak and they can decide who gets to speak and who doesn't get to speak and they also have like the Clinton Foundation people donate money into that they don't donate just fuck loads of now it's all all these things but hold on success all these things with what they are essentially or you're paying someone to speak for an hour and you're gonna give them $750,000 and you want me to pretend that that's normal that's crazy and what does this person do they're a public servant okay okay so they're public servant and while they're publicly serving they're also making seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars to talk yeah that seems a little crazy doesn't it like why do they make so much money to do that and who was paying them and what what what do you have to benefit by having them come and read some nonsense bullshit boring speech a friend might want to see Rudy Giuliani after post 9/11 when he was on his victory tour he was on like a lap of the country doing these these speeches cuz everybody loved him he saved the world during you know September 11 he was the guy who stood strong everybody like Wow Rudy Giuliani is a good man so he rode that and he started doing these speeches and he'd come to colleges and a friend of mine went to see him and said it was dogshit then he just it was a boring ass like reading with no passion it was a chichi go in there and say some nonsense about freedom and the American Way and terrorism or whatever the fuck and first responders and just there wasn't anything real it was just it was a performance it was like he was doing a one-man show all across the country for exorbitant sums of money God that'd be fuckin great if he was actually doing a one-man show hundred and fifty three million dollars in Bill and Hillary Clinton speaking fees documented this is just Jamie just pulled this up that data is stunning that's a stunning amount of money and over 15 years it's from 2001 to about now it said still it's more than yeah that's mean it's perfect then because that's ten million dollars a year this is more recent 225,000 that's our standard fee she prefers a private jet and prefers a Gulfstream 450 or larger the memo outlines that Clinton requires travel by private jet you know it'd be fucking close is this like if you are like a mad billionaire could you just get Hillary Clinton to come to your house and like just speak to you for an hour in your living room like this is fascinating hold up but scroll back down there she made 21 million dollars two and one she made twenty one point six million dollars in speeches in just under two years that's amazing that's incredible that's so much money she's like a kind of like crazy animal that you can like lure with money like you can actually if you have enough money you can lure a Hillary Clinton into your house like you just have to lay it out she'll show up like if I put carrots in my backyard I'll probably get a rabbit or two if you have enough money you can get politicians to come and start feeding it you're at mansion quicken when does I become when does it become a bribe okay so should she like say well you can never be it's weird right you couldn't be someone who is in public office and go and also have like a book reading tour where you read from your novel about crime or something like that you'd have to be like no fiction person who's when you're talking you're talking about what you do for work it's part of what you're talking about like nobody's gonna ask Hillary Clinton to come and speak about the history of jazz in the United States all right she's not gonna give speeches on that it's gonna give speeches on politics right right right so okay so why is that okay why can you like have two jobs that means you're having a second job like you're doing your job like you're you're saying the things that you say during your job but somebody else is paying you to why is it ok that why is it okay to do that like that seems like that's like that seems like very problematic right why is it okay for your husband to go talk who was he talk to that ahead of the whoever the prosecutor was it's a district his bill clinton went and had this secret meeting with what's his who was it about what well write it slow oh right right right Lindsay what the hell's her name damn it the point is like you just are open like you know like hiring hiring the the woman who somehow warped the process of getting a Democratic nominee there yeah what's her name Loretta Loretta Lynch yeah doesn't that sound like it's country singers ever yeah that's my yeah Loretta Lynn right that's what it sounds like Loretta Lynch yeah now she met with Bill Clinton meets with the Attorney General on an Arizona tarmac now list by the way flew in on his private plane and said that he it was impromptu whoo laughs fuck fuck impromptu on a private jet yeah hey you know what hey who are we flying over right now wait are we flying over Loretta Lynch oh come on stop down but you get a piece of apple pie she's a good woman we're gonna sit on the porch and drink lemonade talk about our grandson the tarmac nothing I love more than a nice a nice picnic on the tarmac of an airport well this is the other thing that she lied about being dead broke after leaving the White House all right not only dead broke but in debt she said that apparently this is just so not true yeah and now and now it's like to make matters worse it's like you have to it there's this weird idea that's like listen you might not like Hillary fucking Clinton but they're like you better shut the fuck up about her because do you want Trump to be President daddies what's going on right yeah so good it's good it says here this is what's this is where it's confusing it says when Hillary filed a financial disclosure document after entering the Senate in 2001 she reported assets of less than 1.8 million in liabilities of more than 2 million well where were they do what were they doing all the money we spend money on there's weight like who the fuck okay who has like two million dollars in assets and in two million dollars in debt do you have two million dollars in debt no most people don't have two million dollars in debt that's that's a crazy amount of money like did you guys have a budget you're dead broke now you guys are crazy like witty partying you guys do a blow and buying Ferraris just stay it on Amazon waiting fuck who the fuck gets two million dollars in the hole like that that is like if you wanted to have someone that you wanted to balance the budget wouldn't you pick the person that doesn't get two million in the hole I mean man it's right jumps been bankrupting at times too right as he didn't bankrupt a few yeah that's what they say he says he likes going bankrupt it's somehow part of some plan but now the question what about the shit about Saudi Arabia what is this you don't remember this I remember when it was like Saturday I was making jokes about them stealing like like silverware and fine china and stuff from that when they were like leaving like on their way what year was this was like to in from 2000 like when they were literally living in the bushes were coming in oh my god taking all sorts of extra artwork and all kinds of things and I don't know if it's true but it's it's I don't think the meme has gone away I don't know man oh that's hilarious I don't know she's so gangster part of me look the I kind of appreciate it in a way she's like our Putin yeah great great just what we need are you part of the appreciate some gangster she is
