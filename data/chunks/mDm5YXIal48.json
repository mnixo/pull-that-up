five four three two hello Billy we're live yo Jeff what's going on buddy hey to him I watched a new documentary this morning in the gym loved it it was fucking great it's crazy I love your use of little kids I don't to give away too much of it but it's about the steroid scandal involving baseball and Alex Rodriguez but what was the choice to use little kids to play a rod and all the other key principles involved in the scandal like to play we use little actors what kids oh come on fella you're just you're just high did I was pretty sober the gym yeah so you now know the stories you've seen the doc and if people remember the biogenesis steroid scandal if not the movie I think recaps it pretty pretty well the thing that struck me is it like all these guys acted like children they really did yeah and and to boot so you know we've done some some sports talks in the past we did you know some of the ESPN 30 for 30s like the you and when you do a sports talk I mean I don't want to say it's it's easy because it's you know making documentaries is a challenge but sports talks were pretty like paint-by-numbers it's like you interview some players you interview some coaches some journalists they mention a bunch of games and you show a bunch of game footage you know like it's a pretty straightforward process uh with this one it's not about baseball it's baseball and Jason I guess Mike it's about shit that went down in nightclubs in shady clinics with fake doctors hotel rooms bars locker rooms so you got a bunch of guy talking heads in your documentary but then yet you got nothing to cut - you got no b-roll so I'm like we're gonna need to shoot REE crease you know recreations here which is which is to me I don't know it's like when you're doing nonfiction filmmaking it's fake shit we need if when you film recreations so it's like I'm like how do we do this in a creative way that that's consistent with the tone of the movie which was always called screwball meaning it was always like a farce you know like a Carl Hiaasen or Elmore Leonard Cohen brothers as sort of Florida fuckery farce and so we just wanted to keep in that in that mode so I'm watching the characters so we got Tony Bosch who is the fake doctor and Porter Fisher who was the whistleblower who stole the medical records and and started this whole thing they were then stolen from him and then sold to not the highest bidder but any bitter and every bitter they were sold to and they're talking and I'm noticing that they had like a very similar storytelling style like for example guile be like so I walk into his office and I say I want my money and he says I don't have your money and I said well you better get my money and he said what are you gonna do about it and I said I'm gonna break your neck and I'm like oh shit they they're so vivid and in the moment and and and talking dialogue so we could drunk history this right we could we could edit together the doc and then have the actors lip-synching the actual interview dialogue and all the actors will be eight years old I don't know like I've always wanted to do it like way back Spike Jonze 1997 biggie video sky's the limit biggie had just been murdered he was faced with this challenge of producing a posthumous video and so Spike Jones was like okay we'll just do a straight-up classic Bad Boy Records circa 97 music video cars Versace wardrobe girls mansion hot tub but they'll all be eight years old you got baby biggie really puffy baby baby Busta Rhymes basically yeah it's brilliant and it sounds like what a great divide that was always kicking around since since 97 and then I saw this off-broadway musical about ten tennis years ago called a very merry honor let me try that one more time a very merry unauthorized children's Scientology pageant I don't ask me to say it again I can't say it again so it's just it's just wild musical like very Bowie esque score written by a couple Yale E's like it's like it's a it's a Christmas pageant performed by elementary school kids but instead of the story of Jesus it's the story of l ron Hubbard all with like in like a school play with like you know paper mache like sets and and and construction paper costumes and props and I wanted to I got together with one of the composers I said listen I'd like to get the rights to your musical and make a Scientology documentary using the kids and the musical as a framing device because in those days no one was making now everybody make Scientology documentaries in those days nobody was doing it particularly because like the church is so litigious and so they had kind of left this musical alone so I thought like that might be a cool buffer like maybe if I make a documentary that's a little light you know and it's like this children's musical but we intercut it with real a real documentary investigation interviews and um that maybe will kind of get away with it nobody wanted to make nobody I mean doors are closing before I even knocked out like got to them and I kind of filed again filed that idea way in the back of my head and then a couple years ago there was that funny viral video of like it was like a Scarface school play I don't know if it was like a bunch of little kids doing Scarface is like an elementary school play mm-hmm and I was like this is such a it's such a great device and the problem is you need to find something that it works for like like cocaine Cal babies would not have been appropriate right for example of us eight-year-old kids running around it's not Bugsy Malone you know so it's just like it's just like how the stars align we just like I was like this is this is gonna work here I think it works it works great it's such a crazy story in the fact well I don't want to give too much of it away cuz I really want people to watch it because I mean I've talked about cocaine Cowboys probably a hundred times in this podcast it's one of my all-time favorite projects Cuse me all-time favourite documentaries but this is this is a story that almost writes itself it's so bonkers the and the fact that it all could have been avoided if one guy just paid another guy or just didn't try to rip him off I like four grand yeah like nothing doesn't make any sense it's fucking crazy and the guy what a bizarro personality he was would just tan everyday and hang out at this doctor's office in the waiting room telling everybody how great it was like the whole thing is so strange like that's everybody remembers it is like the a rod or a roid scandal you know and the truth of the matter is that Alex Rodriguez was collateral damage yes in this whole thing yeah it was not about him don't tell Alex that but it's not about him you know it's it it was really the highest the career of the highest-paid baseball player of all time effectively ended over a four thousand dollar debt between this cocaine-addicted fake doctor and his faked an addicted steroid patient and it's like that's why I said it's like a Florida fuckery story straight up it's just like this is classic only in Miami absurd farce and that's what you specialize in this specialize in Florida fuckery I go to your Twitter feed all the time for current Florida fucker it's just it's yeah it's distilled it's just like it's pure Florida fuckery yeah it's just it's and that's what this story is to me it's like Miami is just well I say the great thing about Miami is it's so close to the United States but like it's it's also like it's America's Casablanca mm-hmm like just people kind of flee to Miami from like all over the country and all over the world usually leaving some kind of criminality in their wake yeah and you know come here and kind of there and reinvent themselves you know like it's just and then you have all of these criminals there who then kind of baking in the Sun you know in this kind of multicultural fucking Paia you know that we have and then they just like and then they start putting their their minds together and brainstorming and they hatch just the most inane schemes and scams like that's our primary export from Miami is just schemes and scams well it's just so amazing that it's still a cocaine culture - after all these years it still has a giant cocaine engine pumping out all this chaos we don't have any indigenous industry I mean there's no factory where everybody goes to work and then 30 years later gets a watch there's no there's no business there it's Carl Hiaasen says all we produce in Florida is oranges and machine guns no we don't make anything that we sell the dream we sell the sunshine you know it's lies that came true yeah you know and so and even more frightening is the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow so it's like there's a lot of lessons to be gleaned from down there but it's basically at this point of money a real estate hustle and a money-laundering capital so it's really no different than it ever was everybody likes to tell me how it's changed it's grown I'm like just because you've built a bunch of shit doesn't mean we've grown right and Miami is just like Miami is one of the youngest cities in the country in your parlance Oh it'd be about one person old or one and a half people ago like one and a half people ago you know we're one of the youngest cities barely a hundred just over a hundred you know correct me if I'm wrong because I've said this before but isn't there more banks per capita in Miami than anywhere else well certainly there certainly was before the you know the the the Great Recession when a lot of them started shutting down but most of them have rebounded one of the cleverer things some of the real estate developers did was they opened their own bank literally their own bank they had a bank where the entire board of the bank were all real estate developers and over 90% of the loans the bank made was insider loans just on the board and then of course they went belly-up in the Great Recession and what happened we bailed him out so it was all their own so yeah it's great held out real estate salesman real estate who loaned themselves money that is round up being backed ultimately by us by the taxpayer yeah I mean that's the old remember they I mean you hear that line all the time now that like you know the people used to rob the bank from the outside in now it's yeah now it's from the inside out but no none could be truer than that story and that's a Miami story and when the Great Recession happened the FDIC had to open an office in Florida because we had more bank closures than any other state in the Union because we were like you could go down there I mean you could buy a fucking mortgage for your dog at a drive-through in Miami in the in like the the late 90s early oz and I remember interviewing a guy we were doing working on a project called Ponzi state about the state of Florida as like a case study in the Great Recession years ago we never finished it unfortunately but we're interviewing this guy and he says um you know we were this is pre like big short like this before anybody sort of knew a lot about this and he said we were down here in Miami setting fires and Wall Street was trying to read our smoke signals that's why I say like the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow sure it is so every time I go there I always go I forgot how fucking crazy this place is if you really should have to have a passport it's I love it I really do love it it's a crazy place to do stand-up you know I did this joke because I was doing a Netflix special and I was doing it a couple months after I did this gig in Miami and so I was using those Yonder bags you know what those are where people have to put their cell phone and yes this magnetic bag you keep the phone but you hold the phone in the book if you want to use it you just have to step outside they open up the bag and they give your phone in every other city it made for a better show because people just sat down and watch the show in Miami it made for literally 40 percent of the crowd at any given time was getting up and going to the back and using their phone and coming back in they were just constantly moving around and presume it was to use their phone they might be a bit powdering their nose they might have been but it was they you know that was because I had done gigs before that where they didn't have the Yonder bags and this wasn't the problem but in Miami just everybody needed to use their phones they just kept getting up and coming back and it was just chaos well it's also a selfish town like it's it's a basically a town a town of assholes I mean really and and so like I always say the I mean it reflects in everything that we do in the way that we behave certainly in the way that we drive like Believe It or Not like people are so much more chill and calm here in traffic in LA I swear to God and LA was famous for like road rage like yeah la like created invented road rage but like Miami it's such a crazy angry weird place because it's like when push comes to shove we're in Miami chill the fuck out like it's all good it's a beautiful place like and it's a shared experience the traffic sucks for all of us just chill out and use your turn signal for crying out loud and just but that's why they I say that's why they call it Miami sorry you're a me it's my fucking a me and stay out of my fucking a me it's just I don't seem to love it you seem to thrive yeah I can't really function anywhere else doesn't make any sense it's and it's so frustrating too I was you know I'm I'm a native Floridian and a lifelong Miami and I for a while I was I was pretty determined to like leave behind a better Florida than the one I was so inexorably connected to cocaine one of my best friend Steve Graham was an ophthalmologist he did his residency in Miami so he did his residency in emergency rooms in Miami and he was there in the 80s during like the height basically during when cocaine Cowboys takes place and he saw everything just he mean he had all these pictures of bullet holes and skull fragments and people with light bulbs stuffed up their asses and just he said every day was just fucking chaos we know Miami idea everywhere else the light bulb goes off over your head in Miami we shove it right up our asses he said they had to pull a light bulb out of a guy's ass in one of those ones that look like a Christmas tree those curly ones this guy stuck a light bulb up his ass and it broke in his ass at least he was concerned about the environment that's like one of those environmentally like sound like no environmentally sound like yeah they were just thicker glass I felt like he could get it in his ass better like though that was the era to cut your teeth if you were a cop or a lawyer or a journalist or an ER doctor I remember talking to any ER doctor once he tells me a story 1980 shortly after the Mariel boatlift started which I think everybody's kind of pop-culture frame of reference for the Mariel boatlift is Scarface Tony Montana was a Mario Leto that's at the beginning of the movie when you know Castro is ranting and raving that he's flushing the toilets of Cuba on to the United States specifically to Miami and so he was working at the the trauma center at Jackson Memorial hour emergency room in Miami and he said he got a Mariel refugee these guys would stand on the beach they would it looked like Havana in South Beach you know like there's that like coral seawall and it just like it had a really have an of I've so they would go they would chill mostly at these flop houses south of 5th Street in Miami Beach where like the cops would literally just they would be leaving after a stabbing at one of these places and they'd be three blocks away they get a call to go back because now there was a shooting or something else it would be going there like all around the clock and so and they would just get in gunfights like literally would just be like they someone would cheat at dominoes and they would just pull out a gun and one guy would shoot the other guy and so he has a Mariel refugee who comes in to the emergency room with a gunshot wound and he knew Spanish she was bilingual he said to the guy said you're really lucky because if this bullet had hit you know a few centimeters or whatever this way you would have died immediately would have bled out right there on the scene died instantly and guys splits a few days later another Mariel refugee comes in with a gunshot wound in exactly the same spot where he had told the other guy that if he got hit there he would have died could never prove it never was able to trace it back but he was pretty well convinced that it was a revenge shooting the other shooting and the guy knew exactly where to shoot him and kill him because the doctor had told him were to do that but that was like everyday Miami the lady who cuts my hair for Christ's sake she said Billy I was so naive in those days you know you you she dye cut people's hair you know they come over kiss her goodbye and put a tip in her in her pocket you know and she'd go home turn her pockets inside out have our little crumbled bills and everything and one day she finds a little baggie of white powder that's something that one of her clients had slipped into her pocket as a tip and she said to her girlfriend she's what what the hell is this and her friend said oh shit that's worth more than gold that's the best tip you got you got all day that little baggie that was just like the culture and it's and it's I mean it's not that she's that anywhere else I can imagine that in like Nebraska someone tipping you and cocaine people would be like what what do you what the fuck are you doing listen it's just like like I said so Mara is Casablanca there's no place like it it's such a strange place yeah everybody everything is for sale still nothing you know and like I said we are about a person old that's how far back Miami goes I was watching a video about the culture of renting super cars to people so they can pretend that it's their car huge in Miami yeah yeah we got all these Brickell Brickell East a thousand tears you know driving their rented fucking Lambos yeah you know and blowing the engines out on South Beach because they don't know how to drive them just getting towed down the street is just listen it's a fake it till you make it kind of town and there's nothing really to make there you can't really other than a real estate hustle money laundering drugs politics being a crop politician there's really no other way to make it it's not a real industry no not at all there's a lot of professional fighters come out of Miami about that whole area Coconut Grove and a lot of aggression a lot of poverty it's a it's a third-world economy down there the disparity between the haves and the have-nots the income gap is widest and getting wider in miami-dade County than just about any city in the country or any metropolitan area in the country Wow so and that's why I said that Miami of today is the America of tomorrow if you want to know what challenges will face as a nation or calamities will befall us in the years to come you need only look at at Miami tioman called it the canary in the coalmine the bellwether and so you know when the election was playing out the cycle in 2016 I was like you know all my friends are just like this can this Trump thing can happen I was like hang on I was like Florida elected and in fact re-elected rick scott to be governor he is the biggest Medicare fraud stir in the history of the united states everybody knows it everybody's aware of it very well publicized we've weary elected him okay we elected him twice as the top fuckin executive in our state like what makes you think that the United States of America wouldn't do that and I know it's fair to say like you know if you're gonna be the governor of the state you should know a little something about the largest and in the state like you forgive me the governor of Michigan you should have some familiarity with the automobile industry and manufacturing and in Florida if you're gonna be the governor arguably you should know something about our biggest industry which is Medicare fraud basically I mean you could argue that he's the most qualified man for the job oh yeah we got like Medicare fraud as is one of the largest industries has been for decades I mean we have billions and billions of dollars in fraud that just so they run it so you'll go into like Little Havana or Hialeah for example in a municipality and in miami-dade and there'll be a little Lalita sitting behind a desk half-asleep and she'll be surrounded in this tiny little one-room office by little mailboxes you know like peel boxes and a mailman comes in every day and just puts checks in the boxes and they're like in some cases they've stolen Social Security numbers and and you know uh stolen identities basically and some cases they're just old people who aren't aware that their mail is being forwarded to this location and they've just got they I think Miami for a while we had more Medicare payments for HIV and AIDS medication then every other part of the country combined and it's all just old people so it's like you would have to assume that a hundred percent of our elderly population suffered from HIV said HIV we're h-happy posit but he's fucking impossible you had female patients getting penis pumps that were paid for by even know that Medicare covered that I gotta look into that but that was a thing well thanks Obama but if you watch the oxycontin Express CD now but that's all about how they would have the pain management centers and they were connected to the pharmacies you'd go to the doctor hey my back hurts you know what you need this go right next door I need you right all they would prescribe was oxys and sometimes it wasn't even next door sometimes it was like go to that window yeah right next door they say show the doctor your x-ray yeah you have to get your x-ray done somewhere else cuz they weren't doing it so I mean hand the doctor your x-ray he look at it go oh shit it was upside down he wouldn't be like oh yeah oh shit you know what you need go to that window over there and fill this prescription and we had more pill mills they called them in Broward County which is the county just north of miami-dade then we had McDonald's locations and there was literally like the Appalachian Trail they were coming down they were stocking up on oxy and we were fueling a death epidemic like in Kentucky but they were pulling over more cars with Florida plates than in state plates up there because Floridians were like well shit we can't let them have all the action we'll drive up and we'll export the shit and at the peak of the pill mill epidemic the oxy epidemic in Florida seven people a day were dying and women and children and and we subsist from hustle to hustle what you wonder why didn't the government crackdown on that shit why don't I regulate it well first our governor and we did we deal with this in screwball is the biggest Medicare fraud stir in the history of the country so he wasn't exactly shall we say vigilant or interested in cracking down on medical related get away with a magic mark mugga magic I guess I mean he listened he he got he pled the fifth amendment like 75 times in a videotaped deposition that was used in a campaign ad against him and Florida was like we're good we're good with that up and he just listened white rich men kind of walked between the raindrops in this country you know it's just a well sorta they got crafts for getting a handjob that was Florida too it's so stupid it's crazy stupid it's cool we were talking about it like how does he not have a guy who you get him jerked off like there's probably a lot of gals out there that would like to make some money you know you don't have to go to a massage parlor the biggest bummer of it is just now my massage parlors closed down ah that's the problem where do I go now since the property we're broke guys go well the fact that they were filming you - it's so whole thing is so strange and if there was human trafficking going on there what we're cops chilling there for like six months some ongoing investigates like can you save these poor victims yeah but human trafficking has become like this keyword it's like this new sort of like fear-mongering a term to get everybody all up in arms and now they're kind of backtracking on that they're like well maybe it wasn't exactly Oh trafficking maybe it was just some reason why he was a horrible person because he was contributing to these people that were essentially being sold for sex slavery turns out that might have been a bit overblown no pun intended of overblown but of course that's kind of how they have to sell it right otherwise people like why are you wasting all this money on hand jobs no one can why because solving real crime is hard oh and dangerous and dangerous okay so you can go and pick somebody up for marijuana or getting a handjob whatever and you can look like you're you're being proactive yeah but solving a murder that's hard man that's hard work hard dangerous and you know if you go to a weird little asian massage place and guys are coming out smiling like hmm it's uh you can start there yeah you know what about low-hanging fruit really offensive there was a weird law in Hawaii where they were letting cops actually have sex with prostitutes like to prove that they were prostitutes I think nearly half the states in the Union have a law that allow police officers to have sex with people in custody y-yeah really I can't make that how do you make this shit up under say well this consensual because it consensual they're in fucking handcuffs what I mean it's consensual like what that's human trafficking if you ask me I mean well yeah obviously they're gonna try to make deals hey I'll suck your dick if you get me out of here how is that how is that consensual how's that legal it's crazy it's the ultimate I mean you talk about people holding power over people that's cute ultimate coerced consent absolutely yeah I mean that is that is more more than an employer doing that to an employee I mean you're literally dangling their freedom talk about an abuse of power seriously I just look I I have all daughters I'm not I don't want anybody's daughter to be a prostitute but I'm also 100% in favor of people being able do whatever the fuck they want and if someone's in a weird stage in their life where they'd rather jerk guys off than work at Denny's like who's anybody to stop them from doing that the only problem is the social stigma that's attached to it the actual act itself is it's beneficial the person gets something out of it you know I mean there's it's some people have a really hard time getting someone to have sex with them you know it's I don't see it that it's just a crazy thing that we regulate something that I mean George Carlin had a great bit about it that's the only thing where it's illegal to make someone pay for it but it's fine if it's free like it literally doesn't make sense there's nothing wrong with sex but there's something wrong with people paying for it and it's fine if you pay for it and then videotape it from our distribution because then porn yeah I don't really first of all it's a contract between two consenting adults if we if we're talking about small government deregulation let's allow two consenting adults to engage in a contractual relationship yes offer acceptance consideration as with anything else a stigma as you mentioned a lot of that is part and parcel of the prohibition the illegality of it is what brings the seediness it's what brings the danger right the because it's forced underground you you introduce all of these elements that don't have to be there they could take place in clean environments they can take place instead of in the black-market and underground it could take place in a where you can protect all the participants yes involved and it's it but it's been true of liquor it's been true of marijuana it's been true of prostitution which they call for a reason the oldest profession yeah the second we introduced the prohibition it creates a level of danger and a threat to society that wouldn't exist if you're like we'll wait what if you just let me smoke this what if you just let me drink this because I'm an adult making a responsible decision for myself what if you just let me engage in sexual activity with this person who is perfectly willing to do it in exchange for some renew Mireille ssin yeah what the why should anybody give a shit it's so puritanical it's so archaic it's such a dumb proven bad idea I mean it's been proven for decade upon decade oh you go all the way back to the alcohol prohibition to what's going on right now with the cartels I mean what how much would it fix if they made all drugs legal how much would it fix I mean we'd have a real problem in the beginning with access where people there would be so much more access he'd probably you know we you would lose people people would die and high-profile overdose cases and there's no people try to make a deal out of it you don't think today cocaine was legal everywhere that no meth people can get the drugs right but it's not that easy for a person like if you don't know anybody who's a criminal like say if you want to buy meth now I don't know where to buy meth I just I know if you're Walmart's in Florida they make it in the bathroom that you do with that again that is Florida it's it's a different animal but like right now in America I mean I maybe could drum up some meth in a few days if I started asking but uh you know I would not have any idea who's an informant and who's gonna rat me out but I think the stats show in states where marijuana has become legal you don't see significant spikes in usage there's there's some significant spikes and uses but the problem is it correlates to a significant spike in population in the state right a lot of people moved Colorado just because of marijuana they need to become a part of the business and because they just wanted to be free you know and then California we've had medical weed forever and now we have legal legal weed and it's I don't think it's changed much here but you do have there's there's some there's some issues there's there's definitely I mean I don't think it's beneficial in any way to sugarcoat the fact that having legal drugs makes people have more access to those drugs meat means maybe there's gonna be a few people whatever the number is who do those drugs who wouldn't have had access to them without it I but I agree but I think it's de minimis I yeah it's like I think and the number of people could who's gonna turn around go like you know what I want to try it's legal now meth yeah my dentist doesn't recommend it but I feel like I want who the fuck's gonna do that who say that but how many fucking people are on adderall and the only difference yeah the doctors prescribing it's really good shit that's what the president bump said yeah that's what you're saying do you think he does he's always sniffing and he always well here's the I don't think he's on cocaine so no and I always describe to people who don't who don't know what this is like people on cocaine start one sentence and then finish another right but it's like talking someone on cocaine or the president they just but I don't think he's on and but he's always you always hear him with the yeah the step I think he's like bumping a D I don't know I think he's bumping it but I think he's definitely well he might be he's not I mean he's a wild man but he's definitely got accusations from his past about use of and feta means there was there was a journalist that actually detailed the very Duane Reade pharmacy where he used to get this prescription diet medication there air quotes diet medication I just fucking speed and look the guy has an exorbitant amount of energy I mean it's quite impressive for a man in his 70s who eats shit his diet doesn't exercise and he's always ready to go I mean when he was campaigning he didn't seem to ever get tired he would go and do these campaign events and he would always be talking and he'd be full of enthusiasm we're gonna make America great again we're gonna build that wall higher we're gonna tell those Chinese listen buy the fucker like he was I mean it's an incredible amount of energy god bless him it's a 70 some-odd years old it's amazing that you don't have to drug test him it's amazing you can trust a Slayers baseball players gonna say they're the guys we need to and what I mean what is that all is not a performance-enhancing drug a hundred percent talk to journalists how many journalists will be totally honest about it they are fuckin hooked on adderall and they are very productive with it very productive I tried it once it's wild somebody gave me something I didn't try it I just sat there and looked at I draw I don't need that my life I've been scared of coke I've never done coke and I've never done a dural I don't fuck with speed because I can't shut the fuck up already yeah my dad is not for me I need something that calms me down and makes me feel weird I feel like I'd be that guy who like does it the first time and my heart explodes out of my chest you'd be like scraping me off the roof of the show you know if I did I write yeah Jesus I'm worried that I would love it that's what I'm concerned I'm worried I would love it not be like okay from here on out it's all about me which marijuana does the opposite to me marijuana is like I'll be cool together you know I finally tried pot yeah I find violate it what happened I never I never I never tried it before but no I was I was actually um years ago I was in Colorado for twenty backstage at a snoop concert oh geez you have to try it I didn't have to because I was secondhand stone oh it's like it's like it's like when when I go to church with Coco I mean literally with Church with Coco for people to understand what we're saying Church of what's happening now podcast with Joey Diaz that's right right I didn't mean that I actually went to like a Santeria trash in sacrifice to check it although we have done that in Miami when he's out of Miami all bets are off right when Joey's down but like like I'm in the middle of a story on his podcast I fucking forgot the end of the story a little like I told and I like ended it and then only the next day did I go I never told him the end of that story I forgot it but so that someone says snoop snoop wants to meet you he's in his dressing room backstage at this concert so go fuck yeah I'm gonna go meet snow for you kidding so I open the door to this backstage area dude I can't see my hand in front of my frog if I like I was like like windshield wipers in my fucking glasses I can't see shit and I'm I'm wandering and I got maybe halfway down the hall and I was I can't you know just panting on my hands in ease housing I can't do I so I couldn't go back to the next year like tears that are I'm back in Colorado never because I was making fun of me because I like you went to Colorado and didn't smoke there like that's like going to hit early and not eating pasta you know I was like okay he's next time next time so I go out and I try it and I was like all I kept saying was I wish I was drunk I wish I was I wish I was just I don't know it was like a bad I just it was so antisocial I felt so weird I felt so sort of introverted and I was unfortunately in like a they have this pot-smoking Church in Denver whoa yeah it's like you go and you can just smoke pot and it's literally in this old church they got beautiful paintings on the wall it's crazy it's trippy and so I was there and I tried it and I was like how much did you saw not a lot two hits two three yeah that's too much is that too much yeah you wanna like if I was you your friend and I was why I'm your friend but if I was right next to you at the time I'd say Oh baby hit Billie just a little baby's like this that's all I want just and then let's just relax don't get crazy don't take it when it comes back around again it's too much - god damn strong today it's not what it used to be I was in very recently in Austin Texas and Texas still has regular weed it's very good weed but it's regularly well give you smoky and you like I'm here everything's fine California no longer these motherfuckers right here these little backwoods that Jesus that is not regular weed that's got a glass tip and that will put you on the fucking moon bryan callen had one hit of it last week you couldn't drive himself home hours later hours later he was still here he had to get my friend Brenda to come and get him there's a different shit so next time I did it I did something someone said you know what maybe you should try something else yes the Teva versus Indiana I tried it second time laughs my ass I was with funny friends okay and I had a fucking blast so I don't know what I did or shouldn't have done or should do or shouldn't do but it was I had a lot of fun yeah sativa is more you're thinking more it's a little bit you have a little bit more energy indica crushes you you just like oh my god I gotta go somewhere and lie down I can't handle this it's but it's different for different people as well but I'll tell you that chick-fil-a tastes damn Oh way better it tastes great I gotta tell you it tastes great I mean it's more ignorant Felicity you're saying yeah thank you how do I explain to my kids why it's closed on Sunday we're driving by how come no one's there I go cuz it's the baby Jesus day okay if you really want to celebrate the baby Jesus though all right let's hear me OTT I watch a lot of TBN because I'm a lunatic and I like I always wonder like if the Jews want television all the time we were on television going like send us money what would they say about us but for some reason I don't know why Jesus needs a lot of money cuz they're always on TV telling you to send your money to Jesus right so I'm thinking if you really want to do something for Jesus chick-fil-a open on Sunday and donate all of your revenue to Jesus to churches yeah all the after you think of the money just the after church crowd alone everybody would flock no pun intended right to the chick-fil-a and stock up and they'd have all them but they could even have people volunteer to work those days and donate all your money to Jesus because he apparently needs I don't know what he needs with it but he needs a lot of money well I don't know if the chick-fil-a guys the people own an art of the same ilk as the Trinity Broadcasting Network folks because those TBN folks I don't think you're being mean by saying they're shysters you know straight yeah they're just they're just stealing money from people I think that chick-fil-a guys like a legitimately religious person who really truly believes that he's saving the world from gay folk marrying each other yeah bro bro it's not logical but they make it goddamn good chicken Sam gotcha great man I tell you again I think it's more ignorance and hate but I've just rhyme just ignorant but but like I don't know and they had this lunatic on he's on all the time they're paid half our shows but this peter Popoff guy oh yeah the fucking miracle spring water and the prosperity the prosperity preachers mmm talk about a fucking bill of goods man you know that guy creflo dollar his name is fucking creflo I'm guessing yeah that's not his Christian name but it's but is this evangelical name is he made that name private I would hope so that was that that was the dude you tweeted about him years ago that was the dude who was out in the world getting donations because he needed to update or upgrade his g4 yeah to a g6 and I was like g6 Christ this fucking this guy I was going to say I need doing it because I need to spread the gospel yeah and so you need to give me money so that because my g4 just ain't cutting it anymore I need to upgrade I was like I wish he had gotten a 737 max eight but that's just me it's just so amazing that that hustle still works the the the prosperity ones are so gross because they go after people that are so poor and destitute that they can't pay their bills and they tell them if you just send me money God will pay you back tenfold and I know what you're saying you don't have any money but you do you do you take that money you send it to Jesus and Jesus will bring prosperity in your life and then they have all these folks that are giving testimonials about how I was down on my luck I didn't have money for rent I didn't have money for food but I knew that Jesus needed this money so I sent Jesus the money and Jesus paid me back tenfold and now my life is filled with joy and prosperity am I being hateful when I say that that is what religion preys on the lives or the no I'm searching for answers yeah but I think for some people there's like I mean this is older wiser me right when I was younger I would agree with you a hundred percent but I think at this point I think there's some benefit to like having community and having this environment where everybody goes to be humbled and everybody goes to agree that they're gonna be good people that follow the ethics of Jesus and you put a little money in the dish and you know they have to keep the operation running and there's a lot I think there's a lot of churches that do a lot of good but I think for every one or two that do a lot of good there's these motherfuckers that are just stealing money and drive and Rolls Royce it's just it's giant fucking castles you know like that Joel whatever his name is what's that guy's name Osteen yeah that Houston that motherfucker he owns a huge arena he they do this and he caught a rash of shit when he didn't let all the hurricane victims stay in his place yeah see he was holed up in his ten million dollar mansion there was only 10 million you know it's not his only property you know I mean he has several houses it's just so distorted though the whole idea of it also distorted but I think I think there's a lot of community churches that do a lot of good where they provide people with comfort you know I you know it doesn't necessarily have to make any sense and it doesn't make any sense but it provides them with comfort I appreciate like I respect people of faith I think it must feel wonderful I don't know how it feels but I it must be wonderful to believe in something like that so devoutly without any evidence without any indication or proof whatsoever that what you so firmly believe in is true but it's the hypocrisy of it that I just can't abide by right like these prosperity guys yeah I'd like the prosperity guys like people who used to have a or claim to have some kind of holier-than-thou moral code that now think like the pimp president school it's like I get it but like but your whole thing was like the Bill Clinton was the biggest scumbag in the world right I needed to be impeached and castrated and but like let's have some consistency it's hypocrisy that I can't abide by let's have some consistency is all well particularly with Trump because Trump was uh this is not a knock on him but he was a lifelong Democrat I mean he only really became a Republican we thought about running for president yeah and he was an independent for a minute then he was a Democrat again then he was a Republican it's a pure hustle I mean the the glass has been cleaned and squeegeed and you could see right through it that's why I works on the evangelicals that's what I'm saying he's like the pimp Joel Osteen like he's like that's what it is well you know he's hustle yeah and I don't want to be mean about this but I think it's accurate that there's there's a level of intellect that just subscribes to that kind of stuff that like I had a friend she was in the Mormon Church for a long time and she left the church but she was really honest about it she said I have a problem I'm susceptible to bullshit like she's susceptible Assoc susceptible to you know to like yoga type people like gurus crystals and the lights feel the light she's susceptible to all that shit and she would recognize her susceptibility but she was being really honest about it you know that she's like I have a real problem I grew up believing something that doesn't make any sense and I believed it wholeheartedly and she goes and that sort of formulated a big part of how I ascertained what is accurate in the world so she's left with he's like a child like skills of being able to discern what's bullshit and what's a hustle she's like a little kid I have a great amount of respect for people who grow up in a cult and who can make their way out of it hmm I mean can you imagine when you're a child you're most impressionable and and you're steeped in that that's all you know like you don't know that there's an alternate perspective and and you're able to grow up and say oh wait there's a whole big world out there maybe I'm not being told the truth and that's incredibly powerful it's really hard I think for it to break with the only thinking that you've ever known in your life I think it's amazing it's one of the probably one of the hardest things that a grown adult has to do is to recognize that the paradigm this this framework they've been living in their life under is all to utter horseshit it's like I mean the Mormon one is so crazy too because it's like the the results are great the people are so nice yeah they're the nicest cult members of all times but then you go back and look at the actual framework of the religion itself you like wait a minute wait a minute he was 14 he like hold on Joseph Smith was 14 in 1820 when he found golden tablets that contained the lost work of Jesus and only he could read him because he had a magic rock but like that's Judaism and Catholicism it's all there all of the frequency mythological horseshit but they know who the guy was like I mean he's so recent to Reese it's - well that's the thing is it you know it's like Scientology it's like yes well we know it's a lie Scientology crazy well a science fiction writer yeah literally was failed a failed science article writer terrible failed science fiction writer that motherfucker never made a second draft in his life and one day said the if you want to make real money start a religion yeah that is his greatest quote ya did it and then I bless him can't knock his hustle people want to buy into that what's amazing how we 2019 it's still rockin like some less you I mean it is even after all those documentaries even have to lay a Remini show yeah all these things just they go out in the world they tell everybody it's horseshit and then a brand new Scientology Center opens in Miami I'm like seriously we know you're in you're open we already know some people don't know the people who don't know are never gonna know that's what it is it's like you're going if you know if you want to put into money like some people have $100 some people have $5 and this is like intellectually some people have a lot of room to work with some people don't they just their brain doesn't work as good just like some people have poor genetics when it comes to their ability to run fast some people have really shitty brain development genetics let me ask you this because obviously you would have sympathy for someone who is taking advantage of or swindled or the fiction of a con con person and how much sympathy do you have for the gleefully ignorant or the willfully ignorant meaning like the information is there it's available before I give Scientology my money I could just I don't know google it right how much sympathy do you have for like the willfully ignorant people who who sort of it's like the fucking dude from my airplane they bought their tickets they knew what they were getting into you know I say let him crash you know like well I'm a big fan of Willie D from the ghetto boys and he has a quote that I always like to use you gotta let a hoe be a hoe and I think in that sense like you got to let dummies get fleeced it's just part of and part of it is there for us to see part of it is there for you to go what they gave away all their money oh shit like there's something to that it benefits us like I'm not a fan of these videos where kids try to skateboard off the side of a building and they slip and fall and land on their head and everybody's like oh shit but but those videos serve a purpose and that purpose is not everybody gets to do the handstand on the side of the building and survive some people fall on the land on their fucking head and they're never the same again yeah and then they they're left with like a third graders IQ for the rest of their life that's real man so it's George Carlin's bit about you know the kid who swallows the most marbles doesn't get to grow up and have kids of his own that's how it's supposed to work unfortunately it sucks if it's your kid it's all of us or experiencing this life together and there's some folks that are just they're gonna do a shitty job of it and part of me thinks that because there is no utopia right there is no enlightened people there's no one civilization that's got it all nailed and everybody gets along together and everyone's totally fine with every single choice everybody makes cuz ever been to Waffle House yes that's that's a utopians close depending on how drunk you are because of that I think we operate under this this weird system where you've got to see the failures in order to recognize that failure is possible I think there's a there's actual community benefit to people fucking up and there's some community benefit to people getting fleeced listen I I always say that I first well I don't believe anybody that says any artist or anybody out out in the world creating something and putting it out there for people to react to it I don't believe anyone who says they don't read their reviews so their own reviews I read all of the reviews and I read the bad ones twice because that's where you learn the most they could be right they could be wrong but right I feel like you just it's where you fuck up that like you you learn the most from it and and I think I feel like there's a white man in America all the time I have to keep myself in check the way you were describing earlier about how like you know what if you just come to realize that maybe the world isn't exactly the way you perceive it mm-hmm and that maybe there's a lot of other people who have very different experiences from the ones that you have and so maybe the reality of the world is different for those people sure and you can be a more enlightened person by being more empathetic and trying to understand those perspectives trying to walk you know a mile in their shoes and I just feel like I I've learned so much more from the mistakes that I made the failures that I've had certainly than any of the successes I have in my home I have no I have movie posters but they're like art they're other people's movies you know I have none of my own movie posters at home that's that's that's at the office that's not what home is for you know except I had one for a while I had one poster of one of my movies that I hung in the bathroom over the toilet because it was a my least favorite and I just wanted to be reminded every like that that was the time I took a shit you know like for the whole world to see and I hung it over it's either for a number of years it's not there anymore but like I just I just I wanted to remind myself of it you know you're a smart guy you take motivation and failures I mean that's what failures are really good for when you fail at something there's there's a benefit to that and that you you go god that sucked I don't ever want to suck again like let me figure out a way to not suck like I always say that with about comics like when we bomb that is it's a terrible feeling but it's the best opportunity for growth because you realize like hey I obviously didn't do a good job I need to figure out what the fuck I did wrong and batten down the hatches and get this ship right cuz I can't experience that again I became a comedy fan in no small part because I have been to shows where I've seen some of the biggest funniest guys bomb and I'm like Jesus short of being a soldier or a cop or like a stuntman this is one of the most dangerous self-destructive jobs like it's it requires such bravery and such strength of soul and thickness of skin that like I went fuckin Vegas just like 2000 and Sol Carlin big beautiful room sat like front row it was weird cuz like the stage was like a wall like I was sitting against like the fucking stage and I had to look up and like Karlin Shu would like pass like right in front of my eyes just above my my eye line and he was doing material for one of his last specials and it was the one I think met him in the second class he had that whole bit about like he doesn't believe in God but like he believes in like shit that he can see and he's afraid of like the Sun or Joe Pesci like you know that whole bit and he was in this big ol god-fearing crowd there in LA in Las Vegas and they were not about this they were not about it not one iota not one little bit and he's trucking back and forth doing it fuckin crickets fuckin crickets packed house sold out I'm the only one laughing in the room just me in this giant room laughing and my ass off and I'm all by myself and I'm at some point I turned I stopped laughing long enough I took a breath to take a drink right and I looked out and then I looked back up at the stage and Carlin he's right there he's like hunched over with his head like dangling off the stage like practic and I look up and I'm practically nose to nose with Carlin and he goes thank you sir and just it just walks away I'm stalking the set the stage I was like oh my god and I saw I was at The Improv um by in Miami when they when they had the one at the number the the horror on the Hard Rock I guess are we doing it or whatever fucking place is def I was like I was like man you know they say what do they say Hard Rock's the floor though that's the Hollywood one though yeah Hollywood that was a seminal good oh yeah what was good maybe the bad one was Miami the Miami when the crow couldn't grow that was that was rose death yeah but but the but no it was cool but then now it's got like they bulldoze the whole fucking place they're supposed to be remodeling or rebuilding at the Seminole Hard Rock like it's like I always say you know what's the saying that like um in a casino the house always wins I'm like these Indian casinos that the only place where like the house never wins because doesn't matter how much money you lose there we still like raped their women and stole their country so like the least you could do is like drop a little coin at the Indian casino and that's what I would do a good play they that was the only place that is the only place they have blackjack in South Florida so you can go there and play blackjack but they bulldoze the and I was there one night Gilbert Godfried was there and I was literally the only person laughing but like in pain like I was in pain laughing and it was just brutal and like and I've been in these rooms were like he's got and and I was just like these are the funniest people that I know and it's happened time and time again and I've been in shows where they killed and I've been to shows where they died and I was like this is amazing this is so amazing it's like the fact that anybody gets back on stage after that after a night like that is just it's remarkable to me I have nothing I've such respect I always say that bombing is like sucking a thousand dicks in front of your mother but not really because somewhere out there there's a guy who loves sucking a dick in front of his mother and if you put another 999 he wouldn't be that sad but no one wants a bomb in front of their mother no one wants a bomb period it's just terrible it's a ruthless experience it's it's it just rips you down and in shreds all your self-worth makes you feel terrible but again some of my best growth periods in my career have come after eating shit I just you spike you realize you go to go to work you can't be complacent and that's one of the things that fuels and motivates me to this day I'm terrified of bombing so I'll just keep it's anything I can use to make me work harder are you the six years since I did my shittiest work had been like for me artistically creatively the most productive and like I feel finally after 20 years of making documentaries that I might be doing like my best work like but it took that fucking long and it took basically almost six years from totally bombing you know to for me to feel like I I hit rock bottom and then have spiked you know better than better than before you've done some documentaries with some dangerous people in them you know obviously Griselda Blanco is probably one of the most dangerous people on earth while she was alive and in this that you also touch on that I mean there's your a lot of these people are fuckin sketchy folks and you're exposing how stupid their activity were does that does that ever creep you out ever get nervous like because you're making these documentaries mocking these people and you know rightly so but it's not cocaine Cowboys we're really mocking is more exposing but this one is like openly mocking this one's really good man it's really funny and he comes out March 29th yes sir Friday yeah and uh April 5th on VOD hmm yeah and well this one's this one's tough because this is like a fresh wound from Netflix March 20 I'm sorry theaters March 29 okay and VOD April 5th so like iTunes Amazon review on your cable box what kind of release you're gonna get in the theaters I'm starting off with 12 cities on Friday the 29th and then I mean oh yeah for sure at the Laemmle Music Hall oh three grand um and then where else I think San Francisco Boston Miami Orlando if there's like 12 cities and then I guess depending on how well it does it's being put out by Greenwich Entertainment who just won the Oscar for free solo for Best Documentary so they know what they're doing and like I said hopefully people will go see it and listen it I hope it's a comedy I think it's common it's a common we tried to make it laughing I was like what the fuck man that fucking guy the Tanner was his name again Porter for sure Porter that guy like what I just imagine if you got one of those guys in your life and he's just stuck in your life like shit how do I get this fucking guy out of my life and the fact that he borrowed money from this guy and then did loan money well loan money to this guy yeah Porter loaned it to Tony yeah oh this Tony borrowed money if this order and then didn't pay him and that's what caused this whole thing it is Alex Rodriguez has got to be pulling his fucking hair out go what in the fuck and and Alex was paying everybody so was MLB I mean everyone was running amok in Miami hmm like just the hiring Private Investigators running people down Alex Rodriguez actually this isn't in the documentary but when these convicted felons stole the stolen documents from Porter Fisher who had stolen the documents from Tony Bosch they set him up in this whole [Music] fucking tanning salon heist like hey why don't you go in and try this new spray tan color it's it's trumpian orange goes go try it on and while he's in the fucking spray tan machine they open his car and steal these documents which has had these client lists of all these famous baseball players including the highest-paid baseball player in the world a-rod and so they steal it and then they turn around and sell these stolen documents to Major League Baseball for cash some MLB has this ragtag band of misfits these this internal FBI like their own internal investigations division that they created after the BALCO steroid scandal they're running amok they are seducing nurses former nurses from Tony Bosh's clinics they are literally in diners with convicted felons handing over bags of cash from some MLB slush fund I don't imagine there we're gonna 1099 the guy and I don't know where this cash came from 125 grand and what they did was is that the felon who was doing it had a buddy at a neighboring table at this diner with his cell phone recording video recording this transaction and then he turned around and went to a rods camp and said I'll sell you a video of me selling known stolen documents everybody knew these documents were stolen so mo B's buying these stolen records stolen evidence in the state of Florida Department of Health investigation for cash from a felon at some point he gets like freaked out and nervous and he deletes this video off the hard drive he wanting some selling a rod a blank hard drive for six figures okay and a rod sends this hard drive he arrives people send this hard drive around the world to like data recovery services to try to get this video back so unfortunately the felon didn't get his second six-figure payment because that was that was the first exteriors were against the recovery of the Deaf but he got like 2 300 grand to sell a rod a blank hard drive an ear rods dropping money on private investigators who are like having car chases through South Miami it was just totally crazy and it's like I always say like you come down to the swamp and roll around you're gonna get some mud on you so when MLB came down to to Miami when the guy Jerome Hill the the former Baltimore cop turned Florida Department of Health investigator he he says unequivocally that Major League Baseball's investigators broke the law in the state of Florida and should have been prosecuted for it and held accountable for it and never and never were I mean it's good to be a multi-billion dollar monopoly well how old was a rod when the scandal broke Eric was definitely towards the end of his career and so that's the interesting thing about coz let's be real I don't give a shit about steroids in baseball and this era of steroids in baseball was not the same as the other you know the Barry Bonds you know era of steroids in baseball these were not guys you know with necks the size of my waist or those they were micro dosing and it was HGH in testosterone and a lot of these guys I mean listen they're there their livelihoods are contingent upon your physical performance yes and so you got to play like what is it 162 games in 180 days it's the most physically grueling schedule of any of the of the professional sports and guys have always been looking for an edge in the 1950s the Yankees were going out the Copacabana all fucking night apparently okay there's an adderall issue with baseball as well absolutely a disproportionate number of baseball players compared to the general population on adderall that's why I said it's a performance of course dancing drug but you had guys like Mickey Mantle and whitey Ford and Billy Martin partying all night at the Copacabana they have to make a 1:00 p.m. game maybe even a doubleheader they're doing greenies they're doing em feta means it's always been a part of baseballs finding that edge now you got guys who are just looking to maybe recover a little faster you know who from from injuries or fatigue you're looking for guys who are looking to maintain peak performance for al a longer period than their bodies might have otherwise allowed is it that big of a deal I don't know it's not and it's it's it's a weird deal it's a weird thing that we have an issue with like you've look if they did the same sort of stringent testing with NFL players you'd find out that everyone's on steroids that's just a fact you don't get people that big and they do catch them every now and then but I feel like it's like one of those things we're like you know the drug cartels they'll let some drug drug shipments get busted so that the other ones will get through I almost feel like that's what they do with with NFL players to get caught like oh look we're testing we got somebody dude that's what that's what this was with a rod you know Bud Selig is the steroid commissioner . that's the bottom line his tenure was marked by the famous you know Barry Bonds derby or yeah well mark Warren Sammy Sosa absolutely so he knowingly I believe um exploited and profited from that era of baseball that really saved him after 94 players strike I mean baseball says look at the size of those guys where they started yeah yeah yeah I mean so many of them they literally were some of the documentary we morph them from like a before and after because they're did they turn into fucking baseball monsters snacking balls to Guantanamo for Christ I know what's interesting to me is as some people recovered from that stuff and some people did not Jose Canseco never recovered he never recovered in the public eye and that's why he's so pissed like that's why the and it's fucked up with you when you're the pioneer in something people really and dude they had a street named after him in Miami yeah and they quietly took that shit down in the middle of the night after decades of naming that Street from he was just totally humiliated and I think it's also because he ratted out a lot of guys but so did a-rod a-rod leaked names to try to distract or defuse but it turned out a book yeah but like it's the public nature of can psychos book mmm it's like I don't know I'm just guessing because his book was like his book turned out to be like the Jose Canseco's book about steroids turn out to be like the steel dossier of baseball saying everybody thinks is pissed and thinks a bunch of bullshit and then for time it's slowly proven true right at the end there's a P tape yes I think that therefore yeah well that's that is a good way of looking at - right because like think about the outrage when Clinton got his dick sucked by Monica Lewinsky and compared it to Donald Trump having at least two women that we know about where he paid off they fucked and people like ask the evangelicals where those dead yeah and all that yeah yeah man it was before the man found Christ a lot of them said he find Christ I was watching the documentary where there was a guy who was some some Christian guy who was saying this all of these accusations or before he was born because he was born in the eyes of Christ when he accepted Christ into his life man well I guess when he's running for president it's what he paid off stormy yeah but like the night before there but after that then he became Jesus after so after he like oh yeah paid off stormy like when one day before the election I feel bad for her too because I feel like she thought like this is gonna go all in on this and then she lost the court case against him so she owes his legal fees 300 grand this is crazy like fuck is she gonna get that and now she's found trying to do stand-up yeah I mean she's Kraft she's trying to do stand-up I think no she's not yes she is in Houston Texas they were calling her the queen of clap back all right that is wean of the clap no no clap back oh okay you know what clap back like she's if it has something bad about her she's gonna come after you even worse like a lose that clap back expressioned like someone kim kardashian claps back at the critics like like that is the dumbest I cannot wait for that one to fucking dry up and go away not Kim Kardashian that's that expression like Twitter insult comic kind of stick but it's just clap back they're calling it when someone has something to say about someone saying something about them that's clapping back right but how does that translate to stormy Daniels doing stand-up how can you do stand-up out of clap X well they were calling her the queen of clap back this she's gonna do stand up again I mean who knows maybe she's hilarious if she's gonna take it seriously I mean you never fucking know I mean as a comic I leave the door open for all abilities but I mean it just means to me that she got this situation where she thought she probably was told by everybody look hey you're gonna win this he's gonna pay you off you're gonna the everyone's gonna know that you told the truth and people gonna pay for your interviews and man but this is America is broke supply and demand economy like if she can make more money stand-up comedy's hard work if she can make more money just spending on a pole yeah what like why cuz she's got probably got bad hips she's like in her 50s or something doesn't she I don't know she's not man you know she's not young how is she she's only 40 jesus okay I'm sorry stormy don't clap back at me ideas meal as you say in my era hard life bro that's just dumb it's just but that thing is that we everyone's so used to it now it's like not that big a deal it's like even if a new accusation came out people like ah like like remember the New York Times report about Trump we're talking about shady business dealings and they thought I mean they spent years rerender yeah totally didn't do a damn thing in and out just office shoulder it's problematic and I'll tell you why um it's what I call the the new American values it's to me what what I think screwball is about in the end meaning like yeah it's fun and it's funny and it's a forest it's a romp you laugh but I think that there's a conversation to be had about what I call the new American values which are like eat and steal and get rich or get ahead and these are values that we're teaching our children now not honesty integrity tell the truth do unto others as you'd have done to Hunter you the golden rule we're now showing them be a bully lie cheat and steal and you could be the biggest highest-paid baseball player of all time lie cheat and steal and you could be the Commissioner of Major League Baseball I gene Steele and you two kids can be President of the United States and I think this tox toxicity of the new American values is going to do damage for generations and we're not going to be able to fully comprehend or understand or analyze the damage it's done for some for some time and it was like after Clinton Clinton redefined what sex meant and we were adults he could laugh at it but the truth is is that he said oral sex wasn't sex right okay and we saw the spike in sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers and young people mostly through oral sex because they said oh well the president said really absolutely yeah talk about a health yeah it was it was a legitimate public health crisis use you saw following the Clinton Lewinsky scandal you saw an increase in sexually transmitted diseases through oral sex amongst younger people because the president it's hard for us to because we see the president right now is sort of a comic you know as he's sort of it's it's you know he's a reality show president we know it's bullshit but what do you tell kids this is the President of the United States is that what it was or was it because there was so much discussion about him getting his dick sucked that more people wanted to suck dicks and get their dick sucked I think without question obviously the the size and scale of coverage yeah unquestionably got people warming people people for a while people thought but I say people I'm trying to people developing minds impressionable youths were under the impression that you could not get a sexually transmitted a disease through something that wasn't sex and the president reset those values just like this president I feel is re calibrating our values and and I think that that's that's what's most I mean other than to the potential of nuclear war I think I think that is what is most dangerous and what could could cause the most long-term damage from this is these new American values lie cheat and steal I was literally at a Q&A with one of the kids that the little kid Ryan Blanco who plays Tony Bosh in the movie the lab coat and the hair he's he's hilarious and so they're all great and he said I always had a Q&A and I was like you know what lessons do we learn from this movie and he'd this is where I got this from he interrupted he's ten years old and he's like oh I know I know I'm like Brian off to raise your hand it's your Q&A - dude you're you're on the panel and it's like lie cheat and steal and to win or something like that I was like you know fuck this kids ten years old you know and I'm like this is what he thinks the values of America are well that's interesting because in the documentary one of the big things the news clippings is George Bush discussing steroids in baseball in 2004 was the 2000 State of the Union yeah and he was talking about how it sends the wrong message that cheating in baseball sends the wrong message to the youth of America and there's I thought that was silly at the time I was like I will fucking message but the reality is those things do have a ripple effect and if you tell people that the way to become this superstar athlete is not just through hard work and dedication but also through taking things that are illegal because they're gonna pump you up and give you an edge on your competitors we're a shortcut Society so we look for those those tricks of the trade you know we're always and we and we don't believe necessarily when people do achieve something naturally or via hardwork we go and what did what did he do what did she do what she really do you probably miss some of those shortcuts work like adderall like steroids they fucking work man you know the UFC has had a giant problem with them for a long time and it was exacerbated by this time period in the early 2000s where they allowed people I guess it wasn't quite the early 2000s it was actually later in the 2000s where they allowed people to take exogenous testosterone under therapeutic use exemption z' they would call it trt and so this famous like the Vitor Belfort era when he was on TRT just starts smashing people because he looks so ridiculous he was so jacked and that during that time period they they fell into this there was a sort of a really a piss-poor way of justifying it that justification once these people have low testosterone low testosterone this disease if we give them testosterone they can perform better but the way around that was these guys were actually on steroids the steroids crashed their testosterone that go and get a test look my testosterone is low like yep you need testosterone and then they would take steroids you know essentially not steroids but testosterone which has you know similar effects and and then eventually the UFC said look we fucked up we're gonna go a hundred degrees the other 180 degrees the other way and higher you sada and we're gonna we're gonna crawl up everyone's ass with a microscope we're gonna find out what the fuck is up and man body's changed careers crumbled beaming we saw so many people get busted in the beginning so many people got caught and still getting a TJ Dillashaw just got caught who's a bantamweight champion just just relinquished his belt for something I don't know what he got caught for I don't know what the circumstances were some people have been caught for accidental contamination because there's a lot of different supplements you could buy even creatine standard stuff that's totally legal to take but they they're contaminated because you're buying them from cheap sources they make him in China and what-have-you that was the problem with this biogenesis thing is first of all Tony Bosh who wore a lab coat had a stethoscope hilarious called himself dr. T yeah that said dr. Tony Bosh he's a veteran Belize which I think I am too have to check my email medical school is dr. pepper and dr. Dre well I'm a ordained minister just so you know I've actually married people that's legal yeah I'm legally ordained minister I got it online Tony Bosh despite having attended what one of our interview subjects refers to as the beliefs School of the medical and Performing Arts okay doctorate he was never a licensed physician in the United States and he was yet he had legitimate prescription pads and DEA numbers from doctors that he could then prescribe these drugs and in fact wanted to go one step further like we were talked about with the pill mills and actually sell them in-house to his clients and was buying them in the black market from some dude in a suburb of Miami making the shit in his garage so that's problematic well you know here's one that's problematic that's kind of weird doctors of chiropractic like you know they don't go to medical school and they some of them check this is check of this is true can chiropractors write prescriptions I don't think that they can I think some of them really I think in some places they can write prescriptions it's not like in Tennessee or in like we're it's where is that a thing says no so they can't I guess some of them could be doctors though mmm adjustment you're right you feel it no don't how about that I went to a chiropractor yeah I thought they were real until I started reading about how it actually got full and a lot of people out there that are chiropractors say I do a lot of good for people I'm sure you do there's a lot of good therapies that chiropractors also offer so do churches but the the actual evidence that manipulating people especially your neck that it does any good at all there's none and it actually has killed people people have died from having the neck manipulated well I I felt a lot lighter after the kyra measure by about $400 when I yeah I mean they do a lot of shit cold laser and massage and stuff that doesn't work but if you look at the you know it was invented by a guy who's a magnetic healer who was murdered by his own son his own son murdered him ran over him with a car and then took over the business sounds like a Sondheim musical it does crazy it's and it was all in like the 1800s and we've had it for so long that people most people didn't look into it and say well what is this what is the science of this this guy thought that he could cure everything including blindness leukemia cancer from adjusting your back this was his premise was based on has I don't you came from a seance and now there's no more blindness or leukemia or it's amazing but there are still chiropractors that buy into that same idea that they can cure things that it's not just you're dealing with pain right and if they manipulate you they can relieve pain no they can cure you of certain ailments because of your spine being on a aligned incorrectly they're gonna adjust it its popping you just like this just like you do that with your fingers when you cry chuckles that's it's the same thing it's like a release of nitrogen or something I don't not exactly sure what causes the crap but legitimately yeah but I don't see did you see anything no okay maybe I'm wrong but I'm proficient I'll tell you that Toni Bosch could not write prescriptions but he was exactly he was doing it anyway or irregardless as we say my dad doing it right regardless we see we see you regardless in Miami because we're illiterate but I use it you're ironically though so I see no but I think I think you might have swiped a pad from his doctor who from his father who was a legitimate a legitimate doc so he's forging his dad's yeah and he had he had a you know what they called medical directors that's part of these the whole anti-aging scheme really prospered in the state of Florida as you can imagine and in no small part because there's a lot of doctors who from all over the country retire to Florida but they are still medical doctors so you have guys like Tony Bosch entrepreneurial with an entrepreneurial spirit who want to open up these anti-aging clinics and they need what's called a medical director so they go to a legitimate doctor and they say hey kind of rent us we'll put your name on the business you'll get a cut of the action and they're basically renting out their prescription pad and DEA number so that guy's you know these other operators who in this case identify themselves falsely as doctors can you know exploit that that power of the prescription pad and so that's what was happening here and more problematic he started treating high school kids oh no and whose parents and baseball coaches had heard about him through word-of-mouth and brought these kids to him to get an advantage you know we have a big immigrant community obviously in Miami we have a lot it's a huge baseball community mmm mommy of people who are smuggled specifically into the country for the purpose of playing baseball and signing those big guaranteed contracts right out of high school and so you have parents and kids and coaches looking for every advantage we're going to this guy you know they weren't hearing about him in the high school locker room these were coaches and parents who are bringing their parents too you might say a guy who they presumed was a real doctor but nonetheless looking to cheat you know to gain the system and that's problematic when you have this guy who knows he knows he's not a doctor but he was a true believer in himself he really thought he was helping people and listen the proofs in the pudding this guy could not exploit traditional advertising he wasn't doing billboards and TV ads he just he was strictly word-of-mouth so he had clients who were getting results including nearly a hundred cops who were referring their friends mmm - his clinics so these parents came to him looking for help help for their kids and those kids are our victims yeah well that's for sure this is the last thing you want to do to a kid especially one that doesn't have any sort of real hormonal ailment is to inject exogenous hormones into their body it just fucks their brain up their emotions their their entire endocrine system crashes afterwards it causes depression Citra leads to suicide and a lot of kids and depending what you're doing to them you could also be risking their offspring particular offspring sure yeah you could be killing their sperm yeah yeah you definitely can you have a disproportionate amount of I mean in the steroid use population of autism childhood cancer just horrible horrible things that happened to the the children of people who are on some of these drugs I think a lot of the folks that are looking at it in terms of a career in baseball or in any other sport where they get benefit they go hey this is the price that I have to pay in order to excel at this extraordinary Avenue for financial gain well Tony Vash was treating Manny Ramirez mm-hmm and when he was in Boston and low testosterone you know he was getting on in the years and Bosh started treating him put him on a protocol as he called it take the you know X amount of Y substance etc at this time each day micro dosing as you said so it wouldn't in the event that they were randomly tested that wouldn't be detected I don't know if that worked or not or he was giving them placebos on certain days I don't know what the the scheme was but Manny starts to come back again I don't know if it was psychosomatic or he really was actually performing better and that's when he got his Dodgers deal it was like a 40 million dollar deal in theoretically thanks in no small part to this guy who was you know who was juicing him and that's and then man he gets busted pisses dirty after a surprise test before a game because according to Bosh he didn't take the micro dose on precisely the instructions you know that he had given them and so pissed dirty and as a result of the what you would assume was negative publicity from Manny getting busted and then connecting it to Tony Bosh in Miami that was the word of mouth that got a rods cousin to come to Bosh and say hey you should meet my cousin he's playing this game in Tampa come up in and meet him and it turns out that it's Alex Rodriguez it's just amazing that someone who made as much money as Alex Rodriguez has knuckleheads like that who can't see the future because if I was his friend I'd be like hold on hold on hold on he's already been busted dude listen to me they're looking at him they're watching you know 9 yeah meanwhile they weren't even weren't even they don't listen baseball is like everything else in American life now including politics it's the WWE hmm okay when Bud Selig the steroid commissioner was on his way out the door literally on the eve of retirement and he's like you know what I need to look like I'm doing something about this cuz I got a great big fat ass tricked by my name in you know in the record books here like all these players do of the steroid era I need to look like I did something on my way out the door so he calls the second-in-command Rob Manfred and says let's do let's do something about this and they go after the biggest scalp you can in the game Alex Rodriguez yeah and so when they needed alex is the heel that was the storyline yeah okay so they nail Alex alright you know the Vince McMahon of the game Bud Selig goes I took care of them retires Rob Manfred who was in charge of this whole botched you know quasi legal operation investigation biogenesis and and Alex gets the the top gig and is now the Commissioner of baseball and he goes you know would be a good storyline now what if I bring a rod and Petros back as commentators they did for a while a rod and Petros were working together by the way they were damn good they remember damn good television dude and as commentators until Petros got in trouble again they asked him but now you've got Rob Manfred who basically put it all on the line and a rod who put it all on the line fighting each other in this battle of the legacies with Bud Selig now they're posing with JLo out at nightclubs and stuff because that's the new storyline the story let you know if one day you're the heel the next day you're the hero here it's like whatever whatever and and and they're just selling everybody this this bill of goods that this is all real you don't really have a picture that was him with a minotaurs body sent or sent are so real so this is I don't know if this is apocryphal or real I know people who have been on the apartment and claimed to have seen it the problem is is I don't I don't know if they're telling the truth or they're like kind of like fueling the the apocryphal tale so yeah I want to believe I want to believe that's the problem we all want to believe so I mean spoiler alert we fucking we did it we put it in their kids face amazing yes the kid who plays a rod is a fucking amazing it's a light eyes well it's just his is like Wendy's do I don't want to give too much of her way but making the funny faces in court it's like fucking hilarious I mean it's so good and I was just laughing I was like this is so ridiculous and to know this is all something that really happened I have to tell you we've been at this making documentaries for like 20 years now almost and so this is the most as ridiculous and fucking absurd as this is it is the most meticulously researched documentary we have ever done why we're dealing with some very powerful litigious yes individuals and organizations so we knew we had to get this 100% right not to mention the way we shot this on set on location for 10 days we had the playback on the set so we were committed to this dialogue right right and so we had to make sure we went and obtained transcripts that were never released publicly a sworn testimony in the case to be able to cross-check some of the stuff that we were told and we're gonna put in the documentary and we just I mean we actually shot at some of the actual locations in Miami where these real events took place the fountain will live at the Fontainebleau Hotel you know the nightclub the Sports Grill in South Miami the ritz-carlton in Key Biscayne we actually took the kids there put the facial hair on put the fucking cop uniforms on and the you pinstripes on and we just filmed them all over town buts funny about how did in Miami no one looked twice at us no one thought anything of just us running around these little kids with beards and mustaches in gray hair and the fucking scene where they're looking for the blood in the nightclub we lost the vial I'm like what in the fuck in fact that he drew his blood in the bathroom and then lost the vial like Jesus Christ it was so crazy I was just watching it like shaking my head like this is all real this is how this went down that guy was worth how many hundreds of millions of dollars how much Oh 400 million was his gross revenue just in baseball and he just had knuckleheads I mean the fact that he was like willing to keep this guy around him he grew up in Miami that's when you surround yourself with when you when you grow up in Miami and that scene was a I mean that scene we had like all those kids like that all the extra kids partying shoutout to my director of photography BG gold net key to the hell of a job like that was somehow getting so great it's a great documentary but all your shit's great damn I'm a big fan of all your stuff but this one's particularly silly you should come down to Miami you should see we're doing I'm almost embarrassed to say it I just mentioned did you earlier we turned cocaine Cowboys into a stage play yeah you were saying that before we started in like wow how come it's not a musical okay calm down and and he's called confessions of a cocaine cowboy you might remember in the documentary there was a hit man Jorge reveai ala who he worked for la Medina the godmother Griselda Blanco and when we first started researching the dock in 2004 we obtained a seven-volume 1300 page deposition that he gave and normally in a depo you're like the answer is like yes no yes no I don't remember you no don't recall this was like he was a cooperating witness against Griselda in in in miami-dade County state of Florida was a three capital murder charges so three death penalties we're talking old Sparky cases and the electric chair and so he was cooperating witness so it read like a monologue it read like a I'm reading it and going on with the new world school the arts high school which was where I studied theater so I was reading a lot of plays and I was like oh shit this is this would be like a great play and fifteen years later we we turned it into confession of a cocaine confessions of a cocaine cowboy and you said it's kind of funny so it's just someone described it oh shit yeah my producing partner that's Yancey arias from formerly spoiler alert he's not on the show anymore this character got into some trouble queen of the south on USA he's brilliant in the show and so my producing partner David sip can describe who co-produced cocaine Cowboys and edited edited it with me he's described as a cross between cocaine Cowboys and my Twitter feed that's how he described it so like it's a little reverent it's obviously a little absurd if you're gonna put kind of cocaine Cowboys is a live theater event so we kind of acknowledged the absurdity of it and the business the the surreal exploitation of it and you know the guy Michelle Hausman who's the the director of the play at Miami new drama at the colony theater in Miami Beach on Lincoln Road he said um he said why are we doing cocaine Cowboys for the theater in 2019 and I was like it's a good question because like it speaks to the relevance of like why do this now and I say well if you take away from the documentary you take away the drugs and the money it's really a story about immigrants children and gun violence that's what it's about and what could be more relevant in the contemporary conversation than immigration children and gun violence and so ultimately I wanted to make a story about the Miami of yesterday but the America of today like I said the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow so here's a story about Miami in the 1980s but it really resembles the America of today and so to do that we had to not make it totally fucking depressing and disturbing we injected a lot of humor and a lot of irreverence and into it um the woman Zillah Mendoza who plays resulta Blanco also plays the state attorney so she has his dual role as sort of these end dueling antagonists against Rivi the hitman and it's just a you know I was writing it with a friend or an Squire this great TV writer and Chiron played both roles because I felt that they were flip sides of the same coin I think the the state attorney is an interesting character they're different clothes oh yeah she changed and has it has different hair and in fact the performances are so different and the voices are so different that sila does some people after the show would be like oh my god she was amazing sheila was amazing is uh Griselda Blanco who's the actress that plays the state attorney Kathy and we're like oh we won't tell the kids so we're the last time I heard of that being done effectively was Mars Attacks I like Mars Attacks these real underrated does yeah Tim Burton hugely under amazing scores that yeah I don't know like especially now I feel like it really holds up I still go act act for Posterous I love that movie people love it I love my god they're crazy it's great it's holds up man you know I watched it like two years ago it holds up it's wonderful yes that's interesting that you chose to use the same woman did you think about that for a while do you have another woman you always wanted to do it from the beginning yeah always I just I've a strange relationship with the state attorney in in Miami Dade County hmm um she's been the state attorney for about 26 years now and and you know when she was first elected she was like the first Cuban state attorney in the state of Florida um very ambitious she was she's been the only state attorney we've had since Janet Reno left us for the Clinton administration oh that's how long she's been state attorney so now she has one of those records where you examine it and you say okay what's actually happening in this town when people say to me like why is Miami so fucking corrupt what you know why does corruption grow you know greater and wider than fucking oranges in in Miami and the reason is when you have the top cop in town does not effectively enforce public corruption laws and does not pursue public corruption you have an area where it's just you send a message of impunity that's the bottom line you know no trouble arresting innocent young black kids on drug charges or whatever but like when it comes to enforcing public corruption she's just non-existent and so what happens is is you you have a and and of course it's like the broken windows theory of crime if you allow petty corruption to to to go eventually some of these politicians wind up literally in a closet at City Hall accepting bags full of money and the only thing we've been able to rely on to some extent is the feds coming in and trying to help but you have a state attorney who has never in her 26 years in office charged a police officer for non duty killing whoa despite a proliferation of these incidents so it's not like it's oh it's not happening as often the incidents have exploded and the reason the incidents have exploded is because police know that they'll get away with it because Kathy will not prosecute them so the message that's being sent is a dangerous one and it has created a toxic effect with the relationship between obviously police and-and-and the citizens that they're supposed to be protecting and serving and it's it's created a very dangerous you know situation in the city and it's also created a situation where just like mayor after mayor just gets away with pure fuckery you know oh yeah and that's that's it's not a sexy answer people I was likewise Miami's so corrupted that people want some sort of sexy answer and I say well when the top cop is the same person for 26 years you know if you're looking at something if you want to know what's wrong in a community or with anything you don't look at what change isn't mean mayor's come and go police chiefs come and go commissioners come and go killers come and go you know criminals come and go you look at the constants you say what's been the same here for 26 years that's got to be the problem and sure shit that's that's the problem so I wanted to make a statement about the state of Miami today and say that that you know also the result of Blanco was born in Colombia in a very difficult time in the history of that country during la violencia this brutal civil brutal civil war between liberal and conservative parties that went on for like 20 years almost caused caused the horrific murders of like 200,000 people some very brutal some very public it's been reported that she has a hobby with her friends and their youth you just run around in just bury bodies that were just lying in the street they're lying around like that was just a hobby something for the kids to do and so you grow up in that environment we were saying earlier like you open a cult you grow up in that environment your psyches fucked you know you're not exactly born into money or power or wealth you know your dad's not a judge you don't exactly have those benefits or opportunities and if you can try to make something of yourself I mean the problem of course is a result the Blanco went into a and illicit and illicit trade but a trade that a lot of people in Colombia were getting into from that era it's just I wanted to have a discussion about a lot of the characters argue with each other in the play about how different everybody is it's like that how Miami is like Game of Thrones in paradise with slightly fewer dragons you know like we just self segregate and it becomes this battle of fiefdom xand and because we're not like we're not multicultural we're very much segregated like I always say the common misconception about Miami is that were a melting pot we are not a melting pot we are a TV dinner where sometimes the peas fall into the mashed potatoes you know we have our little kingdoms you know bye-bye flag by nationality very much so and so everybody's arguing about how we're different and the plays sort of when you walk away you're like okay but this is a conversation about how we're all the same and some of us have different opportunities than then than others and it's just a bat matter of what we're able to make of those of those opportunities and that was sort of the comparison I was baking by because it's a little locally it's a little scandalous the fact that the same actress plays both of these these very powers but also because Kathy the state attorney is a very powerful popular figure so because you've publicly stated there's a reason there's parallels between her and Gasol the Ponca and let's say the portrayal is not the most flattering mmm in the play worried I think she gets a fair shake in the play but but rivey the character through his commentary comes down pretty hard on her I've been publicly very critical of her I think it hope in a constructive way on publicly and via social media and but I mean 26 years and it's almost 70 people yeah you know but that is fascinating you got to wonder if it's a spoken agreement or if this is just a known sort of just this is just how she does business you don't have to worry I call it a conspiracy of convenience because not every conspiracy involves a bunch of you know a rogues gallery had a boardroom table in a dark smoky room you know it's talking about okay how we're gonna conspire I'm gonna do conspiracies of convenience are just like people are in positions of power and everybody just kind of wink wink nod not everybody knows what they're supposed to do right and you don't ruffle feathers and you don't you don't fuck with conventional wisdom and this is the way it's all wait this is the way it's always been done so this is the way we do it and everybody just kind of you either fall in line or they get rid of one way or another and so that's just the way fiefdom is operate sounds like such an exhausting project to create a play out of that sort of horrific time in Miami's history it was fucking okay like when you told me you were doing it that's the first thing I thought of well being a lazy fuck I'm like well that's so much time you know that seems like so much time to do I don't wanna do that there's there's like this documentary racket it's not very profitable so I wanted to go where the real money is theater plays playwright fortune Billy and I said to him to my co-author or in squired the director I was like listen it's like this has to be purely theatrical experience to know projections no archive like news footage like we use in the DA I'm like if in Miami first of all these days if I just got to put my pants on to leave the house that's a fucking hassle meaning like if I could just when I'm home if I can just chill I want to just chill right so if I'm gonna be like okay I gotta go see a fucking play thank you I'm like so first thing I had to do is put my pants on all right so put my pants on then you got to get in the car you got to brave this traffic spring break on right now mighty Beach it's out of control so you got to go to South Beach go to the theater Lincoln Road and then like pay your hard-earned money to see this play because plays are more expensive tickets for plays or a lot pricier than a movie right and so or in Netflix subscription so you go in like I don't want people to be there like what the hell I could have just stayed home and watched this shit on on Netflix I want people to go like holy shit and we're actually seeing that we're seeing um a really disproportionate number of people coming to the theater who have never been to like a live played before because of their interest in the subject matter the title confessions of a cocaine cowboy or the documentary so people are coming and they're rowdy and they're like interacting with the actor is this kind of fun because we do a lot of breaking of the fourth wall we're Rivi talks to the crowd or the cops talked to the crowd and so they're talking back the audience in there and it's fun and and very and and funny and and I think pretty thought-provoking particularly at the end and they just like this audience is is we're like oh shit you can't duplicate this experience in any way you know that I mean like yeah I mean watching comedy on Netflix is one thing being in the room it's a totally different energy yeah it's a rush it's like you know it's like a drug how many seats this year 420 oh it's great for twenties really intimate but that's a good size for an intimate live show it's huge and and it's a beautiful take a historic theater in Miami Beach there's not a lot of what's a crawl which the colony theater okay I know where that Lincoln Road it's that walking stream you probably get back when we had the comedy fest oh you probably did it where you were at the Fillmore and you might have done the Jackie Gleason show more now yeah I don't I've done a few different places there I don't remember all of you there's a smaller room for you but like it's a great cool space it used to be an old movie theater in my grandma I used to go see me oh we don't preserve a lot of our history in Miami it's like I was saying earlier like we're such a young city literally young and we're like America's perpetual rebellious teenager we're like everything new we don't like we have a transient population a lack of institutional memory and we're like fuck history let's just knock this down and build new because that's the only way to create jobs like knocking shit down redesigning it rebuilding it repopulating it building at all or creating more revenue because we know the state income tax in Florida so it's just like it's just constant hustle so to have a place like that where it's like oh we're gonna take a deep breath and say this is a cool spot there's no venues like this in town it's been here for almost a hundred years like let's preserve it you know let's preserve the original architecture let's preserve some of the the olders like this old carving of like pelicans like this really creepy like old-school deco art they just preserved it and it's really it's like the perfect environment to do a show that's like by Miami for Miami you're the no income tax thing is very attractive to people people may leave the states that don't have income that's one thing that pulls Nevada pulls people in the Nevada why do you think Oh Jay Simpson moved there yeah like there was a law where they couldn't get his money right we have the homestead law like that you know that you can you can't get the money you can't get the house you get so it's a great place to sort of hide assets I told you like a third world country it's got banana republic you know yeah cuz he got he lost the civil case you're 30 plus million dollar judgment against him he bought a fucking house in Florida now he is he still there oh I don't think so I think he's in Vegas now I think I think he they released him but they were gonna I think you might be on paper so I think he might have to stick around I'm not certain because it for a while he wanted I think he was asking permission to go to Florida when he first got released and the Attorney General of Florida was like no thanks to be fair though she was a blonde woman so she was scared so soon what it's say he's one of the weirdest cases in all of American pop culture history I mean he is one of the weirdest cases I you know there's a fantastic photo that someone made a meme of Howard Cosell with Bruce Jenner on his one side and then Oh Jay Simpson on his other side and Howard Cosell say and I've seen the future you're not gonna fuckin believe this because this is so goddamn crazy that one of the most famous and beloved people forget before that murder beloved I mean he was like the rock oh absolutely right in that in a lot of ways maybe even maybe even well I won't say more below the rocks pretty beloved but that level I mean endorsements Hertz rental car ads he was in movies he was loved him yeah but loved personality comedies no yes son trilogy yes you know and and I well it was inevitable he would wind up in Florida of course but but like crazy just crazy and this is something that in the end not to spoil it you've been so so kind did not spoil screwball but in the end that's also part of the the message is the idea that and why we use the children these athletes are heroes to these kids they look up to them these are supposedly role models and how many professional athletes do you know who you'd be like I want my kids to idolize this this person like legitimately like legitimately very few sure so it's like that's the and that's where that whole sort of like lie cheat steal to get ahead message I think is what's what we're teaching our children these days and and that's the case with like OJ Simpson it's like this kid people idolize that guy so did they were did a rod retire did he ever come back from the skate I don't know anything about base for one season he did yeah for one season he came back he got the largest suspension in the history of the game but they reduced it right they reduced it but it remained the largest suspension ultimately was like 160 it was almost like a basically a full season and the following season he came back played about another year remember he was injured for a while I think he actually he might have been injured the following year then came back the year after and then he retired and the Yankees made him like they gave him like a front office job where he would mentor young players really can't make this shit up did really yeah but that is so interesting that he didn't become persona non grata like Jose Canseco did right it's I don't know how quite out to explain it and listen it's been one of the greatest I think reputation rebuilders not even a rebuild remember he was hated Yankees fans used to boo the guy like he was not a beloved figure as a baseball player now he's like my me my mom knows who he is I mean she calls him JLo's boyfriend but she know the bottom line she knows like he this I mean I think they're gonna be studying this case study of like image rehab is gonna be studied for like decades to come in like your glasses calculated I think it was a lot of it was accidental but but like look at he's never even apologized or really admitted what he did he never went on like the may a culpa tour mmm like Lance Armstrong I'm positive no he never failed a test I yeah see that's part of it like he was on this shady doctors dockets how the fuck did the doctor used the right name like that's that's what's so crazy like why did you use his name what do you mean why did you use a Rodriguez how about use a pseudonym well if you remember Tony was doing a lot of cocaine at the time right and he was like it he was like in a in a fucking spiral his whole life was he was about to hit rock bottom while he was running this business now what's funny is so his medical records there was some file folders but lot of them were in composition books like just old school CVS like what you used in the movies yeah that's so that's why that's C I can I keep wrote in and he would scribble in so those rubies but he'd write patient nicknames and DOS and then some of it would just be like stream-of-consciousness like middle school girl like journal like he would write his name in different fonts he would come up with different like business ideas and plans and and make signs you know for like his businesses and and talk about motivational speaking ideas that he hadn't it was like it's a real journey like into into his mind if a cocaine-addicted fades after just an interesting journey I gotta tell you but like he I so these composition books on some pages there'd be like code names like um you know he had a guy that was like you know that he would name after cars or named after be like mijo or little Spanish words or things like that um he had a player when he bought he brought him like he bought him an SUV of some kind so he like you know he code named him like Tahoe or whatever the fucking car was you know another one was DUI because he just gotten a DUI so that was like the good but then like after a while he just kind of abandon it and then was like eh Rodriguez or Alex Rodriguez by the way there's a shit ton of Alex Rodriguez is in Miami but when you start seeing a rod in the books it's kind of a kind of a tell you know a little bit just got sloppy you know like fucking drug addicts what does that guy do now well he's five five years off off of cocaine which is good he went to federal prison and rightfully so for the kids for the high school kids that he uh yeah when the judge sentenced him specifically said you know it's one thing for consenting adults to engage in this behavior it's another thing for you to drag kids into this mess and potentially poison them so he went to federal prison get this he winds up in a camp so it's like minimum security federal prison in Alabama and he winds up teaching impart a nutrition class to his fellow inmates he's in there with Jeff Skilling of Enron who's teaching a business class Ezreal inmates and Jesse Jackson jr. who's teaching a political science and civics course to their fellow inmates they say prison is the best place to to learn and so we actually so one of my you know we were running out of money on this movie and so as you always do with movies and and so there's a couple scenes that we wanted to do that we ran out we just couldn't do we had to cut him from the schedule so one of them was an epilogue with all the kids in federal prison like jumpsuits and like Tony teaching and like a little baby Jesse Jackson jr. a little baby Jeff Skilling from Enron a little baby and another thing to another thing Bosh was doing is he was like you see him at the beginning of the movie sitting at the bar at the Ritz Carlton keep his gain and he's writing little protocols on a fucking cocktail napkin for the bartenders on how to build muscle how to lose weight so he was doing that in prison for inmates for like vitamins and supplements that they could buy in the commissary he would like he be like hey yo dr. T I want to I'm trying to build muscle mass maybe okay here here's a pro go to the commissary buy these vitamins of these sublet and there you take it this time that yo Tony I'm looking to lose weight what do I do and he give him and then guards started coming to him like hey I'm looking at my wife wants to lose some weight or well yeah he'd give him verticals yeah so I mean he's very I told you he's very much a true believer in himself he's got a lot of faith in himself and he for a while was planning on opening a nutritional supplement business across the street from Marlins Park my my hosts are brilliant like this is pretty recently it hasn't happened yet but like he's looking around for new for new opportunity and Miami is a is a land of new opportunity I told you this last time I saw you that it's an old saying that I love that la is where you go and you want to be somebody New York is where you go and you are somebody and Miami's where you go and you want to be somebody else it's just it's not only a town of reinvention it's like it just always been a sunny place for shady people I just always wanted to know what happens to a fake doctor who gets busted selling steroids to kids what does that guy do for a living afterwards I think now he's I suspect now he's just sort of being you know subsidized by family and friends right now he does have kids and child support probably two to make somehow I don't know exactly what he's up to I'll ask him the next time I'm gonna see him this weekend it's in two days yeah oh yeah he does and and he's quite it's quite funny he's quite uh sober ish ish ish well I think he still drinks but he doesn't he doesn't do colas it drugs in him yeah and that was that was that was bad for a while yeah I'm sure yeah that's always the bad decision-making route what's what's funny about this is that he so we caught him like on his way into federal prison originally so in November of 2013 Alex was in the midst of the arbitration that you see at the end you know we that we portray at the end of the movie in Amal MLB's offices in Manhattan and we got a call from his publicist and his publicist says yo what alex is on a break from the arbitration and he's coming down to Miami he's got an office in Coral Gables which is just like very wealthy affluent suburb adjacent to the city of Miami and it's actually the city where the University of Miami is located for Alex Rodriguez field is at UM on campus and so they said listen Alex would like to meet with you to talk about possibly doing some kind of tell-all documentary geez this is November 2013 so I'm like yes please yeah so I figured like this is a hush-hush meeting you know we're and do this on the down-low at his office and Coral Gables they say meet us some weekday high noon at Hill Stone restaurant which is the Power Lunch spot in that neighborhood the most prominent corner in the city floor-to-ceiling windows open kitchen everybody from the street to the dishwasher can see everything going on in that dining room they want to meet us there at noon so I'm like oh okay we go there slammed every seat taken mob scene around the host and three four deep at the bar they escort us down the center me and my producer Alfred Spellman right the center aisle parade us practically and you know ESPN in the 34 30s they really fetishized the directors so like they have like video interviews with us like you know in bumpers like every hour like little little segments and so people sometimes recognize me usually in Miami like close to UM because we did the um you know dock so if there's any play any place I was going to be recognized it was two miles from the University of Miami and so take us right down the middle and they're in the center booth on this elevated platform around the back is Alex Rodriguez holding court wheeler so we literally have like step up on stage to join him and like all eyes are on us in this place and I don't know what we kind of get introduced and I need like an icebreaker so I'm like so who's gonna call page six you were us sure as shit two weeks later was in page six and so we sit there and um Alex didn't laugh the publicist laugh that's like a publicist joke you know yes so because it was clear that we were there to be seen having this meeting yeah it was so clear why do you think they did the it was it was part of Alex's when you said was there a plan there was kind of a plan it was part of Alex's like PR offensive or push back against major league baseball and so we sat there with him for almost an hour and a half and he just lied just lied to us um the whole time and I didn't know that I'm not a about everything I never met Tony posh this is all people you look at my records I you know I my performance didn't improve after the time he claims to have been treating me I'm not a baseball fan I'm like you to me they I call it screensaver all right I I just but my producing partner Alfred is a degenerate baseball thing he gets look the fuckin mlb.com package has it on his desk on his iPad all day long during the season I'm just like I I mean I guess he does that instead of ambien you know I'm less sleep eating with baseball I guess I don't know so he's just like but he's a huge baseball fan and when I left I was like he made a lot of good points Alex did often fucking lied about everything and I can't blame him he lied to everybody in those days I mean he was in a he was desperately trying to salvage his his career and his legacy and he allegedly lied to the DEA in a queen for a day meeting who the fuck lies in a queen for a day meeting other than George papadopolis I mean your support the whole point is you're supposed to tell the truth that they're not gonna kind of fuck with you but but he allegedly did that so does a queen for the immediate so Queen for at a meeting with the feds you get a letter for it they're like we're investigating we you're a witness an investigation we understand you may have participated in some illegality or committed some crimes in the course of this larger investigation but we're not after you we just want you to come in feel comfortable and free to tell the truth to our investigators so that we can pursue our investigation accurately and fairly and we will not whatever anything you say will not be held against you essentially in a court of law so your queen for a day they call it you get a letter queen for a day letter and the hexley called they call a queen for a day and so I don't know that's the thing the feds have and so Alex was free to just speak the only thing you can't do is lie to a federal agent mmm that is a crime and that is in fact I think what George papadopolis was ultimately he lied in his queen for a day meeting the whole point of a queen for a day meeting is to tends to not lie and not in because you can't get in trouble essentially for any crimes that you admit there about the investigation so that was the allegations that he actually lied so I listen I'm a documentarian people lied to me for a living I'm I'm fine with that especially because they spelled my name right in page six and that shit was in bold I don't have the juice to make that happen Alex's Alex his publicist had the juice to make to make that happen I was flattered that they you know write about me but like but you didn't think that he was lying I suspected he wasn't telling us the whole truth but I thought he made some interesting points in Alfred to Alfred had was a picture in high school North Miami Beach Senior High go chargers and Alfred had actually pitched against Alex Rodriguez is like one of his only war stories from his baseball years in high school right is that Alex was a senior I think Alfred was going to some sort of Ron Frasier baseball camp at a um and they did the summer league game and Alfred this is I'm my eyes are glazing over telling this story but like Alfred Alfred's pitches against a ride and who was already a senior already a beast everybody knew this guy was gonna was gonna go in the draft and be huge everybody knew about that that he had been the talk of the high school baseball community in Miami forever and so Alfred pitched against him and he held a rod to a triple of course Alec you know a rod smacked the shit out of this ball sailed away but he he was it was only a triple wasn't it was a rare not homerun for Alec so I thought oh we have like a funny personal anecdote like we can find some common ground here right you're talking to someone who might be a potential interview subject you know and so I'm like actually Alex you and Alfred have met before alpha rolls his eyes like he's gonna embarrass me and tell this dumb shit story so I tell out like isn't this funny like you guys but and Alfred held you to a triple and he kind of looked at me like you're looking at me right now he's just he was totally unamused and maybe looked even a little hurt or offended this is the greatest baseball one of the greatest baseball players of all time the highest paid baseball player in history and here I'm just telling this cute story from like twenty years earlier or whatever and he seemed like I held me to a triple I'm like how could you be upset about that you're one of the greatest of all time like super winners but it's like yeah it's it's that's why I left I was like this guy's a really interesting character like he's a complicated guy he's an interesting guy's a sensitive guy like I was curious about him I was excited about the prospect of interviewing him and man they finally ghosted us out yeah the January of 2014 that's when they lowered they reduced his suspension I started hitting up every month I started hitting up the publicist Joe following up on that meeting you know because it's funny in the page six article it mentioned he met with the 34:30 filmmakers Billy Corbin Alfred Spellman he's been shopping a book proposal to these publishers the book proposal thing was total bunk literally not true the the the publishers are like we'd love to get one but we haven't gotten a book proposal from a-rod he really did have the meeting with us but like everything was just we were just kind of pong in his game which is cool whatever I respond to this documentary not exactly but I for like six or seven months I'm emailing with the publicist and then it was clear that they weren't interested so and that became the tactic by the way when you said was there a strategy the strategy was to shut the fuck up hmm and just like like you said like with the president big New York Times big escandalo a scandal or expose and then maybe if we just tomorrow in this 24-hour news cycle in this fucking in this world of just being us being hammered with bad news you know in 240 characters every nanosecond of every day just shit just passes and they just they they played it just so so beautifully and brilliantly and then almost a year later we got a call from a friend of Tony Bosch you guys want to meet with Tony Bosch he wants to talk to you about doing a documentary like hell yeah so we take the meeting really interesting guy meet with him several times over several months and then he says listen I want to do this interview he goes I'm getting sentenced to prison tomorrow and we knew about that you know that the case was ongoing he said but look I expect the judge will give me 45 to 60 days to surrender to complete this drug rehab program I'm in and then I'm only gonna get like a year and a half two years in prison and so we could find a couple days before I have to surrender to do this interview they say I don't like dude listen let's see what happens tomorrow I was like depending on how much time the judge gives you like you're going to prison one way or another like maybe you want to spend some time with your kids get your affairs in order let's make a decision tomorrow whether or not we're gonna take two three four days out of your life for this maybe we'll do it when you get out right into an you know in a year and a half two years federal you do at least 80% of your time but then you go to halfway house sometimes for a little bit at the end on six months or as long as a year so he goes he goes to court the judge says four years and you have not 45 to 60 days to surrender but 45 to 60 minutes to surrender give me your you know take off your belt in your shoelaces and well surrender to to the Bo P and he did and so we back burn again I got a fucking email from Tim L Frank who is the Woodward and Bernstein of the case he's they the journalist who got the stolen records from Porter Fisher the whistleblower and blew the lid off the whole thing at the beginning of 2013 he says to me Porter Fisher called me and he's asking me for your number to discuss possibly doing a documentary with you I was like first of all like we sometimes don't make documentaries about things that we make documentaries about things that happen like 20 30 40 years ago this felt like it hadn't ripened yet like it was still a fresh wound you know like people wouldn't be willing to talk like you have to kind of wait for more time to pass you know and here we are and I'm not a spiritual guy I don't really believe in the universe talking to me or anything but I thought man if ever someone was trying to tell us something it was like you got to make this documentary the three primary players in this major baseball scandal all independently of each other contacted us within just over a year to talk about doing a documentary about at night alfrid jokes that in Florida when you get out of prison your first call is to your mother your second calls to raconteur to our company you know to talk about a documentary and tony got out I hit up Tony I'm like I'll come visit you in Alabama how much time did you have to do he wound up getting a sentence reduction he did just about two years and then he was in that camp in Alabama I wrote him I said dude I'm gonna come up and visit you we talked about this he said I'll be in a halfway house in six months so let's just meet in Miami I was like done and then when you meet Porter and you meet Tony and you see them their interviews in the documentary you realize like well Alex this isn't even about Alex you know it's like this is about these guys in this crazy you know Carl Hiaasen desk like Coen Brothers botched robbery like story no and so like that was a story we wanted to to tell and that was the Tony Porter part of the story well listen dude you fucking nailed it it's a great documentary I really enjoyed it like I really enjoy all of them and just keep on fucking knock it out of the park man thank you a baseball
