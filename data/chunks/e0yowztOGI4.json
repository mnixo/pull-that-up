seeing something on your Instagram that it's it's still not signed yet though you're disappointed in that very disappointed no Lucas Brown trying to avoid it or what's happiness T like I've been through so much the last couple of years with Wilder with clips Cole with different with hey this I fooled on Hayes on the car I went over to England shoutout to the UK I loved it my second home I was big a big fuel injection about how what I'm doing right now because I went over there and I've never felt that type of love anywhere in the world like for myself to go where you know we speak the same way in which we speak their language you know just to have the love man that's just incredible everywhere I go let's go champ you know it's just amazing man I don't really put a lot into me what I'm doing right now but you decided to go over there and get an apartment because I was flat on my ass champ and I was like you know trying to move up in the rankings I gave everybody a call-out Heyman every LaBella everybody everybody the Cubans I gave everybody that call was like yo I'm trying to get back in the game nobody believed in me Chris Lawrence Holmes like y'all I believe in you and that's why I was like you know what Chris he said your you a little crazy I said I am I be diagnosed a little crazy I suffer from PTSD this is true you know said but uh well I'm exciting and I'm gonna make it happen because I'm gonna believe nothing could stop me Chad you look at me nothing can stop me I don't care who you get whoever say they could beat me they lying because when we put doing the bell ring champ I'm a whole different person because I'm charged look at me look at what I've been through look what I'm telling you you can hear the emotion in my voice the pain still lay a champ I'm

not also not stupid I'm not gonna fight fights for me for guys for pennies that's meaningless that's gonna beat me up I'm 44 be 45 already guys but so much limit on his body I'm a heavyweight I fought George Foreman champ I fought Vitali Klitschko champ for free by the way we'll talk about that later I for transfer both dreamer sir you feel me now for some big punches George Foreman so for me I'm not gonna go down I'm not gonna fight every guy out there just to try to build myself I'm a former two-time heavyweight champ in the world that alone should get me a title fight that alone that's how it used to be guys have come out of retirement from the from the beginning from the Sullivan days and he knows no fights and got a title fight what drives me crazy is you're so marketable that's what drives me sir you were in the UFC no prunella note the best ever they would be lining up fights for you left and right if you were in the UFC listen champ I know I know now that's another story in itself 1993 or for my awaits is his name right he sold the UFC today in the right yeah in 2001 call Rob right now he tell you who his boyish Shannon Briggs he was sitting on the couch with me waiting for Mark Roberts to come home to talk to try to get mark to kick to are going with him with the UFC well boxing is hard to get fights lined up because there's so many different conflicting performance promoters and different you know a piece of the pie and then it's hard to get fighters to agree to fight someone like you who's dangerous yeah I'm you know I'm fast I punch hard and I got a chin so you know they only cannot know one thing that I run out of gas and I say this all the time champ if you if your biggest asset is hoping that I run out of guys you fucked up this is my language eyes boys and girls don't apology let's stop excuse me I apologize boys and girls you messed up if your own if you relying on me running out of gas that's should be that showed you going to a fight took my Magisto be one of the guys you already lost champ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
