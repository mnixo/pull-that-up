the girag and experience you know and I think first of all the style of comedy that you and I come from too you get very spoiled for a certain particular type of colleague Boston comedy is a very specific kind of comedy if you stop and think about how many good comics have come from Boston you know Jay Leno came from Boston Steven Reich came from Boston guys that people don't know that are probably better than 90% of the fucking people that are like big-name comics like Gavin Don Gavin's one of the funniest guys ever walked the face of the earth yeah he's he's a monster he's I guess turtle I think it's all like the East Coast I think all the way down to like DC the amount of guys but I think that's also by all something was rare because because we're from yeah Boston does have because they didn't leave they didn't leave those guys stayed there no one left Boston the big monsters Steve Sweeney Kenny Rogers in those Don Gavin Mike Donovan the when I was a kid okay and I when I first started doing open mics there and those guys were all the national headliners or the local headliners rather they'd be at Nicks and they'd be it right there the connection I remember sitting there watching those guys and they would kind of like some like national guy would come through like Billy Crystal and Billy Crystal would come through and they would put on don gavin steve sweeney and fucking and and Lenny Clarke in a row and then bring up Billy Crystal yeah it wasn't Prevert they did it on purpose yeah yeah they knew that the level of comedy was so high there and these guys were only doing 20 minutes tight the site 20 minutes late doing what they're doing a lot of them were doing local ruckus dude I don't give if you put on for local headliners yeah in front of me if I'm on the road yeah fucked you're fucked you're fucked for the first couple minutes until you can get him into your groove but people love local shit and Boston especially Boston is such a a city that in love with being from Boston so I sentiment was one of my fate his name doesn't get brought up a not enough topic that he used to do that joke about a had some so he his comedy was so blue-collar and I was coming up you know working in warehouses and stuff it was where my both my parents were professional white-collar but I was a moron so I fucked up in school so I had like blue-collar job so his comedy was just right out over the back he did something he had some soda back and forth with the boss and he made this reference you know basically tell him the boss to go fuck himself he said I'll take a 20 minute shit on the clock if I want to and I fucking fell out because it was always that lazy fuck wouldn't help unload the trucks he had every goddamn trick in the book on how to somehow make that eight-hour day go by and one of them was when he would grab the herald of the globe to go take a shit and it would somehow take like fucking 40 minutes every day Donovan was a he's another one he's a master there was a bunch of guys that were around back then I mean they're still around I'm sure Donovan if you live in Boston you could probably find him headlining somewhere I mean still doing comedy I'm sure right I know he ran afoul into the IRS for a bit he owed a lot of those guys that were working for cash for a long time they weren't paying taxes on it I didn't hear anything about that I heard they were all up to date I don't know what you're talking about yeah you're right you know what I misheard I misheard I think those those guys out in Long Island that make some of them did yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I miss her oh here's another one who doesn't get brought up Teddy Bergeron you ever get a chance teddy bear teddy holy shit that guy was good let me tell you something I saw that guy in 1988 I was at an open mic night it was one of the first time so I thought about quitting commie I went up yeah it was an open mic night and I went up and I you know I did my little five minutes of fucking nonsense stupid terrible bad comedy just trying to make people laugh didn't know what the fuck I was doing and didn't go so good you know those early sets it was like one of my third or fourth sets so I'm not so good clumsy you know maybe one laughs and then I fuck it up with a swag punchline and I just didn't know was doing Teddy Bergeron goes up and just so fucking smooth smooth and relaxed and the way he would talk just like mesmerizing and I had heard about his Tonight Show fucking said he had just done at the night show and somebody had a video of it and they played the video and he plays the fucking piano he does like this talks about commercials and he plays the piano and talk someone it's so fucking smooth and so good you would look at Amiga okay this guy's going to be gigantic this guy's going to be bigger than Robin Williams he's going to be the biggest stand-up comic of the country never left Boston just stayed yeah they all stayed I don't yeah they were there what it was like founding like townies but but comedians but that got work they all got work in Boston they didn't have to leave see when they were working at Nick's comedy stop and they were working at you know stitches and all these different clubs they could hop around from Club to club like there's a that that that you see that documentary Alameda did yeah and up stood out yeah and you know Lenny Clarke talks about all the different sets that he did he would do all these different sets at night now we go from here to there and they are there and they're there and close they'd be making fifteen hundred bucks a night yeah and he just hire a driver here's the wait outside and do all the sets what I love about those guys is there was almost like a height requirement to like they were all like fucking 6-2 6-3 huge guys and they could like literally would have like a keg of beer over one shoulder and like an eight ball in their hand and would just be going from Club to club destroys drawing and hammered and do it blow all the way just to keep their buzz going and then and then to the end of the night dude I heard some fuck that that back room at Nick's man somehow they offered to pay me in Coke what yeah they would offer to pay you coke yeah that was the deal do you think you do coke no no we could pay in Coke no I'll take cash yeah take what the fuck like I thought that was a joke I didn't realize they pay you in Coke they were they offer to pay you in Coke I mean that was a lot of guys did a lot of guys got some of the money in Coke because I guess our comedians on porn stars to to careers that can get paid in Coke if it had to come down to yeah I would say probably bands too probably a lot of bands a portion of boxers back in the DJs they'd give you some chips you ever see that I know it was just a photo op thing they ever see that that great picture sonny liston yeah where he looks like he just knocked somebody out he's sitting there still in his boxer trunks hands taped up I think his hands were on but I that had to been a promotional even even those mob guys do that come on Sonny let's get you show a little shit don't you think the starting out in Boston was like one of the best places you could have ever chose to begin your comedy career I think about that a lot so learn it whenever I think about that cuz when did you start what year I started in March of 92 I was like 23 almost 24 so I started a little bit late and I remember just some of the times like when I've gone on the road and and you meet the young the up-and-coming guys like ya the comedy scene here sucks and blah blah blah blah blah like like it sucks so bad like don't even know what to do yeah and you always tell them but just go out and start a room like some of them like you know the scene so bad they don't even think of doing that I can't even start room and say go pick a fucking sports bar that does no business on a Monday Tuesday and tell them that you're going to get people in here you know lie to them that you know you're gonna get people to come in to watch these fucking open my kurz do five minutes each do the first time I eat my fucking balls on stage I was doing this place like Kelly's something or other in either reading or North reading it doesn't exist anymore this comedian Jack Lynch booked it and they would literally be like a Bruins game on TV and they wouldn't shut the game on fuck no no you had to do comedy over the game yeah and the volume for the game was still on - yeah a lot of those gigs down the Cape I did a lot of those gigs and you'd find out the fucking games on why you got they like fucked the game they're gonna leave the game on that was like an always an issue yeah I'm gonna leave the game and if the said are we're gonna turn the game off they would turn the game off everybody go what the fuck I'm fucking shot in the game off you shot in the foot and then you would have to go do comedy for a bunch of people were angry at you for shutting the game oh it was brutal and I remember the second question other than I gonna shut the game off is is is there a stage yeah another thing now yeah so you just stand you just stand with over the to it I'm ever doing a gig this is how Green River was me al del bene Patrice O'Neal and I want to say Dane Cook was on it and we were so Bobby Kelly I think it was his gig that he booked we were so green and years later I finally figured it out they gave us this microphone it was a lapel mic oh my so he had to go up and and do comedy with just like a lapel on like we were doing Letterman but we were so green we didn't know that you clipped it on Syria all standing there holding I swear to God holding a lapel mic I remember Patrice he's like fucking six five hold it because I remember that's right del bene al del bene was hosting is like what the fuck is up with this Mike he's like this is a smallest mic ever look I'll put it had it in his mouth and we're all laughing at them like yeah what a half-assed fucking gang we were so stupid that we didn't understand what it was and like he would let it I would bring me up and then hand me the mic like a teacup with his pinkies out picking out and I would just be like eh keep it going oh yeah my dad was he was pretty nuts growing up with like three fingers up in the air holding this thing and I went from that to to from from going to talk window straight in to go into comedy kickboxing I had a few key three kickboxing fights and then I went right into comedy cuz I knew it I was going nowhere so there's no money in it was your opening like stand-up was it about like donating alright now I never talk was it really intense was like hello this is my comic I tried it I ve got to talk about your life no I never talked about that there's no one wants to think that some fucking guy's a martial arts champion and that's the thing because he was actually good at like this that you gotta be have like low self-esteem right you could say you know if you could say uh fun to talk window tournament once and I fought on Friday and when I finally woke up on Tuesday you know after some God yeah so now I'm doing a comedy everybody would like you can't say that oh so I fucking kicked this dude in the head knocked him into a coma that's not funny dude but I mean when I when I started out though there was like you know because all those all those headliners didn't leave we were like how the fuck do you end up headlining we were looking at the only guys who kind of busted through was you and Anthony Clark with the two guys at the time who would actually somehow gotten past the old boy network yeah well they left you know Anthony was one of the nicked Apollo left two they just left you know you had to leave you can't stay in Boston it was so intoxicating because you can make a living you could be in Boston and even if you were a nobody you know you're still you could grind out five hundred bucks a week you know you do here do here as long as you're willing to drive and travel if you get 500 hours cash a week you could pay for your bills you could eat but if you want to try to go on the road man good fucking life no TV credits no nothing just some guy from Boston how much are they gonna pay you but your fucking gas your airfare is gonna eat up all your profits it's fucking hard it's what are you uh what do you think now because I just went back to Boston given back there lately yeah yeah it's sad there's nothing going on there now what is the fucking the comedy connections a theater now you know it's that big Wilbur theater but you common connection you to be 150 seats that badass little room and now it's you know no but they they reopened that right up the street the old Charles Street play out yeah what's it now ah it's another comedy club called I can't remember there's a small one in Faneuil Hall called Motley's I did that's at Tim Mackenzie's place I can't remember I did I ran through all those 80 it was like it was like an eighty five seater I did dick Tori's comedy vault but I put together my basically polished up my first five minutes material ever so I always go down there the vault oh yeah did I fucking love that place and this is thing hasn't changed it like I remember when that place started is how fucking old I am now and now it's they just like celebrated I said Tim Mackenzie I'm sorry like something Tim McIntyre I think it started in 93 yeah why was he late yeah I was a year earlier than that son no no no the vault kicked our DS comedy vault anti something that shit was around in the 80s alright because in 88 when I was around the dick Doherty commonly bought was around Victoria Stanton Remington's yeah that fucking Bank it's like a bank Wow it's a vault I thought I thought spike Tobin was the first guy who opened that shit up might have reopened it mighta reopened it okay that's it might have went under and they brought it back but dick Daugherty's comedy vault was a staple back when I was living there and I moved out of Boston like 92 yeah you were gone before right when I started you were already gone um yeah what the fuck was I working at I think I was first time I saw I saw you what the Kowloon oh that place that was a good place yeah that area too and comedy still a Shia Chinese food and comedies a weird combination exists in Boston like the base the most famous historical comedy club in Boston was the ding ho so a Chinese restaurant that they had comedy out of and now the only place that exists that place that a Rick Jenkins runs he runs a place in Cambridge yeah and that's the UH that's another the Chinese restaurant his restaurant and upstate even how many labs that what they call it yeah member the lyac the cool cool yeah coo coo and then the other place is Mike Clark's plays giggles and Saugus yeah you know but there's more work in Boston or the at least there was like just little road gigs an hour drive here hour drive there more of those in that area than anywhere else in the country no when I would talk to guys from like other places and I'm like where's your Road gig so where do you go for Road gigs oh you know sometimes I do Ohio sometimes like what do you got no don't you have gigs around here like no one could make a living around there yeah but I have to war there's no nobody nobody would start like I don't know what if I bought people would just start rooms don't it Bob Marley out of Maine he came down like a fully-formed fucking headliner just because he had like 25 rooms going up in Maine like he started basically it was like McDonald's having started with like com Reese's to tell me when he was living up there and it was getting so big he actually ended up leaving because he almost became I think like a kind of almost like a club owner at that point he could have done it but he basically started the comedy scene up there because before that all they had was like the connection but like Portland yeah yeah and he start like he had a Tenney's before that I used to do gigs in Bangor and Bob would do like guest spots and shit when he was first starting out Bobby I don't know if you know how famous he is in Maine do you know oh yeah no no I yeah he's like if you don't know who Bob Marley is very funny guy very nice guy I've known him for fucking 20 plus years always been at just a great guy but when he first started out you know there was like this is like you know probably he probably started out in 89 or 90 there's no one known from for being from Maine there's no like one main comic that stands out but Bob Marley in anywhere else in the country is like people might have heard of him they might have heard him on XM radio you might have seen my Comedy Central or something in Maine that motherfucker is huge oh yeah there's probably no comparison it's like no they were delicious or Gabriel Iglesias in in LA is giant Gabriel Iglesias does shows in LA well he'll do like five shows on a Monday night like something fucking nutty and sell out everyone like days and days in advance right that's how he is nobody else is like that ya know he used to go mmm bees tell me he would basically be in LA auditioning and then every year right as the holidays came around he would make like 10 times what I made on the road in that month yeah just should be talking about his money but yeah he would just go up there and do parties and then he do the New Year's thing and do this movie like tires in he would do like a like a 1500 2000 seater he do be doing like adding shows and yeah and doing all this main material you know so much mean like I was listening to him on the radio the other day was on XM radio is doing all these main jokes fine it was doing him in Maine they were going crazy they were fucking going oh and he also dude he has like a box set that's how many albums this dude is put out he's put out like 16 albums 14 Alba's fucking unbelievable credible the amount hours 14 hours of fucking material I kind of I pretty much have stuck close with the same guys that I started like my graduating class Bobby Kelly al del bene you know I knew BER when I first started in Patrice because we kind of came up like a little bit after you like you were a couple years ahead headlining and I did a bunch of really fun little gigs for dick Doherty the Comi huts remember those comedy Hut's yeah the light show Cambridge that we did dick tours come home yeah we are cool macaques Dain was with a comedy troupe with Bob Kelly in him and al del bene oh so it was a good comedy troupe you guys were funny it was good you know it was interesting you would do Tommy sketches and then you would do like each guy would go up and do stand-up right and so we would work together do these dick tardy gigs those were fucking fun our sketch comedy improv group was was so bad we were so bad at improv and everybody you know the first rule of improv is don't deny but we were so bad at improv that our first rule was denied so we were just commanding completely ruined scenes by like you're pretending pantomiming I'm holding a baby and just Bobby can be big did why are you holding a tire and you just it would just fall apart from there but we just had a bug I've had some good ones you had some good sketches with a couple against cuts it was fun I mean it was it and it was experimental I was like you guys were taking chances you were doing something a little unusual at a comedy club Jan you were doing comedy - yeah that was probably actually better for us opening with our stand-up and then we just go fuck around and do music or skits or improv or whatever for you know whatever the rest of the hour to fill it out but we we also you know we came out of Boston where you know I know the guys that I can't I mean I loved I loved Steve Martin and the guys that I always loved just watching growing up that I wanted to emulate and then when I started in Boston these guys were like killers man well people don't understand about Boston is everybody knows all these famous guys but he knows Billy Crystal everybody knows you know I mean in very good comics Robert Klein but ah blah blah blah name the guy Don Gavin was better than all of them yeah he was better than all of them this is not this is not an exaggeration and he was fuckin squeaky-clean I mean every now and then he said fuckin fuck fuck a little listener but that his bits were not dirty it was delivery was perfect right it was perfect you would watch his economy of words the way he said a sentence up and you would just feel humbled you would be like fuck he's a master yeah he's a master but he got caught up in this Boston thing where there was all these great guys in this one area and they always drew a crowd and they always got paid well and then they would go on the road and they'd be nobody said why would I be a fuckin nobody gotta be back back in Boston actually another back in Boston and they're just doing the same gigs over and over again when everybody else takes a shot and branches off and disappears and becomes famous and it but you really would watch these guys and part of you would feel bad that they weren't getting over the hump but you felt like so fucking honored to be opening up and standing watching going I'm learning from the best so when you leave Boston it's like you had that these were guys like I always describe it like they had the energy of showman but they were like men they were like men doing comedy yes yes and I you know I always really wanted to be there they always stood right at the fuck in front of the stage you're real any Clark is the perfect example when ladies a fucking man's guy this is what lady Clark said was we were a giggles in Saugus and there was his fucking table full of chicks they wouldn't shut the fuck up they were screaming and yelling goes listen if you don't shut the fuck up I'm gonna hire and they're gonna fuck you in front of your mother like what the fuck it is say mean it was me I think Chris McGuire was there I think it was me and Chris I can't remember we were like what the fuck did you say he doesn't give a fuck yeah Lenny Clark did not give a fuck he was just his big gigantic burly guy who would by the way he would beat your ass too whoo this is bit like if you like talk shit to Lenny Clark he'll probably you know do a line and punch in the fááá-- these were real like real hardcore blue-collar guys but really hilarious but it made us it made us char because you were held up to a much higher standard you had to go on after guys who were way better than average and you had a you had to be sharp all the time you had it you had to constantly reassess your material self up for that kind of you still look back and remember the first time you ever bombed yeah oh yeah a bunch of them I just wrote called New York I just I just wrote a chapter in this book I'm riding all on the very first time I ever bombed a horrible terrible disaster that I'll never forget because was the first time I ever bombed while I was getting paid oh that's a big difference yeah Bobby had open mic nights everybody's bombing you know it's like there's like five people are gonna eat shit on stage you're only up there for five minutes but once you do a payday and I was middling I shouldn't have been meddling I really didn't have the time and the guy went on before me fucking crushed and there was this chick that I had seen the last time I was there and she was super hot I fucked her and she was in the front row and she brought her friends and her friends look and they were gonna sit in the front row when I went on stage so I was panicking I was like they're gonna be like right in front of me I was like a year in accommodate year-and-a-half yeah yes and this guy went up who was the emcee was way better than me he was already better than me and I was like I conned this fucking booked me into making me a middle I was like it's a cocky do shows like I could be back in middle come on in middle so he lets women on this guy goes on stage and strews and he stopped doing comedy it's really too bad he's a natural I don't remember his name unfortunately but he fucking killed and then I went after him an eight just dry bricks of shit with no water for 20 minutes it was the most embarrassing feeling I'd ever had in my life I couldn't believe how unbearable and her and her friends were like looking at each other and her friends would lean over and say some like oh no and then I could hear crickets and I'm trying to be like extra loud because I'm trying to like be trying to bring her back to my side so like you like force the punchlines and the timings all even worse and my only experience with being nervous before my only experience with pressure had been fighting so when you know fighting in tournaments you know if you're nervous you just turn inward and you say this is mine I do this I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do someone fucking explode I'm stoked cool cold yes terrified but you just get psyched up to go which is the worst thing you could ever do on stage to be nervous and aggressive fucking and all introspective and turned in yourself I can fuck with a gentleman just gonna grow the worst mindset ever for comedy that's called being Carlos Mencia I'm gonna turn it in I'm going to explode the most feed I had a shoe I ever do shows without microphones oh yeah yeah everybody's ever do a bachelor mother like I did yeah I used to do like colleges around Boston where they'd hire me and I'd be like where this I'd be standing on a pool table did my mom stand did one in the cafeteria standing on a cafeteria chair table yeah riki table like I couldn't move that was their stage I did a place in in Florida called The Rathskeller they hired me to come down and do like one of my first Road gigs and it was the thing where it's like there's food being served during the TVs are on like all that shit works like the whole everything is happening and I'm doing stand-up and like somebody threw a hot dog at me like five minutes into an hour oh those gigs are so important man all those shit gigs that Boston Comedy used to book and all those little weird fucking places in New Hampshire you would drive an hour and a half up to you know New Hampshire and do some weird bar with a tinny sound system yeah those are so good though when you look back at it now it's how important were those like for developing your ability to like focus on stage and kill and cut the fat out of your act and driving home from or no main once I got a gig up there and it was the first time in a few years and I drove home and I'm like all right this this matters even though it was horrible I was like this matters it this someday I will look back on tonight know that like I learned fucking something here oh man but it was never look back yeah you do those gigs and you just like wow like this is this doesn't even feel like show business it feels like I did a thing with this guy Scott Papac URI he used to book the Mattapoisett in it's a little tiny shithole no but it was a great little room where I got to see Teddy Bergeron by the way who was a fucking genius yes one of the best comics ever one of the best comics ever had one of the best Tonight Show sets of all time I ever see is Tonight Show so yeah it's it's fucking genius another guy were you like how could this guy not be in everybody's you know mine as one of the greatest comics ever yeah and this guy Scott I booked a gig for he and I on Block Island and block islands like an island outside of Rhode Island I there and there's nothing there it's just drunk retarded fishermen and they are dumb as fuck and they're so drunk they are all of them there's maybe 20 people in the room all of them are so drunk they can't even keep their eyes open their mouths are sliding let's go we have to do comedy for them oh and Scott gets up and starts shitting all over them and he was not really you know he hadn't been doing comedy that long then really probably shouldn't but on stage right in this sort of a situation anyway and I went on after him and they had already turned their backs to the comedy show and half of them there turned their backs just started a conversation and we had to stay in a it wasn't it wasn't in a hotel room it was in a supply room they had two cots in a Cell hi room with no shower and there was a bathroom you know we could take like you know a whore's bath yeah a horse bath and you know we stayed in this little fucking supply room until we could catch the boat back the next day oh man I did so many of those little Waimea colleges where there's really no me psyched I got a gig I know at the time yeah at the time you're like alright I get a gig I'm making fifty bucks or whatever it was but oh man brutal Bangor Maine I did a bunch up there yeah I did a bunch for normal ofoh he had all these gigs in western Massachusetts yes way out there we had to drive 40 miles an hour because deer would jump in front of your fucking car every five minutes you had to be careful that you didn't die like you get these certain get work shear shows yeah especially Western Mass yes out near Amherst I remember there was a lot of two-lane roads where you would see dead deer all over the place right fucking wrecked cars yeah I nailed one one night did you yeah yeah just as just his ass had just gotten past me and I did the thing where I gunned it I'm like I wanted to swerve the voice was like got it and I fucking hit him and I watched him spin off into the woods did you Greg and I started out probably within like a week of each other yeah right yeah back in Boston the old Boston stitches comedy community you know and dude we you and I have gone through fucking can we went to some crazy gigs in the big getting men we went through together we went through like the darkest time for stand-ups well the early days yeah we went through our personal darkest days but at the lightest time in commonest time I thought the way you know I mean we were I see young comics today and my heart breaks because they got a scrounge up stage time you and I you know I would say but less than a year into doing stand-up we were driving out and making 50 bucks cash yeah I've six nights a week it was for me it was exactly one year I first got paid by Norm Lefou to open up for Warren MacDonald Peking garden I don't know where it was with some bar I was on ass like an Apple box like literally like standing on an Apple box dude comedy can't fucking move and you know I had a good time and then the next time I lurked for Lenny Clark there's a two times in a row I got super lucky normal ofoh like got me oh you shot up you motherfucker man it was like all of us were like there was this ascension you would go you'd wait in line to get a spot on on comedy hell open mic night stitches comedy club George McDonald welcome to comedy hell where the jokes always die the comedian is this whole thing and and we ran out of booze comedy hell where you can flat fly as high as the lights on Broadway or crash and burn in the fiery pit known only as comedy hell and that was step one and then you and then you would get like a guest spot on a real show and then you would start to get these like you know 25 to 50 dollar emcee spots where you were driving the headliner somewhere and you jump past all that shit because they would send you out to feature and the headliners couldn't follow you because you were out of your fucking mind I mean you were nuts and and so they had to headline you so you started working like the D rooms but headlining them so you started to get an hour together super fast yeah I had to had a sink or swim there's times when Greg and I would make agreements to steal each other shit we were bombing yeah hey dude you got my whole act if you're eating dick up there feel free to just and he would come back do that blowjob joke killed if you go back to Peabody you might want to wait out of three yeah yeah me wanna let but he let the heat die out of that joke it was fun for us cuz we knew we would neither one of us shit there was a point in time where both of us were doing like middling gigs and we really didn't have the time we really didn't have a real solid half-hour so it's sometimes you just it when you when were when you're a young comic and you slip in the beginning you're set like the odds of you pulling yourself out of the fire oh yeah I remember one time I was having a good set and I knocked over a drink and I didn't address it yeah that was it the audience turned on me didn't do I was the smell blood yep they knew I was scared they knew I was killing we're all about there it's all about their uncomfort and you denying I remember being on this was probably the cruelest thing anybody ever did to me when I was on stage it was like you know half filled room back it was always like the back of a Chinese restaurant where they had a banquet room yeah that they just put a microphone up and call it a comedy night and I'm up there tanking it and I'm not acknowledging that I'm tanking it and during one of the silences that should have had laughter in it after one of my jokes I heard this middle-aged woman whisper to her husband I could hear a whisper and she just goes the poor bastard Oh worse than any heckle Oh God Jesus Christ it just you know you it would be real hard when we'd watch each other you know you watch a friend eat dick in the beginning too cuz you know how devastating it yeah you know there's some times where you know this guy is not gonna pull himself out of this and he has 15 more minutes to go yeah oh yeah watch him slosh through it up there is there a way out of it do you what do you have to do like do you just have to avoid op or do you just we would just make a lot of the material that's where we'd cover yeah that's where we'd steal any I reach oh I knew that there were grenades that I had in my waistband that were joking yes that there was just take the fucking top off and lob it and you're back in the game yeah it's like we would help each other yeah looking well there was a time where I was headlining where I had no fucking business headlining there's no way I barely had 40 minutes you know they were letting me headline these rooms and I would have to stretch it all out and if something went wrong and it went wrong hard yes there's no better motivation to creating new material than when you just those shows happen and you just fucking have to get to work like you need more weapons man you got a weapons too quick you're up there dying well especially like you can do the hour when it's going well you can take that one bit and you can stretch it out add shit to it you're you're doing improvisational jazz and that hour fills out yeah but when they're not laughing all of a sudden it's like concentrate everything shrinks down and now what you had as 35 minutes you just ripped through in 17 and now you're scared so you're tense and you got nowhere to go except the crowd so you start fucking with a crowd they don't like you now about that they don't like you you're not making them comfortable so there's not like a nice flow of energy and so yeah the early comfortable yeah you feel it and the thing about Boston is and I think it was kind of unique to a lot of common other comedy cities is it it is a punchline town it's Bam Bam Bam Bam you know they don't want to see something esoteric they don't want to see a storyteller they want you to grab them and just smack them around and then walk offstage with your hands in the air well there were guys that were doing it that we're so good at the best yeah what we came up in an era where you know we've I've talked about this a hundred times on the podcast and people always go yeah yeah yeah we know they were really good comedians back then I don't think people even understand what a nerd what a it was like a utopia Boston was like this stand-up comedy utopia there was at one point in time there was five clubs in a tiny little area seven night a week Club yeah I remember there was just that one block of warrant warrant it was Nick's comedy stop and then there was duck soup and there was a comedy connection and then Mike Chuck Mike Clark had the comedy club in the Charles Playhouse above the comedy and then on the weekend you cut over to Dick tardies comedy vault right over there yards where craziness yeah and then you get in your car you drive down stitches on Comm Ave it's like holy shit one the best part really was and those were four short sets you doing five seven minutes with a big Club those were the big ones but then you and I would get and this is the thing people don't get today that we would get it for a year we getting either you get my car I get in yours we draft Providence one night for a 15 20 minute set for Freight all the time then we go to Hartford one night then we go to Worcester one night then we go to Maine one night we would go anywhere they give especially a longer set yeah and then you know we were lucky enough to come up in time when the word comedy in front of a place drew a crowd you didn't need to have a big name they just were comedy crazy and we just happened to be dropped in the middle of it in a city that was a closed system they didn't have headliners come in from out of town so the local there were four or five big local headliners that drew and the Andy and the club's otherwise they only booked based on do you crush are you funny are you original so it was a meritocracy yeah and no one ever thought they really get famous there what career if someone used the word career people would have looked at the computers like what are you talking about all anyone wanted to do was become a big boss in comic yeah it's like the fame that you wanted was just the being accepted amongst your peers and having crowds come and see you that's it that's what everybody except to see you I think wasn't until later I think for us it was just I can't fuck it's like you know when you're first fucking a girl and you can't believe she's letting you fuck her after jerking off for three straight years that's what it was like when I was doing stand-up in Boston they're allowing me these stages that I've watched since I was a teenager in awe all the sudden I'm on it and they're letting me talk that was it yeah that's all I needed you know one of the first guys I ever saw do a live set was Tom Cotter yeah Tom Cotter is one of the first guys he's our buddy from Boston it's a great guy and he was in like some sort of the first time I ever went so I'm sort of an open mic night and and and he was like the first guy that everyone on stage I remember that I swear to God same thing he was like I'm not he had started maybe two years ahead of us that guy he always used to bum me out and the reason why is to bum me out cuz he was so fucking funny to hang out with but he wanted to take it down a notch and he wanted to like maybe maybe I shouldn't go so dirty maybe I should and you wanted to go dude that's you when you're at your best you're a pervert new twitter the frenzy twisted Lia's he is one of the best most twisted dudes and I don't want it I'd rather have him on we should have him on and do it together because his stories the shit that he would do I I can't I can't say it on the air and I can say anything on the air but the shit Tom Cotter did it was what the first guys I know that would walk around with his balls hanging out of his pants yeah one of the first guys like no one was doing that back when we were 20 you know we were like 21 or whatever the hell we were and Tom cloud is walking around with his balls hanging up his pants like Jesus yeah be a Christmas party and all the comics are there and he and he would have hands on his hip still it was like he was hiding no no and I remember at one point we were at somebody's house and there was a dog it was a Oliver's dog and it was a he had rescued one of those greyhounds I think tom was putting a dill pickle up its ass in the middle of the party like we were both beyond children we were like fucking we were like a collection of bad kids yeah it was a part of the fun of having a guy like Tom Cotter to is cuz you knew that he would like do something like that yeah he would one-up things yeah he knew if there was a bunch of comics hanging around Connor would find a way to make something fucked up yeah I always felt like he kind of pulled back onstage though you know well he yeah he in terms of practical jokes and like guys like Kevin Knox may he rest in peace was one of those guys just what so fucking funny off stage and so me Cotter and noxee are working at a place in Maine called The Laughing lobster which started so you have slow business and suddenly burnt down in the middle of a wet summer and so we're up there and we're staying there's a condo complex that were staying in which was pretty upscale and they got a pool and I was all these hot fucking chicks from Montreal to come down that part of Maine yeah so we go we're gonna go down to the pool and I don't have my bathing suit they're like fuck it you got boxer shorts just wear your boxer shorts down so they head down and I walk down to the pool I open the gate and I walk in and it's packed and they're on the far end of the pool and I make it about halfway down the pool and they both stand up and start screaming Greg what are you doing in your underwear at the whole fuckable six left Victor wrap red face ran back to the condo Oh set me up the holdup you're a fucking human being
