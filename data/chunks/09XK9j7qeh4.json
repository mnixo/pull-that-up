trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night okay very good guy two very good fighter and him and Vinny we're both in the UFC so they got a lot of good John Connaughton job John Howard Paul Harris yup and then they also got a my boy Jake Shields chick she's like bitch I ain't fit that's good fine that is the same night as the UFC fight in I think is the same night as UFC fight in New York City a fucked up world is that's that's a tough draw yeah Arminius kid I guess yeah we get them to everyone fucked up yo let's let's get busy with this what do you think about this Brendan Schaub I am very excited about this fight I think people are fuckin sleeping on in the Alvarez I think he's a dangerous dangerous 155 pounder that motherfucker can punch he punches hard he's fast as fuck and it does not a human alive that's more game than that kid I agree 100% that dude if you've never seen him fight before you got to watch his fights in Bellator with Michael Chandler and dream yeah thoughts just fights him dream and Michael Chandler's another dude who's out there who is world-class that could easily be fighting and winning in the UFC oh yeah and you see it now with Eddie Alvarez because it took a while for Eddie to get comfortable in the UFC Donald worked him over in his first fight because that dismantled by John and but now he's training with your boys and Mark Henry and look Connors a goddamn phenom and he's out he's got as for us a hobby likes to call it the touch of death in his hands it's a scary fight man anyone who thinks it's a easy fight or not a big fight for Connors they just don't know the sport out of their time underground King III think at 55 and everyone knows I'm the biggest Conner nut writer in the world at 55 I just don't see a ton of success there I think Eddie Alvarez if you look at the top five we've talked about this before you like top five it's his easiest matchup and that's a fuckin nightmare for him because Eddie can grab his ass off he's been so many big fights he doesn't get tired he doesn't mind winning by decision he doesn't get tired and he's a bigger grappler yeah those are two and he can't fuckin crack and look at his resume yes and he's rising crisp man it's got crisp striking he's not an easy guy to hit you know you can hit him and he gets rocked and he survives you watch his Chandler fights Eddie off got rocked and survived against Chandler and a couple other guys over in Bella well think about how house Connor when this fight you go through it has to knock him out yes five rounds knocking out you're not winning decision against that he could win graduation I don't think so I just why do you worry about the fight with Gilbert Melendez Eddie won a decision in the Gilbert Melendez fight oh no I'm saying Eddie wins by decision right I don't you don't think that Connor could beat him in a similar fight no no yes a intensity endurance that takedowns the grappling right the striking as the rounds go on the knockout power goes down see people sleep on Alvarez is wrestling cause I forget I forget how good of a wrestler is and his endurance yeah it's very tight where do they wrestle he's a high-level guy yeah he's division one oh yeah American I'm not sure but compared to Connery's fucking Dan Gable yo this fight this fight is nasty right we all know that those guys I mean this we're talking about Jimmy man oh so the same I was about to go down ya know but no I'm saying this fight is nasty just not confuse people at home but I agree with you man I think people sleep on them I think you've rolled with like a real Division one wrestler and you realize how fucking strong their wrestling is All American that's high school national prep all-american what is um what is his college wrestling record he doesn't have one you have no college wrestling doesn't say is college wrestling he got his wrestling and frickin dream how about that mm-my probably just went right by passed that career and went right into MMA so high level high school Russell which is not as impressive no as a college wrestler but when you see him wrestle you know he's got some skills does he like just to stand up though glove standard guitar just wants to stand up obviously it's to someone he's been in some of the best you know so Connors not an easy takedown though even now to high school champ Chad Mendes beg to differ times I mean as time goes on he's gonna be harder and harder to get that Chad Mendes fight though in Connors defense he had a pretty fucked-up knee in that fight he was getting he was getting stem cell injections in his knee but that's also the only wrestle reversing counter fight drunk taking down pretty effortlessly yeah that's tan that's like that doesn't even go off of you say bad knee I get that it's tough fight man because people would think cons like those guys they don't know the sport man I saw the violent ah fuck true but also I could see Connor just smirking him oh yeah that's how calm is gonna win he's gonna if Connor wins he's gonna murk him Connor has some vicious fucking power in his hands has Eddie been knocked out he's been stopped yeah Chandler stopped me rear naked choke them and beat him for the title hmm knocked out I don't think he's been knocked out he's been something spinach has been some choice dog fights he's just his game as they come I think he's one of those guys that fights at its very best when he scared her I think that's gonna be one of the best things about this fight is that he thinks Connor is a dangerous motherfucker just like he thought ha fail dos Anjos he stopped dos Anjos in the first round and a lot of people including me we're making the argument to dos Anjos if you look at the guys he's beaten stop cowboy in the first round beat the shit outta Nate Diaz had us beat Pettis up stopped Ben Henderson crushed him I mean you look at all the guys that he's beaten there's a real argument that he's one of the best lightweights of all time yeah and then anyway and stopped him in the first round everyone thought he can get murdered like you don't thought Eddie Sheen get you thought I was huge he doesn't have the the marquee name recognition type thing they don't know he's a dangerous fight for Conor me cuz he has such a big name but yeah but if if Connor does when you imagine the 55 belt holder is crazy and the freeway I mean yeah and I think you don't forget about Tony in there Tony well no we're not forgetting about him for sure but I think the thing about Eddie Alvarez is that he has the title and that's why it's sellable it was just Conor McGregor vs. Eddie Alvarez we're getting out of title you can't sell it it's just that well because this isn't gonna Millar guard notes tonight oh so valuable we realize how valuable that title because Tony is right in there in my opinion as is Barbosa as is a couple Cody Habib nurmagomedov is of course everybody's first choice he's undefeated nobody's been able to deal with that grab you a suplex your face is nasty fucking striker - he's oversized give him I was fighting he's fighting Michael Johnson and the Neto that's right in that car that's a fucking great fight Johnson just coming off with a knockout of Poirier that's a great fighter great fight down on the main card it's the best let's be real that we always argue what's the best UFC fight card that's the best UFC fighter Baltar I'm close it's like by if it holds up yeah if it holds up what's the lineup guy said yeah the leader the lineup is right there you've been saying you have three world title fights you have our is vs Conor McGregor you have tyron woodley is fighting wonderboy fun holy shit people forget that this is even happening because everybody's talking about other fights they forget this fight how about you on enj check versus Karolina Koval Kovich hmm come on man nobody's even talking about that and then you have Chris Weidman versus yellow motherfucking Romero come on ah then our boy cowboy cowboy is Kelvin that's about Kelvin huh and look at this me shit my precious Raquel Pennington that if I never had my fights never man Raquel Pennington is one of the best Bantam weights in the world nobody talks about her because she's won some fights in a crazy way like the Ashlee evans-smith fight with a she's had some break yeah but she look she took Holly home to a fucking split decision those girls have lost a lot though eight eight and six they have brawls bro yeah these girls go after it and Raquel Pennington mine in my opinion six super or super aggressive I like watching her fight maybe she got beat up in the last fight she did god Amanda Nunez ya mannan Nunez no Joe my god Frankie Edgar vs. Jeremy Stephens discard fuckin I thank you that I almost forgot about that that's insane not nurmagomedov in Johnson holy shit it's not even close there's not even a second place holy shot ticket is sanity oh my god to my favorites holy love so I decide to go gangbusters on this cafe on the towel is fighting Timbo chiffon fight that's all I finally train to New York with hens Oh Jim Miller novice y'all go out sweating 155 this is 1st place that's a I call that the throwback Thursday 5 have you seen what Alvarez looks like it's crazy I have not he's ruined he's way thinner he's lighter you know you remember when Alva's fought Matt Hughes when he didn't make way yeah and he was a coal realer go be the baby gorillas so jacked it was amazed hair said see ya he had he had muscles that would start above his ears for you and me look away excuse me sir you
