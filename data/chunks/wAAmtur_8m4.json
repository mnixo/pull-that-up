I get me all the time more famous than them hi I wish we could tell you what we were talking about and yeah we were talking about Joey getting in trouble though he just just texted me about it how's Joey Diaz get in trouble with what the MMA community MMA outlets there's nothing to do well here's the thing though I see where they're coming from they're they're journalists if someone says something that fucking outrageous about what McKenzie Durin's derriere must he said I think your ass smells great right yes the comic uncle Joey said this yes the Commodore girl Joey but I get it I get where they would and then Vinny Magalhaes back them up I get it packed up Joey yeah he backed up Joey says I feel like and tasty too yikes yeah yikes I get it I don't get it that's Joey Diaz the great comic who's commenting on a hot girl in the UFC he is not a writer he's not a journalist these riders have nothing to do so they're like how can we get hits let's talk about Joey Diaz right because no one's reading any of our shit I agree with you in somewhat but he definitely did do it like it ain't a bat here's my thing they could say whatever they want about what he said but if he was your friend and he texted you that you would do what I did I'll show you he fucking texted me that before tweet I love the Joey text now Joey never would text message oh I hope he doesn't keep some ideas as a full on text easy he still calls though last week most of the time he calls but he texted me yeah it's Joey Diaz Mandy sorry folks wish I could let yen you can go to Google what he said I'm trying to be respectful it it's Joey Diaz there's he can say whatever he wants he doesn't work for the UFC he's not he's not an attorney right I'm glad he does I glad it does think like that you don't send me text like that but if I was a news website and I was gonna report first of all you wanna play who's read yeah what cliff for sure that's what they want but also anybody who reads that I really you're either gonna be like me or you like you can start laughing what so you're gonna get really upset really upset and you're not a Joey Diaz fan anyway you know if you read that in 95 percent of that is dudes reading are like that's hilarious yeah the other 5% of like what the hell what are we doing how could you report this yeah I think that's a good number 95 95 that's hilarious I was wondering the same thing some women will get upset though and rightly so if I have just to imagine if you were a dude and there was some big ol giant Alexander Karelin looking dude who wanted to fuck you and he was always making jokes about what your butthole must smell like just stop just stop and think of what that would feel like that wouldn't be a good time if you're McKenzie if you're anybody that someone is saying those things about right I just mean just trying to be open-minded social justice I'm fucking out I come out it's not possible I just I'll feel a little sick but what I'm saying is if you look at it from the position of them am i right a person the person whose buttholes in question that would be an uncomfortable position to be in right a bunch of people talking about what your butthole smelled like we just trying to make a living on TV just to make a living just try to choke a girl you know what that it's it's also Joey Diaz being complimentary you know it'd be one thing if she was not an attractive female or something like that she's obviously very attractive which is what makes us funny I agree 100% I agree now if you tweets out I want to wet black beasts asshole smells like something like that fully redeemed that's funny - he might yeah I don't know if he can get away with that why just to throw it up there to give those cheeto fingers something to write about she always coming on with Yoel Romero I cannot wait for that I cannot it's gonna be a complete that's the craziest podcast ever they'll get it talking in Cuban and I mean Spanish obviously then go back and forth trans little English and whatever whatever he can't get Joey's gonna help him out with you know like if I'm if I talk too fast or if I say something and doesn't understand Joey's gonna jump in it's gonna be awesome it could be awesome and complete shit Joe that's right be awesome yes see me awesome with you and Joey well Joey's just he's a great entertainer our people don't understand like part of the reason why he's so funny is he knows what's entertaining for you Kirk he knows he knows how to be the life of the party like like no one counts pretty goddamn good at it Callens up the calicut entertainer talent can take over a room and and some of the best parties I think that's his best art form me titli I've told him that I think that your best art form is like inappropriate comedy around people who are trapped you're at a plane with him or something and he can't go anywhere it's the funniest person he's made me laugh harder offstage that almost anybody yeah he's right there he's right up there offstage with Joey but on stage Joey's just he's on Nana especially right now he's on another planet Oh counts fucking hilarious on stage too but Joey right now Jesus Christ Kalyn just did his uh like a showcase at the improv how let go you know Kalyn I murdered and murdered that's good I've been hearing good things that's good yeah that Club is uh not fun and not a bad club to work out now I wish they would get rid of that stupid fucking piano on stage though that doesn't make any sense to me the pianos weird and Brian makes the same joke about every time oh yeah I won't say what it is there's there's a part where you're standing especially if you go anywhere back on the stage where the people that are on the right side of the stage leave your face in the audience you're right those people can't see and there's not a lot of room it's stupid strange it's stupid does anyone get on there so I can I don't know man we should have a carrot top or some shit well I know Craig Robinson does occasions his own does he yeah you she has his electric piano done he maybe Owen Benjamin Owen Benjamin could play the fuck out of piano but listen the more the story is no one's really use in that even as a nick is it like huge pianist was like a website that he had or something because he's a giant dude nobody's using that fuck no you're rid of it get rid of it Owen doesn't need it like most places don't need a goddamn piano it's so old-school well it's just in the way it's an hindrance it's taking away from the show I really believe it takes away from the show can you name any other club with a piano onstage not fairly it's hard to think it's just a stupid thing to have but also look what the comic stores doing and then do Robinson with his own fucking keyboard you're right yeah usually comes out with his own shit yeah he's probably got a bunch of shit like that thing right look at him I bet he'd easy at GJ's deejays the fuck out of a party he does look like it mean DJ he does right you know who else DJ's his Shack if seen Shack like straight up DJ his giant ass is around you yeah that's what he does like in his office got platinum records multiple being a DJ as a rapper know that diesel CD went platinum I saw some video him DJing and it's like thousands of people I kids just jamming out obviously high off their ass on ecstasy but it look like a good time that's what he does why not man why not I so Peters is legit DJ legit really like legit friends with all the old school rappers like Big Daddy Kane and shit I'd no idea dude Russell is seriously legit like when we had him on the podcast a long time ago he actually look at the size of Shaq towering over that fucking equipment the biggest DJ he's so big he's so crazy um but Russell uh doesn't like those other guys calling themselves DJ's those like Tiesto guys really yeah he says that's not a DJ he's like a DJ someone who knows how to play records these guys are like press and play on their laptop and bounce around with their hands up in the air I mean I think there's more to it but I agree kind of seeing a playlist and doing your thing it's a teacher's name to that it's a different thing but to those people that want to hear that different thing those are the Masters it's like we I just think it's silly to get hung up on one art form or another because in any art form you're gonna have this Russell turn it up see you know he actually knows how to like and scratch knowledge it's a tell - dude is smart dude where else is very very smart very good dude - like one of the nice deep I think I've ever met super super fuckin sweetheart first man to roast me on stage and hurt my feelings but then that was the way I've just kind of yeah I'll bust and little busting of the balls he's just love him yeah he's a sweetheart but um he's like super passionate about old-school deejaying like with record players and shit like he's really good at that and there's a there's an art to that but that's why he hates on these new guys like DJ tiesto and well he doesn't hate on them he doesn't hate on them he just doesn't think that they should call themselves djs djs a disc jockey you know like a new-age disc jockey though but they're not a disc they don't have a disc he's got a disc and that's part of art his movies true disc less bitch jockey I see his point is look I just think people look people love that kind of music obviously like calvin harris shit hell yeah i'm not saying shit in a bad racist jams we have describing it but as you're driving down the road in vegas macy's big ass job there's posters and shit and yeah Diplo huge all those electronic guys I mean obviously people love that sound so I don't think he's saying that they suck I just think he's saying it's a different thing different yeah cause like obviously if you wanted to hear that shit and you go went there and Russell was scratching records but come on come on bro I'm here to do ecstasy listen to this jockey a person who introduces in plays recorded popular music especially on radio or at a disco they're electric DJ maybe time to update that super old what the fuck is a disco do not a disco dard-e-disco how about a ballroom the thing about those DJ's like steve aoki at a documentary on Netflix which is ridiculous but because they're not like live performing they can do more shows than anyone so like Steve Aoki was on the road 300 days out of the year made something like 300 jillion dollars private jet he's going from Amsterdam to China yeah just non-stop yeah that's all you do he was at the lab he was the guy who's stolen cakes and people's faces mainly girls he'd toss cake and that was his thing and then hit one girl and her neck was like huge I think he had a lawsuit so he stopped throwing the cake in there yeah don't throw kicks it was lost people asked for it though what do you do oh is that the girl who got hurt no I don't know some girl got flash though throw a cake oh my god with like a piece of cardboard underneath it that's just the bottom of the cake you know I'm saying you got put on it something that seems so yogi Long's cake though it's guy in a wheelchair oh let's not watch this I don't want to watch it again and wheelchair get hit man it's all yeah oh my god maybe it's an honor right no it is if you're a fan of Stevie it's like hit me with the cake right like if you're like at the WWE and someone spits on you there's a little bit of blood yeah they catch that conversation spit or in the NBA that when they throw their mouthpiece people catch him it's disgusting happens MMA do yes what do you do with that thing I've seen that yeah why do people throw them in the audience I don't know it's so decision so preposterous what is this Jamie what is it oh she's left you said blood spitting blood this is the guy lifting at the Arnold thing dock to start spraying and blood right in the middle of his lift whoa that's raw like clean up everything they take a little break you need to see a doctor sir yeah he's fine lift up got a little stomach and thing going on that's eternal bleeding he's got a little gnats probably nasal infection you think yeah bursting out like that walk it off can't be good I just deadlift a thousand pounds looks pretty healthy to me yeah we see deadly I'm gonna live along too 9:39 it says she said someone too lightweight that's so much weight I saw a crazy one where a dude was doing this squat and the the bar couldn't handle the weight and the bar bent and he couldn't get it back on to the the rack and so he had to like kind of dive out from under it but it was a shitload of waste obviously imagine how with that kind of weight on you and you got to figure out how to get it off you so dig out hurting you yeah have you seen homeboy who when they do the heavy squats and they blow their asshole out oh I did see that that's a tough one yeah obviously I would thought you were gonna bring up that guy who was doing he was doing something in one of those crossfit games and he was doing like clean and his arms gave out and it dropped down in his neck and paralyzed him no positives a friend at Tates you know landed on his neck and hang out dead just fell down by stops now he's paralyzed from the neck down just boom like everything just shut off he it landed on his neck probably passed all the CrossFit for well you know it's all these guys are too almost too fucking tough for their own good with something like that where you're holding something over your head doing a thousand reps or yeah they're just trying to smash everybody's reps and show how badass they are which is you know it's competition Steve Nash hates that shit he says that and I see other people's points to that it's beneficial that the competition makes you work harder but maxwell's take on it is those type of exercise movements like power cleans and things like that they're not Molina presence not meant for high reps yeah he's like those are strength moves they're meant for low reps couple sets you know heavy chairs that's not something your body should be doing that and things that can go wrong right a fuck you up stressed yeah when you start going tons and you're losing to your technique and form that's damaged it man yeah you lose in this guy was in an out of position to his body eyes take up boy yeah take knows him Tate's big in that he's deep in that CrossFit world finished barbell what's his thing over there he's a something off Lincoln in Venice he's always fought he's always there there's like some strongman shit there's yeah I know you talked about the name escapes from God me too the box no I sent the box in Venice hell whatever Talan works at Venice barbell Club tates always been into hates I don't know that kind of working out seduces back in the day is it dousset yeah yes there you go shout out to deuces and what's up dude yeah Kate's always been into kettlebells and you know muscle ups and shit like that and just crossfit style movements and he's a big fan of crossfit he loves it have you done a ton of CrossFit no I mean I've done I do those kind of exercises right I do a lot of kettlebell stuff I do deadlifts I do a lot of things circuit training but no but I don't do it the way they do it no me neither I do that Pavel taught shalini method are you doing like sets of five never more than sets of yeah I've I dig that and I take a lot of time off in between sets I my schedules been so crazy man I haven't been able to go to the gym like you typically do you know where I work with my trainer and I'm doing weights I'll do mid stuff like that so I've been trying to find some alternatives yeah man it's fun to mix shit up yeah something different yeah I've been bored like a yoga class I've been doing yoga I've been doing hot yoga which I love fucking Taekwondo bro how about that deep I wanna go deep after poker we're front kicking motherfuckers up a hard pass on that man I don't want anything to do with much of it but here's the thing it's like do you like some sort of McDo Joe style Taekwondo as long as they teach a good technique you're gonna get a good workout and try and burn some calories you know I'm just wheel kicks and shit hard path for me hard pass Joe pajamas just wrist locking motherfucker grabbing that wrist but you fly fly fly and Steve with magic boy meets a girl doing an Asian ah the wrist makes I go full deep on that no would be fun if you did it and you just you did one of them Aikido demonstration to show what happens when someone doesn't just give in seriously you'd be like you know that he goes and grabs you and does this he likes pushing you they try to throw you and you just kind of push their head down I like come on man come on man come on bro you don't try to counter I mean just go just got shot just kept this take the worst promos are not working yourself it's all bullshit but apparently man those dudes who were badass I did back in the day it was about getting rid of swords guy comes at you with a fucking sword and they're all they had to learn how to like the guys lunging at you literally with a ridiculous movement cuz he's trying to just chop you up right so it would be similar to how these guys move and throw those yeah in those demonstration videos but if a guy doesn't have a sword it's too old-school to it's just fucking oh well I was thinking about doing this is a sponsor anything like that I was we get those because you have one in the back there one those Pendleton bikes yes we're gonna wake up and do that and then do my thing those are great they have a whole thing you do a bunch of different workouts go online I was like online class this is a sponsor I don't yeah you do it live - yeah well you know what I like better I like the rogue bike that fucking assault bike what is it called the echo the hildine yeah Jesus Christ they made a beefed-up for everyone I have one here yeah I see it a lot is on it 20 seconds on 10 seconds off holy shit dude if I give the the pendleton bike that rogue thing in a or the Aerodyne and like a rower i'd be straight yeah rollers bad I got a rower two rollers bad ass - I do 30 and 30 with the rower so 30 minutes of sprinting thirty minutes of rest 30 minutes of sprinting thirty minutes seconds oh she's just Christ Joe what are you on sir you imagine if you just sprint for 30 like one Viking are you so the tabata is 2010 and then I go from I do like it'll do eight rounds of 2010 and then I go over and do the row machine and I'll do eight rounds of 30 30 30 seconds on three and then I go back and do it again and then I do it again and if I forgot this Holmes if I got the stones I could do three sets exhausting I've only done three sets once and I had it double up on the shroom tag you felt sick I was beat down man you're just really exhausted at the end of it but it's also short in your body super intent that the thing they said most people think that's the best work that you can do it does something to you I guarantee you because one of the things after doing it like three or four times I started to feel it in my running school running a lot too though but my running my endurance and running is getting better and I think maybe some of that might have to do with the biking just that because the button Mike works out different muscles two men your lungs - yeah one has to adapt to that kind of capacity moving like that that's not it that's the beefy one I will break that shit yes I did Jamie it's called the rogue echo echo air or some shit I've been doing the thousand meter test on the row like I'll get down hit mitts with my trainer guys and meters I see they have the records for the week right I'll try and beat the records and just so anybody knows that's not a sneaky ad I paid for all the rogue stuff it's here I bought it all no no is that good that's every time the thing is beefy beefy is fuck he's got girders and shit you got a fat ass handle on a girder yeah any step my game up so I don't have to leave to the gym to save time dude it's nice to be able to just do it in your house you know all you need is a chin-up bar and some kettle bells at home and you could just get something done yep that's what I need because sometimes you know that thing where you have really have an hour before you have to leave like you might be looking to the gym and squeeze 30 minutes in let's see that's what I've been doing yeah it's not like to wake up with my son and I'm like done with him and then him with an hour that maybe it's to do here I'm going to New York and doing this I just wanted to do something home dude I become addicted to the fasted cardio I used to do that before tremor starts throwing up yeah but I think that's your coffee intake yeah you probably talk to you cuz it's like 20 cups a day 12 to 16 cups together and then fasting until to the doctor's I say let's not do that that's so much whatever but so it's too much of everything and if you're not having any food then it's just good and straight in there it's all getting absorbed I'm on all these medications now to get off Kido real kind of' stage when diabetes what is the medications they put you on I don't it's some anti acid like super strong stuff so I can still drink my coffee it's just not as aq open you'll fuck up my entire workflow if I can't drink coffee it's crazy yeah the fasting cardio is the way to go yeah I love it man I get addicted to it you know when I get addicted to I get addicted to the feeling of having done it when I didn't want to do it that's what I realized this running thing is for me it's this this little game I'm playing with my brain well I know I'm gonna do it but I wake up I'm like oh and then Marshalls Barton Bert put him in the backyard is like come on bitch he wants to go dude he's so crazy now because we've been doing it so much so he's in really good shape I have fucking dogs in shape like that dogs getting shaped like that yeah he was getting a little blue chubby you know but he was only like he's still at baby fat on him he's only 14 months old so when I took him he was like 9 or 10 months old when I first started taking him I just wasn't sure if he was gonna listen or I was worried like what if we run into rau snake or something like that suck it sucks he got used to the routine you could get them to the hospital though they survived they're a lot tougher than us yeah suck it up they hit him on the nose get out that's not real that's what I've heard bro I've heard - it was so fake bro science it doesn't work really suck it dogs die cuz it hits him on the nose and so you know it gets spread that's what I've heard no my dogs get been on the nose your dog and my pit by rail sake yeah do you die no he's still alive no he's dead now was a long time ago we doing i all my dog that bit by rattlesnakes except the killer nurses except squeaky Fromme she was uh she didn't give a fuck about snakes she was just fuck of other dogs did her that was my prison dog that was a dog that I got from the pound it was in the palace from Kalyn count on count suggestion please yeah Ellie animal shelter for like five or six months there's a sweet sweet dog do did not want any dogs ruining her newfound party dog aggression well she'd lived for the formative months of her childhood before I got her she this cage and I think that that fucks with a dog's head nobody adopted her for like I think it was at least five or six months or bunny and then once you finally do get adopted you get all this love from these people you get to sleep in bed with them and shit and they take you home and I mean I dog was she slept right by my bed sometimes they would hop in the bed but I have to kick them off with a fart and shit yeah I see I like him in the bed ruff I like no dogs in the bed keep it yeah it does keep it warm but sometimes they fart and it's brutal you like oh jeez or if it's a hot summer night it's like get out of here man I know it change it but um she's so like any dog that she thought might steal that from her like any dog that came in game and she just she would growl at dogs you pet them she just was not into it so insecurity issues yeah this is good if you guys are running all the time yeah I've never I've struggled that a little bit lately where I'll be tired and I'm like come on you gotta work out I've never had a workout and then afterwards went I wish I didn't do that yeah whatever not once people are saying this people need to understand like I saw a couple of comments people saying this is terrible advice and you should listen to your body when your body's tired the Sun shut it's not right no you're not no it's weird yeah I know what I need to rest and I also can I know like how when I've done too much stuff like I've done like two works out to work out two days three days in a row before and then you get to that fourth day and you're like whoa all right I probably should do nothing today like just that's it that's almost tougher to do them working out for me to take a day off it's almost tougher psychologically right now it's going good right you bastard stinking it's kind of cool but there's a moment where you realize that you're probably I should really monitor my resting heart rate in the morning that's another thing Steve Maxwell taught me he said that that's one of the best ways to figure out if you're over training or training we do.thank up in the morning if your heart rate is five to ten beats over what it normally is don't do shit because you're fighting something off if you're fighting something off where you need to recover you could do like light skill work they say if you're sick working out makes it worse it messes up your music yeah yeah usually I know if I'm being lazy I'm like I'm arresting bad man or I just want to do this I'd rather do this but you know what if you're not too sick if you're not too debilitated to work snob it's not a bad thing to just do light no like well okis work just move like try to figure out some technique where you not doing anything harder than a steamer sauna sauna yeah someone who asked me about steam room versus sauna I asked around at Patrick and there's there hasn't really been studies done on the sauna or the steam room rather that show the benefits of the sauna probably shit they're both hot ash it probably has some benefit the only difference is that the sauna can get way hotter because it's a dry heat so the sauna can get you know my son I've had it up more than 190 we set it up and had it be sending that son in Boston your serial killer there ten more minutes shop and I was dying I was like I think I'm set man I think I'm kind of sad I'm all red like a lobster it's just got to go - you just got to just go empty in there I know I hear ya but I was good man like we were in the firm of a minute Jamie dipped out super early shout-out to Equinox and Boston great fucking gym that's a good night man yeah they keep it at 170 that's what most people think it should be 170 but if he was 170 with steam man you're getting cooked in there that's not good I don't think you could take that heat so the idea is that the sauna because it's a dry heat for the most part I know sometimes people throw some water on the rocks yeah but it's a dry heat for the most part and that that is what you want because that's what your body responds to the edges the actual temperature and produces those heat shock proteins it makes sense totally makes sense you know it's weirdest sometimes in the UFC and you can feel this too if it's at a hockey arena like t-mobile where the sometimes the when you get into the gun again that crowd it's freezing because there's ice under low 50 free it sucks for the fighter yeah it takes a while to get going you'll see guys for the first round that guy looks a little stiff right what's going on Vince it's freezing out there man you just in shorts right you're sweating in the back and it's warm in that locker room then when you come out it's this like God so yeah total dick get in right away i but god damn it yeah I'd always think about is the hockey team there others ice sorry to calculate that your focus on something else I didn't realize it until one day I saw like a crack in between the boards the floorboards and I looked down I went that's fucking ice there's ice there right now and I was gonna keep it they keep the ice there they keep ice to keep ice we're just all these thousands of people chill on top of ice well it can't break I know I'm just saying that weird oh it's definitely weird but it's gives it better well not for the fighters for sure but is it better for the articles that sometimes it gets fucking hot in those places if you have just a big-ass chunk of ice in the middle of everybody kind of smart boys I'm super cookie is in in Brazil this didn't use any AC or anything I was in one of them and there was an open-air place in Brazil so we were indoors but at the top the top areas it's like these big ol open doors that face the outside there's bugs flying around shit that's some precipitation man it was moist and warm we're was though it was well there's one with Anik and someone and they're literally just sweaty the pit stains that was sweating it out that happened in Abu Dhabi - we're not with Dobby I was drenched that was outdoors that wasn't out - right yeah yeah whoo fuck was that males and Weidman Anderson Demian Maia that's right yeah why have been fought out there - I think you fought BJ Penn fought Frankie Edgar that's where Frankie Edgar won the title and they've had Boyd not yet now go out there yep and be back there in a while it's been a while come on a minute hot minute yeah that one was crazy because you saw bugs flying around you never knew were real oh it's my mangy shit out there I went on a hike does it come in Jumanji this is quick what in the fuck is this shit you've never seen but yeah it's crazy you go to other countries man they're there hell they have completely different ecosystems the point where you look at things you know what in the fuck is that what is that but where it's dangerous - I remember I was in Brazil we were climbing this thing they go now listen fellas you got to make sure and we're with the locals like you have to come down before nightfall otherwise they're not gonna find you kind of shit is this so we just dipped out getting up there my man I'm Hitler like big man got lost he we didn't see him for the rest of night oh and the clothes like he's one with you easy he's one with the jungle now like oh what the fuck does that mean so this is the rundown so shit what do you mean he's one with the jungle he showed up a day later just exhausted do you get it outs of sleep and someone in one of these huts took him under their wing and saved him oh my god people do get helicoptered out there if they get trapped at the top I was like dude I fight like it's a bad idea how many days before a fight was this it was like a week before the guy promised had a soon gone basically a speedo just asshole out in front of us just fucking go jungle you know on your foot in just foot doing work smoking us shredded tan fucking all us items with their feet look like like hobbits feed like the craziest feed ever these people that live in the forest they splay out like a hand and they super thick toes and shit like it doesn't look anything like we have bitch feet yeah today I had a run in regular running shoes because my feet are sore from the Vibrams and yeah from just a pounding I don't I'm scared of that plantar fasciitis no get your mind right let's go and get on there's a reason there's technology son let's quit running barefoot no no I think just the barefoot thing strengthens your feet up I think it just takes time I'm just being real careful be super careful yeah nightmare I'm sure don't crews have to deal with it I've done it that night I had to get shots injection in my foot and with Tom Cruise it was the same thing it was coming back too quickly like he had a knee injury right so after his knee injury then he just tried to get way back in the shape way quick and fucked his feet mine was just I think from being so big in this running I was doing you know miles and miles and miles and miles I love running let's Larry my favorite thing to do Neal Brennan did it on he got planner from a treadmill from wearing those Vibrams if you're they say you got to work into them gotta work just wanted to go straight barefoot and just start doing work no you definitely do feel good to be bare for like I like walking in the street I feel like them do something dangerous like on the sidewalk really yeah while I feel nice about it I don't know what it is man it makes me feel free yeah I know it's dirty and dangerous supposed to be dirty and dangerous that's what life is supposed to be supposed to be interacting interacting with other life sometimes barriers it's your feet yeah this is nice rubber barrier between you in the world that shit ain't right you're always confined I like let them breathe a little bit man one of the Indians had it right with moccasins there's no air flow with those goddamn moccasin they didn't give a fuck with things smelled like back then oh that's not like they gave up if they can find a creek the temporary put some of that fire out real quick I got that life but they would just run around with moccasins they basically just had like a layer of leather between their foot in the ground so they could do climb mountains with that hey hey hey what is this Jamie how dare you Jamie this guy is slicing chunks off of the bottom of his foot I mean those are talus raizy that makes me feel sick bro man cuts couses off his foot with a knife and dog eats it this is the name of this video how the fuck did you find it look at these calluses dude this is insane bro this guy is just slicing through these calluses like it's a coconut like it's coconut milk like a pineapple this is insane have you ever seen anybody have calluses like this before though I think this guy is a problem it ain't normal what kind of a man can just cut at his foot like that how do you don't hop how deep to cut we don't cut your goddamn heel off you know the food is not sharpening that knife that's not a sharp knife that's not geez this is crazy mom that could feed the dog is taking the pieces of meat mean a dog's a maneater that's how in the world is a meze get that bookmarked couldn't wait did you say feet just couldn't wait to drag that shit who the fuck cuts off the bottom of their feet with a knife like that and what's he doing to give his feet like that why is he yelling at that dog Oh his flaw it makes me this close to throwing up wouldn't you like to think that the dog would get used to that smell like that's all I like to eat now and then like you'll be sleep and the dogs hungry is like fucking homes gonna snack out on this dudes feet so zombie you got a zombie talking heads now looks like a bloodhound to dogs goddamn horrible monster meet human eater Wow I feel super sick man on another note how about that Brian Ortega how about behind her take it I don't want to show yesterday night was awkward cuz me and Brian are super close and I don't know what it is because same thing with steep a whenever I know these guys it's I know him from when when I trained with him and I've seen him in that light like with Brian or taking a corner him for his one of his fights before you get to the UFC and I knew him is that Brian Ortega we're all jujitsu you know cardio for days but terrified to fight like I know him is that bright and now he's evolved into the number one featherweight in the world so when I when he got the Frankie Edgar fine I was like god I just feel like it's a terrible match up man I'm telling Hannah I'm like what's he gonna do and I was like don't worry man don't worry and so on my show it's Ryan and Heather listen to like do they coming like how you gonna pick against me like no I said my brain went with Frankie just cuz Frankie Edgar he's a legend my heart wanted you Brian he's like dude it hurt my feelings I'm like I don't I don't I'm sorry man like I and I don't know what is was steep a to never I see him I I know miss that version of them it's a problem I have I like this gap I don't know what's going on that people always do that they do that they remember someone by what they were were they're at their worst it not even their worse but is their empathy of third of their of their career you listening I say their worst just say a lesser version of who they are now correct right it's like do you ever get that feeling when you go back to high school like out from around someone from high school I feel like a loser weird feeling 100% when I go back to Denver I'm almost not myself because I feel like this almost the al almost like this loser a loser yeah because yeah because you remember back who you were when you were insecure and starting out life and just that's a normal thing you know they always say that about comedy clubs like if you start out at a club that Club will never respect you they respect you when you leave and you know maybe you get a TV show or something like that and then come back and they I remember when you suck though yeah they remember when you suck yeah I always had it I had a problem with that in Boston at first we yeah because they remembered me as this guy was an opener and then you know how my head you like you're not a headline remember you were opening you did 20 minutes you opened that's what you do I know like you're not a headliner I had one night and I this isn't in my nature at all I'm gonna go back it's been busy but I had one I had to laugh act arrived just by bomb been bomb bomb like I do like just one guy in the back just goes oh no doubt no doubt man I've done something I'm like what the fuck am i doing man it's so embarrassing I've been back since but not because because of my comp scared a laugh fact it's just I've been at the store and and just been on the grind but you do have it in your head like up there and clean that up there's there's a it literally it's I think about every day it's something back here get your ass up there man yeah let go but I'll go to the Comi store nope get your ass up there see that's an athlete's perspective that's the difference it's one of the things that I've been saying to people about you the difference between the way you've been approached in comedy and another person would do it you're doing it from an athletes perspective like you work hard at shit yeah and you know where your weaknesses are you gotta you fix those other people ignore them it's a real problem you know like like someone will have a joke and the joke doesn't do well like several nights in a row but they keep doing it the same way like why are you doing it the same way you need to cut some of that out you need to tweak this and you turn that around need to add something maybe not explaining it enough but if it's not doing well and you keep doing it the same exact way it's not the crowds hoping yeah you got to figure out there there's a laugh people get stuck in a weird pattern though if wanting to do things the exact same way over and over again oh nothing's better to me when it's such an honor to if I'm at the Comedy Store if I was a dumpster in La Jolla and a comic oh hey you should try this I listen your joke you should button with this or try this I'm like dude that's brilliant man yeah every now and then someone just nail it for you they just find they see something that maybe you didn't see like oh like you ever thought about going this direction like - it's not like they're writing your jokes like a what if you went this direction with them like that dude that's brilliant man that's happens in martial arts too right like hasn't someone like pointed something out to you like oh shit Oh hundred percent with a choke you know your hands are like this do you ever tried it like this and I do that yeah that makes sense it's so much easier yeah sometimes things don't seem they like they'd be easier and they are like this the pretzel grip this grip you're like why would I grab something like that and then you do it if so shows you but I feel like in not my yeah it feels nice Oh feels nice right or take a shit dude his guillotine is ridiculous as he grip it and he's getting that just he has all sorts of variations Emma fuckers nice with it he's here you know it's right you know he's here a lot of times he goes flat he's so good at it but shows he like Marcelo like how Marcel slides it yeah they're like a blade you have catch a blade yeah and he's the best at the world in it but he also he's getting the respect now from the crowd because for your Marilyn Frankie kind of faked that shot he got hold his neck and crapped entire crowd goes yeah it's like oh shit yeah they realize what he's capable of when that dude gets a hold of your neck it's a totally different proposition when he what he did to Cub Swanson at the end of the first round basically that basically out cub was fucked and it was just a matter of the time ran out but that shit was fully locked in and cub wasn't going anymore I got emotional yesterday we came in the room because I'd seen him since and I went to bright week not even on air went home on stopped there bro hear me real quick before anyone tells you this I know you can kind of show that when you're the number one featherweight in the world no mic warned you for that rough and nasty fight and wouldn't the climb there where the fuck was that and he's the number one guy in the world Brian let that soak in he's a number one contender max Holloway is number one in the world he's right number one in the world right but number one contender true right he's number one all I'm saying that's always the champ yeah that's the number one Corral defines the champion he's right number one that's a mess I know I know understand that yeah that if I was max Holloway motherfucker they're gonna fight for sure not max always the greatest Bellary in the world right now but max for Rio Tiger to go from it's crazy to see man it's a very interesting fight it's nuts cuz Ortega is super dangerous standing and on the ground he's honored different level than anybody else they're also the same size yeah like totally you she has a big advantage reaching size but now they're kind of equal dude Holloway something special though man he's super special well he did it Aldo well he did the Aldo was crazy twice twice and the second time more emphatic like like he knew he was gonna know that's always something special so and it's almost like when you watch what he does you can't appreciate it until you see it a bunch of times because like what he's doing he's not knocking someone out with one head kick he's not like catching someone with some unbelievable spectacular submission know what he's doing is just fucking us out classes regularly yeah with technique and he's ferocious and then what do you want to do you want to test technique you wanna do pace bra you want bra line right here come ball see how that goes for it yeah that's what Brian can't fall into and Brian will be I'm sure in Vegas eyes the underdog which rightfully so it's max Holloway the greatest featherweight in the world right now so with Brian he just has to be careful max will lure you into that Bron he's not gonna lose those brawls yeah he's very good a brawl that's for damn sure he did the crazy thing was the Lamas fight oh my god Ricardo Lamas he's beating his ass and then he just points the set of schedules come on man let's fucking throw now he's one of my favorite fighters bites his mouthpiece down it's just windmill enough you can do that yeah don't you technique you want to whatever you want to do yep it sounds like from what Brian told me is there aiming for that international fight week so you have DC steep a maybe cyborg Amanda Nunez then you got Brian Ortega max Holloway well max just broke his foot so what are we at right now how many weeks is he out is even out of his cast yet I don't think he's out of his cast I think I saw a photo of him on Instagram was about two weeks ago he had a cast on he's on tough help in DC right though or doing it you know standing on his cast but or in March it's only June Phil May June July for months a foot of bone and the foot is not it's not an easy one because you're always standing on it no and then when you get back it's gonna take time yeah and then you're gonna be real hesitant to kick things well hey I'm not the one rumored international fight week that's what yeah that's what that's what Ortega's hearing day want to do in hole I obviously Hannah and Brian wanted there like we'd love to go to Hawaii go to Hometown and do it mmm but you know there's a lot of moving pieces for your sea get to ye job inside and outside like how how big of an arena do they have that's inside if it's well outside they have the stadium right they could do the giant state and which would sell out it would sell out but what if it rained which it does in Hawaii all the time we fighting in the ring wet and wild remember that watch that came the cage you wouldn't watch that rainy the rainy I mean be is so weird but no you can't think of this to have yeah it's good risk to have look can't have it though gotta be phenomenal for Brian if they could just slip to the ground real quick amazing I mean he has dug he has a good advantage over almost everybody at 145 when it comes to jiu-jitsu like who doesn't he have an advantage of when it comes to jiu-jitsu at 144 there's no one no one more dangerous than the tea city as far as on the ground Brian and you know he'd locks onto things there's a finality to it that his strength and his now his belief in himself with it he knows how dangerous he is there's a it and really it's he's almost you know people haven't seen what that kids capable of either like we've seen some cool stuff but some of his flying triangles is flying arm bars and his his grips and stuff and it's guillotines and here's a lot of cool setups that we haven't even touched on so yeah he's one of the most impressive guys I've ever seen in terms of like when he starts locking something up you know it's over game over whoa game over just super high-level very interesting because it doesn't have like World Championship you know victories in his past right no he didn't come up through like the IB jmf whatever the hell it is or he didn't go to metamoris anything like that he's just this kid that grew up on the Gracie mats and over time was that kid who was just like god damn he's good and just kept with again where they kept with it yeah now the crazy thing is his striking has become just as deadly fluid crack Frankie Edgar with an elbow like that and then starch him with that uppercut that's like he can do that to you stand it now you lift off his feet yeah yeah so where's the where's the picnic picnic it's not standing not right for max Holloway he's probably looking at good the picnic for me standing cause he's so goddamn you know good at it but you can't just say that's a huge advantage anymore after you see or take a judgment he's knocked out Clay Guida with knees mm you know now after you knock out Frankie Edgar like that you at least have to acknowledge the kid can do some stand-up damage I think yes but I think there's a real concern with if they're gonna try to fight in July with Halloween not have enough time to recover I hope I'm wrong but when I'm looking at that one you just said that's March I was like yeah it's March isn't it beginner Montreux may june july this for months how do they have how he healed up for you after four months are you ready to throw kicks and get your foot checked well who knows maybe they'll slit or maybe Dana told or Brian hey we're shooting for Mara shooting for July summer something like that but they don't realize we're max all you know this yes maybe thought another car maybe I'm wrong though maybe I mean six weeks is what it takes for bone he interacts a tweet us or something okay I'm good right now bitch Google what it takes for a healthy what is max like 28 no 27 Bronte is same age 20 bucks something yeah and this won't be the last time you see a bride are taking max hallway fight what's up 26 26 sorry take this 27 go to how long does it take just Google how long does it take for a bone on a 26 year old man to heal and then cut it in half kiss max Holloway yeah let's say you have the doctor she gonna be how about six months well yes from the soccer mom six months for me it's gonna be about three thank you sir I'm gonna push it at three you giant pussy that's also a way to blow out those AC over you that's out dogs just are these two all these old people like you're out for about a year that's true three months talk kick rocks you know what man this tended an engines injury that I got I got golfer's elbow that really made me aware there's a difference between injure and a muscle and injuring a tendon hundred percent they don't have much blood supply man it's a fucking four in the dick to get that to heal I'm stunned at how long it takes how many different things I've done when since you told me that hole ups and it started hurting here I've stopped doing for a little bit cuz I mean it's just here it's just as I started hurting in there and that's when to hear and I'm like you know I'm a chill out on that stuff I got a chunk of something floating around there too yet like the piece of hardened or another I fell once in Alaska Cowen and I were on this deer hunting trip and I slipped off the side of a cliff and cracked my elbow on this rock and it was hurtin for months afterwards like every time I would do a chin-up it would hurt and I just sucked it up and I think I might have chipped a piece of bone off in there there's something floating or it's a piece of calcium that's built up because of irritation that can happen is that it ride bro yeah you got this man bro sighs dude speaking of people again fucked up how about that girl's side worked fine Chuck scared when she got hit with the first one her eyes were like oh my god and God bless her man because your first fight in UFC here you go this is what you guys want here's cyborg main event short notice enjoy that yeah that's kind of a crazy thing to do right title shot your first fight ever in the UFC title shot and first Friday ever and nobody knows literally nobody in the UFC knows who you are you see they even have a picture up of her till they kill the fight you've never I mean she got submitted by Tonya avenger' that's tough she submitted Tonya and Tonya submitted her and we know that she's a 135 her yeah that's her like wincing in pain a cyborg lowers the board down though she did that weird yeah well that was obviously the strategy the strategy was to close the distance get that clinch drag side work to the ground she's a 135 her man she really it's not big enough but for cyborg it's like what do you want me to do man like there's no one in the division what is stopping that Megan Anderson chick from coming over at her work visa she was here illegally or something like that no that was the holdup there Oh some bullshit lawyers cuz I know man let's go cuz she's a legit you know big cuddler big girl any Australian you know a fighter a saw tattooed up she's actually one you know she's in the same weight class 145 yeah yeah and she wants to fight you know freaky cat Zingano want to fight - she's talking all that shit someone call Trump I don't get it done Katzie gana wants to fight well well Katsucon oh did want the cyborg fight but since she lost that last one right yeah split decision you ain't get sour Stefano no no no no no there's no way she's gonna have to get a couple of it she lost her last one - she took Juliana Pena yeah she she's taking too much you could see the Ringwraiths was there in the nerves of there she is she she needs time she's time she can compete there with cyborgs I'm trying to be funny here she's not gonna lose to a single woman you need it she needs to fight two women or there needs to be a dude in there but one girl's not gonna beat her I hate to tell you guys like it's just not I don't know how you're gonna market that you tell me you want to watch her ever CM Punk well I think you put her as co-main event a lot and some cards that have a lot of great fights I just think that the people are only willing to watch whoever steps in and fights her but to have her be the center of a giant event I think it's gonna take a real challenger like Holly those ratings were good like yeah that was a good fight because that was a fight with people like hmm Holly you know is legit like real skillful box shows you how good is to get the decision although she you know Holly was never really winning that fudge but man she wasn't yeah she got blitt up you realize when you're in their fighting tire burger it's totally different proposition when you see cyber is like oh man she's never gonna lose until father time my guest touches around the shoulder right now she's only 32 not crazy it's not young but it's not old either no she's not old shity prime she dudes for another five years easy when you know you think about how long she's been around like we're back in Chino Carano fight how old was she then Jesus man super young super young she's been doing for a minute did you ever watch that fight again it's not that fight divided enough credit no Gina mounted her at one point Tom Tina first team all deities captain the team yeah it's pretty hot but out of respect to Kevin Ross this would be the end of this conversation it comes to how hot what's he do Kevin Rasta muy Thai fighter oh yeah with all he's all tatted up they're still together yeah good for them valid for them hopefully she's right yeah she's got to be very cool cuz he's very cool yeah they're both gonna stay beginning a fight she's just teeing off on ginger and fucks up and Gina ones up on top of her look at Gina doing work people forget how good that girl was man oh she's very good look at that cyborg every girl should give her royalties for starting women's Emma Mayen spirit actually half-assed heel hook here are a half-decent heel hook here she an attorney get out of it she popped out yeah Gina chronic I mean she just think out big Gina crown would be if she was in sport right now Jesus sign boys hit me with some hammers this was yeah she would be gigantic be so because she was in the break when the UFC was really in its infancy we got Showtime what year do you think this fight was if you had to guess mm 4 6 9 mm really 9 Wow cyborg vicious kick to the body so cyborg was only like what 22 ish or take 2 again and this time Gina mounts her look at that like people forget G just getting them out because cyborgs mistakes I still yeah she's just the most trouble we've ever seen cyborg in besides that more tie fight and Gina's gonna let her out no Gina was an absolute monster people forget man but with cyber I I'm dead serious I'm trying to be funny yeah that's true women enter that octagon against her she's not gonna lose yeah or do you need get khabib up in that bitch well she obviously has some physical attributes now when you think about the rest of the women at 145 no one stands out what they're gonna do is Amanda Nunez that's the fight yeah I mean this wants it cyborg wants it the I like the fight I think technically Amanda Nunez is better as far as a technician as cyborg however for let's say that's five rounds even three rounds over those three rounds she's she I don't think she possesses the same powers cyborg you know I'm saying the cyborg hits a girl you you see it on their face his stoppage of gina carano will watch it on the big screen it's horrific that stuff one it's horrific when she gets her down like the hammers and she drops off more of a cyborg Finn I'm more of cyber fan now back then I was first team all jido no one wanted that no one wanted that did she test positive for this fight uh no I thought it was after this is another fight yeah I wasn't this fight that'd be way bigger news cyborgs Amanda's a good fight that's a real life I just and I'm a huge amount of Nunez fan I just think over that time she's gonna land some shots on cyber so I won't get hit but when side work its it just can't play that game with her there's there's no female in the world who can play that game with her you give me one I'll fake one you here you here it just doesn't work do you know who knows man that's interesting it's great right and it's got legit one punch power legit smack him up power real black belt in jujitsu very good at fighting knows how to fight for the homo fighter yeah she knows how to fight forget about all the things that she can do she puts it together well you know who can fight cyber cyborg yep she's the greatest female fighter of all time it's hard to argue it's hard to argue right yeah I'm hard to argue there's some caveats in there obviously but it's hard to argue yeah you know some caveats I guess we're gonna go down that road but still in the UFC with the USANA testing she's still the best so that kind of takes out of the window real well she was the best back there she tested hot cool now she's in the strict in the most strict testing pool of all time she's still dominating so where's your argument there now well you know the argument that she retained all the shit from when she was taking it back and they definitely retained something I'm not everything though as Hector Lombard to question has to be doorbell fooled right that's true but those are men it's different the idea of you know a guy taking shit or a girl taking it don't you think they're different it's it's different but it's also it's different there's argument there but it's not different to the point where after 10 was that 2009 you said so after nine years she's still retaining this muscle mass and she was born a bigger female that's true - that's true - like no matter what Gabby Garcia did she's still 6 4 correct she still a giant dude she was at the USC I was like holy shit you're scared terrifying she's way too big for up there she's Jotham she's so big you see she wasn't sitting like a lady so it's security I've come behind you in DC and stood in front of her she can't sit like a lady she's got Hawk legs she might fuck if she's crossing those legs bro so they're so big she's pleased if you have like one of them super tank CrossFit squat girls those giant legs the blood ass in the quad can they even cross their legs I'm sure how could they cross you can cross your legs just something s legs I crossed my legs is comfortable and I get along oh yeah that's pterodactyl take a swing I don't think Tara doctors have big dicks my won't change that one up it's a bird left tail bird there our bird there not a dinosaur well they're not a dinosaur yeah did you know that they're in a class of themselves yeah so it was tell me that my kid told me that oh see this this way we right here this is uncomfortable it's fun so comfy he's a nut cruncher as I'm so comfortable yeah but you got an extra foot of leg yeah there's a lot of room here but with get with Gabby Garcia remember when she was like like big bloated girl and she got shreds Oh totally shred City and then she backed her in between she's back to giant again I think why not cut 245 what are you talking about Brad she's 680 dunno she's 6 4 I mean you see or not 70 to make it she's good friends with cyborg - look how big look at she what she was when she got small yeah she is now she's just hot when she was small she wasn't bad Talan that's what I saw that's what I saw in the air like look at that oh that's when she was on the other alternate fighter with Wanderlei I wonder where she's at mentally when she sees her so like does she take that like there's a lot of dudes are into that she can't go online like I idolized like I had a friend who's a female bodybuilder dick thicker than a Snickers definitely deca Gold's Gym just rang yeah just protein powder seeping out of her goddamn eyes get that pink one above it to the right above above and to the right okay no not mad at at all so at one point in time in the recent future she got down to the body of a really hot CrossFit how much did she weigh there though she's probably still a thousand pounds just 650 for me what do you think 160 there no I bet she's t-64 she's 200 bro she's not to hounds there I bet she's 200 don't you Jamie Jamie she's 6 4 day come on bro okay maybe she's 195 but I'm not going any lower than that that's a big girl she's a logistics floor pretty sure find out how tall she is she's stronger than me that's whatever but there's some Deuter that there's a market for that I got a friend who's a bodybuilding she was busy because she would do some a little bit strange for some change and get oiled on she's only six - I'm sorry - 36 6 - we can make 145 jobs going say what about you what do you think would happen if she just got completely off of everything and just ran marathons what do you think she'd get down to 36 to 236 look at the fucking size of her probably 170 Jesus curl I'm going to death right now this you see it did you see her beat up though do you see a beat up the grandma yes with the knee brace she beat up a grandma with a knee brace bro is so wrong struggle City right here here's her like first of all she's really good at jujitsu by the way phenomenal right you know Kenzie during her hatches yeah Mackenzie beat her on points how crazy that's how badass Mackenzie darkness she poked this chick apparently and they found that check out fake like a hippo - yeah good move I'd fall down I block out she's Russian though they can't forget murder she's back someone's got a bet I have bet you make it to one minute survive anyway you can for fun mean it dude I just boom how do they not have her fight - it's like no more can go the fight has gone one minute my obligation is over here do you think about herbicide wars perverse cyborgs sad burger fucker up Jeff Novitzky psycho high for several weeks so much better standing up than her shoe to have to take cyborg down and cyborg would fuck her up so what you want to watch that now really for obvious reasons that we can talk about look at that there she's right there Bom Bom Bom but legit black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu you can say whatever you want about it but the girl works her ass off yes no matter what I mean matter what you take you don't get that big unless you're training hard she's just dropping bombs in this check her strikings got a lot better a lot more smooth and relaxed like she was having a hard time when she first got oh shit she got drop he's a share tagged that Lea de tapas doing work she looks like thanked Oh was she attacked again damn her striking is terrible well she's hurt she's hurt she's no but yes yeah I've got me Joe all the way this chicks going come on come on come on Sarah come to Center damn she's like bringing it should get a little emotional though that rice and just free-for-all my shoes so gangster they're so gangster they're trying to bring back the golden days I know you know what that day's over so kind of give it a rest but I like what they're doing you see belt or a brought crow crap back and crap Roy I just don't that we've seen that just don't test anybody please don't just stop testing that's all say with the John Jones thing against Brock lesner hey Jeff Novitzky let's uh go grab a cup of coffee while these boys Rumble huh [Laughter] once you go going on vacation to Hawaii well John and Brock take a little trip here the UFC is clean but the USC UFC decided to go down that you saw a road and they've committed to it it's changed the game legitimately for sure let's be honest when you throw that in fucking life oh yeah legend like cro cop he still wants a fight excuse me I'll show up come on that's real I'm not saying he needs it I'm not I'm not it's not a knock on him he's upset at me because bas Rutten was saying that during one of his fights that uh they paid him all this money and they had to bring all this money back like boss is explaining on the boss say it boss said it but he thinks that I said cuz it was on your show yeah I was on my show I didn't know what the boss is gonna say and if I heard anything about it I heard it from boss his boss worked there boss is just fucking hilarious and he's telling me about how they would pay those guys in cash well he doesn't like you he likes me and I punched him in the face meet him were friends but I just want him to go I'm a big fan hell yeah there's a lot of faith in God bad for cro cop I always enjoyed watching him he's an example that I was used of what happens when you get an explosive Stryker versus a technical striker in MMA I think when you get a high-level striker that's used to a certain style of fighting and then they fight in MMA sometimes that style doesn't translate over like I don't think Peter Aerts would have done that good as an MMA fighter I don't think Nestor Hoost would have done that good because they would have to have changed the way they strike because they're so technical and really fun to watch fighting they would brawl for sure yeah but what Mirko would do was have these big one shots these big one kicks these big one punches just jump in with one shot super fast and quick that is really beneficial in MMA more so even than kickboxing because it's volume the bull he's fighting guys who are it at the time were they were concerned about takedowns you're concerned about all these different things that could possibly happen in them and they fight right so no one stands the way they stand in kickboxing when they're standing in kickboxing they're more sideways they're more light on their feet they're moving around because enough to worry about being taken down it's a totally different propositions also a dance on a rhythm yeah yeah yeah guy like who's would just pick you apart start leg kicking you chopping down if he's got to think about takedowns even really great strikers are susceptible to one potshots in MMA because there's so many more things you're thinking of that's why Kevin Randleman cracked cro cop and knocked him out in their fight because he's got to worry about the takedown like if they were just in a kickboxing fight Kevin Randleman and cro cop just in k1 nightmare it's a nightmare for kevin i think about think about wonderboy Woodley you know wonder boy all day big in a kickboxing match all day wonderboy lights him up Woodley that one shot power and he dropped you know one place you know before I think I say that even in kickboxing Woodley I think would do very well because he's so powerful and you'd be able to manage it more though you loves yes catch more and also his punches aren't as dangerous mm-hmm so when he's hitting us I was dangerous you can catch the kicks a little bit better still not fun hell no Boy Wonder was octagons a nightmare not one shot power yeah this little gloves got hopefully fight soon he's going to he's he had shoulder surgery at a torn labrum so he's pounding on that trying to get that fixed outright beat dos Anjos that's what they're gonna do yep maybe they'll do that international fight week two everybody can pay try and get these ratings up for Fox buys WWE imagine if Brock's first fight back as John Jones yeah I can yeah I kiss is what I'm just a card oh not in July yes yes steep a DC grin Sean Jones Brock preach tyron woodley dos Anjos Ortega max Holloway Amanda Nunez cyborg we busting this load on this one card do you do we can still do the ratings did that that place would be is being sane that'd be one of the greatest cards of all stalkers and then on top you sprinkle in let's make a little CM Punk mm you wouldn't be a that one why because that one needs so much money the one that I'm thinking about which one you know the one which one Joe the one that was a lot of sprinkles on top which was you know that boxer guy what's his name I tell employ him something money that we keep talking about if that happen this is by the way I believe you and I were the first speculate that's publicly correct I think that's the fight I think that's a fight to make I agree I don't know if it'll ever happen but I think if it does happen it happens on its own individual card you put a kick-ass card underneath it but I don't know if you put like a UFC 200 sized kick-ass card or anything no gets Floyd and CM Punk's gonna sell and also if you're Floyd just lean it from Floyd's perspective all right pay me this much money which boatload of cash and also give me the guy who has zero experience like me and see a punk who's a huge name yeah so make sense it's the only fight to make for Floyd cuz Kondo literally kill him yeah I can't do that Kyle it wouldn't be fair it's not fair Conor beat up Floyd in CM Punk in the same night people would understand the difference between Conor boxing Floyd which you got clearly outclassed but he hit him like Floyd's not gonna do anything no it's no competition it does it's gonna be sad it doesn't make sense makes sense he'll get kicked once in the legs and be like oh my god now I can't walk and then he gets kicked in the same spot like oh Jesus Christ is folding over he's getting front kicked in the gut Connors talking shit to them get a head kicked officiously and then you're on that highlight reel and the UFC is using that over loop over and over and it takes one clinch just one clinch and you're on on your back if you're seeing Punk then if item Floyd I am army crawling over there Floyd you're not even good and punch me but say you stand karate style you stand karate style and you throw sidekicks you just walk towards him throwing sidekicks there's so many kids to the cage yes why would you even want to box them you stand total wonderboy side stance just stand like this way back lyoto machida style and just throw sidekicks keep them off you and then when the move is whenever it happens get that claim fucking everything in my guy weighs 145 legitimate pounds that's what Floyd way I would even just bear hug him and just pull on top of me and sweep them and get full amount I would literally just come out Floyd like there just walk straight forward like the terminators going to make it welterweight yeah he can make welterweight in boxing he could that's the only problem with this fight that we're speculating his 20 pounds later they gonna fight that see a pucks not small no he was legit sized 170 so he would go and catch weight here you have to be catch weight 60 see that's the other thing you drained CM Punk down to 160 and he's Fox Ville yeah let's do that yeah well here's the thing yet at 170 he doesn't have a lot of muscle but he's got a little bit of fat so maybe six you might be able to do 65 he does it smart and long you know he takes a long time to do it just as calories really ramps up his cardio just forces himself to do an hour of cardio after every training session has anyone seen him lately other man looking thinner no it's kind of to look a lot thinner to get that fight well or Floyd just says I don't give a fuck I'm gonna light this dude up cuz when they're standing when when he's got to close the distance on CM pie Floyd has four ounce gloves on are you fucking kidding me and he's impossible to hit he's in pot you're not gonna hit him that's some cash coming in and it's gonna be fuck yeah night night even the leg kicks like boy can you even kick his legs how fast is CM Punk kick you know I mean we're not talking about like yachts and Clyde that's not the move foresee a pump yeah sir just do what you gotta do get to the great doesn't he have a karate background CM Punk yes much as I I have a karate was like 13 or some shit I play dodge ball - doesn't count soccer player I'm gonna put that on my fucking soccer play my twitter handle now account man play it yeah so hard bro yeah it's that cold brew this new cold brew were snacking on goddamn Jamie what were you showing me right before the podcast started about some dude who just retired because he had a brain injury and a full running but I was just seeing the story so not too much about it but I know who he is names Benny Wells he was a running back in the NFL he had an MRI and it's showing brain injury so he's starting he's already public stating he's having problems with it he is having memory loss speech problems how old is this gentleman 29 I think man yeah man he's already going under treatment right now so like he's he would be one of the first people I've heard of that it's already getting treatment for what I guess they can tell now about potential so what do they do how are they treating it there is handsome fella former Cardinals RB beanie wells dealing with traumatic brain injury so they know for a fact he has it so he must be one of the recipients of one of the newer tests that allows them to see while a person's alive because it used to be these two have to do an autopsy autopsy to find out what's wrong with what's wrong with your brain some plaque separation mm-hmm experience some sort of TBI and says when you have plaques yeah separation shows you've experienced some traumatic brain injury obviously that traumatic injury for me would come from playing football not only that they had some cells tacked on to that separated plaque that I needed to get under control what does that mean you think I mean extra cells I only know is being bad cancer types right still in out of the woods yet but I'm hopeful Wow well at least he sees it right you know and he got ahold of it now when did he stop playing pretty recently and he would also be in Columbus which would be at Ohio State where they have not only like the James Cancer place but I think they're doing the tests or some of the early tests on this Oh remember correctly okay I don't know I talk too much I forget some of the should I say I really do I've realized that when someone asked me what podcast Eric Weinstein and Heather huiying were on and I had to think about it's like 1080 something I thought about look how the fuck could I ever remember what I said if they were all one hour a thousand different conversations plus fight companions yeah this is I think it is Ohio State there's a thing and this is on their medical Wexner Center medical website they have advanced imaging and neuro sensitive care and Rehab Services that's right we're talking brain trauma yeah we're talking about that flip player that just got tested he had a plaque separation in his brain how long did he play for Jamie so probably about seven years I think he's obviously the exception though you know there's obviously a problem but he's definitely the exception I wonder you know it's been around for so long I think a lot of people just live with it you know and the thing is um was that apo a3 with apoE 3 something that Rhonda Patrick was talked about like a gene like somehow the way it expresses itself I know I'm butchering this for the science people going crazy but science people it's more likely that you would get traumatic brain injury if you have it or you do not have there's actually tests for Alzheimer's disease yeah early onset Alzheimer's yeah there's a test you can take to see if you're more susceptible to CT than others it says there are three types of apoE genes called alleles alleles apoE 2 3 e3 and e4 everyone has two copies of the gene in the combination that terms your APO genotype the e2 Alejo I hoping that fuck that I'll probably am a fucking ll e le right is the rarest form the apoE and carrying someone copy appears to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's by up to 40% whoa apo III is the most common allele and doesn't seem to influence risk the apoe4 Alejo I know I'm fucking that word up someone's screaming out their phone right now president aprox Lee 10 to 15% of people increases risk for Alzheimer's and lowers the age of onset that's what I think they think is connected to traumatic brain injury I think it was apoe4 well whatever gene I got I've been knocked that's the way two of them heaviest fuck did that one whatever that is get that one it's made me so much happier well aren't you happy though because your life is going great don't you think that's a factor I think there's something there's something to be said for that that people don't look everybody knows that having good friends in your life having a good relationship having a family and having a career that you're happy with all those things make you feel good it's one people strive for them don't you think then that that has an impact on overall happiness I think you know with with football players and fighters MMA box or stuff like that I think one of the advantages I have is I found my passion and I'm in pursuing that so I don't you know it keeps me happy and it keeps my brain where I have to be super creative so it's keeping me sharp I think a lot of athletes and soldiers for that matter they get done with this high stress high you know rich job and they get put in the real world and they can't they can't find their Lane and it's oh it's PTSD or oh it's brain trauma at CT now you're just depressed man because you went from being the superstar for doing this high-level job to fit in with society now it's tough well I don't think it's no you're not I think it's both that's why I say it's a factor because it's a factor but it's not it's there's a lot of physical factors 100 cent Joe I'm just saying been around blasts 100 100 and that's a legit issue I'm just saying if if people are as fortunate me to go through this sort of traumatic fighting career and then find a passion your true passion you'd be way better off and I have no advice for that I don't know what to tell you but if you could find something you're into it's definitely gonna help you I think for everything in life you know if you were a dentist you do want to be a dentist anymore and you really wanted to make paintings if you could if you could really figure out a way to do that you'd be happier like whatever that thing is it's just really hard for some people to find a thing and that's one of the things I've talked to people I don't really know what I want to do with myself and then they asked me for advice like man no one told me it doesn't really work like this but you got to figure out there's literally not a book you can read and we can talk to you that's gonna point you in the right direction here's that here's the best piece of advice take some action take some action do something key if that doesn't work correct it find something else but keep keep moving keep moving when you're sitting at home going what do I do that's when it's a problem and when you're texting your friends going hey what got any advice for me my advice you use don't ask me for advice yeah don't tell me do you mean for it but are you shit together yeah I don't do that to people I don't call people up say man which door do I just do things correct just go do something agree and it might not be the thing you might say okay well now I know I don't want to do that try something yeah it'll be afraid to fucked up though I fuck up all the time you gotta go down you gotta take risks you got to people are so scared they want to be in that Harbor want to stay safe keep me under the blanket cushions oh that's not which is weird cuz I take risk when it comes to my family my friends even with Brian Ortega I'm like don't do this do that I'm super but with myself I'm pretty reckless but with them only no no wait please wait yeah it's a strange what do you think it's deep end and DC I think it's literally the greatest super fight the UFC has ever made I'm so excited for it some amazing fight when you see how well DC handled volcon old Amir and you see what steep they did to Francis it almost like makes sense while John is out and Brock is busy throwing his piss into a microwave he's got the same pump system that I use out there they strain that bitch and the reason why it's a super fight too is cuz how tough is this car this fight to break down like if someone's like I'm pause if steep is gonna winning like no you're not I'm positive DC's gonna take him down no you're not and the thing is it's like well now DC's find a heavyweight yeah he's undefeated heavyweight know if I can fight at the heavyweight he's actually won the best every weights of all time imagine for one day we see Nowitzki 'he's wearing all diamonds that was what I would do if I was in the Mitsuki if the day Brock Lesnar gets in the UFC I will show up in a full fur coat with a giant diamond encrusted cross he's been pimpin pimpin aemon's on everything gucci sunglasses indoors and just sit there nobody told me how to dress does this just sit there like a god we did aid another one it was just sitting skate side imagine if just like that's the way to do it so everybody know like super obvious if you have to bet on it Joe Jon Jones Brock Lesnar the fights happening huh boy I hope so I hope so things that mean if I was Brock I wouldn't take that fight really no get a fight under your belt first not cup his time we time for that bullshit there's don't warm up as brock lesnar so you get a fight warm up I know it's rarely yes Francis oh Jesus what do you want to do the poor man I'm gonna Francis of rock rock if I'm Bronx excuse me sir I'm blasted doubling like I'm at fucking Minnesota you right through that gym or or in the first round Francis is superhuman freak strong and you got to wear him out before you could take him down but you have to stay conscious long enough to wear him out before you take him down and he's throwing nuclear Putin style in September of fucking head and when they land you're gonna see sparks that's gonna remind you of Alistair Overeem and you're gonna go holy fuck we play that game if you play that game Bob Brock less than I am blast I'm coming with a single inaudible a stumbling through Francis Brock is older he's he'd be the best wrestler that France has ever faced who's that Stevie Brock no brought Brock's the best Restless ought you say he beat the ban on saying it'd be the best wrestle that Francis ever fought oh yeah oh yeah for sure he's also ginormous right but he doesn't have the stand-up acumen that steep a does like Brock is just not as good in the stand-up we don't need any of that so you definitely need a little yeah you gonna need a little yeah look good I'll stir did Alistair kept him off remember that for a hot second then I also want to play the Rock'em Sock'em robots and got flatlined no no when Alistair beat up by Tojo guy we're talk about two different animals Jesus Christ sir how dare you tell I wasn't talking about the berean optic bro don't was a moment in time when you and I get together I just fuckin I'm not salivate to talk about uber room it was a moment in time a special moment he was the scariest man on earth yeah he was a weird moment it was like wait a minute what this is real how was that guy that I was fighting that to it I feel like it's a bad idea well not only did call his doctor he had already won the k1 Grand Prix on the Strikeforce tile he's a smash Brett Rogers I mean he was he was just beating the fuck out of people man Brock was like it what was terrible fight for Brock the awful fighting man would take down the fence and world class striking wicked striking like it was a different kind of strike it's like much more technical juicy like we're in fucking pumping like you're in fucking what's the juice place Jamba Juice the fucking job but he doesn't punch as hard as Francis let's bring back then he did he's just Louise's no I don't think so I don't know man he punch more technical very hard much more technical but I think Francis has got some new things use some power yeah new levels there's the way Francis punches you is like it's a different level now Francis is a complete nightmare however broccolis gonna be an awful matchup for true it's true but I feel like you got two giant moneymakers there that's what I'm I don't know right away we try to make money or not yeah but if Brock loses that's a wrap like if you loses the Francis he loses a most terrifying it's not like he's going on tenure run here we're just trying to get our motto look at before and after that's crazy as Christ 2009 a 2016 whoa that's amazing testosterone is real people that's more testosterone that's that that's that job but not having it's real to for sure yeah tough mentally to yeah there's not much you can do either the other thing about it is like once your body doesn't produce anymore and you're in your late 30s like that and even juice it for a long time there's like clomid and stuff that tries to be a thct or HTC what's a cell phone either way HCG or something whatever it is it's supposed to boost your testosterone naturally but never to the levels when you're injecting that Jamba Juice no not only that though you can't take that stuff it's about the UFC right it's illegal just saying when yeah that's true when I guess when he retires he can do whatever the fuck he wants yeah when he retires or goes to rise in you imagine UFC lets him out the contract then all sudden he disappears for like eight months and just were here just locked in the house and Forbes horsemeat back just just fillet of horse all day he's eating that Canelo me and it goes back to deadlift and hanging out with power lifters steps out of the fucking house in Holland six months later dick tied around 297 yes you know I want that journey for I want that it's not one I'm bored of that training is only one way can happen dude how about cojes and hot for fucking Clem brew trawl and they're saying it's in the meat Mexico it is it's a small trace amount and everyone's like oh the fights off trust me it's boxing that fight is not off there's way too much money involved that is a real fact oh is that one particular substance he tested positive for exists in meat literally and also it's not like straight steroid it's like it's you know guys use it to cut weight stuff like that and it's such a small trace amount they're gonna be fine yeah that's such a great fight triple G canola man it's a very good fight and it's better than the first Cinco de Maya why do you think it's gonna be better because I think triple G don't fight like himself he wasn't he has that mix in style he's a little reserved and then you know Canelo is moving too much I think now that they're gonna bring in like the real fight now mm-hmm I don't think the judges fucked this one up you never know though it's shady I loved the first fight I loved it I love me too I thought triple G won it going away though I really thought he won me too I think a lot of people did yeah a lot of people thought that was a poor draw that's what I think you know chip with G coming off you know that draw now there's a lot more hype with everyone's getting tuned in the ratings gonna be better but boxing judges you know they're crooked MMA is nowhere near as bad but Bob like did you see the wilder Ortiz fight no I thought for sure Wilder was losing on the cards like he's gonna have to get a finish but on the actual scorecards they had Wilder winning which off see they want Wilder to win which was I thought was I was like I didn't and I'm a Wilder dick rider like you saying that fight I think MMA might be worse and they're the same exact judges there's a lot of the same judges that judge MMA that also judge box and also judge MMA and they don't even know what MMA is but how about you in DC trying to walk that tightrope of not clown and what's-her-name Adaline hurt she's a very nice lady as you said it was my mom I don't want to fucking piss exactly what I've not judging that's exactly what I say it's so fun DC just trying to balance that she has no business being in that in the no she's a very nice lady but yeah she's made some bad decisions and she also was a part all in though she was also a part of the Canelo Alvarez triple G decision that's the problem yeah she's fallen yeah and she was on the wrong side of a couple decisions that night there was some there's some bad ones super-society some that we like what how did he win every round what well you didn't make any sense like some that some that literally didn't make anything on the UFC yeah this past weekend there was a lot of bad decision bad ones yeah but there was like a couple of split decisions that I was like what in the actual fuck is this and the way it screws over the finer they've like the repercussion is such a shitty deal yep yeah they lose half their money oh yeah my money cuz you don't know what's going on and literally dude there's no recourse and if it's a bad decision in there's three people and one person just has literally no idea what they're doing and they give it to the wrong person it's awful man it's fucking terrible and it's unnecessary here's the thing it's unnecessary there's way better methods and one of the most better methods is one of the better methods is hire someone who is an actual martial arts expert like I'm Matt Hume or something like that someone to score like oh you can I'm sure there's a lot of those guys that would do it a lot of trainers out there that would do it I think I agree you have someone who specializes in mixed martial arts she's been around the game I don't they don't need to be Cate side cuz Kate side can't see everything and you're also swayed by the crowd they should be in an undisclosed location and they're watching what we see and judging the fight from my MMA fighter's perspective I think that's a good point and I also think they should be able to see all the replays yes they should see all the fight stats they get everything get everything copy strikes and then decide yeah but what you're doing is so old-school the only thing that I would disagree with I don't think they should hear the commentary because I think the commentary can switch I'm saying no comment no no crowd noise you have three expert MMA and I was watching on this who's winning cuz you get it they know the ground game you know for that for Tony first and khabib let's say Kobe takes Tony down and they think oh he has a huge advantage and then Tony just whooping his ass from his back elbows submission game stand back up Ken taken down but on the ground could be constantly under threat yeah how you gonna judge that how are ya you got to know what you're looking at I also think three is too small I think it should be 10 people 10 people a lot of people care qualify have them call in it's a real shit show do it all dude it all with the internet you didn't even have to be in the building either 10 yeah 10 people it's hard off with three more but if there's two that are smart and one that's bad you got a shitty split decision and everybody feels weird about it like what would have happen if there's three morons a 5 10 10 10 you're gonna get the right decision almost every time because that's true a few people are gonna disagree but most people gonna see it that the majority is gonna see it this way and agree and it's 5 to 5 you gotta fuckin draw in your hands and that's rare and I think sometimes a fight should be a fucking draw I don't have a problem with the drop sometimes watch I go man that's too close to call don't fuck over Sonya in half their pay if there's a draw they both get their win that's how we should do exactly one guy moves on and the other guy doesn't just arbitrarily so weird it doesn't make any sense or you draw and they'd have to in the contract and rematch on whatever card they're ready to go again I do it again kaolin the fucking address here I'm 75 minutes away he found it he says he's close I don't believe that he might be good Brian Calvin Brian King Khalid so what else is going on the UFC was what's happened what other big fights are there um dude when Yoel Romero comes in and talks to Joey Diaz and me he's getting ready to fight Whitaker they're gonna he's getting he's gonna fight for the title even though he didn't make weight in the Rockhold fight that's short notice I don't hold that against them though especially with his body type god he looked again it that good against rock cold hot rock cold said he was like made out of metal said the guy was just ridiculously strong tough light rock cold for anybody for anyone unless you Robert Whittaker but yeah yeah and Riddick her with healthy needs man yeah he's me tough to beat for a long time but if someone could do it could be ul he's not young 40 years old son every bit of it yeah who knows those Cuban birth certificates you have no idea that's what I say with Ortiz they said oh he's 38 went bullsh that's the most shot out 38 year old I've ever seen that man has 400 amateur fights in Cuba there's no age 38 48 you think so the no not 38 there's no way you see them up close I'm like what fine did you see him up close yeah I said the press the waiting's all that stuff for sure done did you see the fight live or did you see it on TV no I flew back supposed to work here I flew back I watched Kovalev beat up his friend beat the piss out of his friend it was like his friend yeah I was like the guy was fighting like he was his friend and Kovalev was fighting him like some guy fucked his girlfriend yes : yeah and it didn't seem I don't know the fucker he's a Superman my fucker but now with that wilder Ortiz fight which was it kind of did what I think for Wilder what empty Joshua with against Klitschko we're not everyone's talk ground so now before we didn't think we'd Anthony Joshua Wilder but I think it forces Joshua's hand to fight Wilder but before it wasn't gonna happen which that's the fight why wasn't gonna happen before cuz if they well so anti Joshua has to get through Joseph Parker first right early next month which is a beast just Parker's a nightmare from New Zealand right 20 you know you know yeah world champion no punks let's get by that and then he's gonna take like one or two more fights before he fought Wilder and I can't do that because while they're just one by emphatic now yeah it's like what are you talking about the hops even those talked about box right now you have to take this fight why did they put fights like that off like why do they say we'll take a couple more boxing well listen if it has a business to hear if you're Anthony Joshua's man just like I do we fight doctorado who's forty you know 39 knockouts the nightmare of a fight for anybody which we probably favorites still to fight or do we fight this guy this guy get paid and then fight Wilder hmm you know things go wrong exactly Joseph Joseph Parker's no joke not at all no but yeah things could go wrong but that's the I'm assuming that's their way of thinking you know well it's scary I was jumping around I'll see being around these guys you know I get close with guys I know Wilder I wanted to win so bad just cuz it's good for the sport it's not knocking Ortiz Ortiz is a amazing fighter but Wow he checks all the boxes man he can even sell tickets he's American he's you know he talks a lot of shit he has a great story started boxing because his daughter was born with a spinal issue and couldn't walk and he just has these great stories and you want the root for that dress as well dresses well dimepiece yeah but hey man Josh was the fight yeah he has won his last couple fights pretty spectacularly - people are so fucking it's so bad they get so mad at me they go are you oh my god oh you're such a home or you you love wild I'm like well I like Joshua to whether I used to root for Joshua but I like both of them man can't respond to those people I don't respond but he can't even right now you're responding well it's my job you know we do that thing kind of yeah you know I like both of those guys man I love both though you can like both of them yeah this one Ferguson Tony Ferguson got mad that I put a khabees hat on hey Tony so we're tall tents planning like hey bro I'm wearing that guy gives me the hat I'm wearing it yeah I could be by like Tony yeah like Ortega like Frank you want to see you guys fight I think would be awesome you're gonna be animosity no no doubt if someone doesn't make weight or get hurt like I'm gonna cry yeah I'm blue every day when I checked Tony's Instagram or check khabib Z cool there's no injuries please no injuries everybody keep it together it's getting crazy in there we're not even a month away not even a month work yeah that's a fight yeah what is the date it's March 6 it's a month and a day for a month in a day that fight that fight is by far my favorite the fight has to happen has for action could be and then steep a DC those are my two fights where I'm just I'm really like the school walking card chiesa versus Pettis I forgot about that al Iaquinta versus Paul Felder are you fucking shit money dude you wanna do rose yeah Joe Lauzon you wanna Anne rose oh my goodness god damn Evan Dunham is still suing the damn thing and they gave him that monster yeah tie some off well they couldn't get no one trying to fight tight they couldn't get married back Tyson off a good fight for a long time he's very very terrified gentlemen yeah and he's having a real hard time getting matchups with Evan Dunham doesn't get over bet you anything your boy Connor is there because his boy artem low Bob's fighting and partisan kabhi makes sense yeah lobe office fighting casares that should be fine Fatman it's tough dude salty record at 14-14 but that's life yeah he's um it's interesting because there's two schools of thought with him and Connor is that you know that he's strong and he's powerful and you know he's he's a good sparring partner for Connor but I've also heard people say no Connor likes them because Connor can fuck him up and Connor spawn just went in love yeah so goddamn tough like having a really tough sparring partner it's probably a great idea you get both yeah he's not exactly the technician but he's Bardem so damn tough it's hard to he hits hard he's that you gotta watch your P's and Q's at all be I'm sure he's a great training particle wait he's loyal to it's not going to hurt you that's super important oh yeah especially now in Connors life that's got to be real important you know I mean how many people were just constantly trying to get the best of him that's all no that's Jack no new friends there's no new guy sparring with them I was looking at this this dude couture Oh on k1 here I'm gonna send it to Jamie this dudes they were they were doing the exact kind of sparring that I fucking hate to see anyone do where they were literally just going at each other out and then Kotaro connected with a giant bomb and knocked him out yes he did it was awful that's that old-school fighting man I'm gonna send this to Jamie I'm also gonna super old-school buddy well it's just it's unfortunate when people choose to train like this because this is a real knockout that this guy suffered and it wasn't an accident like this guy was teeing off on him trying to knock him out I just sent it to you in a text message it's not like the guy was knocked out because you know he just got caught with a freak punch-out we go boys bar and watch this shit who those guys in the back and leave this look at this well they're playing for keeps and then walks away like he doesn't give a fuck it's so weird man hey yo they don't get anything out of it look at this that guy doesn't look very good oh he's fighting no no he doesn't and I mean he is swinging from the oh that's kidding like kayoed yeah he's flatline yeah how do you say his last name that that talking to me I'm the worst that's the honey how do you think it's it tella k1 Takeru Takeru are you to Cairo yeah and then he posted that yep it's awful right no it's just a tool moon it's awful well it's just a maybe it wasn't him sparring I don't know who was uh getting K out like that but that should be an example of just what not to do shoot box back in fucking 97 what are you doing does it show the translation no cares either way either way home posted that's how it used to be that's how guys spark got back in the day like for sure educators I know that's why when you see something like that today like hard to see now that's not it's not smart it's not good for you and it's not a good way to Train you're not learning from also you gonna break all your toys so people go oh you fight like that no we're good man right we're good or you have to be a guy who can hang in there in that gym and do that but all of your gonna take unnecessary damage can you do it yeah you could do it that's how we used to do it everyone's do they can do it but is it smart to do it definitely not no it's not the right way to do it especially at his level we know you're tough man you're gonna knock guys out get a one what are you doing yeah did you watch how the glorious past weekend I'm not huge into glory jokes I watch all comments boys are you I know I know you only keep boxing it's alright to me I do I enjoy it I appreciate the art stuff like that but I was I was really in decay one and when it was in its prime but with like it's hard for me give me glory and there's some amazing guys in there I'm just I'd only have so much time on my hands where Glory's not that's already yeah I don't know to me I like it better than boxing to me okay are you I'm sorry I don't know being honest I appreciate real good glory fight to me is more interesting than a real good boxing match cool crazy like kicks crazy like knees I like Muay Thai even more more than boxing yep good boxing match yeah if you rather watch that inconel a triple G you got your gun well that's exceptional that's a lifetime match you know about Ortiz fight man one of the best I've ever seen but like say if it was like buuck ow versus sanchow yeah I would be just as excited about yeah that's fair you know I mean like those two levels yeah that level yeah not so extreme that's crazy fight yeah you'd want to see what happens yeah I don't know I just again I can appreciate when there's a good fight I'm down but I'm not gonna shut down my night in order pizza and watch a glory mmm well I will for sure but yeah but I don't miss play which is weird which I don't miss any MMA UFC Bellator I don't miss any boxing there's so much shut everything down did you get excited about the Kovalev fight or was just like no I get excited about it anytime yeah super excited about it yeah like this past weekend I was just so happy because I knew I had I'd freaking Showtime boxing out with wilder for shorties which is a great fight and then you also had you'll see 2:22 so when you can and that ended before the co-main event so I get to see all of it that makes my weekend man did you see that dude Alexander Hernandez starch Benilde are you shocked did he have dare you she's hit a rough patch how about your boy Hector and goosh yeah x1 bar that wasn't good were you out on that cheap shot cheap shot you think yeah I think is a natural response you can get away with I agree the second punch he knows the bells already rung yep the first one I have tonight you're in motion yeah but that's that second one that knocked him out that's where I draw the line yeah it's healthy he's bad guy but it's also a natural counter to kick like that to throw that straight right with the left hook so maybe there's that but you can't have the fight carry on well he definitely naturally fired back but he knew in his head that the Bell had rung and he fired back anyway I mean that's what it that's what happened why did he do it I don't know but here's the thing we can't speculate we don't know no one knows it was on purpose all you know is the Bell routing rules the rules real clear the bell rings the dude throws a punch and then another punch after the Bell 100% foul there's no gray area like that they're gonna appeal that to me is crazy and Hector was saying something like the guy was talking he was fine just like you say my pendant where am I yeah let's let's see a CB Dollaway said yeah he said it over I kept saying that he was saying I was letting a everybody no because he was saying it over and over again and we all know what that is we've all seen that when the guy gets knocked out and just keeps saying what happened what's a nightmare it happens so often yes that is what always happens when people get kayoed sued they go oh shit what happened you don't remember and you tell them and then five minutes later what happened and then you tell them why am I here what happened like they forget over and over again all night I have to stay up Hector's in a tough spot he's lost five in a row now mm-hmm so I don't know what they're gonna do with him well I mean I would imagine if CB wants to do a rematch they would do a rematch cuz is there'd be some interest in that fight because either one of those guys is not generating a ton of interest correct Hector's lost a lot of fire a lot of fights his last two he got knocked out by Marquardt remember that yes that that was bad yeah and that was it seemed to me like one of those fights where he thought Marquardt was done you know last thing to go your mate retired yeah I'm glad I'm glad I mean third but there's a thing that happens to fighters where you know they just can't take a shot anymore they'd been doing it too long just a fact and so guys go after him but the last thing to go with a guy like Nate his power yes he knocks out CB after CB you know keep CB came back and who did he be I thought see me won two in a row and they got Hector did he lose it one indecision I'm pretty sure after mate he won one well you know he got fucked up in an elevator accident he's in a lawsuit at the UFC over yeah he's like permanently fucked up his ease elevate that one happened he was on an elevator and it just dropped the elevator just dropped and slammed onto the bottom I'm sorry how's that the UFC's problem it's not think he's in a lawsuit with you is he not am I crazy a lawsuit I think with the hotel I thought it the UFC maybe I'm wrong it doesn't make sense the elevator then I have misinformation it won't make sense come after you see if it was the hotel you didn't know that it was the the elevator accident I know it's the elevator so yeah it doesn't make sense that they'd come after the you know I would come after the you have sex what I heard but apparently there was quite a few people in that elevator and when he dropped a lot of them got fucked up it is more than three or four people in the elevator but he got fucked up bad was it a Steve Wynn I don't know one who owned it I don't know where it was do you not remember that's such a shame look at the ass for that bill yeah but he did go and fight again so they would probably be arguing like hey you're still professional that's what I was going to say cuz he's in that lawsuit then you fight this weekend the courtrooms gonna be like hold up you're saying you're max an issue they fought Hector Lombard yeah you're talking about yeah that's true right the best argument would be did not fight until the lawsuits settled and then wait shoots some stem cells in there down to Panama yeah dying you see you were standing Wyndham Hotel in Cleveland don't stay at window yeah or do so they'll sue the shit out of those people see what happens but yeah the patio elevator apparently was getting funky on people before and people were still riding it don't don't more people down in elevators because when they they're like talking to a friend they assume the elevators there and then walk in the elevator stopped then they go down more people die like that then we're even imagine you doesn't come out or open the door because it think you know it's not goes thing I mean like a yeah go and they fall to their death it's a bad one it's always like the elevators there that's a fucked up way to end it shitty deal you don't want to go out like that no I heard a story about a dude who got trapped in an elevator the elevator went up and he was trapped in the door and the elevator went up and just sheared him in half I saw them final destination - maybe that's what it was yeah yeah I made it up now I'm pretty sure was real that'd be a terrible way to go Oh looks like that actor who's in Star Trek and he was in alpha dog he was right up here man in Hollywood Hollywood Hills he lives on a on a incline and it was beginning out of his Jeep to close the garage door and he didn't put the Jeep in park and it rolled up killed him roll over and killed him dropping against the garage door young actor two phenomenal actors walk Wow Baxter on the elevator one leg in the elevator one leg in the second floor he was helping the occupants get off the elevator when also then shot upwards beheading him that's it his body fell into the second floor lobbies had fall unto the law floor of the elevator his head in the two remaining passengers an elevator shot up to the ninth floor one of the pastors described the scene I can't get out of my mind the head was there the BA but the body wasn't he still had the Walkman earphones on his head holy shit there have been many problems with the elevator and the service repairman was at the building that day to work on it the elevator had been inspected November 1st 1994 and passed the inspection George that's a way to go baby not good painless though yes but you would be awake for a couple seconds you know they say won't you like a chicken right that doesn't make sense to me though because how come you're not awake when you get choked out right well because when you when you get decapitated right everything's still find some of the energy still up there firing so you can see maybe yeah I heard about that chicken that didn't have any head live for 18 months without a noggin after a farm and a failed attempt at slaughter act off the head but missed the jugular vein we really we really don't know right when people lose their head chickens are the fucking dinosaurs man this shit said that many many too many times but that kind of shit is what you need to see just realize it's not that's not person although the pterodactyls not a dinosaur it's so strange to me I know I think pterodactyls might have had feathers they don't know they're thinking now that a lot of dinosaurs had feathers but when you think about what a pterodactyl is we always assumed it had like bat wings but now that they think that dinosaurs are feathers a wonderful a giant bird yeah wonderful akin to that and look it as a possibility you ever see or see that giant picture that it's the t-rex covered in feathers yeah that shit out of my face they didn't look like that bitch they might no no Raptors covering the others like red feathers they look pretty dope to men you seen the pictures Jamie that bullshit t-rex covered in feathers yeah that one's furry that's cute that one that's cool yeah see that one we showed it before it's out here Bozeman Bozeman Science Museum or some shit in Bozeman Montana pretty cool place and they have a replica of what they think a raptor could have looked like if it was covered in feathers because they think it's very possible that that's what those things looked like remember Jamie there was it was on the floor there was an actual model we pulled up the image before I mean if you go to images and some science it for the feathers but if that's what they think because they found some that have feathers they know that they've got some fossils that have like very clear indentations wear feathers must have been well then everything I grew up on with dinosaurs is wrong well they think that's true anyway they used to think the t-rex was a predator and now they think it's scavenger I think this is vegetarian yeah no they think he just waddle around just Kruk like that's why the teeth are so big crushed dead animals are just laying around that's it right there that's what I think that thing looks like which is kind of even more nightmare that's more freaky big alive feathered fucking lizard that runs and guts you with its claws my brains trying to analyze it it doesn't really work well because how we know dinosaurs yeah but they have an eagle man I mean Eagle is a lot like a fucking dinosaur it just it has a hatchet for a head that's think instead of teeth yeah but you look at an ostrich you look at their legs and shit you can see dinosaur haunted their feet yeah but nobody has teeth like that there's not a single bird that has like leopard seal type teeth you know God leper seal underappreciate analytical mean is fucked one of the coolest annals of Okoye and we're on these scooters and went down there's all these leopard seals and there's some people taking pictures some asian dude walk they've got nose to nose with this thing I told my brother good get your camera cuz that thing if they rip his face off and this could be awesome my god they're fucking killers man so bird leopard you know I'm saying like they're leopard seals for a reason man you know I didn't even know they were a real thing until I watched that march of the Penguins movie what what you know what a fucking rat leopard seal was I never heard of it either gangster yeah they haven't scared cuz since the kid I was in Mexico and there's one going up in the water I thought Oh cute look it's like the ones I see on cartoons and my dad's friend homes the neighbors I do not go in the water those things are mean is fuck yeah I was like really Zach yes they're out there fucking killing shit right now yeah they've eaten people before there's one of them the poor penguin some scientist actually a female scientist in a rare attack got killed I want to say about ten years ago those things are gangster they're pretty stunned because they have giant mouths and huge teeth they look like with his mouth closed there looks so fucking cute like hey buddy that's what that agent is doing nose the nose with his buddy hi buddy now get me a picture of his teeth like right above with his mouth open go large on that that's not even a good one that thing looks like a tremor yeah right there oh Jesus Christ it look like tremors look at that man I mean that is that doesn't look like a real thing that looks like a fake animal it looks like it the movie Trevor get shitty CGI Trevor shout out to Kevin Bacon I was thinking this about the Oscars let's go to that one of the lower left look at these fucking teeth he looks right to me I don't kick you those teeth bro how'd sheriff fish talk he's like I would be really happy to eat your asshole percent want to take a bite out of your dick person they're fucking killers yeah we're gonna say about the Oscars though oh I was thinking the killers no I was thinking like when are we no one it's no one can possibly see all the movies because we keep adding to the library every week new movies come out they don't take movies away no you have to hit a certain period where they're gonna preview that movie so you up for the awards that's not what I mean I don't care about the Oscars I don't keep with your awards I'm saying the number of movies that we produce as the human race is fuckin crazy and it's never ending yes like every year they put out more and movies don't go away so they're just the database just stacking and stacking and stacked enough to follow and it's only been happening for a hundred years yeah I mean and that was silent in the beginning right so there's been a hundred years of these movies just stacking up and all the premises like if you think about premises like the parol the robots get smart and want to kill the people okay all the monkeys get smart and they want to kill the people okay like there's all these premises that just go all there's worms they live on the ground that calls earthquakes I like it great movie like this is so many of these I'm in immediately so many like like it's must be so hard to come up with an original premise for a movie there's so many fucking movies like you think it's hard to come up with a new joke or a new premise for a joke well the way think movies what do you think you get like Jim re-creation of Jumanji of rocky and Predator like they're running out of ideas how many buddy-buddy movies can we see can we put the rock Kevin horn somebody goddamn movie that's just these regurgitation of all the same shit we've already seen yeah yeah it's there's so many movies yes there's not that many paid actors is there like it's a struggle city less than 1% make a living acting but there's a jillion movie is it less than 1% less less than 1% make a living really good movies of all actors yes Wow that's crazy like a quality living of all the actors less than 1% that's pretty crazy crazy think anyway comics make a legit living do you make comics are the difference being that for a comic it's more up to them correct it's more up to them to go and you're a good piece of proof of that obviously you have the boost of being famous from the UFC and then being famous from your podcast those two things helped you as a boost but also the hustling yeah and that's the thing that like an actor can hustle but you have to be hired you got to be hired to do something there's a million moving pieces you got a track where you have tests well people have to like you'd be right for the Royal you could just go up on a showcase night and do like 15 minutes kill and you're on the money yeah acting's a motherfucker a hard gig to get good at to you know acting yeah I think like God to get good at like Daniel day-lewis Styles watching there will be blood the other day and I was just thinking like this guy's like the butcher putting out so many yeah whoo New York what does that gangster in the Eric I forgot how good there will be blood was I watched it the other day in a hotel and I was near where it happened because I was doing gigs in Fresno and Bakersfield and I didn't know that but that Tehachapi Mountains that's where there will be blood saw about that's where they were drilling for oil that's right over there amazing movie dude I think it's funny sometimes fighters whoever athletes go I'm gonna go to Holly we get into acting like maniiness sit in on a class or he needs watch someone do like a dramatic role and see if it's for you me I mean you're talking about it's a legit craft man some people are just good at this there's a thing that they're doing where you're you you're compelled by their words you have held by what they're doing it's not easy to give it's not easy to achieve that spot not a lot of guys do it no it's a true art that that's why it's so tough to get casted in those roles and TV and movies yeah reason why it's so goddamn tough I've been watching that Viking show you watch that Viking show that's on history wall and baby yeah you get on Apple I got on iTunes it's fucking good man it's good show and it keeps getting better and they're really good actors I want season two right now I need some shows man I ran out well we've seen Punisher on Netflix have not changed your life that good it's you would love it it's a lot of shoe mops hell yeah thanks yeah I just don't like action that doesn't do anything right I like a good story yeah Punishers dub rent what went through El Chapo went through narcos don't work you've never seen the wire I've ever seen the wire seen the wire get like season five that's all there is they just did it released it in HD so if you haven't seen it you could watch it some people say grace it's probably the best ever ever yeah that's a strong spoken easier for you to say because I haven't seen it you fuck it straight it's true that is right from people ranked at number one that bronto's right yeah I've seen someone well that's a problem you know liar son I stopped one episode of The Wire well I've seen half an episode Sopranos Sopranos was the show that got me into binge watching but not binge because you know watch it every Sunday whenever it was on or whatever yeah night for it yeah HBO night with your girl was it big though it was a big deal to sit and watch The Sopranos like boy here we go the that time was I was with Game of Thrones mmm Brian here yeah yeah some poor electric car that he half charges how often do you think Brian fully charges that car it's just in the shop he's like ran into a wall or so so he treats his cars like shit and he goes dude do you think I should hear Porsche like you and Brogan like no absolutely not absolutely not that's not him he's hitting full-on midlife crisis let's let's encourage it I want to get a yellow Viper like foot in braces like I want to be that guy in a shit tan anyway Oh Viper now he doesn't know how to drive enough for a Viper but he should drive something that has some balls yeah Tesla's bummed me out I like the message that's just not the car for me doesn't make any noise not the problem the fact that it doesn't make any noise it doesn't do I'm just too used to noise me - I don't we sound like two cavemen right now but it doesn't have that PA door that v10 noise to be saying that exhaust there's nothing and I you know what it's pissing me off that lately car manufacturers have been adding noise to their cars like the Maserati they put it in this in the speakers what yes in what cars BMW and m4 does it they put in the speakers up sound they pump sound through the speakers that's a bitch so as the engine goes up it comes some of it's coming in through speakers like panel brawls your girl apparently some guys have figured out a way how to cut that out I think what you do with that turbocharged cars turbocharged car turbocharged cars when you have forced induction forced hot air induction it makes the car much quieter doesn't sound nearly as like throaty and rumbly like my gt3 you know raw that thing sound of that because it's naturally aspirated and you also get instantaneous feedback from the from the throttle response it's what you want that's what you want when you get into turbochargers it's all about turbo lag which is why they have twin turbos they have one turbo on the low end one turbo on the high end but even at the very best implementations of turbo chargers there's still a perceptible lag slight lag slightly getting better and better though Porsha yeah yeah yeah um they get they're definitely better than they used to be due to how the fuck gave it up in on cars comedians in cars getting coffee Oh another thing no no I get Jay Leno Show I've done enough car things that's true let's take that new Porsche get on there something I can't believe you're from Newport literally I was like I'm I want I hit you about the podcast I'm just here to see the car and you didn't bring it has an oil leak you know yeah well you bought it's not new it's 1991 1991 964 something I wanted to fuck around with one of those older cars I like those love it they're small they're real small that's one of the weird things about it when you round it like those things are tiny a driver's car yeah you know what I love it cuz do you not gonna see it no one has it out there it's customed to you yeah that's right there's more of them now than they have been before people with older cars thanks to your boy Magnus Walker yeah Chris Harris had something funny to me said why is it the four years ago I didn't give a shit about nine six fours now I think for the best-looking cars there it goes Portia goes through these phases where this one's cool is with a 68 78 it's just these weird phases well those long hood cars are kind of always the best-looking ones the 19 like 67 to like 70 early 70s like 72 73 you know they have that long hood doesn't ones that Magnus is really in yeah he's done a few of those where he redid them he made him cool too yeah oh yeah for sure well his style like that that's another level more raw than what I'm dealing with Magnus yeah because his style of what he has in 1964 too but a lot of what his older cars were were those 1969-1970 ones and those he would redo those and those cars don't wait dogs shed they weigh like 2,000 realize not like the Porsche purists think like they're not really into the fingers or the Magnus Walker you know I'm saying I think your cars in the middle of that I think yeah it's not modified it's not like a singer which is completely different singers got a carbon-fiber body I actually think singers they might be good there's a lawsuit Porsche took a lawsuit out of them cuz they're selling the Porsches but they're taking the Porsche logo off put a singer one on them yeah such as the bushes suing them they have an issue with it yeah that's interesting yeah I thought they liked it because it was just like bringing back interest in I think they liked it before you started making it the singer you know I'm saying yeah because what he's doing is taken in 964 which is that same year that I'm talking about and then he puts all this other stuff on it and beats up the suspension and beats up the engine like impossible to get to yeah they're so sick well now he has a new one that starts at 1.5 million dollars is that it Jesus Christ there's a limited number of them they're gonna make it has a 500 horsepower naturally aspirated engine it's got giant fender flares they'd see if you could find it the singers say no more if a man dude you're in wait till you take a look at this thing okay sometimes I like when you send me pictures of cars again mate so no no see that makes you mad they're so sick and that you mad like there's not enough cars in the world for me yeah what is it about cars I don't know cars and girls they'd like you see you like God right it just speaks to DNA and it's it's a and it's not all men somehow Callen come on here you could show them that yeah where is he he's in the dressing room I mean I've had yeah he's walking around the gym see him I guarantee you he hits that punching thing you have he's gonna break it he's got karate power whoa you know I would but my wrist yeah maybe is that but this I mean some men don't get into it but it's so universal with men it's just it's so normal that men like really get into cars why is that I don't know I don't know what is the battle especially v8s right like I'm not the type of guy where like I'll see a car and my brother's supercar gonna go that thing your car s not on a track like I don't give a shit about the track man yeah those guys who are like those track guys and I'm just like a road guy fun driving car

better looking car than that though you know I'm saying well I'm gonna be honest those Fuchs wheels I always felt like they're not good enough for that body style look how the wheel wells on that I always felt like they're classic those Fuchs are quiet leading they have center locking hubs to see that look at the fuck that dignity on that thing filthy tail in the back that's the only reason I bought my car cuz the duck tail look at the back end oh my god that might be one of the best-looking cars ever ever ever what's the interior like on that - oh it's phenomenal it's all it's you're gonna be orange I said look at the center locks man and like people say all bespoke the interior look at that Jesus Christ how much is it 1.6 million makes you want to risk it all Yeah right just sign
