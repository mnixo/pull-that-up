throughout the that this this artificial world that we've created of hyperspace we're gonna have like a hyperspace cloud drive of humanity that's gonna be just as fucking crowded as Earth and we're gonna go shit we don't have enough hard drive space in the fucking cloud and these assholes keep copying themselves because they want to be immortal so like rich guys would have like a cloud server if like 200 trillion terabytes and it would just be filled with copies of themselves and then they would just send out fucking like fake emails click here to see some dick whoa I want to see some dick you click there boom he it's an exploit it gets into your server bang makes copies of himself everywhere yeah you'll be able to like get Joe Rogan in your car's your car it has your brain and all your

many of you fuckers if people don't think about that shit man if it's possible to download consciousness is possible to copy it it's possible to copy it it's possible spam it in that sense human history's really kind of fucked up and weird when you if you approach it with them through a moral lens because you see so many nasty things take place and in the weird ones are the ones where there really is no good solution where you don't know what the healthy thing would be like there's one that I was researching for a history on fire maybe a year from now or something I was researching this story from the 1980s in El Salvador at that time there was a right-wing government in El Salvador that the US government was supporting and there was a leftist Korea there was in the logic of the Cold War there are only two options here either pro-communist or your pro-us there's nothing in between right so in the process of fighting this leftist guerrilla the government of El Salvador is doing nasty things right anybody you criticize them doesn't matter whether they're communist or not torture to that chop off their bodies leave them in the middle of the street American Congress at that point was like oh shit you know it can't really keep sending millions of dollars to these guys we're doing horrible human rights violations so they passed this law that in order for any more aid to be sent to the governor of El Salvador the President of the United States to sign off on a document stating that these guys have made huge improvements in their human rights record that they are on the right path you know it's yet better problem is the deadline is coming up Reagan is itching to be able to send out all these millions of dollars to the government of El Salvador and in that moment the Salvadorian army comes on these offensive against the birria they find some villages that just wanted to be left the fuck alone they were not Pro communists but they were not anti-communist ealier they were like a bunch of evangelical Christians peasants who just wanted to farm their fields and be left alone so he would let the Communists go through they would let the army go through the figure if we stay neutral everything works out right well not in the Cold War and the Cold War there is no neutrality or either on one side or the other so Salvadorian army come in grab every single villagers separate the men from the women killed the man rape all the women then kill them all kill everybody in that village and New York Times the New York Times did an article on it and Reagan was like oh shit what do I do now so he said the guy who wrote this article is some crazy communist none of this is true it's a smear campaign against our allies the government of El Salvador has made huge improvements and send in the millions of dollars of course years down the road turns out that the original story was true that this stuff did happen and but other than bitching about Reagan this is not even an anti Reagan thing he said it's a messy situation because you do support government of a sir brother you're literally supporting death squads child rapists I mean it doesn't really get any worse than that you don't support them there's a chance that El Salvador could turn into a communist state in which case is not exactly like communism around the world as a high reputation for human rights it's fucking awful right so it's like what do you choose you know do you choose to support them or do you choose it's like how do you you see where I'm going like again it's a situation where no matter what you choose you're fucked you're doing bad things but clearly you've the moment you're supporting death squads that cannot be the right solution not that there are but at the same time what is the right solution what is the good thing you should do you know Carter at the same exact problem you know right before Reagan Carter some guy DRG Bishop of El Salvador this guy Oscar Romero sent email they're saying stop fucking sending money to my government because they're doing horrible things with it card I was like and I want to look at this because this is politically troubling for me so two weeks later death squads walked into the main Church in El Salvador this guy was celebrating Mass they gunned him down kill them so it's not a Republican or democratic thing you know he's like both sides of the game there did not know how to handle this in a situation where it's like which mass murderers do we support and which ones do we oppose because that's the reality of it yeah I was like there was heard a story like what the fuck do you do yeah I would imagine and probably last a long-ass time to long time at the beach it's probably a couple solid hours of visions then right with that kind of dose yeah on and off there was some yeah there I kept seeing initially I kept seeing like this group of people like kind of eyeballing us and I was thinking like are they gonna take our shit like are they gonna try to steal or am I gonna have to fight someone like this isn't weird this is a place not a lot of people go to and they kept seeing that and then I have to take a deep breath like ah and toshka like feel me you know feel like my energy she could feel what's going on she they are you okay like ah somebody kind of come no what are you what are you talking about and she's like planes fucking sea turtle bugs she or whatever you know like she's just she's in heaven you know it's just looking over at me and my okay she's like seriously you're fine don't you worry you're fine it's like okay and I put my head back down and it kept seeing then like this young kid kind of comes through the crowd like he's gonna challenge me and he walks down like oh fuck I got our defend us I got a fight and I know how fucked up I am I got believe gotta defend myself and I'm like let's playing out in my mind all the ways that I'm gonna have to fight this guy and I realized right then like I stand up open my eyes my oh fuck it's just a vision and I was like heart's racing I'm like why would I think that and then I realized every fucking day of my life since I was a little kid I played that out any time someone gives me a dirty look or says like it was a word from whatever being picked on as a kid bullied that kind of shit that guy I always play that out like how am I gonna have to fight this guy am I gonna have to fucking defend myself how's it gonna play out oh he's he's got a long fucking neck I'm gonna take his back and choke him out he's whatever you know sable but it just showed me how silly this dumbass mind game right that I would play and I would go down the rabbit hole on a fucking daily basis sometimes like like just playing into this thought of negativity that had no space for me and it does me no good to play that out like what about dirt that's fine cuz then I'll do this no no none of that shit I'm wasting time and I'm becoming emotionally attached to those thoughts yeah it's not just oh I'm thinking about this I'm feeling like I'm gonna fight right now yeah that fucks you up that turns you into not your best version of yourself so that vision from mushrooms was just a fucking game changer it doesn't stop me from having those thoughts but it allows me to catch myself I'm aware of it [Music]
