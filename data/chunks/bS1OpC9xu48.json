hello freak bitches cultures he work with this girl Susan for years that helped you get a different perspective oh you know what I didn't think it right I didn't think that way yeah you're right but I saw that kind of shit now look ultimately you get on the set you're gonna do what you're doing the directors gonna hey Steve you know you shouldn't be so angry there what whatever you know he thinks and the guy that wrote it you know what I mean but I work very hard at it and I worked for years now now don't forget I'm making a living for 16 years as an actor hey I left the Riviera in 2000 is that crazy yeah sixteen years so and I've done a lot of shit this is you saying that mm was 16 years ago what yeah is that right yeah listen II I started on The Sopranos in 99 I went back and forth for a year you know I didn't quit I did six episodes I was still at the rib what is it like how it must have been fucking strange I was still at the river then I booked it for ten years I can I booked the river till 2010 Chris Rock said you still dipping your toe in that shit I said why not they paid me what the fuck how hard as hard is it to fuck a book three comics a week I could do it in three days booked up six months that's hilarious you know the book I booked guys that uh you know that didn't work much you know well I think your point is the really important part of what you're saying is like the getting a different perspective or a guy like Gandolfini you would you'd imagine he was so good you would imagine that he probably looked at it from all sorts of different angles yes he did and you saw a lot of different colors but he you know he would work 16 hours okay 16-hour days on The Sopranos he's in he's there so I mean the guy gets up whatever time he got up then he's got to go home and learn tomorrow stuff so sometimes he told me he'd be sitting in the chair he fall asleep for two hours he wakes up she's still there just waiting for him to wake up and they're gonna work on this stuff for tomorrow whoa yeah and then and nine months of that don't forget you know The Sopranos Joe they were when I got on the show was like eight days I came on the second season so it was like eight days for an episode then nine and ten at the last season it was we that we shot nine shows in nine months holy shit yeah was like shooting a movie there's no commercial so it's a full hour but you know that's what it was man it was long it was like shooting a movie Wow my month and Episode III the first episode was 1718 working days Lorraine Bracco said to me you're gonna work more in this episode that I will the whole season cuz she only worked one day an episode you know she had the greatest job in show business why he shot that in one day oh that's beautiful for her you know was a great part too yeah it was great you know but III think the coaching wise and I think a lot of it is you know your focus you concentrating know your stuff know your lines I mean you're an actor you know know your shit don't come in and be like a smartass yeah maybe I paraphrase know your stuff respect what's on the page you know that I'm a big believer in that yeah on the Sopranos you didn't have lived the word thaw and I'm not joking you there was there was a time that I had to say I gotta go and the line was I have to go and they kept correcting me and correcting me correct cuz I just you know I gotta go I have to go I don't know why what when I didn't question it right I mean you know but that's a crazy amount of work where you're talking about Gandolfini that's really that's still fuckin with my head yeah now listen Jim was one of my closest friends couldn't find the better guy he worked it hardly saw his kids you know his kid you know his daughter wasn't born you know while he was on uh Sopranos but it was like no life you could completely gave up your life if not the rest of us because there were so many characters you know I didn't I had a couple episodes where I worked a real lot but you know other words just can't be good for your health well it was a lot of guys I mean I remember ed I think Jimmy Smits I read years ago NYPD he said he couldn't take it was 18 18 hour days yeah and yeah he's making a fortune he said I couldn't do it anymore ya know I've had friends that have been on dramas before and there's the same thing they would tell me that just they just couldn't do it they just they would and they would just they would be at when the season would wrap their to go this has got to be my last season yes you know it's appointment to money now you know the thing what I love about Blue Bloods is there's a lot of characters for this different story so it's not like that on my signature whoa it's hanging up it's it's you know like seven of us but it's not my signature how crazy is uh someone's gonna fake the signature I'm hanging up on a nice restaurant Bobby baccala with a fat fake stomach it's from the days when I wore the fat stone oh they made you put like a prosthesis - yeah yeah then I got fat enough on my did you get fat enough just after wear that no though one day chaser you know I I you know when I first got the role I was seeing all these jokes like you cows on with legs and your fat fart can you thinking I'm going I'm not that much fatter than gay and Afeni I start to think that maybe they cast the wrong guy I'm not joking I'm saying could that be I mean these jokes don't make sense and then they call though you got to come in for a fat suit so I wasn't ridiculous thing then the second year they made it like a really nice one that cost for like a costume shop it had like tits and had a costume shop in like a Broadway custom thing and and then one year I was going back and I was at a fitting for the the fourth year you know worked in the next year and he looked at me man hey you know if the way that anymore I said alright so I'll be silly it was pretty embarrassing at first I was prancing around there they had an ass on me too like a big ass go figure yeah and he was gonna too big and I was like going walking back and forth like raising Christ it's fucking humiliating Steve Landis Bergman 2 , he said to me today X your permission to do that I said no stevie's I want the fucking day that I want well I want to get the job you know that was a weird time when The Sopranos came out because all the sudden there was like a lot of fake mob guys a lot of fake connected guys fake Italian you know I mean still around I call it gay Guinea Actors Guild but you don't I mean it's like that acting that way became in fashion they started it tasted they used to hang around wherever we were around they were extras it was a day they're still around but there was you know we did a appearance in the casino we just do a lot of that stuff you know they were everywhere they were everywhere they were hoping to get on the show come on you did the shot it doesn't how to do the show no I remember Michael Imperioli one time we were up in Reno and there was one of them guys he was playing blackjack and well you know and except come on put me on the show I could though you do I had Michael just went off on who I've been fucking John for twenty years you know bump up I've been acting did you do you know him he got he hit Michael and Michael was right he got really pissed off this is just one of those fucking goombas you know and the guy could do what you do yeah they're the worst exactly it's like this there's wannabes but there's something about guinea wannabes this allows it's a handful out here oh yeah there's planning the thing here they congregate together when they try to like Clara Hou Italian together what's the last thing Rogan how come you got Rogan what the book I kind of try to navigate away from oh the brutal well being even in New York I kind of that's not my thing well Sopranos was so good that it almost killed the mob genre you know I think so I think you're right about that cuz you know what unless and I get a lot of scripts Joe you know of that crap you know they make these I call them backyard movies you know yeah never gonna see them you know it up getting paid I'm not interested cuz it's that same thing I'll fuck you or break you fuck man do you know I am you know my uncle is like a doll my rarest cat but it's true but they write this and I say how just people give them the money how do you get the money to make these movies well I think for a while people are making them just cuz it Sopranos was so popular now unless you're gonna beat Sopranos Goodfellas you know what's the great mob movies surprise I was shot around good those Cocina see no way a Raging Bull had mob Florence right great movie what am I missing there was just a few you know some great you know great great mob movies but now I was after The Sopranos I mean you don't see no the Godfather got for the right to know there was some but you're gonna have to beat that then they tried they tried to do some Mabi stuff every Donovans work and that's a good show that's a good show when that's from an Irish perspective yeah well I think what happened with those movies was or that show rather is it was those you had a movie every week exactly so like every subject was covered betrayal gambling it was funny murder was funny funny funny elements it was very smart that was something you know I would go I would be around and people go I don't like that show you our number time have you ever seen the show have you ever seen the show no I haven't seen it I guess I guess for somebody I I don't I don't watch porn I hate porn have you ever seen it no well then how do you know you don't like it or did you see it or do you watch it you know what I mean but secretly they're holding signs up by with no porn well that was a big thing right the Italian American society was testing against it about this story I wrote a kids book Nicky deuce okay it took place in Brooklyn and we turned it into a movie for Nickelodeon you know which I we didn't wanted again the Phoenix lesser movies and I had Michael Imperioli in and sirico and and Nickelodeon made the movie but when I was when I wrote the book I was doing book signings and you know it's about a kid fish-out-of-water who goes back to Brooklyn he grew up in the suburbs and he winds up with a kid entire neighborhood Bensonhurst in Brooklyn and then he gets into some mischief I don't even call it trouble but so this guy kept writing letters and shit and killing me on the internet and writing letters to the bookstores ahead of me getting there you know like saying hey he's you know - auditory against Italians and he's now he's bringing kids into it blah blah blah blah blah so finally I get the guy's number and I call the guy I swear to you I say to him listen these name is a I think his name is Anthony I said listen Anthony buh-buh-buh-buh this isn't the world I know like rappers rap about what they know this is what I know you know and he said to me I said you know what can I do tell me what I can do let's fix this I mean cuz you know you know Papa bah he saw you can make a donation to my organization it was the italian-american bullshit I said you gotta be kidding me a hunger ball to stop trying to shake me down and there's a whole bunch of when the movie came out we got some heat for the Nicky deuce movie really and it's not really about mob it's just one tension I mean exactly you know and they did that with the surprise but people would say all the time you know Joe uh yeah I don't watch the thing I'm an Italian you guys talk bad about Italians you know they didn't they they showed what really was I thought it was very authentic you know oh well The Sopranos is authentic as it gets if you know anybody like that you know those people exist absolutely and I contend they don't exist is it fence exactly I think it was a story that need to be told I don't yeah yeah we put the Italians down this is what it is but was such a fascinating show because Gandolfini was a bad guy like his character Donna Wong yeah you rooted for a bad guy a murderer for a murderer who cheated on his wife stole robbed shook people down to Lily but he was your guy he was I think the first I think I could be wrong the first like antihero that people really fall into I think you're right III can't imagine for that it was you know your root for the guy you know he was a real antihero a murderer a conman I mean all the above all they didn't just do it to people in the mob they did it to people you know like on the show there wasn't just within each other yeah they went outside they were robbing people yeah and busting up you know businesses and doing all the stuff that they do yeah it was great show was good very small it was a very small show and if it were if they put it back on now they would get higher ratings than some of their shows now I probably bet they would it's well it's so good I think a lot of people forgot how good it was and it also changed a lot if you go to the first episode the first episode was essentially like a slapstick comedy remember that no I know you know lorraine brought not lorraine bracco who was the woman that played uh his wife Edie Falco Edie Falco Edie Falco had a fucking machine gun and like the daughter was trying to spend down seated and she's outside with a machine gun pointing at her it was way more slapstick it was weird it was like a comedy when they shot the the show aired in 99 right I think they shot that like in 98 if I'm not mistaken really if I'm not mistaken at 98 I believe on 97 even they go back and then it took six months and then they started shooting them you know how how David chase did it he didn't do it like a regular show where you shoot it and then in three weeks it's on the air you know he put them all on the can they were finished and locked and you know you know what I mean like you know you finished you yours or whatever it took nine months and then he edited them and bah bah bah bah bah and then they aired you know it's done a completely different way Wow you know also they would they would you know if they didn't like what you did I mean he replace you and you never even knew it really he was place here you know like I think I had a scene with a guy and they call back you know a month or so later and so you got to shoot the scene again with a different actor for whatever reason whether you know the guy didn't do a good job or he looked too young or too old or just didn't fit he had the he had the capacity to just shoot it again if a scene didn't work he rewrite the scene you shoot the scene again you know three months later what's interesting about those kind of shows too is that they're so big and so popular that you become that character whoever that character is you become that guy and you're that guy forever well that's of course I mean that and that that's part a deal that's okay I had no career before that so it's not yeah I'm not saying with you what I'm saying like there's some people that'll be like you've worked since then you'll continue to work but there's some people that were on that show that were really famous when that show was on the air and they vanished yeah yeah yeah well you're in the you know you've got people all over the world watching I mean I've been stopped with people literally Oh from all over the world that have watched his show it was like a cult hit like nothing that ever hit before like big pussys big pussy for the rest of his fuck yeah yeah some of Vinnie's also he embraces that too you know what I mean right Grace's dad for him and it works and right he's okay he works he does his things no he's always gonna work he's a very good out yeah he's got his music he's a musician and stuff but I I hear you especially the name big pussy that was a big thing what people like to say that yeah yeah they do like say that but also his you know the scene in the movie when they kill him like the whole the whole way it plays out it was very intense it's like whoa I can't believe they kill big pussy well that was the big thing boil early it was the first time to a regular cast member gets killed yeah I mean they're not killing the you know the guy from friends Wow exactly David Schwimmer ain't getting killed you know oh one year one Friday night oh my god they killed David Schwimmer there's five friends don't you know so that was a big character that gets killed and then big Carrodus kept getting killed which is why guys were worried I mean it was a real concern that you were gonna get killed off the show the more material they gave you yeah the more of a shot you're getting killed yeah yeah I mean you know let's not kid ourselves it's not just you know you're out of work they just put you out of work in the biggest show when when Gandolfini killed Imperioli I was like whoa holy shit pinch his nose there well like what but but you know what once you made it into the last season it was like a listen you know right you know we're done you're paid well however the story ends it's probably better if I would have got killed early on I would have felt really shitty I'll tell you and so all the stuff that happened cuz you know right you know what I mean I press you know we didn't major we started making money towards the middle in the end you know not the guys at the beginning were making all money well those shows are hard to make money right they like HBO is nothing don't worry get HBO pace and they pay now even better than the shows off the end nine years Wow no you know we're going to you know and then there was other coming in because she had the opportunity to do other shit you know well that show was also groundbreaking and it was one of the first shows like that and now HBO specializes in those kind of shows and shows AMC and sold is Showtime yep yeah I mean you know that all kind of I know witness a promise it's the first time they they're hiring uh you know a fat bald guy you know Jim wasn't a leading man right I mean they wanted you know you figure it's a good-looking mob guy you know what I mean but he was intense and charismatic and what a fraud actor girls girls love them yeah we used to joke you know they say TV puts ten pounds on you I say it takes fifty off you well he was just it was a such an interesting character he was so intense and like when he got into that murderous rage like you fucking bought it hook line and similarly when you acted with him you didn't have to uh you know get enough hacks scared like it was a scene I got to be scared you gotta yell at me you know he was fucking you know he gave you the whole thing yeah well we had that fight you know me and him had that fighting the first episode out last season I mean you know when we shot that for a day and a half whoa that was tough he was choking me he said listen well you know let's try to take this as far as we can and we fucking turned I was pulling his hair he was fucking choking me that I was getting cut from the night was wearing a you know necklace you know I was getting cut from that I mean we've all banged up hanged up for real and that's why I look real it was like two fat out of shape guys fine and fuckin I mean they don't you know guys it's not Steven Seagal I mean you know we look you you you know what the hell this was like a fight like so when you do something like that like how hard you hit each other you know as hard as you know you could without really hurt and then he had said that let's go as far as we could and we were you know I usually I say pull my hair pull my hair and all the fucking phones Aaron he's choking me go ahead go further you know you know like I said we you know we're good friends you you know if you do it with a stranger you could get a little yeah funky you know to me like hey well you know you know
