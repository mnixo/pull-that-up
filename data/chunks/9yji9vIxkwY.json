headphones do I need them I like them I mean just to gauge my own voice you don't need them the only one not having all ends right no no no we don't need them I like how you're mocking me with that marijuana come on man I'm open I it's you're sober October yes I know it's my unsub or a lifetime how Wells last time you're sober how many days have you ever done it what a great question um let me see was the last time there's some where I was on the road I could get my hands on weed probably when I was in London or something like that that's usually an overseas thing right and I went like two days and you know like I did my time man I belt like oh I get it and I remember what this was like right but like why bother like you know a post heart attack I feel like I'm living on borrowed time anyway so I'm like well I'm gonna spend that time as well as I possibly can and generally in a THC drenched condition this is not a brag and I'm not like kid you should try this at home but like I only am not ingesting when I sleep so like I wake really yeah all day yeah is there anything that is that don't say it like that the way you're like all day like judgy sober October I'm maybe joining me right yes I would but I'm always like smoke this member November I'm always in awe people who do go 24/7 I think really because I only do it because I thought you did you what am I out of your life I always had the I was under the impression you - I know you'd do a lot more in shit well let's talk about that rule okay I get the beauty for sure you know i-i've been in here in jumps and spurts right and in those jumps and spurts you have become like the most powerful fucking broadcaster on the planet like crazy popular everywhere then you can crack a smile you know I'm writing shit well it's don't it's only hard no it's weird why cuz it's well don't you enjoy it come on motherfucker wanted to like my whole life I wanted to be at the top of something real you are at it I was the top of podcast for like a minute back when we started it should peg in the old fleshlight days but like you are now beyond you've transcended the fucking medium you got to tell me if don't wince you gotta tell me it feels good otherwise what am i striving for in my career and to be honest I don't really strive if you've seen the shit I do but like there is an idea of like you know oh man at the top it must be amazing and like no bullshit you're absolutely the top you have fucking Snowden on your podcast dude everything feels exactly the same but different explain um it's still fun I still enjoy talking to people like you and I had my friend Kyle kolinsky on earlier I've had some really interesting people on I love I've always enjoyed talking to interesting people so that's the same everything's the same in that regard it's different in that it's it's very obvious when I go places that it's having more of an impact because you're the same person right but the world changes like the impact you put out the signal and the world sort of changes and shares more lovers more haters more this more that just it's everything just increases yeah more yeah it becomes more it becomes it becomes weird people want to interview you people want to do things and I don't do any of those things let me tell ya because I don't I'd never want to cut you off because you could listen to you you're just a shame in your guru I love coming here and I have love to come in here but now there's this different onus to it because it's like I'm gonna use my time wisely fuckin Bernie Sanders is next you know what I'm saying like this it's it's it's nice but this is how authentic Rogan is so we're making Jay and Silent Bob reboot and I reached out to like everybody I know about being in the movie and you know even the people that are like oh man I'm gonna go to New Orleans that's far I'm like you do remember I almost died of a fucking heart attack like all right I'm coming i guilted like everybody into coming so Jordan who's our producer Jason muses wife she runs our company she's like I I reached out to Joe his manager and he said he's not interested I was like you know what let me handle this like I'll reach out to jog I got Joe on direct I don't need a manager man some 10% or fucking getting between me and my boy and shit so I can email their text to Joe and I was like hey man we're making reboot do you want to come play and just flat out on Front Street as true as the King baby goes I hate that acting shit and you were like I'm flattered but I don't want to do that he's like I'll talk to you about it when it's tough I was like all right that's how authentic you are that's you know you're in a place right now where you're like can't fucking ruin my credibility with shit like no if it's not a ruin the credibility what if I don't like doing it and it takes too much time I don't have a mess that is not and that was not me going look what I thought it was a fantastic how those adorable honest I was trying to dance yeah why tell me why cuz I do too much I'm doing you know between all the podcasts that I do doing commentary for the UFC doing stand-up comedy there's a lot of things three things you've been doing for the last fucking decade bro I mean they've all increased perhaps like I don't I'm not in the fighting world so I don't know if your your jobs there have exponentially increased I knew you were no obviously cut that back a lot and the more I've cut that back the more cut things back to happier I am and then stand-up has that he's not cut back at all so this has increased this has increased quite a bit yeah so the idea I'm doing six podcast this week and then I'm flying to New York on Thursday and then I'm doing Artie Lange on Friday in New York's that would be a seventh podcast we're gonna carry that one over to the next week right but assists that does not leave any room for trips to New Orleans to do a movie though doesn't leave any room to do anything this I get all these weird requests to do things that just are not interesting I don't want I don't want to do them and yours is one of the most interesting I know I believe me I'm not voting out in a spot going like why didn't you come I just don't have time it was the most on-brand fucking response and it was also a lesson and like let me let me reach out this manager knows nothing in the manager exactly my manager is a rare thing she knows exactly how I feel about everything so he doesn't you know I just uh I say no to everything man I don't want to do anything you and I started podcasting roughly around the same time and it never occurred to me when I started and I wonder if it occurred to you to do seasons no right look at once you just turned on the machine the machine just kept going and there's this there's a gaping maw how do you tell an audience that's used to access all the time like we're gonna do it in a clip and then take a bunch of time off and stuff right no like a television show house seasons yeah and they seem to do that like I remember when cereal had like a were this many and we're done I'm like oh I never thought of that yeah it's a novel it's a corporate approach right I mean they blame well it's like the same type of people that would put together a television show I mean that's their approach as the approach that someone who was doing something along those lines and then transitioned into podcasting that's how they would approach it the way they would approach a Netflix show or an HBO show or whatever it is have you encountered a bunch of that again you've been in the space for quite some time now podcast of course it's crazy crowded everybody does it but the business my industry or the industry that I sometimes work in news podcasting like proof of concept now so you go into someplace with a pitch for a TV show and they're like mmm that may be why don't you try it out as a podcast and hit react that's what's happening a lot I met somebody who was a friend of mine who like worked a mirror match with me back in the day she's gone on like she's producing like a she put together a podcast package where she took it to a TV network and the TV network wasn't interested and she was like this is a good concept man myself and I think they sold it so like I heard or something like this huh six-figure thing was like a hundred grand I'm like they're paying hunt grand for podcast now and they're like no no that's just what that person got paid to bring in that show it's a big big crazy industry and so I've been looking for like the last year and going like well clearly he must be approached on the regular to do this for somebody and clearly every time you're like why would I bother like I could do exactly what I want having been approached a few times haven't had to be like as I've watched the star rise and rise I'm like oh my god like nobody snatched him up yet and then I realized of course you've been there have been overtures but of course Thank You Chi vivre for those who've never been in this place it's like why would you slap a logo on it it's your own you built your own fucking thing from scratch yeah I'm pretty outside of the Hollywood thing now you know I don't really but there's a market for I don't outside of Hollywood thing like there is some company that would be like we will pay you and I suspect you've been offered crazy fucking money and had the integrity to be like next oh like what I'm doing I like this so it exists I'm not changing shit you know I mean it would have to be made me cry yeah but I don't have that so punk rock so indie film that's so like like you get it a lot of people like built their ships and then instantly tried to sell them and laugh this was one thing that like you and I get emotional about this shit you and I like were there for the beginning of something you know we weren't there for the beginning stand-up you're great at it you weren't there women be there for the beginning of USC and shit but like podcasting was something like you were there for the beginning of I was there for the beginning of it now it's saturated we were first wave there was a couple guys before me like Corolla was before me I was premiered was before I go from Aaron and Adam Curry Adam Curry's the absolute first he's the he's the number one creates it yeah and you had him on you know I have not I don't know him I know but where does he live no idea think about it like podcasting changed your life talk to the guy who was the first guy that was like this is good he named it you well last time I was talk to you I was like you gotta get him call it coconut and you do it was great wasn't he fantastic he's such a trip I got another catch for you okay it's good it's good time promotional but it kind of is but at the same time it isn't but I want to tell those dudes stories but like there's a company called caviar gold make sweet I know it's sober October they make our weed so why don't have a little bit more days oh you're gonna I'm gonna leave you with this and you're gonna be in heaven this is a sativa you're gonna be able to have this snooty who Jesus is a diva oh that's hilarious pumped a box of weed see buddy yeah bro that rages I took the first row there to be fair let me see I smoked to myself Jesus Christ that's the sativa that's the wake up weed you smoke that you're ready to like clean house record podcast it's also pumped up with CBDs but man Mike had caviar controls he's like Swamp Thing he controls the plant he works with distillates so he can take your weed make a super weed so that's that's the sativa it's it smells like tell me what smells like it smells like a heart attack no man smells like maple I said he goes what he wanted to smell taste like I said breakfast you got to get it right up there it smells like when they McDonald's McGriddle yes yes bitch it's like smoking a McGriddle how'd they do that he's a genius this was a dude who was like I couldn't get high off we did anymore I had to figure out how to make we'd better so I could get out of it that's the sativa and he's gonna be a billionaire man but you gotta have him on the show dude because his story is like fascinated his weed growing story his how he got to this place in life like it made me want to be in business with the most like this guy's like he's got a movie in them so that's the sativa this is the indica and this shit is like deep on the THC is called snowgoons this is indica yes this is all go to sleep we're going dark so this is like 45 percent THC right here smoke 45% yes oh my yeah what in the fuck man it's amazing I smoke this with be real and I watch them go down hard be real went down you took be real down I did the smoke box I've lived the longest episode of it and then this is the hybrid and the hybrid is called Berserker I'm gonna leave you guys these three boxes as soon as super October is done Oh smoke them give them out the guy who we do the weed with I've been smoking his weed for like two years this cat our gold weed I love it it's insane it's the weed you smoke if you're a stoners and you want to get stoned so I hit them up because we got ten percent forty five percent so what did it used to be it'll change it's like werewolf weed it'll change what it used to be I mean if you you know good most pre-rolls you go buy an expensive pre-roll 2225 rain what is it like when you go to England and you take two days off what is that feeling you sit there and go like boy everything sure is crisp does it need to be it's not bad it's not like I'm Jones and I'm pounding tables III don't have that kind of relationship with it but it is kind of like you know like remember our word a hockey jersey forever you know a lot of people were like you don't want to wear something out to Mike I'm you know I've been married for like 20 years like I dig in I'm once something works me I stick with it went vegan still vegan you know like never really altered since that happened and stuff so you know most heart attack right post heart attack have it righted the day after the heart attack because my kid made me my kid was like she'd been vegan for a couple years and she was like scared she'd never been through anything real first world kid wonderful kid but like you have tragedies in life at shit like that we you know we do getting regular blood worked on I just went and saw my doctor I'm what is it two months ago mmm doctor late and I'm and did the stress test where you know you're on the treadmill and you grant and stuff and then they take all the blood and he was like whatever you're doing keep doing it's amazing he said I can see your heart because they take pictures of your heart he's like I know where the heart attack was so I know exactly where to look he's going if I didn't know where to look you would never tell he's like right now there's no lasting damage keep going so I hike Runyon every day nice I'm vegan out like a year and a half ago cuz the kid and and haven't really straight back so I'm all plant-based and I am intermittent faster I don't eat breakfast anymore I'm not gonna be like breakfast is propaganda but it kind of is you don't really need to eat that early in the day particularly you know what that's untrue thin people maybe do guy my size certainly didn't need to be eating breakfast could have skipped it I do the same take sixteen hours off that's the to break the fast do you pick a timers is deep enough as you can go just eight and sixteen you know let's just do it based on and what's the soonest you ate them generally speaking it depends but I've gone I've gone as late as like one two in the afternoon yeah that's why I try to make it till noon the earliest and like by two I'm ready I'm ravenous yeah yeah I think it's totally doable it's it's not your body gets really used to it to what I generally do is I get up in the morning I'll have a cup of coffee and then I work out and either I run or I do yoga or do something whatever I do is pretty intense and and then I do podcasts generally around noon that's when I start the day and so I've already been up for hours and hours and sometimes I don't even eat until after the podcast sometimes they'll eat it like three have you gone days where you don't eat at all no I've done that I burn off too many calories I thought you also workout it yeah I just have the hiking stuff but I love days where I can totally skip all the way down because the body is still feeding off of like yes stored energy and stuff like yeah but um but I'm also you know I'm on WWE ambassador so that made like my reduced eating made like staying on points like insanely he's right right I knew you just maintaining now are you trying to canal maintaining like I'm on the road for the next like 60 well we have 63 dates with Jay and Silent Bob reboot we've just been in Jersey Chicago Detroit Grand Rapids st. Paul st. Louis Columbus has the first leg and now we go to Texas and stuff we're doing that for like 60 lissa detour we're just touring the movie rather than like I would put the movie out in 1,000 theaters we don't have that kind of marketing money so instead me and Jay are just touring with the movie so essentially it's like a comedy tour or like a small punk band tour we go to a theater we set up shop we sold tickets in advance a lot of the tourists sold out reboot Roadshow dot-com for tickets and we intro the movie watch the movie with them and then hang out afterwards Q&A chat Linda and for me it's like you know it's pretty grueling schedule it's every day in a different City but every day I get to like sit and watch the movie with the exact audience it was made for something like walking into a multiplex that's playing your movie and even if it's crowded you're like man I hope all these cats get every joke and stuff this is the crowd the movie was made for so every reference every joke like Landsman you feel like a genius I sit in the back of the room watch the back of our heads like a dirty little cock at every screening man just ready to fuck a jerk-off I'm so happy with myself I'm like I'm so clever listening doesn't laugh it's you know it's like stand-up but like with the movies and you know it's not it's we've just taken the movie and kind of event eyes dit and by being like hey man come watch it with us because you do that that's very cool and in a world where people would come see me and J anyway talk about the old movies like and pay fifty two hundred bucks for like they pay the same thing see just bring a new fuckin movie so it's been incredibly successful man like big sold-out shows we've had to like double up on shows but watching it with the audience is like it's it's it's fantastic you guys do a Q&A or yeah afterwards and I Triple E we share the stage which is difficult because I tend to you know as you see I like I'm blah blah blah so I've tried to hold back to let him kind of take front and center during the Q night cuz he's the star of the movie and he's amazing in the fucking flick like I tell people at the beginning of every night I'm like I we only get to make this journey and we've been doing it for 25 years since clerks because like I met a boy who said dirty things to me and I said come with me we're going to Hollywood and like I met a true American original Jason Mewes who I said you I think you're funny I wonder if people would find you funny outside of New Jersey and like somebody should put you in a movie one day and then one day I was that person and he was our passport has been our passport to the world the guy least likely the guy that was never going to get out of Highlands you know on his own accord but like simply by being like wait say these things here on camera now we've got a movie like he opened up the entire world to us so it's his finest hour in this movie like he's funny as fuck and he cares the whole show but he also gets to be emotional because it's about him finding out he's got a long-lost daughter and shit so it's father-daughter movie ins and so there are moments in the movie where people cry and not because like Kevin fucked up another movie like they're like oh my god like he's he's getting me there as an actor it's been like fucking thrilling to watch so every night like it's thrilling to watch when we made it every night I get to like sit back and watch the audience take it in and I'm used to making comedy and you want people laughing otherwise you if it's silence its death but there are moments in the movie where like it's quiet and that's a good thing and like you know I still clench my asshole because and any silence you're always like you just need one heckler to be like fuck this blows or whatever in the audience breaks or whatever so far man it's been like really fucking beat he's put the seat out there though the fuck this blows you know no out of my mouth I was like damned yourself we're going to Houston tomorrow night like I left the tour because Joe was gracious enough to be like hey man you could come in on the 29 and we had a day off and stuff so I left I was in Columbus last night this is place called Studio 35 they were like tell Joe Rogan we want him I was like to be from Klump everybody wants do you know studio 35 and you know fucking yes holy shit man fuck I was just there there we what's crazy you were you there we go wait so you know that theater it's fantastic fucking theater I I always know Columbus as that theater as that Street and then we actually went into the city and I was like they built the whole city around that little corner and shit they like that's been here forever did you know and you must know Columbus is the swinger capital of the United States of America what this is a lot of things we were staying there we went to do a show at Studio 35 like years ago for the first time like almost 10 years ago we've known these cats some great people and they put us up in a house and like you know the house was like neatly appointed but nobody lived there like even as an air B&B it was just like there's very clean and shit and so when we got back to the place they're like you like the house and we were like yeah it's nice man this is in the middle of the woods away from everything down a beaten path and she and we were like yeah it's nice to know like it's the swinger house and I'm like what do you mean feel like that's the house where the swingers go to fuck should they were like didn't you notice all the boxes of tissues and I realized a fucking room had a box of tissues in the corner so it's the swing and I was like why would that happen here in Columbus Ohio and they were like Columbus Ohio is the swinger capital of the United States you should go back with a black light and check it all out motherfucker find out what's happening where the splatters are I think I think I remember that night sleeping on my jacket like you know I got my own come to deal with have you ever heard that was that horseshoe that's where hustler started was in Columbus Thomas Voeckler flight started Columbus is the birth of a lot of fucking places that's what he said you open up the door for Jaime he's Garrity theories that go here this would change the whole show so Columbus is this hidden jewel it's a great place it is really really great place I love it but there it's a great fucking theatre man I have yet to see any proof of swinger activity myself I recorded my 2009 Comedy Central special at the walls of spike spike TV special the time at the southern theater in Columbus yeah with a good crowd fuck yeah it was great I love Columbus I love it last time I was there was like what year and a half ago year September if there's Schottenstein oh yeah about a year first last night party so it's awesome two shows for his really lovely people so I go to Houston tomorrow first show and Houston sold out I'm there in a couple weeks a sec are you yeah ii saw me a few tickets we got to sell like 20 tickets in that second Houston show because we've not had a show that hasn't sold out like we played the Fillmore in Detroit that was sold out when is your show there's one the one in Houston tomorrow night but like then there's like San Diego there's a Chattanooga that's been a difficult one cell you ever been to Chattanooga been we posted a show and it was moving and we were like I will add a second show and then both of the shows kind of stall the certain place of Chattanooga Tennessee how active are you on social media pretty active like I post every day on Instagram and every day on Twitter I kind of keep those active what's the new one with all the kids to tick-tock yeah do you do take time nope because we're men a man like we're fucking much just we're looking men we're old world oldest how old he is down to 49 52 yeah so like not for nothing but like if that's 52 and this is 49 what were we worried about we were worried about what 52 was when we were in high school which was what dead people people who didn't take vitamins people didn't exercise regularly and on top of it maybe I'm just biased because the older I get I want to believe this but like didn't the didn't fifty look older when you were sent did like when my dad was fifty I was like ah fuck all right yeah 50 it dudes look different now it's health you know it's it's diet diets a big factor getting enough nutrients not smoking cigarettes that's a huge fuckin weed and said that's true cigarettes down we'd probably does a lot for you you know it relax for sure we'd said my life it for sure reduces inflammation you know and CBD I am a giant proponent of CBD I take CBD every day I hate I don't want this to sound like a commercial but that sativa is pumped up with 30 percent CBDs he checks out the CBD so when you smoke it you're not only your healing something as usually but it's a nice crisp eye that sounds like commercial but it's good yeah I just I take it in drop form I drank this stuff kill cliff which is a drink that US CBD in it I just think it's it's a miracle anti-inflammatory elixir from nature just so I'm a huge believer in it it alleviates anxiety it's good for so many people with arthritis and so many issues my friend Dave Foley his his hands were all fucked up man yet real bad arthritis and now they're they move freely and easily News really yes yeah News Radio Dave Foley has full use of his hands because of CBD because of the CBD yeah he deserves full use of his hands that did the genius does he is you saw him work yeah yes I got something I usually say to like dig holes in genius and you got to back it up but I could just say to you and your oh I told you he was the guy seriously opening a fucking beer of the knife look how butch you are oh my god that's so Rambo bro it's for people to think I'm cheating it's a Heineken zero alcohol and is that so sober October included I guess it's it's not just weed sober everything it's not sex sober no no that's not so they don't stray arrows wow that's the and not for charity not for qinger country just fucking well we started off what happened was it started off four years ago with a weight-loss challenge to my friend Tom Segura and my friend Bert Kreischer and I kind of hosted the weight loss challenge they they had a deceased was the most that's Bert who consumes the most over the course of a month and the winner I sent him to a basketball game and re-center to what it re said them to some other national champions yeah they went to some you know they had a good time right so that was one year then the next year we all decided to join in and that during the whole weight loss challenge Bert kept drinking we're very concerned about births health and so we're like man Bert's gonna fucking die if we don't get this motherfucker to stop drinking do you think he could stop drinking and I said all right how about we all do it we'll all go sober for the whole well I didn't even know that sober October is like a thing people have been doing it for years long before us you realize we just invented a rhyme and they're like man it was just pure coincidence that we started with the first weight loss thing was October as well right what does it think it started close to the end of the Thanksgiving time period or something like that what's the way it was in like January I believe was it yeah okay well for whatever reason we decided to do it during October by dumb luck there was a thing already called sober October we we literally didn't even know when we started doing it so we did it and we had we incorporated a challenge we had to do 15 hot yoga classes and everybody didn't believe that everyone was so broke our he said he was gonna drug test me I think it happened too because Ari was gone and we had to do that another podcast to talk about the Welsh of the bet and that was probably like in September and then it was like oh walk toe burs next month so Brock Tolbert and gazzarri was gonna look for like four months in Asia so so we had sobriety for a month plus 15 90-minute hot yoga classes over the month so you had to do it basically yoga class every other day right which was great so we did that and then last year we said okay we'll do it again but this year we're gonna do a fitness challenge that got really crazy so that year it was a competition and that year we were working out five six seven hours a day I set off the fire alarm in my gym for my sweat literally from steam coming off my body set off the fire alarm is that possible it's possible okay video this is seriously yes yes so you got your body heated up so much at the fire line my gym is my home gym was essentially a little smaller than this room and it has you know elliptical machine in the cage and squat rack and all that jazz and I set off the fucking fire alarm from steam because I did five six hours on the elliptical machine I watched this there was that oh yeah that's it you keep last bag listen tear oh my God look at it look at the fog oh there's the alone that puddle on the ground that's all my sweat hey kiddin nope so we decided no all that do this well because I'm gonna win and you're gonna lose of course I want go crazy we were going crazy and then we all had to sit down this year and say we can't do this again cuz this year we only had to do 10 classes so with whether it's yoga or Tom's doing boxing and it took some we took some tactical gun courses and Tom's also done some weightlifting or he's done some meditation class as well it's all just bettering yourself and you have to read 500 pages of books you know whatever whatever book 500 pages so that's the challenge this month all year all of that is is it's just not on my med exhausting yeah my god like October should be a fun month we're heading in the Halloween and stuff like that right for Samhain shit like that and it just seems like a lot of what is this would you say Samhain Santa the metal name in the minimum but Samhain Samhain remember like Samhain is the it's the end of summer the festival of Samhain I know it is I never heard they talk about on Halloween pull up the clip the movie Halloween from John Carpenter's Halloween Donald Pleasence tells a story about Samhain that was the other Halloween really and there's a metal band called Samhain ha ha ha but the notion of like getting all you know dry and shit is just I mean I get it he's not interested do you drink no hmm and I never really did I I was never had a taste for it I was obviously a sugar guy like that was definitely my yeah my advice well baby you probably lost more than a hundred pounds since way back how much have you lost Aalto tens from well my highest weight I ever was like at one point I was like I weigh my area code know it was 323 holy shit dude well I'm not done because I was like well let's round this motherfucker out and I went up to 330 really yeah which is nobody's area code that I know of so that was my highest then I saw what was it was it fed up the sugar documentary mm-hmm and took off like a bunch of way cuz I stopped doing sugar then you know my weight yo-yoed for a bit then - it's coming in February to be two years that I had the heart attack I was shooting the Showtime special in between shows I had the heart attack so then I started losing weight first time went on Penn Jillette's suggested diet with Ray Crowe nice just sides and it was like all potatoes just eat potatoes for like two weeks and I was like this'll be easy I love potatoes and after two fucking days you learn you hate potatoes like you love milk and salt and butter and shit that goes into mashed potatoes but just eating a baked potato like eat and you could have as many as you want they're like oh my god eat as many as you fucking want and like that's where I learned fasting because when your choice is like a fucking potato or nothing you're like you know what I'd rather eat fucking air then eat a potato and stuff and then you realize oh I'm okay like I didn't die and my body will start feeding off some stored fat so at that point when I had the heart attack my kid was like please go vegan there's a nutritionist was in the room the morning after I had the heart attacks kids slept there all night just staring at me to make sure I didn't like fucking have a second heart attack and really that wasn't the big danger the big danger apparently was in order to get to my heart that punctured my groin that's how they get to your heart that's the easiest fastest route and stuff and so the whole night till yeah yeah well I mean they could either crack your chest but they don't like to do that anymore right so it's not it's not as invasive to go through your femoral and so you go through the groin some people go through the wrist as well I've met a cat it was like they went through my wrist I was like why did they go through my groin he's like probably wanted to see your dick so I sat there i after the morning after the kid was there and the nutritionist was like you should you know if you thought have you thought about plant-based that'll cut your cholesterol down or at least losing some meat and the kid was like yeah go vegan one of us and and you know she was definitely looking out for me but at the same time she knew that like I'd be a big get for the vegan community community like oh I flipped this fuckin motherfucker there's some a meat-eating I used to drink two gallons of milk a day if I could flip him that's good good so I tried it and I was like ah I'll give it a shot I lived the way I wanted to for many many years and obviously that led me to almost dying so how about I try what you're talking about you know for a few months six months and that was a year and a half over a year and a half ago so being vegan and also intermittent fasting meaning essentially I don't do breakfast like yourself has dropped me down another 70 so I'm 198 right now which is like my high school weight Wow yeah that's kind of nuts more than a hundred over that the entire time we've known each other yeah I've lost a human being I've delivered a child and it went somewhere it's yeah that's used to carry it like a nympho twin and shit yeah lean more a young you know or lean man I mean how much enjoy yeah well half for you that's it that's an awesome accomplishment man it was it wasn't I didn't try like you know again Weight Watchers are now they're called WW they were absolutely helpful but it was never about like I want to look better it was just my options were get healthier fucking live no man had two heart attacks first one was a warning second one took him out and you know as much as I could change my lifestyle and I did like I still got my mom and my dad's like hearts and my egg that defective yeah I hike every day up Runyon except since we've been on the tour that's been a little more only hike difficult yeah all the way up and stuff I haven't gotten into weights or anything a good thing about strength training is yes time strength training is it's particularly important as you get older it maintains bone density maintains your muscle mass and there's a lot of correlations between people who exercise and maintain muscle and heart health and just just overall vitality of your body a stronger body is more durable you know and you know it's not hard to feed or somebody just hire a trainer that's true I think when I'm done with the tour like we're done in February yeah just hire somebody it's time and you know you can hire some weight has been like that I never imagined I'd ever do so I never imagined I'd have muscles like I never done a pull-up my entire fucking life I remember in high school hanging on the bar that look move on Smitty cuz like I couldn't fucking get there be nice to do pull up for last world for sure especially like what if I'm hanging off a cliff in this life not not today no but in this life yeah yes you're right it's like slow build and I've also got like access to like hey I'll hire you yes it's not even like I gotta get my shit together and do exactly it's go somewhere it's good to go somewhere instead of having someone come to you it's it's a change of environment sort of it puts you in the mode like okay we're here to work but I recommend that to anyone who's getting well I just anyone period I think strength training is very very important you've actually sold me it don't take much I'm pretty gullible but you've actually sold me in as much as like I trust you you're smart and what you just said about bone density makes a yes and I'm only getting older and we should only getting more Halloween yeah weight bearing exercises carrying weight and you know it doesn't have to kill you it doesn't have to be something that's brutal and it breaks you down so you're exhausted the next day you really want like a light workout you really want and a slow build find someone who understands the state of fitness so you're out right now but it gives you a nice slow bill just like squats with very little weight a few deadlifts with very little weight just a little bit of this and a little bit of that a little bit of push-ups a little bit of setup how long's it you don't need to work out that long you can work out a half an hour at you know three days a week and you're fucking golden what make a giant change in your life sure what those are I like them odds three days a week oh yeah so you don't even have to do it every day no you don't want every 30 minutes is it like a fucking doesn't he not fighting fantasy no build your body up to that you got to realize you are a guy who's never really gotten after it your whole life so if you just shock your body into getting after it now it's probably going to revolt you don't want that they already tried that yeah you want with rokkyo you want just some light weight bearing exercise you know and build up over a few months man there's no rush you know you're just trying to be healthy right you're not trying to fucking win mr. Olympia just start slow do like weights with a squat rack and like fucking 25 pounds on each side just three or four just three or four put it down you know what really irritates me about this is like as you imitated a guy doing squats you closed your eyes you went to a place you literally played a character you acted in front of me I could do it if I'd if I'd shot your thing here it might have it might have made more sense ah make it so easy do it all the time so it's me it's like I understand that sounds horrible though as you closed your eyes I'm picturing you doing it that picture what my eyes would be popping out of my head you'd be fine because I don't want you to do anything that makes your eyes pop out of your head but really though you take time man time is an investment I don't know if I have it's a slow changing like water hitting rocks right when you see look water carving a pathway through rocks that shit takes forever it takes forever and that's the same thing with Fitness you're not gonna get giant muscles quick I mean you could be one of those fucking Psychopaths that decided to completely change their life and completely dedicate themselves to fitness and also and you got Jack do you have all these muscles but that is going to have to be a massive commitment and a life-changing thing and for a guy who's had a heart attack I don't recommend that at all I recommend you just slowly start working out with weights nothing even brutal you know some you know what a Turkish getup is no it's a great full button that's different body exercise you have a kettlebell in your hand you lie down on your back on the ground you lift your arm up you slowly get up to your feet we're standing up with proper technique and then you let it down and then you sit down again you lie back down on your back again it's a full body workout and it's not you know it's nothing that's gonna kill you it's something that's just gonna give you a little bit of strain to strengthen your connective tissues you don't have to do four or five like that's what I would say and that's done for the day no you do a couple other things do a couple of shit but I'm not talking about you breaking your body down for at all right I'm talking about you slowly adding resistance training this meathead mentality that you got to go out and break your body down I think that's that's it's a terrible thing to do to someone who doesn't exercise because they're gonna be in fucking severe pain and it's also I don't think it's productive I don't think it's necessary I think the way to do it is to lightly get into it then once you start feeling it I feel a little bit better it's easier to open up a jar of pickles everything's moving better you know and then you wrap it up you just hold on you fucking sold me on the pickle open pickles are hard man to this day I never I hate pickles but you know it's tough to open up is like a jar tomato sauce yes it's hard not many times that happened to my wife and be like what does it just mean can you yeah there's got to be Fitness in my fucking genes somewhere man because my mom's dad was a boxer like growing up like a like a guy and he had a record he was kid Dixie Schultz growing up like in my grandmother's house there was a picture of a guy like Wow in that position with trunks but old-timey like and I was like who's that and she's like that's grandpa and he didn't look like grandpa so I never associated but apparently he was a boxer one thing man - not even box somebody but have somebody hit hold pads for you and you learned how to punch and hit pass because it's exciting it's fun to do it's like interesting Batman you hit things like Batman that's how you sell it yeah man hit pads he hits fucking you know injustice oh my boxer grandfather I want to see if what if you agree with this okay so you're that you've been the man in the ring so to speak you've been at the epicenter of attention of the thousand five thousand bunch of people as a man on stage even the man in the ring sometimes when you're doing a UFC event and stuff like that you know what it's like the the surge the the energy that comes from like I'm here and everybody's got I got their attention and I command the fucking room it's part of why we do what we do my grandfather having been a boxer must have felt that right like fucking probably way more than I feel when I walk up on stage or we're on the reboot Roadshow to where I'm like well I feel clever sitting in the back watching the movie with the audience and hear him laugh this is a guy who is like I'm the man in the ring and like it's all up to me and my fists and I could be a god or a goat tonight and like and then it becomes primal and there's pounding and shit like that you would imagine there's a if you got in the ring and he pursued it enough to have a record there must have been some sort of call some sort of satisfaction to it all maybe sometimes people do it for money right maybe look this guy know been a way to make a living know this guy I don't know he may I mean you don't think he did it I think he was hoping for purses but I don't think it was just like this or mailman or them although that's where the story is kind of going not mailman but this was a guy who boxed professionally and the story was that my grandmother like when they had their first kid Maya Virginia my grandmother was like you can't be a boxer anymore and so he was like all right and then he stopped being a boxer and then my grandfather became a custodian in the Newark courthouse and every day he would like get dressed up in a suit and take the bus to the Newark courthouse they lived in in a different section of Newark and then he'd put on his custodian outfit and like clean the toilet sweep the floors and stuff like that noble salts of the earth shit so my whole life I never questioned this you know your wife says you you quit and you quit and stuff like that until I became older and I became something of the man in the ring myself I know what it's like to stand you know at attention for everybody where everybody you were the focus of thousands where you get a level of affection from from a of one vociferous mass that you is unparalleled from any amount of affection you give them any other single human being in this world it is I've never done heroin but I imagine it's better than heroin it's one of the greatest drugs it fuels us and you know we obviously like it we keep fucking doing it we make money off it yes but there's many ways to make money and we like it and we do it because there's power to it and it feels fantastic and you feel like man they like me they really like me and then I started thinking why would he have put that all to the side like how do you step outside all that just because your wife is like I don't want you to do that anymore and then it made me reinsert my grandparents and I figured out and I want to see if you back me on this play you don't know these cats are you gonna no skin in the game so you can't offend anybody doesn't that sound like she did dirty shit that nobody else did yes son where else but the bed I didn't have that thought at all no I my thought is that he recognized that it's very dangerous and you probably knew people who died and he probably wanted to find a way out of it anyway which most fighters do most fighters at some point in time they realize I'm gonna have to jump off this ride one day I can't stay on this ride until him a dead man till him 90 years old or 100 years old it's not feasible it's does it doesn't exist there's no 98 year old boxers I don't think he faced his own mortality every boxer does every fighter does you you you hit C get hurt well then he's probably been hurt you see people get hurt you see people get pummeled you see people get knocked out maybe been knocked out yourself and you realize that this is something that is unsustainable if he's not making any money at it it's extremely dangerous and you start you know you start thinking what could happen to you you know what can happen to you it happens to people you see it happen if it hasn't happened to you you watch it happen to other people if you're around combat sports enough you're gonna see people get fucked up and when you see people get fucked up you realize like hey this is voluntary there's other ways to make a living I don't have to do this anymore I can get off this ride or you're the type of person that doesn't give a fuck and you want to be a champion and your your thought is you are here for glory you are here for a legacy you're here to leave your mark you want to go down in history as a great and if you don't feel that way I tell people to get out I think fighting is one of the most singular pursuits a person can get into yes I don't think you're not only giving like the I'm dedicating myself to some yes you're giving your body something that like you taught your entire life protect this it's also the the consequences are so grave the consequence digging and zagging you you go the wrong way you run into an e runway you run into a head kick wrong way you run into a punch you know you duck into an uppercut your fucking lights go out you're laying on your back they're gonna flash light in your face and ice on the back your neck and you you don't even know what day it is you don't know what and then that you never get back and you can only get so many of those your life you know there's it depends on the person but you get knocked out three four five times whatever the number is there's a certain number that your life is going to be fucking different now because now your brain doesn't work good anymore that's a fact and maybe it'll get a little bit better over time maybe you can go through some cognitive therapy there's some different things they're doing with magnets and different things they're doing with stem cells where they're shooting them straight into your cerebral spinal fluid and they think that that might have some sort of a positive impact on CTE but man that the reality is combat sports are a fucking brutal brutal business and so you think it's possible he just got to a place where probably smart like ah this is my perfect excuse to nurse he wasn't making any money doing it either it sounds like I gotta tell you he gave me you gave him his dignity back I honestly was like he gave it all up because she give up the ass she's like a dirty German girl and I was just like I will let you do the anal you've got to get out of the ring and she's like I'll give you one ring for the other and he was like fuck god damn it gussy he called her gussy I think cause we love and fan oh yeah I love kids he's got a kid right he'd they hadn't add a few kid man everybody loves their kids and you want to be around see those kids grow up and you don't want to be brain-dead and everybody look I personally know a lot of people that have calm bad sports induced brain damage there's no doubt about it no if answer yeah that's why when I see anybody who's like half in half out I go fucking hard in the paint I tell me you gotta get the fuck out of this now you ought to trust me and you know and I've done it to the point where people think I'm mean and I'm like look I'm not mean about very many things in this life but when it comes to people are delusional about their abilities and combat sports or their future in combat sports I get fucking mean because I think you got to know you got to know with no uncertain terms i I can't be protective of your feelings I have to go in hard because no one else is going to people don't they bullshit you coaches bullshit you trainers bullshit you they tell you got a chance promoters we want to put you on fights when you really should retire it is a dirty aspect of the business and I don't I don't play that shit if I think that someone should get out I go hard and I tell them and you know I've done it to friends I've done it to you know guys that I've done commentary for they've asked me and they pulled me aside and I said you got to get out man you got to get out because you could talk right now you're okay right now but how many more shots can you take how many more times can you get knocked out 1ko can change your whole fucking life Meldrick Taylor got knocked out by Julio Cesar Chavez and mal detail was Olympic gold medalist a fantastic boxer was fast as fuck lightning fast combinations beautiful skill but Julio Cesar Chavez just kept wearing on him and wearing on him and boom he dropped him in the final round and they stopped the fight with like seconds to go in the fire Richard Steele stopped the fight it was a big controversy like oh my god how could he stop the fight Meldrick was ahead in the scorecards and you know there was only a couple seconds to go and Meldrick wouldn't want a decision it was a right call because he was done after that fight man after that fight he was never the same you hear him talk today it's the saddest shit in the world he can barely put together a sentence and he had a few fights after that against Terry Norris who was a brutal knockout puncher and a couple other guys he just was never the same again it was at one fight one fight one beating too much and it was just it all fell apart on them and that can happen that can happen to any fighter and when you're done you're done and you you you the only way you should ever compete as a is if this is your fucking calling this is the thing you're obsessed with it is your 100% focus and as soon as it's not as soon as you have doubts get out because there's a bunch of people out there that don't have doubts and I always try to tell people like think about Mike Tyson before he won the title think about the Mike Tyson that destroyed Marvis Frasier think about that motherfucker that guy's all in you don't ever want to face a guy who's all in when you're half-assing it a lot of people are half-assed Ihnen they don't even realize they're half-assing it they just have this thing in their head well I'm training pretty hard I'm doing good I got good skills I could beat this guy but when someone's in there in and calm it's combat sports are uniquely dangerous in terms of the consequences of you not being committed so you got to know when to get out and no one does very few people there's like a few guys Andre Ward retired undefeated Olympic gold medalist to division world champion he's the rarest of the rare most guys they keep going until they get fucked up they keep going till they get knocked out they get brutalized and then you meet them afterwards and they can barely talk man they could barely talk I've seen so many guys they could just barely string words together everything's a mumble all the words the slur into the next word it's a horrible man and I saw it in the gym I saw in the gym with guys who never made it they still got brain damaged no the the fucking the gods of combat sports they don't give a fuck if you win a title have you eaten shots you take punches to the head kicks to the head you're getting fucked up man no matter what seems like wow how come they didn't talk about that for years and years they didn't know they did know that people get punched drunk but they didn't know what was causing it it's not even knockouts it's it's sub-concussive trauma that does the vast majority have a lot in the world of hockey yes yeah sub-concussive traumas terrible but knockouts are also horrific and then from me my discussions with guys like dr. mark Gordon who's an expert in traumatic brain injuries and he works with a lot of soldiers and he runs his TBI foundation to deal with injuries that soldiers and football players and fighters face and his descriptions of it will the fucking shit out of you I mean it's like he's like people can get brain damage from fucking jet skiing just all that bouncing up and down keys are not even getting a jet ski accident just like just jet skiing and jet ski accident successor eight but he's talking about like people some people get in accidents it's some sort of a something happens you would get knocked out and they are never the same again this is a real thing you can get a shot to the head or a golf ball so many misses they crack you in the head with a golf ball right you get hit with a line drive that kind of shit changes people forever forever so your grandfather probably wanted out first all right some thoughts number one his sober sober October gives you a different Joe Rogan yeah oh my god you're so dialed in it's beautiful I get you're the Ken Burns of combat sports I can listen to you spin yarns tell tales you know what that's unfair the Ken Burns I call you the Jean Shepard I don't know who that is but I hope he's lost you love Jeannie I remember Christmas story yeah yeah the guy that narrates Christmas Tom wrote the books the essays that it's all based on my other thoughts that is far more dignity than I ever afforded my grandfather I appreciate it my mom is gonna appreciate that and then forth fuck I lost my point I thought I had enough of him it's to me a hits home because I needed to know when I needed to retire to when I stopped fighting I knew it was like I'm not doing this the way I used to do this you know I used to be completely obsessed but I saw a bunch of people get knocked out I knocked a bunch of people out I knew that that easily could have been here like to knock somebody else it's weird it's a bittersweet feeling like you don't feel good you know it feels if you were in a true combat position it would feel good well fighting for your life you mean yeah in competition I mean it was all people my age you know I was 19 20 years old and I'm standing over this unconscious version of me you know that I just kicked in the head and that's how the person yeah the amount of force you can generate with a kick it's just so terrifying it's so terrifying you know the think that that's gonna bounce off your head and the lights go out and then you could incur legitimate permanent brain damage from something like that in the initial kick or in the hit the drywall the canvas both this the kick someone kicks you in the head someone who really knows how to kick they bounce a fucking shin off your temple you might not ever be the same again that's real been knocked out I've never been knocked out I've been stopped which means I got TKO I got dropped with a punch and then the guy followed up with a bunch of punches and the referee stopped the fight that was the last fight I ever had there's a lot of slow down yeah I got I was in a kickboxing fight ok so there's three fights in a day I won the first two won the first one by knockout I beat the fuck out of the second guy and I was pretty sick actually going into the fight going into the the turn I would get sick sometimes because I'll be nervous and shit I wasn't my nutrition was terrible and then the third fight I got hit with a left hook I got I won the first round and in the second round I got hit with a left hook and my legs just went blank they just stopped working I remember going to fight the fuck shit I've never been dropped like that before where my legs just he was a perfect left hook he just caught me crunk riding a chance so what if he catches you on the chin what is the what's happening that it's it hit it's like it connects range what's your brain right and your brain like it also does something that's like nerves behind your jaw and when you get hit hard it just it's like an electrical charge goes into your body and everything just shuts off it's weird like it was totally conscious but my legs just stopped working and then felt all that happening while that's happening more punches are coming no because it was kickboxing wasn't MMA and MMA the guy would jump on you and they'd stop it right there or you'd maybe grab a hold of them and maybe you would survive maybe you wouldn't you know there's arguments that it's safer in MMA because they stop it quicker there's also arguments that when it goes to the ground you could actually survive better and you could hold on and maybe that would allow you to take more damage maybe that's not a safe I'm in the former camp I think it's safer okay because I think when fights get stopped quicker it's safer but so so when you got adjusted and electricity went there did you go down yeah I went down my legs my legs just stopped working like this like I'm standing up he hit me and I just go plank yeah he went down yes under your ass yeah I went down and I got up before the count of ten referee dust your gloves off and the kids swarmed at me again and hit me with a bunch of more punches and I covered up in the referee stopped the fight so that was a TKO which is technical knockout but I had already known that I was kind of I was already doing stand-up comedy at that time as well and I didn't know that I was half in half out and when I wait when is this 1989 so this is even before this before news radio oh yeah way before yeah this was standard or be funny no well I knew I knew somewhere around the time I was 19 that this was not there was no future in this and I was trying to make the Olympic team which was the Nationals were in Miami in 1988 and wait were you from Boston that's where I was out of so I was a Massachusetts state champion and then I would go to these national tournaments and compete against like the show you know the Illinois Champion or the New Hampshire champion and I got asked a question on behalf of somebody else hold on yeah you got a question stored yeah yeah because I was talking to you no no no Humber's okay your grandmother yes named Josie yes Gerard Way yes lead singer of My Chemical Romance yes yeah we're related that's who he said I was like I'm going to Joe Rogan he goes I don't have a hundred percent confirmation on this but I'm pretty sure Joe Rogan is my cousin yeah my aunt Josie was his grandmother yeah I don't know him but we're cousins how crazy that two people in the same family became super fucking famous and don't even yeah we don't know each other that's not you gotta have money's fascinating he's good yeah yeah and plus like you're related yeah well anyway back to the story so you know I just I didn't know what I was gonna do for a living and then there's a about a few things happened you know if you watching a friend of mine get knocked out really bad there was a guy named Jersey long who was this badass Canadian guy who knocked my friend Larry out he hit him in the head with an axe kick and just changed Larry was never the same again he was always like real tentative and nervous who destroyed his confidence and you know he also what we did we weren't making any money so the you know these are all amateur fights right so there was this thing like what am i doing like why am i why is this my whole life why were you doing it well it changed who I was you know from the time I was 15 to the time I was 21 almost 22 when I started fighting when I started doing competitions it gave me a focus and it gave me something where I didn't feel like I was a loser right like for the first time in my life it was something that I didn't realized that if I focused on this thing and I dedicated to myself to this thing I could be successful and that changed and hillie the opposite of a loser but yes winner in most cases where I wasn't before that I was I was a loser I've just didn't it didn't have anything going so it it's cool it was your football like for some people in high school it's like a fan football I found somewhere it was your Jesus some people like yeah yes yes I think that's what people need them they need us something whether it's chess or Jesus or filmmaking whatever the fuck it is right you'll find a thing and you focus it and you see some success and you're like oh my god let's go do something I can do something I could be somebody I can I can I can do something that's fulfilling and rewarding and I know that I'm not a loser because a lot of it is like confidence right a lot of it is if you look at your life and you look at things that other people are doing you go god I can't do that he's doing that these people could do that they're different than me I don't have confidence it takes doing something and having some success at it that gives you confidence to do other things and Marshall is so terrifying to me it was so scared of it that it became by overcoming that and becoming successful at it it gave me this understanding that you can do you can basically do you know within reason whatever you want if you just focus on it and you're not gonna do it it's not gonna be immediate you're not gonna be successful immediately and you're gonna fail but through those failures you learn and you go back and you get some experience and you do it better next time and that is earlier is just success training yeah and it's like this fucking tattoo this is Miyamoto Musashi from the book of five rings and in that book he said something I read it when I was like 17 years old once you understand the way broadly you will see it in everything and that that is that is if anything that is one of the main focuses of my life that I think that more time so once you understand the way broadly you can see it in everything that describes you your seeker my favorite proverb is may you realize your own divinity in this lifetime mmm I saw it on a yoga wall-hanging that my wife put on my house once and it was just it wasn't really the message she intended she just liked I think the image of Buddha and one day I was letting the dogs out and I was waiting by the door so you had time to like really stare at it and I was probably just stoned enough and then completely understood it where I was like oh yeah you realized your divinity and this life to your own divinity meaning don't wait until you drop dead to find out you were God all along handing it off to somebody else and some higher power higher powers in you ah fucker became a fighter made him feel worth something my father became a filmmaker made him feel worth something mag manifested he's absolutely right it's that you can kind of do anything you can't can't fly without a jetpack right Ron James one on one yes and Mike Tyson back yeah there's things you can't do physically but there's a lot of things you can do a lot of things you can get better at and especially artistic pursuits because the thing about artistic pursuits is you kind of everybody finds their own way and so the shift to me from doing something that was competition especially competition with grave physical consequences yeah do you go from that to doing stand-up when I first started doing stand-up I realize about okay this could be it like the the fucking fighting thing this like it's a dead end there's no money in this before the UFC there was no money in kickboxing I remember I'd gotten offered a kickboxing fight a professional fight for 500 bucks and I was like what is that $500 it means I have to train for six weeks no alcohol eat eat good run do all these different things training so far and then 500 bucks at the end of it then maybe brain damn it's like when you see what porn stars get paid for anal and you're like what like you would imagine like don't they pay a million dollars to do that and they're like oh no you know five hundred someone fit to fifteen hundred sounds about right it's not a whale do you realize then that you went from like you just 1/8 eat it you want from pain to pleasure your business was pain well then your business became pleasure make my first Commission of huggers laughs no yeah your job as a fighter is to hurt the other person give pleasure to the people that watch yeah but the fights gonna happen with or without the audience correct whereas in comedy yeah don't happen with or without you yes but there's always the eyes the only time there wasn't an audience we did have fights where people from other gyms or other dojos would come oh dojang because it was Korean they would come and we would fight them right and there was no I mean full-contact fights and there's no no referees you're butch you're so butch it's so logics I read about fucking like you know superheroes pounding on each other and you've literally hit people and been hit you know what it feels like to take a punch I've never been it in my life this not also me throwing that out into the universe for it don't fucking hit me I hit I will offer to suck your dick before the punch system all desperate to make you it might be worse than hitting you yeah no kidding I get bad blowjobs but I've never been hit you all those stories I read about like green arrow punches more all the stories I've written we're fuckin daredevil punches motherfucker yeah you've actually done the punching and received the fucking punch yeah pretty metal a lot of kicks it's butch dude that's because I my earliest martial art was talking window which is mostly kicking based yeah I did that was the first a lot of that to the kickboxing was one of the big turnaround to cuz kickboxing happened at the end of my Taekwondo career when I was realizing that Taekwondo was really limited and it was also at the beginning of me doing comedy it was all happening kind of at the same time right and I just was really really really really fortunate that I wanted to do stand-up comedy and I happened to be in Boston which at the time was one of the hubs one of the most creative environments in the history of comedy oh my god I mean all the people you hang out with you well there was a lot of guys that you'll never hear about because they were genius but they stayed in Boston but Bill burr was he was a little bit after me like like a year or two after me and his Patrice O'Neal who's also unlike bill burrs group and Nick DiPaolo and there was fucking goddamn is so many guys that came out of that area do you just go on and on and on about the the local headliners but the environment Steven Wright came out of there and it was awesome yeah he's from from that area and that there was guys you never heard of that were fucking Oh Lenny Clark of course but this guy's like you know Don Gavin and Steve Sweeney was to this day I think one of the best some of the best comedians I've ever seen in my life and they were just local headliners who were just masters they just were just just destroyers and we got a chance to see those guys as when we were Greg Fitzsimmons who's another good buddy of mine who came out of that group we we got to see those guys when we were amateurs and we got to see these guys were where they were just destroying in a way that you didn't even think was possible and we got a unique opportunity as amateurs to be in this incredible environment where there's so many comedy clubs there was three comedy clubs on one air in one area on warranted Street there was one where his Knicks calmly stopped and there was down the street there was the comedy connection and above it there was a comedy club at the Charles Playhouse and then across the street it was Duck Soup so there was for comedy clubs with half a block I mean it was crazy it was just it was a boom of comedy then there were stitches and there was just so many so many outside bars and stuff that had stand up to when did you realize you were funny ten years blended well enough to be like I'm gonna try stand up yeah I could get laugh funny as I finally know I was funny to my friends in like in the locker room or like when we were on a bus like traveling to a tournament everybody be nervous and I'd be the guy who made everybody laugh like gallows humor I'd be doing impressions of each other like that I I had comedy for psychos that's how I thought of it and my friend Steve Graham who I'm very good friends with to this day he actually talked me into doing stand-up he was one of the ones like you should be a comedian and I'm like look I'm making you guys laugh because you're fucking crazy I'm liking other people are gonna think I'm an asshole like this is not like things that people think are funny they never occurred to you thought you were like livingroom funny yeah I thought was funny because I know these guys mean it was mean funny cuz you know comp fighting is a mean sport right you know it's mean you have to be mean if you want to be successful you know and there's so some of my comedy was mean and then I didn't know about amateurs I didn't understand and then I went to an open mic night one of the things about going to an open mic night is you get to see the professionals really the hosts and occasionally professional drop in and do a set but you also get to see these amateurs who are terrible and you go oh I get it so everybody sucks at first and then you know you could just go up with the people who suck and you suck too and it was like okay it was a huge relief because I thought of stand-up oh my god it's like Richard Pryor or Jerry Seinfeld those are bahama gonna be a legend I can't do that so I'd like probably I was faking that like I was kind of 21 I went on to a comedy stage not you know once when I was before I even made clerks when I was probably about 20 Rascals had an open mic night and West Orange no the one isn't in Eatontown right before between the Monmouth mall and the CV Square Mall Wow and so I went up and I did like like five minutes and the only bit that worked was a bit about sucking my own dick and I put that in clerks years later I was like oh I remember they laughed at that bit I'll throw it out but I remember trying it when I never told my friends this would be 1990 it was before I even saw slacker and that was when I knew I want to make Clerk so probably 1990 or 91 pre-august but it was like it didn't I remember being like well I tried it but I'll never do that again and now I literally make my living being onstage fucking talking crazy it was nuts and and it's that's that's why I'm like that's why I had my head around my grandfather like how the fuck do you walk away from that like don't you feel great when you're up there and you're fucking killing and stuff like that yeah I know it's like money of course is always a part of it it's nice to get what I would consider overpaid to do the same shit I would fucking do anyway like I would be trying to be funny regardless and shit but don't you get the leg it's definitely great to kill it's horrific to bomb and did their counterbalanced where as amazing as it feels to kill it feels equally horrific or maybe even more so to bomb it'll haunt you and then the thing about doing well is you don't think about it while it's happening because while it's happening I'm thinking about my performance I'm thinking about making sure that I'm in the zone it's the landing yes I'm I'm not thinking everybody loves me I'm thinking okay this bit it this here's the peak here's the valley here's where I bring it up and here's where I hammer at home and here comes the pause and then there's the punch and I'm I'm doing I'm going and I'm also in the moment where I have to be when I'm doing a bit if I'm doing a bit on a clock or something like that I have to be thinking about a fucking clock I'm not just saying those words I am thinking 100% about what I'm saying because if I don't it doesn't work as good there's no way you can't just say the words it's a form of hypnosis it's like a mass hypnosis and these people know those fucking animals out there in that crowd they they smell weakness they smell distraction they smell when you're disconnected they they feel you like in the way the avatar people do you know there's a fucking is being referenced like a vendor just there's a thing that's happening that's undefined because the only people that really understand it are the people who are real comics who have been doing it a long time who know how to kill and there's this thing that happens when everything is tight and everything's in place that is you're a ride and you're a passenger on the ride you're not you're not driving it you are in a sense that you have to do the work and you have to do the writing and you have to perform two shows tonight I fucking hammer it out all the time no yeah where you doing ice house no Comi store I was at the Comedy Store Sunday and I did an arena Saturday night in Cleveland or the two shows the Fox Theater Friday you gotta go baby you gotta go go go go go comedy is like running it's like anything else you got to be in shape yes enjoy it you don't know where you're like but it's not that because you don't can't think about that because if you think about that it's time that takes away from the actual thing the actual thing deserves a hundred percent of your attention and the acts I'm not saying you feel that in the moment but when do you fucking feel it like when you like good night and everybody explains even then I let it go I just go get it cut me out here then I start thinking oh she was eight cuz that's how I go that's how that's what makes me go that what makes me go is the thing I can't I'm concentrating on the thing like why do I get the thing that you don't worry alright so I concentrated on the thing but like then I fucking celebrate that like holy shit I stuck the landing I do that with my friends right after the show like we we have a great show like me and Santino Saturday night we have this fucking wild show there's arena in Cleveland it was awesome after it was over we high-five we get something to eat and that's it then then you let it go you got to let it go because that my thinking is I'm not you're talking on the road every night and it's like even though like it's a different show every night and it's different wonderful audience like I'm still thinking about the two shows we had the music box in the Chicago Theatre like how my god it was religious of all the screenings I've ever had in my life like those two will stick out thing is different too because you're playing a movie that you did you're putting out a piece and you get to sit down and watch people enjoy the piece and you get to get this like big rush like I love the menus a fuckin yeah but the cute thing the Q&A is also organic you know yourself definitely being yourself but it's organic as you want it to be yeah like basically somebody asks you a question you're like right here's a long answer or maybe had nothing to do with that question right but even then it's like that it's not like you're doing us like a bit you know like where you have to begin your set thank you very much cago great to be here here's the thing about Chicago you have memorized bits oh yeah there's bits but they don't I was always blown away by Carlin like one day we were rehearsing on Dogma and George Carlin was can't wait his smoke break it was the 90s everybody smoked cigarettes and shit and I was like what do you what are you working on now George when you're not doing this and everybody was in rehearsal Matt been Linda Salma Chris Rock whole fucking cast me Jay and George is like oh I'm working on this bit for the new HBO show he goes it's called advertising lullaby and I said what do you mean working on it and he goes well memorizing it and I was like you memorize your bits and goes yeah I write everything I was like you write your bits I was just thought you kind of came up with shit off the top your head it goes nuts he's like I write everything and then I have to memorize everything like a script and then we were like can you do it and he's like yeah you want to say it and so he did a command performance for the eight of us in the room of advertising lullaby and it was pitch perfect I saw the HBO show like you know months later and it was pitch perfect so I couldn't believe that that dude was as committed to the written word as he was but he fancied himself a writer first and foremost he's got time and want to do comedy though like he really backed into it he was he wanted to be Danny Kaye he wanted to act and stuff like that and he was just happen to be funny first he did the radio DJ thing and then the hippie dippie weatherman Burns and Allen was prior to that and stuff but he kind of backed into comedy and was excellent at it yeah but was not like it was not like this is what I've always wanted to do since I was a kid just kind of he always seemed to accept the fact that he was like oh I'm this is it I'm a genius at this all right well he did it differently he would do I mean he was probably the most prolific big-name guy of all time and he he actually inspired louis c.k to do a new hour every year because that's what he did Carlin George did a new hour every year and part of the reason why 875 nights a year that's crazy but part of the reason why is he owed a lot of money did a big time yeah I don't know how that happened but in his book last words he talks about like he bought a jet and sometimes he bought a jet yeah in the 70s he was that fucking huge he bought a jet and he would sit on the runway in Long Island at a at a fucking LaGuardia yeah and just do coke and the fucking fire his book last words is amazing Wow they published it posthumously but he was working on it with Tony Hendra before he died he was so awesome man like I think about him all the time any time I jump on stage because we every night after reboot we get up on stage and work the crowd and stuff I got a chance to say hello to him once what would yeah yeah I met him at the Comedy Store it's very friendly said hi to everybody said har the door guys hey how's it hi to me hey do you know how I didn't know who the fuck I was had no idea just said hi I said hey man how you doing that's it that was our thing I have a I mean I worked with him a few times in the movies and stuff he one of my favorite fucking memories of George Carlin is we go see him do a show me and Chris Rock it was me and my wife Jen and Chris was married to his wife malach at that point and George is playing at Caesars in Atlantic City and so he's like I got seats for you guys up front and stuff so you know Rock was like it had his roll with the new he was like fucking at the height of his game and shit and so we go see the show and Karlin had a bit where he it was like people I could do without like guys named skip shit like that mm-hmm and one of them was people I could do without any man over the age of 12 who wears their baseball cap backwards so you know long before I met him I'd always hear that good at that bit be like so the night we're at the show he's up there doing it bit and and you know he's like another person I could do without Kevin you're exempt from this guy's over the age of 12 who wear their baseball cap backwards and rock like my eyes lit up and rocks next to me and rock goes he knows who you are even though like we'd work together on the movie it was so needy exempt though for the for the show there's that kind of school nice he was a he I think we got along because he he wanted to act and I was always like come act come play and like he liked and just Jane Silent Bob strike back he plays a hitchhiker that like blows people for rides right and the day he was such a committed actor the day we shot we had him for a few hours and then he had to rush off to go be on a stage and be Carlton so he made a little win a window of time for us and he came to me on set and he goes uh Kevin you're the writer director this I have a question for you I was like okay and he goes uh you know this says that I'm fuckin with these dudes I talked to him about the rules of the road am i fuckin with these idiots or do I believe in the rules of the road and I was like wow I can't believe you're given at this much fucking thought George I said but like I the way I wrote it I assume the guy believed in the rules of the road and he goes that's what I thought I was that's exactly what I fucking thought he was so like committed to performance man like he was an absolute joy to be around and he was never on he's like you like fucking not like a man about them doughnuts he doesn't feel the need to make it laugh I love Tracy Morgan to death don't get me wrong but like you gotta save six hours for facial you know cramp rehabilitation yes because you're just laughing so hard you're laughing in your faces and that rictus grin the entire fucking teen you ever made John Witherspoon is he the same way oh my god I did a show with John Witherspoon and his son JD and my fucking face hurt after it was over it was like Chris Morgan like my cheeks were hurting George was not that just sit there and have a conversation with him like he was just interesting you know mr. Hackl Dino miss Pat do you know who she is she's another one she'll make you fucking face her really oh my god she's so funny her stories are so crazy she has you listen real yeah what were your jams well I'm Kinison was my boy that's why I got the long coat first ranch proud yeah well I was introduced to comedy through my parents having Cheech and Chong album ah Tommy Chong is in Jay and Silent Bob reboot and then Bill Cosby and then when I was at gave me up Bill Cosby albums and my mom would always be like you can't listen George Carlin but you can listen Bill Cosby because it's not funny fact how crazy is that well I mean how crazy is it that he had a stellar reputation oh my god but you know when I was on news radio I had heard that he drugged women did you really yes yes scout about it MSE yes yes the the scuttlebutt what and I might have heard of a candy Alexander who was always on top of shit she always had her sort of fucking thumb to the pulse but um yeah her so I'm going wide-eyed because these are like rock star name yeah I had heard I had heard yeah and I was like what no I can't drugs women nevermind Kenny Alexander that's all she's amazing a lover a lady to death that lady quit news radio because she wasn't getting a big enough part I remember yeah she's like you know what only do is she went off and wound up being on yeah was it see I saw she was on a bunch of shit she's been in a million different things she's amazing she's a powerful woman I every time I'm here we talked about it but like it was such an incredible assembly did you see the 20/20 that they did I'm Phil Hartman no they did like couple weeks ago like a whole hour 20 minutes on Phil Hartman and stuff I wouldn't watch her all right when you didn't pop up in it I was like that's very Joe Rogan to nothing I can't know I don't even know if they asked I don't remember the other thing I wanted to ask you was the the fucking moving fast moving lights that the air force was like Oh your video on Oh what were your thoughts well did you hear when I saw the video gasps what commander David flavor that I had no okay that's who you got a you got a watch that podcast cuz he's the guy that was there he was in the plane yes he was the commander he was the guy who was in the fucking plane who is saying he said whatever it was it went from 60,000 feet to 50 feet in a matter of seconds you see me lighting up a like a child because this is the shit remember in search of when we were kids yeah Leonard Nimoy yes where they made you fucking believe when we were children we believed in Sasquatch we believed in Loch Ness monster we believe in aliens and those the difference between this is what is this this whatever this object was believe it or don't believe it think that's something is off about it it was actively blocking and jamming radar and it moved at a preposterous speed it went I don't remember how many miles he said like 30 miles inside of a second some insane amount of speed it traveled they were trying to track this thing they couldn't I mean it was it was moving emissions did no emissions no emissions no method of propulsion that made any drone technology they don't know what the fuck it was but they had seen several of them and the people around that area in San Diego off the coast of Mexico the air force people had seen several of them fuck this is yeah this is good I remember seeing this in the day this was in the news and I was like what is this not like the front page fucking news story New York Times wrote a big piece they did but you need to watch the podcast with commander David flavor that's the one David flavor was the guy who was in the vehicle he saw it with his own eyes he observed it with with the the tracking equipment in the plane and he looked at it with his own eyes was it looked like a tic-tac that guy is not full of shit and he is a high-level military guy doesn't have a long history this he's not seeking tension was very difficult to get him to do this in the first place Jeremy Korbel who made that document bob lazar in area flying saucers that that was a humbling experience listen to him talk about it because you could tell he's not full of shit he was telling you about a real experience he had that is impossible to describe and the fact that this thing was actively jamming radar people could say it's a this or it's a that or it's an anomaly a blitz what do this early jamming skeptics want to thank that oh they moved it to 2x zoom and that's why it looks like it took off quick no they couldn't track it they couldn't stay on it it was moving too fast Assessors didn't make any sense off it took off at a preposterous rate of speed and here more importantly it was actively jamming radar it was using equipment to jam their rate on purpose yes so not just like it couldn't be like perhaps no no no whatever whatever was created is whatever its energy signature was created blowing something to you to jam the radar it knew that they were trying to try and want to be found exactly was like fuck off what do you think with your nonsense I think it's from another planet that's what I think that's what I keep talking boy it's either from another dimension or it's from another plan wait what more likely that it's from another planet and I think would move on what do you mean in the other dimension well we don't have any idea I mean how many dimensions are there we know what we can see and feel here's the thing well you see an ant right ants move it around the ground and you hold a cell phone over that ant does it have any idea what the fuck that is no it doesn't this is what I make a trip out here it doesn't because it's it's outside of its realm of understanding and it's entirely possible that if something lives a million years longer than human beings have existed and it continues to innovate and continue to create new technology they can make technology that is indistinguishable from sorcery if you think about the way bob lazar explained it when he was working at area 51 it's like if you took a nuclear reactor of today and showed it to some people from the Victorian era they would think that it was magic and this is exactly how we were approaching these recovered crafts because they were trying to back engineer according to Bob Lazar whether you believe him or not they were trying to back engineer these crafts and they were saying that these crafts were operating on something called element 115 which we didn't even know was a real thing I mean they had speculated that it existed but he was talking about this in the late 80s and the 90s well they didn't even absolutely prove that element 113 or 115 was real until I think it was 2013 so he's talking about something that the Air Force or the Navy or whoever the fuck was operating area 51 and era and an s4 where he was that they had this knowledge and understanding of this element that they had somehow or another made stable that could bend gravity it could change gravity so instead of being a propulsion system where you have a fire that comes out of the back of a thing and it forces a thing forward this thing just pushed gravity in front of it and it shot through insane amounts of space and time it with incredible speed that didn't even make any sense and they didn't understand how they made it they couldn't back engine so pushing gravity would that's you have to listen to him describe it I was looking at a lighting that would that would push it up then it also give us gives us propulsion as well I'm butchering it for sure but the way he was describing it there was something about this element 115 that you utilized it wouldn't when it was inside of the spaceship it utilized gravity and some sort of an understand why that they still have not figured out and he saw an actually yeah he saw it in action he saw it in action and he was a propulsion expert from was the lab los alamos and you know he had worked on propulsion systems during his own free time and he had worked on some nuclear projects at Los Alamos it was in the middle of concocting some top-secret military shit and he's clearly a brilliant guy you know but so many people try to discredit them and maybe they're right and maybe I don't know I believe a lot of what he's saying if there are aliens do you want to be here when they make contact well I think they're making contact whether we like it or not that's what I think we're I think they're looking and watching whether we like it or not they're observing I think if you were an intelligent being from another planet you would want to make sure that the territorial monkeys don't blow each other up and that's what we are we're like this adolescent stage of evolution where we still have all of our primal territorial jungle instincts but yet we also have this insane ability to harness the atom we also have this ability to send videos through space and we can catch them on your phone and play it back and forth we hardly hold energy in these little rectangular devices that we hold in our pocket Lee charge them and you charge in them with fucking nuclear power that's you know nuclear power plants are charging our phones and then the phones go into our pockets and then we're like real close you know we're real close to a lot of this crazy technological innovation and it keeps getting more and more spectacular with every passing generation and they're probably watching they're probably watching and waiting and trying to figure out what the fuck we're doing and if you believe what they told Bob Lazar that they were responsible for an accelerated evolution wait wait wait wait it's come on too much information one of the things they were saying whose day when he was working for does he work for the Air Force was it the Air Force that Lazar was working for whatever whatever the government body that was operating area s4 they gave him a bunch of breakdowns on a lot of things they do and what where they think they got these crafts from and where the crafts are one of them was from an archaeological dig he said but they gave him an explanation of what these aliens are here for and what they're doing and one of the things that they said and he said I have no method of verifying whether or not that's true or not but that they had accelerated the evolution of primitive primates so they had taken primitive primates and they had done something to them to change them from a primitive being to what we have now in Homo sapiens and that's it very quickly if you really look at evolution the difference between Australia Pittacus and homo sapien it's only a few hundred thousand years which is insane if you if you think of how much more advanced we are than those lower hominids and there's no other animal that's experience that kind of a leap the human brain doubled in brain size over a period of two million years we have no idea how we have no idea what happened is all speculation whether it's eating meat controlling fire using tools hunting increased access to protein changing from herbivores to omnivores to carnivores all these different theories the throwing arm that's another theory that humans figured out a way to use an arm to throw and hit things and that accelerated our problem-solving skills there's a lot of theories we don't know but Terence Mckenna had a theory called the stoned ape theory he believed that human beings were experimenting with psilocybin mushrooms and it's psilocybin mushrooms accelerated our evolution who knows we don't know but one of the things that they were telling was our when he was working at s4 back-engineering this these crafts were that human beings were the product of accelerated evolution and that these space beings and that there was more than one there was more than one civilization that was involved in this these space beings had had some sort of a hand in this running experiment that is the evolution of man so then who the fuck no totally so how everyone's like we might be in a simulation we're not but at the same time we could be somebody simulation we could be a simulation too I mean Elon believes we're in a simulation yeah and you know I had a philosopher on that was trying to explain to me the likelihood of a simulation and and his was his name again I say Nick Bostrom his perception was that if you look at the laws of probability it's more likely that we are in a simulation than we're not and that was really hard for my stupid brain to accept that if you look at the amount of planets that there are if you look at the Fermi paradox like where are these planets if you look at the just the the insane number of stars just in our galaxy alone and then the insane number of galaxies in the universe what are the odds that a life-form hasn't gotten to the point where it can create a simulation that's indistinguishable from reality well the lot the odds are very small so if the odds are more likely that something has created a simulation that's indiscernible from reality the odds are very likely that we're in it right now if we're in a simulation like we're in a pretty good version of it you and I are kicking ass yeah we're doing great in the video game exactly well as well thumbs up like not bad like considering it like in the simulation we were allowed to climb from a place to another place yeah we were making progress we're having fun I mean we're not just playing fucking pitfall no actually we're Sims but I think about what you were saying about loving being on stage and that great feeling of having all these people that have been entertained by your art you know and and going to be able to sit there and watch well what you create being able to sit there and watch your movie and you be able to sit there watch all these people laugh at your work that's crazy that's a crazy great thing and so much better than your grandfather who was a janitor you know think about that that that is so much less rewarding your life is infinitely more rewarding and more with the simulation as well I'm sure maybe that's the marina simulation is it just like that give them some backstory so I didn't really have a grandfather it's all speculation who knows well who knows how it changes every day I mean when you wake up you assume that these fucking weird cloudy memories of the past were all realistic you know we don't know we don't even know if you ever have really gone to sleep we just know you have this memory of every night going to sleep we don't really know what do you mean was why you're awake right now how the fuck do you know that what you've experienced in your past all of it wasn't just simulated like and if it is simulated wouldn't sleep be simulated as well wouldn't all of it be simulated if you are just in this state this state of perpetual simulation where everything is existing all at once but your mind puts it in this context of the day-to-day grind get up in the morning I got a hustle I got to go out there and go out get after it maybe it's all nonsense maybe you're all in this eternal neuro neurological concoction some thing that's forcing your brain to interact with these ideas and memories as if they're real it's unfair that I'm the only one stoned because this is hot it's this toter talk this is good fuckin song for so many years I'm probably permanently stoned so I'm even in sober October yeah something probably take me months to completely dry out if I took a test I'd probably you didn't answer my question do you want to be here if the aliens yes for sure really yeah what if they're hostile hmm we are hostile so you think we could take him no no I mean take over the earth no fucking vaporize those chimps down and so wait would we gun down the alien invader I think so they'd probably be able to control us and be our minds yeah because you're probably impossible to even it was like isolate it could probably just take off and be gone like he pointed a gun at them they probably just disappear and be on the other side of the earth in a matter of seconds I mean we're talking about technology that's indistinguishable from magic right right how do you sound like Thor man that's what they said and Thor did that yeah I like Thor and they were like you know science and magic was the difference well it is well that is something that's really sad too I'm not saying anything unique that's one of the things they've said about a certain level of technology like when you achieve a certain level of techno it's a it's a famous quote is about certain level but it has nothing to do with Thor it's something to do with a certain level of Technology bar distinguishable from man yeah yeah yeah someone like that but that if you hit a certain level of technology that's beyond your comprehension right I mean look man if you could just go to the eighteen hundreds of an iPhone you'd be a fucking sorcerer right true here's what's the Arthur Sze clock there we go any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic Clark's first law there is about 2001 yes is that it he brought that right didn't you right well Kubrick made the movie made the movie by thank God he write it Clark wrote it but then again I was like Asimov yep 2001 Spaceballs I got what a great fucking movie that was the screen pick what do you think happens then all right so if we're in a simulation and we die then we just ceased to exist as a program if we're not in a simulation if we're organic little meat puppets and stuff what it what's your take on the afterlife doesn't just end I think do you have any accusation about that any speculation is just that it's a speculation you could just jerk yourself off all day that's kind of you know Richard Dawkins I had him in here last week and he was like I think the lights go out and that's it do you think the lights go out he's almost like challenging him like I don't know did you know either it's not romantic enough you know what I'm saying but at the same time it might just be me being arrogant going like no no I can't just the lights can't just go I know what not work no one knows you have not experienced it so even his reductionist view of it as pure speculation and he just decided to make it simple and logical I got close when I had my heart attack I was the doctor said you got a ATP I having a Widowmaker he goes that means in 80% of the cases of 100% occlusion the

Louis at the AMC West aisle of San Antonio at the Regal Cielo Vista so every place we go with the movie me and J then the movie opens up in our wake so if you don't if you don't want to see it with us at reboot Roadshow com you can go to fandango.com just enter Jay and Silent Bob reboot and see if it's pioneer you it's a good time it's a heartwarming film every night for me going to watch this movie is like being in church where I'm the priest and also the person they're celebrating have you made a deal with iTunes or some of those Saban films has the movie domestically and they've got an output deal with somebody I think Amazon and then Universal has the movie abroad we're opening in the UK November 29th or something like that I'm going over there Thanksgiving yeah fucking smoke oh no I got some menus all you to tour there as well for a week in England so so it's got homes and stuff but we the reason we go out on tour was cuz you know I like you I got an audience man I can count on the audience and I live off that audience like normally me and Jay are just out there I'm doing Q&A or or stand-up or whatever so like going out with the movie like the budget of the movie was like we you know we shot it in New Orleans so it's like 10 million but you get money back so it's like eight million we needed eight million bucks so we got some money from Saban for domestic rights we got some money from Universal for the overseas rights but then there was equity financing we had to pull together like a missing to three million bucks to make up the budget and stuff and that's where you get money from real people people were like I'm gonna invest in a movie and hope I get my money back or if not make it and stuff and those people always get fucked in this business never make their money back ever but the tour like I was able to assure those people I'm like within one year of the date we start the movie you're gonna get your money back because I knew I could take the movie out on tour and as long as I was willing to live with it we can get all that equity financing back so one year from the date of my heart attack we started shooting Jay and Silent Bob reboot as a big fuck you to the heart attack one year from the date we started shooting Jay and Silent Bob reboot I'm gonna be able to pay off my equity investors that's fuckin unheard of in this business but I only get to do that because the audience that we built up because the audience will come out and support us and like I was told a long time ago like if you work for the audience you'll never work a day in your life and it's absolutely true I've hadn't had a boss yeah and then I meet the bosses every night at the show and they're beautiful like their fans as they are my boss they give me money just like a boss gives you money and shit and they'll let you know if you're fucking up you know the audience will fucking tell you your boss will let you know but it's this tour with this movie like we banged out a tiny record because we don't have marketing money it's one thing to get money to make the movie then it usually cost double what you spent to make the movie to market the movie to tell people it's coming to put it up on screens and shit so we were lucky enough to get the 8 million to make the movie we weren't gonna get fucking 15 to market the movie that's crazy and that's generally what happens so we just had to be smarter about it and since that tour anyway with the podcasts oh my god let's use this fucking model and expand it so we hit a little record with our opening weeks we did the opening day of the tour was in New Jersey at Asbury Park at the Paramount and we did like ninety three thousand on one screen so we got that like a the record that week for like a limited opening or something like that and you know it and every headline was like you know Jane saw Bob reboot beat Avengers end game in this one record and you know it's it's one of those things you send your mom and you're like just read the headline don't read the rest of the article and feel like really smart business-wise and stuff and so me and Jordan Monsanto is Jason's wife she's the kind of the brains of our operation we we thought like we could count on the audience we'll take the movie out on tour and stuff like that and it's really been working out and it's nice that like some business people are being like hey good job like people are gone like oh they figured out their niche and they've been doing but we've been doing this for years we did with red years ago remember we toured that as well so it's great if you got like most filmmakers wouldn't bother cuz they're like I'm just gonna put in a bunch of theatres and shit and let the studio pay for and I don't have a studio so I got to take my movie to the people and for wallet be honest with you like I started as an indie filmmaker so that's in my blood and there's something insanely gratifying about sitting there with the audience I never had that early in my career they just put the movie on a bunch of screens you hear number was how you did being in the room seems like you just you miss out on all the stress of all the other aspects of moviemaking the worst the thing I used to hate the most man is you spend your time trying to make a movie you dream like I want to see it up on the silver screen you have these movie dreams and shit and then you have to make it reality if you're lucky you get to make the movie reality if you're lucky it gets a release if you're lucky you spend opening weekend not celebrating like we fucking did it we we did a thing that not everybody ever fucking does and Brian who are we were chimps and we figured it out but instead we'd spend every fucking waking moment of opening weekend going how much to make who's going are people going like isn't it's not making enough fuck we got to drive more business and suddenly the joy of what you were seeking is fucking gone because you're mired in the business and if you're the if you're lucky if you're the Avengers you get a month at the box office that's about it before everyone moves on to something else if you're a Kevin Smith movie you don't even get a weekend you get a day if you're fucking lucky and so suddenly all that dreaming took me five years to make this movie and living through a fucking heart attack comes down to one day at the box office fuck that man like tilt the table in your favor so I said I'm gonna take myself out of that box-office race and instead do this like what I'm losing in well I don't have marketing except what I'm losing in a mass release of the movie I make up for it by being able to accompany and move myself and that makes it a premium event it event eise's it it's an idea that I stole from Eddie Izzard I remember when I fell in love with that is roots stuff I was like Eddie Izzard is literally just doing fucking stand up in a big theater with a costume on like he's just doing stand-up that you would do with fucking improv and stuff but like he event eyes dit he turned it into something it's a one-man show as opposed to like he's doing ninety minutes of stand-up so for us we were like let's take the movie on the road and ties it if you're next to the movie people like oh shit the directors there if I bring gent like oh shit Jay and Silent Bob are there as well so it's been like a blast but you just have to be willing to put the time in and and you know some people like yeah you could do this but I'm like yeah we could do because we've been doing it for like a quarter man 25 years since clerks happen and from day one I've been engaged with the audience long before it was like fashionable or profitable just because why else wouldn't I want to like in the early beginnings I was like my friend Ming Chen the guy from comic book men he built a website and I was like can you put up like a thing where I could do Q&A all the time with the video is that possible he goes no because it was like 1990s 95 and he goes back and put up a message board and it was like a whiteboard like read it he's like people could put up those long before read it exists people could put up messages and then you could look at him anytime you want 3:00 in the morning you can respond to him and I realize I'm never gonna fucking be alone again in this life man I'll always be able to reach out to somebody who's like hey man I saw your movie I had a question for you and boom there's a connection should mean that so since 95 I've been in it like online with the audience like and I remember when I started it was me and Peter Jackson were the only two filmmakers on the web and then Peter Jackson got smart it's like if I'm on the web I'm winning Oscars and he went off and had a great career I'm still on the fucking web because I love connecting with the people that that you're trying to reach like you know I don't do it in a vacuum going like like good filmmakers like David Fincher they make a thing and they put a movie out there and they don't fucking go follow it they let the movie speak for itself I'm the other guy who's like when the movies done I run out and buy gold on let me tell you the story of how it all fucking happen and shit what people love it it's it's it's different and it works incredibly well first so the tour every night last week was like fucking sold out and it just felt like amazing and as the tour unrolled unrolls we were gonna fly from place to place and then I was like let's just fucking drive let's do it punk style so we've been driving around it's yeah we got a little SUV and we've been trucking around and it's fucking glorious man I'm 49 you don't get this at 49 this is a shit you're supposed to do in your 20s but like post heart attack now I'm like well like post heart attack I didn't go crazy where I'm like give me all the post in the world and she had like nothing really changed for me but I didn't become very cognizant of like you know my wife hates when I say it but I'm like I'm living on borrowed time I know for a fact my old man fucking died after the second heart attack we're all living on borrowed time act accordingly I'm just acutely aware of it because I was so fucking close to the moment so it's not so much like I'm having a midlife crisis not by any stretch of the imagination but like anything that allows you to feel like young vital makes you feel like oh yeah this is why I started shit like this or it's fun like we're making a living and I'm it's crazy like we're on the road all the time and I've been saying all week like this is the best vacation I've had in years even though we're working sometimes three times three shows in a day because it never feels like work I'm just driving around my whole job is to like go to a theater and fucking show the movie to people and stuff it's really fucking dope that's awesome man I'm happy for you Thank You Man I am I am always um how was the piss it was great I needed it I know you're always getting there as long as I could beers weird pains that's like you don't want I couldn't concentrate you want if you want good steady flow yeah what I'm walking away from this session with you is that I know bullshit I think when I'm done with the tour I'm gonna start working out yeah not like you know games for cows egg and shit yeah don't go crazy just some mustard oh no I think I need to do let me see I'm 49 I turned 50 in August I gotta be able to do a bug and pull up 50 you can do that that's totally achievable strength training where were you in high school like I could have used that kind of like you can do that keV instead of it was like fucking fatty get off the bar and shit now some people have a different approach they were I know that you've got that Zen Yoda Yoda Rogan approach you now where's it where's your show tonight Comedy Store two shows you got you know you're gonna do yeah you were gonna do the same show both times no no um I have some new stuff that I have to work in so I'll try to figure out how to do it these shows there's a lot of lugging around whatever size depends I did you ever know there bit where you're like I'm gonna open with this and then I'll try the new stuff you always try to open with something that's proven works but sometimes not sometimes there's a thought that gets in my head like right before I go up I'll go see what this works so wait a second how many stores a gym basically to work out yeah I mean you get paid but really it's a gym you probably had a part a point in your career now where you don't even have to like come up with shit to do on like late nights because you don't even have to do what was last time you did like a late night thing yeah don't do those too often I was gonna say like you got your own fucking audience those people are gonna love you do you figured you crack the code you like you you built a thing and you were like I'm gonna build my own thing you're like the Coen brothers of this bitch comb brothers like we're like we're gonna do our own thing and it's fucking weird and it doesn't work like your thing at all but we're gonna stand over here and we're gonna keep doing it and slowly the whole industry gravitated toward them they stood outside of it and then everybody started doing their sensibility their sense of humor their type of casting you're the same fucking thing you you bill and I watched it in fucking real time you built a thing and you were content to be like I'm happy with this like I don't need to fucking chase this or that I'm building a thing and now you're been rewarded by being at a place where you don't have to like go anywhere to promote whatever it is you want to do you literally do it fucking here feeding your own machine think about it instead of gentlemen on tonight's show or something like that and giving them ratings you feed your own beast by being like oh I'm gonna be here come see the show you know it's really I don't even do that what do you mean I don't talk about my gigs I just do it through social media you never you never on this very rarely Bill Maher does at the end of every episode he's always like hey man I'm going to a gig tonight he doesn't have social media I don't think does he's not on yours for sure very strongly I just post stuff up on it's what I do two minutes out is sitting with this it's like you know yeah I mean I talked about it casually like I'm in Houston and then no Dallas on November 15th and Houston on the 16th there go I just did it what you know it man but oh listen man I'm I'm I love what you do I love the fact that you're living in this vibe you know you've got this thing that you do and where you make your films you promote your films you go on tour with them and I like that you've switch it up to like read stay is one of my favorite movies man I fuckin loved that movie because it was so crazy guy I didn't have any idea what to expect when I sat down to see that but I love that you've got that sort of artistic freedom you do what seems like a thing to do and you know it's masturbatory I guess on some level it's creative is what it is as long as people enjoy watching me masturbate I'm alright I think people like watching you beat off who knows tip my jar yeah you know I'm a cam cam kid thank you brother thank you for having me Kevin Smith ladies and gentlemen goodbye [Applause] [Music]
