trained my day Joe rocky podcast by night okay t-mobile arena remover Mayweather McGregor yeah good googly-moogly fucking happening how is that going to happen what do you mean how is you see do you think the UFC and Mayweather come to an agreement yes that's what's happening Connor open Vegas is in cahoots with the UFC let's get this I guarantee you he's involved but the report who knows who made that report pretty good you might hit it on the way over here I made up I might have I think it's going to happen man wow you really think so I really do and you're asking me commentating it so let's just figure this out now you want to talk to you just hence we filmed and probably companion on me I don't know man I don't know what I'm doing well if you're not commenting me you're like giant companion for it and yeah that was elebrate the shit out of it I would prefer that honestly June 10 June 10th is out to get me a lot of my man Mayweather so she done TMT money hmm I don't think they really care about me commentating they'd probably want Max Kellerman or the boxing people max kill men you would be fun I would love to do it with them but that's what that's a boxing match you know that's their world yeah I mean if it was a mile ago and he was sitting down next to me doing commentary you know that I think that would be a little odd too not it not as Floyd was just doing boxing in the Octagon you know they do not run well no no I'm saying if the roles were reversed like I think there you could talk about moving Connors history because they've done on your own shit let's be right they're gonna be like you know she and sharp talking about UFC it's where I like to listen to it's going to be good at song who's knowledgeable break down like Connors history how he came here I got his movement was known for hmm I think that's super important you have tougher people who don't want you I mean yeah you're drinking a shit well the new boxing you know come together and hanging out with you guys smoking weed watching it right here there's not so much better I just want my dear friend Joe Rogan part of the biggest fight of combat this is I'm good I'd like to be right here crazy don't think that's the biggest thing I love you think fighting history bigger than mommy Frazier number-wise yeah yeah it's a big biggest pay-per-view ever because it brings in two worlds it brings in the UFC world and one guy was unquestionably the biggest star in the USA unquestionably by a longshot and then you bring in a guy who has been one of the biggest moneymakers in the history of boxing change begins the only got to go 49 I know I was in Rocky Marciano I mean he's like right there and we'd love to break rocky Marciano's record and then you know one man when people want to do things like break someone's record and you want to do it so bad they take on a guy who's never had a boxing match before and then that guy starches you this is Jimmy I mean it's not like I said I'm going to build a G right at him great or whatever there's some about a man I'm telling you something about that dude he's got something going on magic he's got a little something extra special but he would need he would need everything to line up it would have to be the McGregor Mayweather would have to dismiss him as a threat he'd have to not train hard enough he'd have to not seriously consider the possibility Connor connects on him and knocks him out right and then Connor would have to do some roughhousing he'd have to hold in the middle ng yeah he'd have to hold him and hit him he'd have to try to get off as many shots and bully him around and wear him out the possibility it's a possibility he's a money without your mask he's a much bigger probably very very quick but if you compare the two of them frame wise like what if they ever do do it and they're standing right at each other looking down at each other you know doing eye-to-eye you're going to go oh shit yeah come this way because you remember when Eddie Alvarez was going eye to eye with Connor you realize how big Connors head is like Jesus overall just a bigger dude jump shoulders his legs that's a big fuck I mean he could make that 145 pound cut when he's on death's door but Mayweather makes it easy what are they going to fight at 45 that's a good question No maybe was fighting 154 lfts Wow so I bet they do it like 55 at the 60 maybe maybe depends on what may was comfortable but but but I think the in Dana light you want to be part of that fight if you don't know what you want to be cahoots with all these guys with Mayweather slowly or don't want to fight to take place at all and look he's got daytime fuck because Nemec met off sick-making that wait if memory met off didn't get sick making that wait then nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson Dana White did oh they're like city hundreds no the UFC did because look the real fight is the winner of rod Tony Ferguson and habib number Gamera in the UFC right so that's the real fight as like being a big challenge for Conor and that could be a million plus pay interest right especially if you if you either have that fight or the better fight financially is another fight with Nate Diaz no the better fight finances Mae West oh yeah for Bob Knight on a quote for Johnson for Colin I don't know for sure for sure Conor as a business that's by far the one I never sent a greeting is what I'm saying in 20 million way more no squatters hundred mill hotter nine hundred one hundred million years away to Rayborn was good find uh he's so fast [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
