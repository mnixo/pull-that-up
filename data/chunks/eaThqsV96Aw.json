the gyro can experience just like there's a lot of dummies that will look at a guy like Mike Tyson I really think that they can kick his ass there are people that look at a guy like you look on stage and they get upset at you for some reason they get upset at you for getting that attention to get up oh yeah but then you know what I feel like they should be getting with you I thank God every champ every time one of them have stepped up I had a baseball bat of jokes you know my reaction was always right on on time Laser sharp and they was burnt out of the audience like a cigarette but you know and he's been in the witnesses and I've been in the witness you doing it I think you're one of the best I've ever seen do it you inspired me what I've seen is the how deep you took it out I was like wow I could go much higher Joe was telling this person man Wow you know saying I see you evaporating people says that made that death told me that it's something you definitely got to have as part of your game people don't be standing up on the stage talking to people you have to have the ability to you know to do that yeah if it comes up got to shoot them down and keep it moving you can't be haggling with them and you know cuz that's gonna break the whole kind of no leader to show up the guys that can just hit him with the ham and keep it moving the best it's an unfortunate side effect of comedy but we started out freezing I were fuckin Comedy Store veterans man and that was a place that nobody patrolled there was no manager shush in the room does the Comedy Store was run by the guy on stage and occasionally dudes got kicked out because the comic would go just get these fucking people out of here god damn it would get it would get to the point where it was just you had to kick him out before the show couldn't go on but there was always something there that place is always drama I've had glasses thrown at me on stage there I've seen wrong with I would remember when uh Holtzman got knocked out by Martin Lawrence bodyguards don't dam that place was chaos I remember I remember Eddie Griffin we were in the main room we had a show it was Martin Luther King's birthday and after the show this was when a DJ came on this is the first time I heard the song no Vaseline right I see yeah yeah and the DJ played it in dr. Dre and all of the Dogg Pound and it was about dr. Dre yeah they were all there and Dre went up on stage and snatched the record off of the off the turntable and snapped it in half and that kicked off a riot trash was in there Tupac was in there trench had that big chain with the padlock on it he was swinging that over is it oh my god all this went on in the may room on Martin Luther King's birthday holy shit ma'am I see we have places fucking crazy man his last wave Flynn surprise laughing oh yeah yeah seen a wedge women out there that the county's calm East I was in the parking lot Richard Pryor was performing at night she was standing by the back door and his other chick came around was getting ready come about they knew each other obviously she she said that other chick did not take that come no more Richard show every time she hit another piece of jewelry came off so when she got finished with all of this women's rings and necklaces and everything and the wig was laying on oh wow and they was dragging her away man and then Richard Pryor when I said you did 20 minutes or what just happened ha ha ha ha lassic take it straight to the stage he went right on the stage stage the stage what year was this they had to be 8 and 80s manually and Andy something dad could you imagine if you fucking videotape that all time keep mind you if you had a video over that and that was that was they gonna mom she's did not take it to cutting them wanted widget shows so fairness how beautiful with that video be to watch that watch the ass-kicking to prior walking on stage two prior talking about the ass-kicking afraid all it was already show yeah don't want to miss it yeah yeah I believe a 20-minute so it was just having I was ahead I performed with Richard Pryor for a few weeks right at the end right when he was when he stopped performing when he was in a wheelchair member at least carrying my stereo our room I had to go on after him for four weeks four weeks and I did that I always I was those those spot mitts he always gave me right after Richard Pryor when you go on after Richard you would you would eat dick like no other time what it is yeah cuz it wasn't it was sad it was sad why you know I mean it was cool because once Richard would open his mouth it was him right I mean you know you could tell that he and and then in it was it was a weird effect because you like oh yeah he's still there he's still in there right but then you would be like wait a minute he's in there that's his body now and that's what he's kind of it seemed like he was more in prison after you heard him do stand-up because it was a realization like this is a man who has his wits but does not have his motor skills and as functions as bodily functions to to match up with his wit right right way and that was that just was even though he was funny you know his sharp that just it was sad yeah it seemed to me like there was a there was a disconnect too towards the end he I don't think he was completely lucid so when he would go on stage and talk about things like they didn't always make sense and you know was uh it was it was he was dying you know and he would get this huge round of applause when he got offstage where people just would say you know hey man will you look at him right now man there's not much time left and this is one of the greatest comedians maybe the greatest comedian to ever walk the face of the planet the most influential I think of all time and you'd be walking and watching them as they're carrying them away and then they introduce you Jeff Richard gets on the piano ladies and gentlemen Joe Rogan from hardball this on Fox TV please welcome Joe Rogan you go on stage and you have to do stand-up I have to richard brand it takes at least four or five minutes to get him out of the room because they're walking with them out of the room there because you can't really walk so they have to carry him and walk with him really slowly and everybody's clapping and standing you know like a war veteran just got off stage you know who did that that's who did just get off stage yeah yeah it's good one yeah definitely yeah you
