the girag an experience I I have so many memories of not even playing there just going to Hollywood I used to go watch bands I used to go watch van Halen play I used to go just hang out you know and that sort of half the fun of the rainbow is just being there and seeing all the freaks and all the cool people and all the you know the people like well there's that guy there's Lemmy from Motorhead there's all these strange characters and rockers and all these people that have been around Hollywood forever I don't really know why you know it's just happy you know it's right next to the Roxy it's just uh just want a spot it's one of those putts or people just get a good vibe there or something you know that strip is just the Sunset Strip is just one of the all-time classic spots in Americana I mean just really is where the Comedy Store is the Viper Room is it's incredible and whiskey the history of going back to even like days of the doors I mean our you know just to know that they played the Troubadour or even you know early days with like Linda Ronstadt her backup band was was like Don Henley and and Glenn Frey you know that was their backup in and they went off and made the Eagles or whatever yes incredible so yeah it's it's not you know the history it goes way beyond the the 70s and the 80s it's like goes back to the 60s and you know I mean you've got the doors look at how big that Bandit you know they're the type man like that you you don't think of them doing regular guy stuff like they're there to me you know you know when you're a kid and you think of a band and you like I know they don't drive through McDonald's like we do it's like right you think like they're almost alien door so that you don't even wasn't that the the mystique of that been sort of eroded by the internet like there was a thing the other day where Charlie Sheen was having a Twitter beef with his ex-wife right and it was that's ridiculous ridiculous yeah but it was the that's been that that sort of thing is different now Pleiades - he used to be the one a guy was a big star that they would be sort of living up on a house and the behind these crazy you really didn't know what each oh yeah like know a show you're on the internet you're literally in two minutes people are watching your show you know the show you're playing in France they're watching it in LA and you just got done with the show like two minutes ago well then they get to read your Twitter pages when I was a kid when I was again a kid it would literally be this much of an event it would last all day I'd go by like Robin Trower record going to my friends you know we'd set up everything man get two speakers outside the window and listen to this album over and over and over now kids download 300 songs in 20 minutes before they go to school or in their iPod or whatever it's just not it's not as personal as it used to be you know like it's more accessible it's more accessible it's uh you know I asked Rosen comrade the article with David girl or whatever from Foo Fighters yeah Foo Fighters and Nirvana and he makes so much sense to me because I I went through all these things that he's talking about which is playing with guys that don't really play that good and we're jamming in the garage and you know pissing off my parents and you know and just going through that and improving from there and just getting better you know whatever instead of people just thrown together with their songs written by somebody else and all that you know it's just that the sum of the human element has been that's my only complaint and it's not really a complaint it's just I just prefer that people play music and not machines you know and I know you're saying yeah well there's also the experience of going to the record store and looking at the album art and take it home and that exactly something missing am i driving 200 miles or 150 miles to do a photo shoot when I'm going to be the size of an ant on you know yeah microchip yeah but or whatever but you know I it's not really complain my whole thing is I just want to get our music to the people the best way I can and I if you know your way around the internet you can you can get that done and we just got done up this big monster cruise and you know 30 bands on this big ship and we went and played on an island and you know it was like a it was great you know so I'm you know I'm not bitter or anything I know things are different it's really difficult on major labels you know because we can go record our next Elmo your house on your computer yeah you know I think that puts a lot of power in the artists hands though and also us it also puts a lot of power in their ability to promote themselves all they need is the internet now exactly and all those other closed off avenues like we were talking about getting on the Ed Sullivan Show was everything to a guy like Rodney Dangerfield you couldn't get on The Ed Sullivan Show you were fucked today for a comic especially boy you don't need that at all I mean my friends who have become famous from the internet like Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir and Duncan Trussell they've only had the internet the Internet is all they ever needed but all they had to eat all they needed was talent and an avenue in my days I needed a staple gun in the posters and Sunset Boulevard to get people to come out yeah and then they'd have to see the poster she'll be excited by it like no rain comes by and they put it over ours oh yeah those cars over there the wars of posters it's still awards yeah well there's internet wars now you know there's there's definitely a lot of that there's still a lot of fuckin morons out there when it comes to that kind of stuff but but I think it's definitely a better time as far as putting the power in the hands of the artists and these people that are than the normal cabal that we're controlling the music industry they've they've lost a lot of their power right oh yeah and you know the difference now is we don't need millions of dollars to to record and and all that kind of promotion and and that's why that they're the major labels are suffering a bit and yeah the where the power comes in is we're know no longer are we just getting our little points you know when they're taking you know we make a million dollars at the record company gets you know nine hundred and whatever and you know they throw our crumbs enough crumbs to where we don't like go away but you know but people don't realize that for most folks they'd have no idea like how bad the deals were yeah especially like jail was amazingly bad and they even speak about it on the internet you can go on and there sit together and they're actually interviewing each other about the old days you know people think we're the bitch and rock stars but we are we were literally broke there they said that their checks per week who this is during the first album were eighty eight dollars and eighty three cents or something yeah and they were selling millions about yeah yeah a million dates okay here's the funny part they got off this tour and and the record company says you always 2 million dollars and he goes okay let me get this straight so if we do ten tours and sell 20 million records we're gonna owe you 20 million dollars doesn't that say yeah it it's just from all the loans and that you know the first coming out of the gate but um well it's also just a corrupt system it has too much power it's corrupt in you know the being the artist when you don't have your own representation and you know you just want to do anything to break out of this club scene you know you want to be a big ban on big tours and so you they take bad deals you know a lot of a lot of bands have done that you know they've done successful with their album sales but their business side of is really horrid yeah yeah that's also the difference between a businessperson and an artist like a lot of artists are impulsive and they're just not that good at things like that they're not that good isn't it and I'm one of them I you know our deal wasn't great either and but we've kind of made up for that we wasn't our whole career but at the beginning it wasn't they're great but but Sanna it always starts off nobody ever says aw we got an awesome deal right out of that eight and we're fortunate an ethical record company no geez you talk about the fucking scoundrels that signed you I mean that's also you think about a music company how many people do they sign I mean they might sign a hundred and one of them might become great white you know this there's a lot of failure involved on there and to prognostications you know that that's what they call their write ups you know the write up bills but yeah yeah but for a band that's successful the the the reality behind it did you ever read that piece that Courtney Love wrote on the music business she wrote a pretty incredible piece about explaining the expenses and how much it actually costs and what an artist actually gets paid and how much the studio gets paid and how they go about saying how much things are worth I haven't read the piece but I'm glad she wrote something like that because it will school the audience and you know yeah it's not their business pretty incredible stop kidding yeah well there's a little bit of that but it's also there are some educational you know people will understand that you know we work really hard and we're not just walking around you know zillionaire sure well you bummed out when the whole Napster thing came along people started downloading mp3s and it just almost immediately sort of took the wind out of the sails of Records um you know I was bummed out even before that a little bit but you know III know me like I talking about earlier that I'm a fan of music and I like to support the artists I go out and buy their albums you know I I want the artwork I want to know who wrote the songs I want to know where they recorded this album I you know I just think that's part of it and that's what makes the world go round in music is to support the artists so I go out and buy ZZ Top CD and you know but when somebody comes up and go hey man I just got your new album I copied it for my friend it's like well thanks you know at least he's going to maybe give me some feedback and if you likes it or not or hopefully he'll go see you live you know go see us live or whatever but yeah um I don't know man it is what I'm not gonna say that that it is what it is yeah but it is what it is I mean we were changing the world is changing around us technology's forcing us to change and we have to adapt but the most important thing is you're still creating you're still doing what you love you still doing doing and then the commerce aspect of it has to morph and as to morph to accommodate this new environment that we live in but the environment is so beneficial in so many other ways it's it just is what it is yeah it has to change yeah there's no way you're not going to have the world change when something like the internet comes along yeah all these other away but the bet that I think the benefits way outweigh the negatives in my opinion definitely and our fans are loyal to I mean we go over to you know Sweden or you know Switzerland or whatever and they're all there in front of the stage you know so so we are blessing that way I mean you know no matter what happens in the industry our fans have always hung so it's like you know well that's a little because you guys appreciate it I'm sure that has a lot to do with it we are grateful for our fans and I always tell them that and you know in the in the days when we were you know playing arenas every night is very difficult you know that the constructed meet and greets we can only meet a few and you really can't go out and say hey you know invite 20,000 people backstage a to put for the party you know but we've really taken advantage of being able to hear their stories man I mean I'm talking like stories that I don't remember I mean you know people doing my laundry and gave me a ride here or you know they were in this certain place or this guy got married to this song or you know it got laid because you know that your song this one or you know I mean it's just the stories are endless in and how you personally and affected these people yeah I mean if our music is involved the people's life on like that because I have again I can relate because like I was saying earlier I literally have visuals when I hear certain songs you know like I remember where I was how old I was what I was doing you know almost like the smell that was in the air practically you know and so when people come up and have a similar story about me like that that my band was involved in it's like you have to feel like that's a pretty tall compliment you know get you know just be involved with that
