mmm-hmm here we go four three two one boom first of all before we get started I want to say I love your reviews or my favorite you you have the well you and Lou I love Lou too but you you you're so good at covering all the bases of whether it's cellphones or any kind of weird technology that's coming out and you just you just nail it you just you're so you're my go-to guy man well thank you that's quite an intra I really want to tell you like whenever as a new cell phones out like I saw that you walked in with the red but that's you know that's not your daily driver now I thought you would like this this is I mean every phone knows is glass on glass yeah but this this red hydrogen one has a lot of weird stuff about it it's first of all it's about twice as big as it has to be but it's from a red which is a camera company Wow all these buttons yeah so buttons just a grip this grip you can probably drop it from 45 feet in it we find throw it across the room but the weird part is it's made by red so red the camera company there I use their cameras I love their cameras but then they come out with this which is a foam just kind of weird but green yeah it's my foot actually so that's next to the the iPhone 8 plus which is already a huge phone what is this metal thing on the back that brass looking so it's like these pins and it's supposed to next year support modules that will connect to it so potentially the are better camera bigger battery VR whatever Reds decide to support or make hmm well attached to it but it's also kind of may or may not happen for a while yeah because Jamie ordered one when did you order one I paid for it blast I don't know right went on sale yeah like last August maybe I'm vaporware mine my official one just ship that's a prototype hmm this is a prototype you have here yes seven I've worked with red for I've seen a lot of the process since I've gotten like eight software updates and this is not final but like it's a pretty good idea yeah what do you think about it so far so I it's surprisingly good a lot of people like new camera companies or new companies come up and make it phone and it's just not right in a lot of ways they kind of took a lot of notes and they went in minimal with the software I like that about it I was expecting the camera to be amazing it's they don't use they don't make this this sensor so this the camera is not amazing yet oh but I think the modules will make this what it is I think the phone app by itself is like not really $1300 phone but it's support for upcoming things that they're planning I think we'll make it good is it a problem when a company tries to get into this cell phone business and you're competing with Samsung Apple you know all right Huawei there's so many companies that are so advanced for you to be red who's essentially a camera manufacturer they make video cameras yeah really high-end for people don't know really high-end HD video cameras and a lot of movies are shot on them films all kinds of things to videos yeah oh you do all your YouTube videos with it yeah is it really that good for you I mean is it worth having a red kit it's a large camera right it's heavy yeah it started off not that great and then I got used to it and then they got better so it was probably like five years ago that I first started with a red a red scarlet this 4k 5k camera and yeah it's kind of a pain but the workflow has gotten better they've worked with smaller teams like individual creators even to get the cameras now smaller it does more in a smaller body so it's gotten a lot easier to use a red for a small team whereas like yeah five years ago they were making a red for a movie shoot with 15 people use yeah yeah so how much they we know uh I couldn't tell you a weight I'd say probably between six and ten pounds oh yeah because you it's completely modular you rig it up to be what you want so like you get that out the box which is just the brain what we're looking at for people just listening it says red dragon on the side why is it called itself red dragon and you got some names pretty clutch looking it looks like looks really like a computer so that's what that's what you're looking at is just the computer and the sensor and that side piece right there is the SSD reader everything else all those pins you see on the top and on the side that's where you connect you want to make it the rig so if you're doing this eight years ago you would attach a viewfinder you'd attach a couple monitors for directors you would attach controls more yeah all this follow focus all this the the lens obviously the mount all this stuff has to attach to it but for just me and my use I'd use it more kind of like what you might see in another image which is just a monitor an SSD a controller and a lens and that does everything so is the idea eventually that this phone is going to be able to do everything that that does so that I think if you asked read they would say yes but they aren't there yet obviously how could they release something and not have an amazing camera yeah that seems crazy that that I think is what I think a lot of people were super hyped about cuz obviously Reds good with not just the they make the silicon for the camera but they're good at color science and autofocus and all these different things that camera should be good at so when they come out with a phone that has a camera on you just kind of expect it to be amazing yeah it's not the best I kind of firmly believe this is the best camera and you have that's the Google three yeah is the best camera in a phone are you a Google pixel fanboy at this point I'm a fan I'm a fan of the camera Roche has turned me into a fan of the rest of the phone just the camera alone it's it's an unusual camera in that it only has one one camera yes yeah there's one camera where everybody else is going with multiple cameras three for Google's doing everything with software yes and I like that about it now is that the excel let's see excel it's it doesn't seem that big it's kind of not that insane I think everyone's everyone's into the notch obviously which is a little different from what you might see in a iPhone or a huawei phone or something but this software is very googly the screen is much better than last year its glass of wireless charges got all these things that last year's phone didn't have but the camera is absolutely what makes that phone good it's really that much better it is that much better what is so good about it it's like you said it's the software so what Google does with HDR and essentially their image processing is a big part of why it's good you could put the same sensor in glass another smartphone with way weaker software and it wouldn't look as good but what they do with that that image processing after it's it's a rolling buffer of images so you can take it's like instant shutter so as soon as you press the shutter it's instant shutter you freeze the motion the dynamic range is great the detail is great and photos are amazing I was amazed at the low-light photos yeah those stunning cuz I had the best I had seen before that was the Huawei the mate RS I guess it was there's been a couple really good night modes in Huawei phones yeah but this seemed even better than that and it didn't seem distorted it seemed like you realized it was at night but you could see all the detail yeah it's hard it's never gonna look as good as daytime but there's a I haven't I don't have the update yet but there's gonna be an update to the pixel that has night sight or another night mode that does the same thing we're taking a bunch of exposures and long exposures and use a stabilization and hopefully get some much brighter image that looks way better than what would be different from the update in in compares to what it does now so right now if you just take a photo at night it'll just try to noise reduce all like when you take a photo at night there's a lot of grain you're pumping the ISO all the way up and when you clean all that noise out you are it's kind of like airbrushing the image and it's gonna be softer so if you do a lot of noise reduction you lose all your detail it's really soft so low-light photos just aren't as good but if you can take a longer exposure with better stabilization you can not crank the ISO as high not introduced as much noise and then at the end of the day have a more detailed better looking photo so that's the theory behind a lot of these night modes how they do how do they do that all in software a lot of calibration a lot of knowing exactly how good the optical image stabilization is in the lens and then electronic stabilization as well a lot of algorithms knowing what part of the photo is moving versus what isn't so there's a lot of computational photography is what it's called happening on the chip that makes it that good it's just fascinating that Google is the only one who's doing this with one camera as opposed to everyone else like my iPhone has several cameras yeah I have a note 9 which I really like and one of the other things about Google this does not have a lot of RAM now I found that actually kind of an interesting weak point about this phone and I haven't even I reviewed it and I was kind of skeptical about its only only four gigs of RAM just like a couple years ago for teak sorry I'm on the phone that's amazing it's amazing but a lot of phones coming out now has six eight gigs of ram well who has the most right now a phone just a gaming phone just came out with ten gigs of RAM so the razor phone or a different no another one I don't even remember the name but then there's also a Oppo find X with ten gigs of ram but do you know me that no you know you don't need what would what would be the benefit of having 10 gigs of ram like what software would run basically the advantage to having more Ram is keeping apps open and running in the background longer so if you have your camera and your Twitter and you're instagramming a web browser and all that a lot of high and maybe a couple games all running at the same time and then you multitask and switch between them on a phone with less RAM you'll find that you'll switch from the game to the browser and you go back to the browser and it reloads everything cuz it it completely garbage that from the memory after a while because it was trying to save space so on a phone with four gigs of RAM this happened me a couple of times where I'd be listening to music and I'd opened the camera take a few photos and then the music or the podcasts or whatever would just stop and it killed that app in the background with only four gigs of RAM I'm not doing that crazy things with multitasking just two things running just to I think it might have been a bug because the camera uses a lot of memory and for whatever reason it just picks the other big memory app and kills it it's not very repeatable I've had it happen to me since I landed yesterday like a couple times but it I think a phone with six or eight gigs of RAM the last phone I was using for a while was the one plus six has eight gigs of RAM and I never happened to me every time I multitask and go back five ten apps ago and open it it was right where I left off is the Google pixel three your favorite phone or is it just your favorite phone because of the camera it is my favorite phone period and it also has the best camera and is it your favorite phone because it has pure Google because you have the Android it's the latest Android which is kind of hard to find and you get obviously this pure Google experience and this amazing camera and a great display and my priority isn't a phone are pretty much along those lines I need a great camera and then I want a great display I want good software and then the rest kind of follows and you want pure Google right you don't want to be operating under the Samsung skin I don't mind I don't mind a skin if it's good there's a lot of skins like oneplus has oxygen OS and it's a skin technically it's close to pure Google but it's missing a lot of the pixel features but it's fine it's smooth it's great is oneplus running the latest Android no no who is its actual phone so one plus I think just got the Android pee update essential just got the Android pee update and then everyone else is on like one version ago or a law or older hmm why is that a pain in the ass for them why can't it be Universal I have a bunch of theories on why they don't update their software as quickly as they probably could I think a lot of it in the US especially asketh carriers when you have to get a so long you want to push a software update to a phone on Verizon for example not only do you have to like rewrite the software and optimize and everything but then you have to submit it for like certification from Verizon Verizon has to push that update that whole introduction of the third-party through the carrier is a huge pain in the ass and then on top of that I know a lot of people who when they get a software update like actively avoid installing it they just don't want change in their phone hmm so at the end of the day like they put all that money and work into making a software update and half the people never install it or don't care then they just figure they might as well not put the money there so a lot of teams are a lot of manufacturers just don't they don't they support the phone for a year or two and then that's it but for folks like you for the power users that's big like that's a big thing having the latest and greatest definitely yeah that's why I'm a fan of phones that keep the skin light and update quickly which is what you'll find with like pixel and essential and oxygen OS and stuff like and that's really it like Samsung takes a long time to get to it yeah yeah as great as Samsung phones are they definitely are first to get a new software they're trying to do it quicker apparently what I've been reading but I guess there is there's a bunch issues always a bottleneck yeah now when when you compare phones like do you have a checklist of things that you have like on a computer or is it just all off the top of your head like do you do you have like a rating system that you use a personal rating system I don't have a rating I do have a like a like a checklist of things that I definitely pay attention to every time that I must say I go through screens displays and battery life mm-hmm how good the camera is and things like that but I never come to like rating out of whatever I used to do that a long time ago but I stopped because I just it's kind of like a never-ending you'll never you'll never get a 10 out of 10 it's really because if you ever give something a 10 out of 10 the next one's gonna be better right so how do you how do you put that on the scale so I'm for October 2018 yeah I guess you'd be like this is the best phone like I said if I say this is the best phone right now then maybe that's a it's not a 10 out of 10 but it's like the best you can get but that line just keeps moving so I don't give things numbers but see for me those the things you said that would be a pain in the ass that your music would shut off because you're using the camera that's yeah kind of big that's a pain yes yeah it's not a 10 out of 10 because of I think the memory is a problem yeah the notch is bothering some people it doesn't bother me anymore it just kind of blends in I don't really look at the notch so have you gone into the developer settings and fucking down removal of the knotch I tried it it wasn't that big a deal yeah it just makes a big black bar over the top exactly and you just lose the screen you paid extra if that seems silly yeah I don't mind it on the iPhone I most of it mostly I use the XS max but I'm so sour on Apple because of what they did with the batteries yeah that was such a dirty thing to me because everybody had always suspected like my friend Brian was always like dude I'm telling you when the new phones come out your old phone starts moving slower Mike that's a conspiracy that's all horseshit yeah your phone's just old bro but then when I found out that it was real I was like you assholes and it's pretend the problem was the way they didn't tell people like they could have just a avoided like the whole whatever like PR we want whatever going to call it by just telling people look this is what we do on your phones getting older we need to preserve either the CPU or the battery so we need to either voltage down the CPU or save your battery pick one and give us a choice they didn't tell us until people started suspecting things and they had to make a statement and then it looked kind of dirty and like hidden that I don't buy it yeah I think it's a trick to try to get you to buy new phones I don't know there's no way they didn't think about that yeah why else would they do it that way why would why else wouldn't they just let the battery be slower or they let the the the CPU be slower and the best part is they give you the choice now but if you never look for it you'll never find it and they definitely still default to saving your battery by underclocking a chip so your phone will still slow down if you don't know where to find that option as soon as a new phones come out basically it's just dirty seems pretty dead because it's the thing that everybody always suspected Oh everybody was suspected there was some sort of engineered obsolescence and there did they're doing this on purpose to get you to keep buying the newest latest and greatest but I wanted to let go nah Apple come on Apple wouldn't do that I mean they're your friends they paint this picture that's really up up right like we want you to have the best experience as long as possible sure which involves not replacing your battery which means we'll just slow down your phone just a little bit it's it lasts longer and the battery can keep up makes sense on paper but on paper well there's a lot of things about Apple that I really like I really love that the OS I really love it I mean it's but it's just so much better than Windows but their keyboard sucks so bad on their laptop yes all the laptop yeah clicky it just doesn't it doesn't feel good it's got shallow travel there's all these issues with I switched to a lenovo I went with a think pad just for for stand up I have to write a lot and I found out that I've right way slower like maybe ten words per minute slower like it's it's a real issue because it's like you make a lot more mistakes with those little shallow clicky things yeah and with the lenovo you have a much you have much more travel it's much easier to touch type it just feels better for me but that bums me out it's like why can't they get that right like you you're making these things for creative people right that's your whole thing's like I think different you know that's not thing I kind of got like it's again like what Apple tries to portray themselves as versus what you're actually experiencing if you never listened to Apple and you get the new laptop be like wow those keyboards worse yes sucks why is this keyboard so shallow and mushy yeah and then you're supposed to listen to Apple and they're like well we made it quieter we made it thinner so the laptops thinner now and they'll give you all these reasons why they did what they did and there's you're supposed to go okay yeah that actually makes sense maybe this is better but your experience often says the opposite so that's why people like to not listen to what Apple says and just evaluate it without listening to that particularly for writers for someone who writes and you write on a regular basis you want a comfortable keyboard and you know I've constantly searched for the best keyboard right now I think it's probably the ThinkPad but I've heard great things about the razor the razor Pro which is the really large gaming one it has a mechanical keyboard for the first time ever on a laptop yeah and that's supposed to be really good I have tried the blade and I have tried what I'm using right now is the surface the Microsoft Surface laptop - and that's got a pretty good keyboard you know it's travels a lot it's backlit and then the actual laptop part itself is not metal it's got like Alcantara like you might see inside a car like a soft touch on the laptop so go grab that it's kind of Alcantara yeah like fake suede yeah that's the craziest shit I've ever heard my wife Alcantara yeah the Razer pull up that Razer Blade pro 2 if you get a chance we'll look at the surface first because he's gonna go grab that but the Razer Blade pro is also it's an enormous laptop and it has the yeah that's it right there the Razer Blade Pro is so big and wide that it actually has the mouse on the side like a trackpad this is it huh that's the surface laptop too oh wow how weird and the keyboards pretty good it's like a polished Alcantara oh that feels good yeah the question though whenever you see that material is like if I'm putting my palms on that all the time how long will that last will it start to like thin out and look kind of worn after a while or will it stay looking like that I hope it does and also the whole laptops matte black which is I think that looks dope but that's also usually a fingerprint magnet and you can carry around like a matte black thing you get like all this is grease on it I'm wearing it so like that's a challenge for that laptop but I love it well the other thing about the difference between the keyboard on this versus the keyboard on what I have is I have the Lenovo carbon x1 and what I really like about this is that there's they're not flat they have like a little bit of a like a dip to them so your fingers sit in them a little bit yeah there's a little bit of yeah that's smart I wish more so like you kind of it's easier oh yeah it's easier to touch like when you head exactly like this spot yeah why don't people figure that out I think all of it is just you get used to it like if there is a there's a Google tablet that came out recently with the $200 keyboard accessory that has circular keys and slightly concave but like typing on it was fine and like they claim like oh yeah once you get used to it like the surface area of the key being circular makes it easier to type faster after a while huh I don't know if I buy that yet but maybe if you were secretary and you're really really used to the surface it looks like a typewriter when you just look at it hmm pull that thing up no need a Google what do they call it something tab it came out like the same time the pixel 3 and they're naming is weird with them but it has a yeah basically a surface like like $200 keyboard magnet accessory you can prop it up at any angle and it goes from a tablet to a laptop with this keyboard dock huh and then it's it's kind of interesting but the circular Keys I found weird that Alcantara on the hand rest feels amazing yeah that's really nice yeah I think I get used to that I I've been using a MacBook Pro first long like I the contrast is like I was really used to like having metal and like metal feels premium and good like it's not gonna wear down but I like this a lot well what metal doesn't feel good those on your hands when you're sitting on it for a long time if you're like yeah it is yeah they kind of got them just right where like they wrap the the material around to the sides yeah MacBook Pros literally sharp yeah cuts you card if you put your hands on the edge for too long this Lenovo is carbon fiber nice so this whole thing is it's not cheap tup no it's not cheap yes in comparison to a Mac laptop though it's Jim it is and there's way more options let's the other thing with a Mac you get like a 13 inch you get a 15 inch you get a touch bar or you get nothing yeah what's the matter Jamie takes a little sleep I just had it there the picture changed oh these motherfuckers that's what it's called though pixel sleep okay so those the keys you shake of the keys and that sort of connects to the tablet it's a great accessory like the the Magna on the back like I don't know if you've seen a surface tablet with the lunar extend you kind of have like a couple notches where you can adjust it and I think the new version has infinite adjustment but this is the same thing like there's a magnet in the back of the surface or the pixel sleep lets you adjust the tablet to any angle watch videos type apples the only company that makes keyboards that I know that had it better in like 2012 than they do in 2018 if you get a 2012 MacBook you uh-oh this is kind of better there's more travel yeah you might think it's like an upgrade if they went backwards yeah yeah goofy I don't know how they did that yeah but they're so design oriented I mean everything looks stellar that's what it is Apple has been not a victim of their own desire to make great design but they often very often make compromises sometimes to the detriment of how good a product can be to make it look better mmm classic example was the Mac Pro the little circular trash can looking Mac Pro that came out yeah I need 12 or something like then they kept they made all these promises it's this sleek modern workstation it's gonna have the Xeon chips and big GPUs and I loved it but it only had one fan for a six to seven thousand dollar workstation and they constantly overheated and with throttle and eventually it was a nightmare for them wasn't that something that was going on with the latest laptops with the latest MacBook Pro yeah same thing same thing they made the the I nine the core I nine they put in this super thin laptop they made this laptop so shin and I kept the fan speed so locus so they they just throttled the CPU down so wouldn't get so hot the pad to kick up the fans that high so the actual performance even though the CPU is more powerful was not as good as the last model right that which was lucky to make it look good exactly so yeah Apple has been a victim of their own like desire to make things so beautiful and then they got fucked by Huawei cuz Huawei came along with the mate book and the mate book Pro is really a better version of the MacBook I'm into it yeah fucking nailed it there's no bezels the way that web cam pops up from the bottom not interesting I don't know how exactly it's like on the table level of wherever you're sitting looking up at you that's very odd but yet there's there's a lot of great things about that but pull that thing up mate Book Pro Huawei but meanwhile it's probably spying on you all day long yeah sending information the Chinese government yeah they just found some spy chip and their cell phones oh you're talking about the well there's a couple things that just happened with with chips in hardware there's another thing about Bloomberg report do you see that yeah the chips that came from all these this this server company or this company that makes the chips that sells to all these big companies like Apple and major major companies and now everyone's compromised and I was like nope not true definitely not true don't say of course not us yeah no 100% not us yeah that's that's a really weird story but look at this mate book like the bezels they're almost Nanak resistance say you're challenged orgeous website if you're you're just laptop brother if you're wha-why and you make that now you have to convince people to switch from the Mac books that they love to that yes just on looks alone they could probably do it but then there's all the other features like well it doesn't run Mac os10 do I have iMessage right do I have no all these other things that I like about my Mac this huge touchpad right what does have a huge touchpad yes but I'd say to this day still Apple has the best laptop touch pads the multi-touch stuff the battery life supposed to be excellent as well right yeah how I give it that sharp I mean that shot was perfect cuz that's like all these X's for that yes we have great design we have better ports you only have USB C on a little MacBook Pro we have both sides yes but we have all this stuff we'll give audio to the MacBook Pro it's got bigger speakers whatever but we have a better battery life we have all this better lower price all the stuff and you still have to reconcile with what people love about their MacBook Pros yes Mac os10 well there's that but there's also people love having an Apple product that - they do love that yeah like if someone I guess put an Apple logo on a wowie I want to well you know some comic has a joke about texting a girl and the text message comes back in green and go damn cheap or it's the true thought people have yes people want iMessage like if you're if you're messaging someone and you find out it won't send an iMessage you only send a text message like I was weird oh these they have a flip phone like simply a person I've been on the other side of that like I carry an iPhone but I don't I text people on my android phone so I've never been on the judging side but I wonder about that everyday like really what does it matter like I text you with a green bubble which Apple decided first of all to differentiate iMessage versus text message which is hilarious what who cares like well it does look better it I'm sure they decided to I'm sure in a software update they tweaked that green to make it look extra harsh well you know what it is is they figured out they figured out with pool tables a long time ago like pool tables the cloth generally is green right but when they started playing in professional tournaments they've realized that blue cloth is actually easier on the eyes and you can differentiate differentiate the edges better so a lot of like really high-end professional matches are played on blue cloth now it's like a light blue sky blue cloth yeah I've seen and that's I guess because of the way your eyes work yeah like something about primary colors and the cones and your more contrast sensitive blue something like that I don't know well it's something about the way the way white contrasts with green is not quite as pleasing as white contrasting with blue but it could be the apples fucking with you with the green they'd given you some vomit green make it some brown color next yeah yeah well the color of the app is green well wouldn't they make it blue iMessage the app that button you press to open it is green it's a green logo why not make it blue that's really true yeah what the fuck that's a very good point Jamie why would it be green when your son in blue messages Apple wait you dorks Steve Jobs dead you guys are fucked you know what you're doing okay but the mate book other than that it's supposed to have a better keyboard it's supposed of a keyboard that's probably similar to that surface book and it's supposed to have better battery life Angeles yeah bezel with screen touchscreen higher resolution but you got to deal with Windows 10 which is a little bit of a pain in the ass I gotta admit it's like the updates are almost daily there's something going on with firmware or something going on with this or that or I've gotten used to it mostly though because most of what I do on my laptop is pretty web-based so I'm just living in Chrome or Safari or whatever so it's not a big deal but then yet once I have to go out and I'm gonna go in Lightroom and do some photo work and then like suddenly I'm digging through files and I'm in Windows and it's then you start to yeah like you're different yeah when you first time you have to update a driver like what is it 1996 the fuck is going on here updating drivers I try to get away that yeah it's just they're close though like it's way better than it was five years ago yeah you know what five years ago you would look at Windows you're like this is like some archaic pixelated came from Vista to Windows 7 to Windows 10 Vista was kind of that nightmare and then they kind of couldn't have worked upwards then I started with Windows 95 I used to make my own computers back in my hardcore video gaming days nice I used to go to Fry's Electronics and get motherboards and locks and fans and I started that online so I never went to a physical computer store to buy parts but I would have to do the whole like cross cross-referencing what's compatible with what online and then put together a whole list and then just buy it and then nine boxes show up and hopefully they all work yeah but yeah there's the same experience yeah and SLI video cards and connecting them with that cable and never mess up and break one oh yeah yeah but fixing it makes you feel like you did something well there's something going on when you're like the jumpers for the motherboard and you're moving stuff around and it's it is it was cool yeah and then once you actually got online with a computer you made yourself you like this is yeah something about this hmm and I remember when you used to be able to do that with Apple you used to be able to buy clones yeah I mean Mike so I way back in the day still in high school I had a Dell XPS like 730 I think it was called this huge desktop where again you could like take this CPU cooler out put a new one in it was modular fully and then Apple also made this huge desktop this Power Mac mm-hm or I don't know what it was called at the time but it was again massive you could take the graphics card out put a new one in you could take the RAM out take the CPU out but it was like this this weird system where like they were on like decks and you had to like chunk like take this big metal slot out and then do the CPU there and then put it back in yeah it's really satisfying to like change the hardware and like yeah I did that and right now it's got eight gigs around yeah there's something specially I don't know I think it's a man thing two men like changing carburetors mechanical feel yeah yeah that's probably a lot to do with the two yeah that's it one generation after that cuz that hold that it had like basically like elevator levels to it like the top level and on the bottom level and on the hard drives and the power supply on the top like all that stuff and you can mess with that if you go over someone's house they have that now you're like what the fuck is wrong with you but that's the thing about like that was the most accessible modular desktop Apple ever ever made and now they're making this promise again like alright we listened we know that little trashcan Mac Pro was not good thermally or design-wise for anyone so we're gonna make a modular professional desktop Mac Pro again that's what they said and it's gonna be next year sometime and I keep picturing that I picture them going back to the roots of like a real bona fide desktop because right now the most powerful iMac or Mac you can get is the iMac Pro and you can't even update the RAM in the iMac Pro really I can't update anything that black bro really yeah what you buy is what you get if you buy a $7,000 iMac Pro you will have that spec forever doesn't want you opening anything in that thing so when they say yeah we're gonna make a modular updatable real well designed Apple desktop I'm like I really hope they're doing that like exactly cuz that's I love that do they have regular towers anymore or no everything's in iMac they had that that little trash can and then the Mac Mini which is the longest since they've ever updated it I'm hoping they update it at the event this month but the Mac Mini is the only other tower they made and that's got laptop internals so not really a true desktop so everything is is that just because of technologies advanced to the point where you can kind of fit everything in the big screen of an iMac basically yeah I mean the the iMac they have those desktop internals in it but yeah like you're you're still gonna be restrained by like how closed off that space is how many fans I can fit in there so if they really want to do like a true desktop they gotta open it up and make it huge which is not very like Apple so it's gonna be interesting to see what they do yeah and when is your you at what year is your laptop over there that's an older one right the last one before they added the track bar that's when I glow spec 2015 does yours have a dip at all to the keys it's very small but that's all you need all you need is a very small dip flat as soon as they went with flat they they fucked up there's a company that refurbishes 17-inch MacBook s' yeah the big one the Mac Daddy these have a laptop that was refurbish it and put a like modern CPU in it they put a big SSD drive like one terabyte or two terabyte SSD drive so you deal with a solid-state drive so it's instantly fires much more RAM much more everything yeah that's what they call it desktop replacement laptop yeah I was into that for a while that was like one of my that's actually how I started my channel was I bought a 17 inch laptop now I was trying to figure out which one like strikes the balance of where I want to be with taking it off the dock once in a while and walking around the house maybe but like planting it back here and it's my desktop and it's a 17 inch screen that was where I like started good thing was HP if you're at the airport and you have like a canceled flight you could get a workout in just like on the plane with this this is like a 12-inch screen and every time the guy in front of me leaned back you just like smack my laptop like I had to like move it you really need like a 12 inch a 9 inch screen probably to get away with what that's 12 inches can you flip that around is a 12 a 13 inch screen but it's like a taller three-to-two aspect ratio so it's not like like the smaller 16 by 9 skin would be underneath like where that guy was hitting my screen so most of the bezel seems like it's on the bottom yeah yeah that's hear your chant the bottom here I mean it's pretty pretty good size bezel but like I'm still hoping for like a bezel this laptops like I'm what have you ever thought about going with the wall way uh not really mostly because I switch laptops so infrequently that I was just like if it's not massively better than the MacBook Pro I don't really feel the need to switch this came out on my radar in the last like two weeks and I decided to try it and it's been like worth the shot like I'm really into it I'm probably gonna switch back to the MacBook Pro in a little while once I start to run up against things like this doesn't have USB C which is mm-hmm that's weird that eventually that's gonna bite me and when I do I'm gonna want to switch back but it's like a new Microsoft laptop that doesn't have USB see doesn't really make a lot of sense it doesn't at all why'd you do that I have no idea no one asks right it's a great laptop it doesn't have the charger is this weird like it's not like MagSafe but it's this like slot charger thing where it like goes in and out easily but also doesn't have a card reader also doesn't have really like yeah a lot of things that I kind of hoped a laptop would have so yeah this thing is everything this thing is regular USB USB see this has one horse-sized USB port a headphone jack and what looks like this has HDMI yes does not have I'm a big fan of this thing and then they make a they make a 15-inch version of it as well this is the I guess so what do you do like mostly on the laptop stuff because essentially writing writing and then getting online just online bullshit but yeah no software really I'm not really running anything other than writing programs Microsoft Word which is native right yeah yeah I mean you could probably get away with any number of laps similar laptops just like so at that point you basically like pick the design you like best and if it has the ports you need then you're good but if you find yourself like if I'm a I like to do photo editing a lot and so basically I have to have some way to read memory cards MacBook Pro doesn't it just has a lot of us PC ports so I just have that dongle plug in the USB card reader and then I'm good this one I'll have to get a USB card reader also for it and then get Lightroom and then I'm good you'll have to get a regular USB card reader yeah just like which is 12 years ago a less common still easy to find but like it's kind of dorky eventually it'll be like 2020 and I'm like I don't want this in 2020 yeah that razor pro the razor blade pro that we were talking about what's interesting about that is it has a trackpad on the right hand side like a mouse because if the mouse is on the right yeah and then it has a sonorous keyboard yeah and a mechanical keyboard which I'm a really big fan of I like those clicky with a true true desktop replacement yeah look at that thing yeah there's an acid plus look at all the cool colors I have the 15-inch with the the RGB they love their RGB I still that's your razor thing cuz they have a phone now I don't know the rabbit the razor phone - has RGB glowing backlight it's hilarious but if that's that's their own aesthetic but um what does RGB stand for just red green blue I like like the fact that you can cycle between colors or whatever at any time is almost almost pointless like it's technically a backlight which is useful but other than that you're just kind of you know you get into the gamer aesthetic which is pretty fun yeah it's well it's it's a fantastic thing if you're into games like that thing literally you can play high-end games at very high frame rates and you know I don't know what kind of battery life it has probably not that great it's a 4k with so much juice and so much screen and that's a so that's a fork a laptop with a desktop GPU in it sighs a 4k model versus a full HD mode model and I think the 4k has a lower max framerate so what is the difference in Full HD model so I think it the full HD model is a higher yeah 120 Hertz 1080p or probably 60 Hertz 4k yeah so if you're gaming you'll probably go with the 1080p but then you get your higher frame rates and you'll enjoy games better on that but if your photo editing then you'll probably go with the 4k and you get that desktop power or video editing for example but I don't think the battery life will be very long on a 4k lap that seems hard to imagine it's so big yeah like find out what it says in terms of the battery life like if you're just playing a game and you're not plugged in you're kind of far yeah if you're that if you're that guy you're walking around with the power cable all the time yeah 100% you're walking to a new room plugging it in and then setting up there yeah which is better than a desktop technically but yeah you're walking around with the power all the time yeah better than the desktop technically but is it as powerful as a desktop like if you get a nice gaming desktop almost I think their goal is to get as close to a desktop as they reasonably can and then give you the ability to take it places quickly what does this say about the fucking motherfucker disable every web site ever everybody's pop-ups oh so gross look at this world we live in now why do I want notifications from your website saw a great jiff the other day am I saying that right jiff of like every website where like you go onto this you don't even get to the content it's just three hours 52 minutes battery life for just watching a movie that's 100% you watch a movie and then it's dead yeah that's hilariously low yeah cuz if you watch a movie on a MacBook Pro like you got plenty of juice left after that movies over you might be able to watch three or four movies there's the battery 99 watt hour battery hmm that's actually a huge battery but still yeah that's one of the things that I like about not this model of Lenovo but some of the ThinkPads have a swappable battery that you could swap while that's a while it's on yeah Oh what yes oh yeah he's able to do that yeah that's do that where there's an internal battery and there's an external battery so you pop out the external but which is a big thick band where you want to get the full jammie that goes like 25 fucking hours yeah and if you pop that sucker out you could do it while this is still running you know it doesn't shut off pop the new one in bang hot swapping yeah hot swap it that I haven't had a laptop with that since like like seven years ago probably it's been a long time yeah well I think think pads are mostly business oriented and it's really mostly what people are using them for yeah but it's you know there's that balance of like what are you looking for like are you looking for something they can do everything are you looking for something that's just I mean most people for a lot of people you could really get by with one of those Google Chromebooks it doesn't have much storage at all that's where I'll probably end up getting my parents into a lot like if your parents or grandparents don't really need much of a computer but all they need to do really is email someone maybe go to a website or to watch it online movie you just need a web browser so like a Chromebook is great yeah so much is in the cloud yeah you know I mean so many people keep their photos in the cloud they keep it as long as you have an internet connection you're good you're good but in terms of like local storage yeah that's that's probably one of the things about especially when I was talking about this phone not only does it only have four gigs of ram it also only has 64 gigs of storage that's it there's a 64 in a 128 and there's a lot of phones now that have like 256 512 and then expandable storage via microSD and the reasoning Google is giving which I actually subscribe to is everything just goes through the cloud like the only thing I keep offline is my Spotify library and podcasts so my whole Spotify whatever is like 30 gigs mm-hmm and then whatever podcast I have is a couple more gigs I don't need a 512 gig phone for everything I usually keep offline I have a couple big apps but not really and then all the photos I take get uploaded automatically to Google photos in full resolution and I never really have to keep all of them locally and so every photo I've ever taken and full resolution is on my phone even though I only have 128 gigs of storage now when you use the Google version of like whatever iPhoto is iPhoto upload so everything to the cloud it's really simple when you get a new phone everything loads up to it it's the same thing happens this is good yeah and you can use it on an iPhone which is you don't have to but yeah real photos I have Google photos on my iPhone so every time I take great photos on this phone there on my iPhone oh that is actually not having the app is pretty useful that's nice yeah and I know there's a thing that's one of the things that people really love about iPhones that airdrop feature that's very nice yeah that's one of the best in Apple only features yeah but don't they have an Android there's an Android drop too now I know that because I've used it yes send things from my Samsung phone to my Apple phone possibly so there's it's not like a first party thing so NFC is useful when I want to send something between two Android phones at NFC but this is something I recently I wasn't really using airdrop until recently and then I was like oh wait I do have a Mac and an iPhone I can just transfer files back and forth and I started doing that in the office a lot which we have a bunch of Macs and iPhones in the office so we started like passing files back and forth and then one day I was trying to do it on my Android phone I was like wow this is like a bummer I have to go into like Dropbox and upload it and then download it and it would just this couple extra steps were a pain mm-hmm and it made me really appreciate how good airdrop is but Erdos pretty good it was really good at making things super simple yeah like you know you don't ever really have to update things and until the OS updates and it's pretty rare yeah everything works really good you don't really even worry about viruses or anything like that yeah there's a lot they do that's really excellent yeah but I feel like they're running on the momentum of Steve Jobs maniacal vision yeah there's been a lot of apples changed or apples not the same since since no more Steve which is true obviously but they're also like their momentum like how can you not like they're insane they they're trillion dollar company now they continue to make iPhones that look the same that they did nine years ago like why not you know and if people keep buying them of course they'll probably never have a reason to change it's just a different kind of company now before I mean he was like Gen generally regarded as an asshole like just a crazy yeah whip cracking my can imagine yeah just just a nut like there's that famous thing of him trying to use I forget what the device was but it wasn't used it wasn't working during one on stage yeah I remember that and he threw it yeah he's like it it was casual but it was hilarious it was like it was anger to it though well because someone definitely got fired like within minutes of that happening yeah yeah and that's happened on stage like things mess up on stage like yeah it's gonna happen Oh couple years ago there was an Apple event where I'm pretty sure Steve is on stage trying to get something to work like in a demo and if you ever been or seen like an Apple event like the entire audience it half of the audience is just people typing like blogging like exactly what's going on so they're all connected to the Internet they're live blogging yes I Stevens like get anyone no work but what look at his face this is the thing like back that up a little bit and give me some volume look at this got it well let us first see if we can turn it on today there's an anger that will you know he was like you motherfuckers after the show he was definitely doing oh yeah yeah so there's another event where like something wasn't working and he's like I need everyone in this room to turn your Wi-Fi off so that this will work everyone I need everyone to stop blogging close your laptop's get off the Wi-Fi and then this will work and it was kind of like a a couple minutes of like huh that's funny maybe it's you serious and like slowly like everyone did closer he's like everyone everyone get off the Wi-Fi everyone close your computers right now and this is gonna work what was the issue I don't remember exactly it was must been some Wireless related getting something to loader work but that was pretty hilarious to me I feel like if you want things to operate at the speed of Apple when he was alive you kind of have to be a fucking crazy asshole yeah you have to have that next level first of all you need a vision of what you want it to be mm-hm and then you need to be insane enough to try to get people to do that well he also was according to is this hit right here Oh Safari down yes [Applause] it's a four-minute video but this is yes is failing to load so everyone's using the local Wi-Fi yeah Wi-Fi is just getting taxed yeah then Wi-Fi is getting crushed someone's at Verizon yeah fuck yeah you're just having Wi-Fi issues yeah twenty minutes later and see the demos or we give up and I don't show you the demo would you think everyone's hoping he'll just like try again and they don't have to turn it off yeah look at the end the whole crowd is everyone the only reason they're there is to live blood yeah all right one last tweet because Steve's telling me to turn the Wi-Fi off 30 minutes that's a FaceTime now that's another thing like FaceTime is another proprietary thing that Apple has it's really excellent yep and it's built into the contacts it works perfectly yeah yeah just everyone with an iPhone you can do it with them just pop out I would like that's a massive that and iMessage are like two of the biggest reasons people refuse to even try an Android phone mm-hmm so I'm like all right well clearly googles mission should be to get iMessage on Android right like that should be like a and Apple will never let that happen they know that they can hold people hostage on iOS as long as they want yeah if they can't get iMessage anywhere else yeah things like that iMessage FaceTime airdrop walled garden yep wonderful walled garden a whole video about this whole ecosystem yeah it's real it's a real major advantage yeah it really is and they've got that nailed they really do gules tried to make their own versions of these things too well just like they try to do Google+ and everybody was like yeah good luck with that I have a friend who was an executive Google it was hilarious yeah she was always telling me how great Google+ is like that sheds dead in the water thing is Google+ Google+ even though only like nine people used it it was great I'm sure it's really good like all the things that they let you do that I wish Facebook would let us do of like sharing with certain groups of people and like all these different things with circles it was kind of a shit show with like how they did it but it's good like it was good anyway so it's gonna die now and that's kind of it is killing yeah yeah they had this whole security breech thing which is also a weird story but then eventually they're like you know what we're shutting it down really yeah I want to call my friend up and go haha told you so it's gonna be it's gonna be finally no more Google+ but like Google keeps trying to do this they keep calling it like a universal message service that everyone's like oh I'm message for Android you're gonna make your own great and then make a allo duo Hangouts met like they have all these half the halfway there are things that kind of tie in Android and are sort of like FaceTime and iMessage but not really and it's just not well done and it's not convincing anyone I know there's been some third-party attempts to figure out how to put iMessage on Android phones and that you you can get like some sort of an app that allows you to use iMessage isn't probably really clunky and forty yeah yeah I haven't tried that I haven't either I imagine it's horrible yeah I have the note nine like I said and I was thinking about switching over to it and I was like I'll use this pen I never use that pen once yeah that's that's the thing as a reviewer I'm always trying to figure out what is a real genuine use it everyday feature that's worth paying extra for and what is a cool demo feature that will get you to brag about the phone and show your friends but you'll never use it yeah and I've always been split on the s-pen is that a thing people really use all the time and I've been like kind of somewhat convinced there's people who like yeah I use the s-pen every day I take notes on my phone I use that app and I'm like I try I try I had a this little point where I was like yeah I'm gonna do lockscreen notes every time I want to remember something I'm gonna write it down and I just never got into it so like I'm usually pretty good about like dividing things into buckets of like yes this is something we will use and is worth paying this is dumb but it's really cool to demo and it will just sell people and I never use it again those two buckets are very clear that yes pencil has been in the middle the lockscreen thing is weird too because it doesn't work that smooth the lockscreen knows better yeah it's a little clunky and then you don't just get it right there it saves it to notes you have to go to notes if you go to the Notes app yeah yeah well I what my thought was I'm gonna use this and I'm gonna put my set list on my phone and that where anytime I go to the lockscreen the note set list should be there I just be able to scroll through my set list when I go onstage yeah but it doesn't work not there no I got to go to notes right what is this then yeah yeah so it's just kind of weird halfway there but I want to talk to someone who's like yeah by the note every year because I got to have the pen like that's gotta be out there this that's what I think well one thing that is kind of cool about it that I've never used once but kind of cool about it is the fact that you can use that pen as a remote control that's definitely I take photographs firmly in the second bucket like great demo look I'm halfway across the room taking a selfie that's cool right yeah yeah then you'll never use it I never use it and then also using it as a remote control for music yeah and for video you can map it to all kinds of crazy things it's actually a really well thought out feature it gets Bluetooth and the S Pen has its own battery now so you let the battery in the phone and it charges the stylus very quickly in a couple seconds you get like half the battery like it's really well-thought-out yeah but am I ever gonna use probably not yeah the battery is huge too it's got a four thousand milliamp battery as opposed to the iPhone which is what thirty even the big ones like a 31 at 3200 is that that little yeah but I mean like iPhones have never needed that the number on paper to be big to be well optimized because of software yes but they've done tests where they did benchmark test between the note and the iPhone X what does it match a tenant's 10s max yeah it's not the the note crushes it yeah yeah no Samsung is getting better with optimization too which is awesome that they crush it they they used to be kind of scared of batteries in the notes but they finally gotten better at that and they're they're doing really well it's amazing that they bounce back from that at all cuz people fucking died and then see I don't think anyone died well some one guy I don't know what happened to him but there was a famous guy was a tech guy who died because his battery exploded in his house caught on fire and he died in the fire really I don't know what phone II was using though he was some some I don't think it was the note cryptocurrency guy not follow the note pretty closely because that was I had a couple of them just because like I was in the middle of reviewing it and using it I carried one every day starts getting banned starts getting caught on fire you can't fly with it like I followed that all very closely and all of you the cases of because it started off with not only were the notes sevens starting to explode but they started recalling them and sending people replacements and then The Replacements started to explode point I was like this is amazing I need to follow this very closely uh he had a blackberry and a Y way and they don't know which one exploded probably one way problems assassination I know has a weird actually was a CEO it's a cradle fund CEO nazrin Hasan mmm-hmm yeah and it caught his whole house on fire yeah he died after smartphone's pulled and catches fire in his bedroom that is a really extreme yeah yeah so that we're to go they can't mess around so like once that's when your phone starts exploding and your Samsung like you have to get you have to fix that there was a famous video of the guy who parked his car in the driveway and put his phone in the charger and left it there and he came outside to his car bursting into flames his whole car was on fire especially in a gas car with right yeah luckily it wasn't in his garage his driveway that is no fuck yeah it's amazing they've bounced back from that though because they really have yeah they're actually it's that's been impressed with their reputation so like in the reviewer community of like I watch over all my friends videos about the note when it came out we stopped making explosion jokes this year I noticed that like we the Galaxy Note 7 had all the explosion jokes note eight came out all the explosion jokes last year it exploded guys so what have they done this year that's better now we're on no nine and I think we're kind of over it mmm two years that's how long it well that's today though I mean did this the short cycle of news today like things come and go so quickly but I wonder if that would have happened to an iPhone mmm what kind of nightmare that would have been I also think there's probably no way it would have happened to an iPhone like you would think there's no way what happened to Samsung but somehow it did but like there's this whole process of like getting a battery supplier for your phone and then it's trusting their quality testing and then using that supplier for your manufacturing and all that and I don't know how different that process is for Samsung versus other manufacturers like Apple but it just seems like Apple would never let that sort of oversight slip right hmm I wonder but if it did how crazy would that well samsung comes out new phones way quicker right they so they come out with phones more often but they update their lineups at the same rate like once a year for note mm-hmm and also once a year for Galaxy S but since they're six months apart it looks like they made four new phones so we're gonna get a new phone every April Galaxy S ten will come out in April and then they all get Galaxy Note in September right well it's only six months well that's part of a different lineup so like galaxy s is every year galaxy knows every year they have all these other lineups so they make a lot more phones for sure and are they still doing the sport because they have that sport model active yeah I think they are still it's not nearly as special seeming to them as it used to be they used to really like put out separate commercials for it and they they'd have like all this hype I remember like galaxy s7 active was a big deal yeah I don't even know if there is a galaxy s nine active I don't believe there is it was a rumor that it was coming out and that it was gonna be completely waterproof and shock resistant it's gonna have a rubberized case right and it was going to have an enormous battery life that they haven't released it the nine was gonna have the same size battery as the note 9 but the regular size 9 screen so four thousand milliamp battery but in the s9 screen right which would been massive yeah I mean that's just that would have been incredible I guess people just didn't buy it as much yeah I don't think people knew about it I think it's one of those deals yeah I love battery life I'm always scared that my phone's gonna run out of battery I know it's ridiculous cuz it very rarely does but I'm always like fuckwit runs out of battery yeah when I hear about like the iPhones battery not being so good I like I've heard that the the X s regular has better battery life than the XS max because the max has the larger screen I think the I think they're about the same I think a standby time on the 10 s max is better because of the bigger battery but when you do use your screen a lot they kind of diminish down to the same number I think and this iPhone 10 R which I've just started using seems to have a battery battery like them both of them this is the less this is the $750 IPS LCD version of the iPhone 10 yeah the colors and all that now how much of a factor is that in everyday use do you notice the difference battery life ya know that the image quality not being as good with the different screen yeah that's the only factor right of the internal components the same they are the same there's one gig less of RAM weirdly but yeah all the rest the internals so what is a standard one have six so four gigs of RAM in every world I'm still yeah and then three gigs in the 10r and then also one camera instead of two and then an aluminum rail on the side I call it a rail but the outside is aluminum instead of stainless steel so the iPhones got this shiny stainless steel outside the yeah the screen is still pretty decent I know everyone likes to trash on it cuz it's only 8:28 it's like a 720p screen roughly this is the are the are but like using it or just looking at it it looks fine like an Apple iPhone 8 yeah exactly it's the same pixel density as an iPhone 8 which is fine for most people so if you get too caught up on the number which is not the typical iPhone 10 our buyer then it's gonna look bad but if you just look at the screen and use it which is most people walking in a store and just say hey this looks fine and it's $250 cheaper I think I'll just get this one that's my thing the 10r is gonna be a great seller for Apple yeah it sounds like it now when you switch to those battery pack cases that's now you have a brick in your pocket that's huge yeah that's a big phone already too so a 6.1 inch screen on that 10 R and then this big battery on the back yeah it's just gonna be massive yeah I don't know I mean I haven't seen any excess max with a case that has a battery in it but cheese I wouldn't even try but it's great if you go on a trip somewhere and you might be in some janky place that doesn't have yeah like a travel version yeah it's just big old brick case yeah we're not a case person yeah you don't have any cases online onto cases yeah but you switch phone so often even if you drop them that's one pop a SIM card out I still take good care of my phones people I call you get a new phone every two weeks you might be right but I still take really good care my phones I actually did kind of getting out of my car this slid out of my pocket which is kind of a nightmare and it took one bounce before I like sort of half caught it so I got this little scratch on the corner mmm that's a Google phone Google phone but it's fine so I always question people that don't have cases like oh you're one of those people my friend Andrew Santino he doesn't put a case on anything and I he didn't have like a good he was a more design person he's like look how beautiful this is one case in this that's part of it but Neil deGrasse Tyson had a really interesting perspective he said he takes his case and he flips it around in his hand constantly and he said if you go to like you watch like cadets when they're learning how to handle guns they're spinning their gun around and catching a hose why do you think they're doing that they're doing that so that they're always able to catch their gun no matter what you have that they have so he takes his phone and he flips it around his ham he's always it yes like a cadet that's awesome my phone and he showed me he was like flipping in between his fingers like oh I like see but that's him he's got this next-level thought process behind everything that's fair not having a key so that means he's not a case person he's always got his phone yeah that's fine I a clear case and the reason why I like it is because it's more grippy in your hand just there's more to it I phone Slippery iPhones are the slipperiest phones they're the way they're shaped they have the stainless steel and then they kind of just melt into this like orb shape and it's by far the most common like slide out of my pocket phone is the iPhone this phone has never slid out of my pocket obviously and the oneplus yeah you said that that was your favorite phone before the Google pixel 3 yep what why do you like the pixel 3 better than that phone cuz I've heard great things about the oneplus yeah I love the oneplus still and I would have no problem using it today but this camera is so much better than every other phone yeah now is that because you take a lot of photos for YouTube and blogging and that kind of thing yeah just socialite a lot of photos I have Instagram a lot of photos and I that much better yeah that much better yeah then the one plus which is already a 600 hour phone and is in the 1 plus what I mean that the Galaxy Note 9 is supposed to have a very good camera as well I can't tell the difference I'm not so you most people won't until you put them next to each other and then you kind of go oh interesting there's a much like when you put an iPhone photo next to a pixel photo iPhones have notoriously great cameras pixels have notoriously great cameras you might be totally fine with either one but if you put them next to each other you will notice massive differences between the photos yeah so did you do this comparisons that are online that we could pull up right now my last one I compared a pixel 2 to iPhone 10 to 1 plus 5t to 2 other phones I did like a 5 camera blind test and what I did was I put the five photos next to each other but didn't tell you which one is which maybe C D or E and you go down the list and I have like 7 8 9 photos in a row ABCDE pick your favorite one a lot of people went with be a lot of people went with D and they didn't know which one it was not the end I revealed which one was which and a lot of people were surprised by which one that picked oh well I picked the pixel over the iPhone every time really interesting and a lot of times when you put them side-by-side you'll notice like iPhones like to boost the shadows a lot more so that they're much more real it yeah this is okay it's so like ABCD in E which one do I like better hmm and I already can tell immediately which one is a pixel and you might not because Iraq I remember pixel 2 had cooler colors and more contrast than any other one and it's a yeah so another thing about these is it helps to see it in a high resolution because the difference in detail and sharpness between them is another thing I paid attention to which ones II I want to say that was the oneplus but I forget no I'm pretty sure B is the pixel cuz this great backpack is starting to look a little bit blue and I was a big characteristic of the pixel - from last year right and that was a big issue with the screen as well right the to the like so yeah look at this contrast like you see like all these are like pretty good but when you see B and you see how much more contrast that has and you look at a and how much it lifts in the shadows yeah he's got he's got a pretty even tone and he's also the one plus I don't remember what he is I'd have to go back to the video she switched him around with everyone every time it was the same a is the same every time B is the same every time I know I'm I'm already pretty sure that B is the pixel go to it go to the top left one with the selfie hmm so again like that gray sweatshirt is starting to look blue and be right in II look how much higher brighter those shadows are like my black hair looks kind of gray at that point in that one so there's a lot of things you don't notice until you put them side by side hmm god that's so nitpicky they all look so good they all look pretty much like the same and see never see your little poster up yes he is a little bit tighter so I'm gonna go see is the iPhone because the iPhone has has a little bit of a tighter selfie camera a lot of Android phones have a wider angle selfie camera because he can fit more people in them but Apple has always told me they go with a tighter angle because there's less distortion and they want to feel more natural you just take a picture of yourself and you look great hmm here we go iPhone X No okay so you know it to enhance oh boy I did add a real camera into the into the mix have my real camera was pretty fucking good yeah I hope so it's $10,000 that's a real camera film or is that videos well it's a photo so it's a medium format 50 megapixel not supplied x1d it's a crazy camera iPhone actually it's pretty goddamn good right there it does but there's just a little bit more to the pixel to pixel to has so this is a portrait mode comparison so I remember I was trying to test like the blurry background versus an actual good camera mm-hmm and whenever you look at these portrait mode photos what they're doing is they're sort of trying to outline the subject keep it sharp and then blur the background are definitely and year after year they've gotten better at this because the fall-off between the blur isn't just like a cutout in real life you get sort of like a gradient of how much blur you have so a pixel too has typically the sharpest cut out and the best like separation between the background where the iPhone kind of just takes the face keeps the face sharp and then sort of has a more natural fall off so your body might not be in focus and Note 8 it's just not as good yeah in that image that's a really that in that one you really see how good the pixel 2 is yeah like that and 3 got better at that actually yes so and now you can change something note was doing last year you can change how blur the background is so I've known 10s now pixel 3 Note 9 all of them you can change how blurry the background is now I notice you have an Apple watch on them I do hmm that's smart watching the game which is by a lot a lot yeah hmm that's why I'm an iPhone person really because of the the watch I carried two phones all the time an Android phone of choice and an iPhone of choice so my android phone of choice is my pixel that's the main number the main phone I usually use and my iPhone of choice I carry because there's still things that iPhones do better and I always carry whatever the my iPhone is a lot of things it's media related it's like whenever I'm a are dropping like when I'm publishing a video on the go like I have the thumbnail from airdrop on this phone but just things like snapchat and Instagram Instagram stories Instagram live a lot of apps with camera stuff are better optimized on the iPhone than they are on any Android phone because they're built for iPhone so I carry an iPhone and the best SmartWatch is the Apple watch tres4 so I wear now for series 4 because it's good it's really good but you don't get text messages on your Apple watch then now I don't but I do want them yeah kinda I would love to be able to use a smart watch this good with my android phone I still haven't found one that good but I'm mainly amusing this for fitness tracking now which is kind of entertaining just like keeping track of workouts and calories and standing hours and all the stuff it does to pretty clear yeah this I was talking to you before the show about the sober October fitness challenge we're doing is the first time I've ever worn a heart monitor and then the seen actual scores yeah there's a real crazy motivating factor of seeing an actual number the game of gamifying of fitness is really entertaining to me and it's what's kept me like I've usually don't wear a SmartWatch for very long but I think it's been about a month and I just keep like so there's a feature net where you can challenge people to a one week long challenge to whoever burns the most calories and has the most points or whatever is like a point system right and that gamification of fitness has been I think pretty special it's been pretty good well this contest has been really crazy with me and my friends so what are you trying to do well we if the winner is going to get a belt like a WWE style belt nice it says intergalactic sober October champion and it has like marijuana leaf or the line through it and a bottle of booze aligned through it and you wear these things it's uh it's called a my zone and it it works with an app it works pretty good and it registers your amount of your heart rate the amount of calories you burn and it gives you a point system and the point system is I don't know what it what they call its MEP ass I don't know what it stands for but this the amount of points over the month is what everyone's shooting for right and so today we're at October the 23rd so we have 8 days to go and I have worked out more in these 23 days than I have in like the last six months and I'm not exaggerating yeah I put in five and a half hours yesterday hard I got more than 900 points then after the podcast I said fuck it we're gonna go for another hundred and I worked out and I got another hundred points put in another hour yeah it's maniacal because you see you actually see the number and because I can see the number I can see all my friends numbers yeah and I'm Way ahead so I'm what I'm just keep telling them I'm twisting the blade because I'm so far ahead like right now fifteen hundred points away from everybody else Oberth trying to work out again that slob so when you see somebody catching up you're like oh I better hit the gym yeah and so I'm planning on staying so far ahead that they must die in order to beat me the iPhone or the Apple watch when you have people connected with the fitness part of it it will literally notify me when one of my friends has finished a workout and tell me like how good their were how many points they just got like as they finish it like you hit the finish button and you know everyone's getting a notification yes that's interesting so I'm gonna put in the extra four or five miles on the bike so if they get that notification that I did that and that really does work yeah I mean there's no doubt about it yeah just having that external motivating factor and then seeing a number there's something about like with this with the MEPS M EPS whatever the fuck that stands for that stands for and I don't know how the Apple watch measures points either I think there's a because it's measuring I mean there's a lot of sensors in this thing so not only is a heartrate monitor there's an accelerometer and a gyroscope so it knows when you're standing knows when you're moving quickly and I it basically just comes up with a points number at the end of the day I every time I fly I just don't get any points cuz I just sit there right but yet there's like a live counter constantly going of like you and your friends and you got to have the highest number so out of all the stuff that you do different my own effort points that's what it is that's the maps points but here's the thing about that Maps points and we were trying to figure out why it does it gives you the same amount of points for 80% of your max heart rate as it does for 90 so like the first day I said I'm just gonna sprint and try to bury these guys so I put them in 90 percent for 35 minutes I was like they can't do that I'm just gonna do some shit they can't do but it doesn't give you any more points for 90 percent 90 percent gives the exact amount of points is 80% so it's they're unprepared yeah I see those two they're fires piece of shit so it's so dumb so I think the reason why they did that is to keep people from killing themselves that's what I think yeah just get somewhere in the 80 to 90 brain fat Burt is always in the two and three fat Burt never gets in yellow that slob he's just bottled it around waddling around with blue and green mostly gray he gets a lot of gray he'll get gray for hours just waddle and complaining thinking about vodka dreaming about food he's gonna watch doesn't hit the gym I mean he's on the gym right now he's a gym right now I'm trying to catch up so he's playing catch-up yeah the thing you just stay ahead he's gonna stay ahead but yeah when you fall behind in the distance you think of them as wolves barking in the distance chasing you like no fucking way you're not eating me bitch wolves 10 miles away are not gonna get you but wolves a hundred yards away they got to keep the distance 10 mine way too far 10 miles it you want to hear you wanna be saying at least just slob he's gonna double everything I do look at that fat face that's not even possible stop I throw up the dog he's so far behind it's impossible to win but that's the point the point is to keep the keep the boot on his neck yeah this is this only does seven-day challenges so you basically like you get you start it and they accept and then it counts for the next seven days all your cumulative points um well that would be good then you just do four and you just keep going yeah you're over yeah I like the challenge aspect of it it's it's really I mean all jokes aside it's been really fun yeah with my friends poor Tommy bunts way behind know what's going on Tom Segura is way behind he's like 1,800 points behind storing them up is he like saving a couple days might be might be sandbags full strength all day you sort you store them up and you're in this device and then you sink so you could pretend that you're not doing any work I could sandbag yes no one knows then the last day you like you son of a bitch I was online he's 10,000 points ahead a real issue so the key is just keep the work rate at an almost impossible level so like yesterday like I said I worked out five and a half hours and then another hour yeah and today I've already put in two hours and put in two hours at 7 o'clock this morning so hotel room doesn't have any the thing is I'm putting two hours in at yellow I'm hitting 80% for two hours fat birds out there waddling around with his dog pretending he's working hard making videos that's he's got like gray and a little bit of blue he may be green a little green and then he takes a break cries lower than mine that's a fact I worked out more yes last night and this morning than he has in the whole day the other thing notes that my problem when I I play frisbee so I take the watch off when I play because it's a wrist thing I'm constantly like mute a play like like that frisbee disc ultimate ultimate frisbee yeah so I take it off every time I play and I know that's thousands of points that I'm missing out on what is disc golf versus Ultimate Frisbee different disc golf is what it sounds like there is you play 9 or 18 holes and you're throwing and walking up to the frisbee no are you throwing a frisbee yeah get an air son so Ultimate Frisbee is different ultimate frisbee you can think of as kind of like football slash basketball it's throwing that frisbee with the left and the right hand yes mostly one end sometimes you throw a little off and why don't you switch the sucker to the left hand it's I don't know there's something about wearing something on my wrists of like throwing and catching that is just not you're so serious about it you want to lose points yeah I I really had to wear it for a week to get oh you really playing competitive yeah so this is all appreciate as all pro highlights but you guys are pro there's professional Ultimate Frisbee now and you're playing professionally I'm playing professional Ultimate Frisbee whoa this actually looks really fun yeah was it oh there's a lot of is that you 2016 Eastern Conference Defensive Player of the Year damn baby marques gonna get some wood you have big hands it probably helps in this sport right definitely ah this is a fun play look at this I want o snatch that guy that I just roofed scored like 15 points against the second it's called which is a lot I roof roof is that ultimate frisbee there's all kinds of yeah you can say that term for a common one is you skyed someone but roofed I like because it's a disc and to buff his head yeah whenever you Moss somebody what is that when you Moss someone like like Randy Moss oh my granny ma throwing up for football and his chest is that you're like you're like head level right that's what mossing someone looks like but there's other words for it so you might root someone I can't believe you're doing this without your sensor arm would you cuz you're so serious about it someone cuz yeah you're losing so many points Wow do you do any strength and conditioning to prepare for this yeah so the season is a couple months long so yes I am we're in the offseason now the season just ended so we're just basically rebuilding I lose like 15 times during the season so I'm like putting that back on now you get to like tryout season in like February or March and then you just start yeah getting your throws back getting your cardio back and starting to work into it and then the season starts I would think that like leg strength an explosive power like doing box jumps and things along those lines would be huge for you yes so there's different like sort of like basketball or football there's different sort of types of players you can sort of diff there's so many things to explain with Frisbee there's a throwers and catchers you might call them so handlers and receivers a lot of shorter faster people who aren't as explosive but are really really quick are our handlers and I'll go around the squirrel around and they'll have awesome strengths and they'll be able to throw anywhere but they won't necessarily go downfield and try to go score on someone because they're not as tall or as explosive meanwhile a lot of cutters or receivers are you can think of sort of like a wide receiver in football they're going downfield in there the athlete's going and making plays in the air and they're hard to guard downfield but they're not necessarily scrolling around throwing a lot they're mostly just catching dumping it off to another thrower and then going for some more yards again so if you watch a game unfold it's very fluid you constantly switch between offense and defense like basketball you're scoring in an end zone and then the points over and then you pull again to start but as the points going on you kind of notice like certain players are mostly doing certain things like mostly throwing mostly getting the disc back other people are mostly going downfield threatening deep there's a lot of terminology how'd you get involved in this the high school I went to Columbia High School invented this sport in 1968 well I had a very competitive team for the years that I was there and I made a lot of friends on the team started playing I played for the JV team for the first two years and then I played for the varsity team my second two years so it was a pretty serious program and we played against other high schools around the country we traveled we flew whoa play against we had rivals in Massachusetts and Connecticut and all these other schools and then we had the big Eastern Championship at the end of the high school season that was that's what we all played for we went 11 straight state championships the two years that I played that's incredible yeah I did not know that this was even a thing you know there's a rich history to it yeah 58 yeah 50th anniversary this year that is so crazy I would never guess we said one was Ultimate Frisbee invented I would said like a couple months ago yeah so the Pro League just is less than 10 years old so there's always been this sort of Club you think of club soccer like area teams there's always been that so I've played for the New Jersey Garden State Club team for much longer than I play for any pro teams and that's generally what players take the most seriously the club championships were this past weekend the New York area team beat the San Francisco area team to win nationals like that's generally what people care the most about but it's not very spectator friendly so what we've sort of created is the ADL is the American ultimate disc league it's a pro version of frisbee it's mainly the same sport but a little bigger field and a little bit faster play just because they shortened the stoppages and have referees and everything now and their is selling tickets and selling merch and jerseys and and like broadcasting games and they have a pro championship at the end of the year so that's that's been like a whole new thing for frisbee players to pay attention to and I've I've played for a pro team as well as past couple years and it's been pretty fun well I buy it because I mean just watching that clip was really exciting yeah it looks fun and you guys aren't getting any brain damage yeah it's about the same level of contact as basketball I would say perfect so you're not like throwing elbows or anything like that there are fouls so you got to be careful about where throwing your body around but your that's gonna happen cuz people are running at each other but exactly you're not worried about tackles or anything I tried the cross that was not it's ridiculous people hit each other with sticks yeah fuck all that there's a lot do you mess around with VR at all yes a little bit I have a DC vive and that's been the most common use of VR we have a vibe in the studio and the two games that come into mind the most are called super hot or if you play that no and beat Sabre I try to play but my kids dominate this the VR thing yeah they come in here and like get out of here they push me away and there's a lot of there's there's a lot of fun stuff so I like so so super hot is a fun one it's a shooting game strategy game type of thing mm-hmm so you're so the way super how again you're in VR so you're wearing this thing and it's a bunch of stick figures trying to kill you and they're running downstairs running around corners shooting at you trying to kill you but time only moves when you move so if you hold still you can look around and like see in the headset where people are and sort of evaluate like okay I can I can pick up this object and hurt somebody with it this is it right here yeah this is a very crude looking video yeah it's super basic again stick figures trying to kill you but it's like a strategy game in that you sort of have to evaluate where you're at and not look around too much and then as soon as you start to move and throw things everyone else is trying to kill you so and so you can sort of dodge bullets as they come around because you don't move when you see them flying through the air there's a lot of cool stuff to this game so I got really into it I didn't get to this level which is probably yeah you got to dodge all these bullets flying at you turn around throw something at them there's a a boxing game well there's several boxing games but ER yeah that are really good Wow and there they give you a workout because there's a guy in front of you and he's throwing punches and you're bobbing and wheels are like full speed punching at him yeah yeah and they look good like it looks like like like you're in the ring and the guy's looking at you he's mean mugging in throws punches your way and when you get hit you see a flash of white okay yeah I try that now yeah it's really fun but I think with the with the haptic feedback suit especially if you could put something there it is right here at a new one this is others a new one to create video casts on your mouth Oh see rock new Rocky movie you can block yeah follow up damaging right thank you get Rocky's your chair in this look at this that's but when you're doing it like we we did it out here in the hallway my feet were hurting because I was moving and shifting left and right and throwing punches and bouncing off of my toes and after it was always like to my fucking feet are exhausted yeah and you're doing the drills in there yeah more so than it would be if I was actually sparring huh because it was actually sparring I don't think I would I don't think it would throw as many punches in such a quick succession yeah you'd be more worried about getting hit back and actually getting punched but when you're doing it's really interesting Wow no there's also the is this in the button HTC vive - yeah this just came out for all of them okay yeah the other one the other one is called beat Sabre and it's a you can think of it as like guitar hero but you're holding like lightsabers as well my kids love that I got past you I love that and things are flying that year and you're hitting them yeah that that is a really well done yeah there's a bunch of really well done once there's a there's a great one that you're in a castle and you have an old-school bow and arrow and this is almost like South Park look at monsters right yeah and they're like it's still kind of cartoony but like your graphics are crisp enough that you like feel like you're a cartoon yeah yeah it's it's really cool and you know like there's actual physics to the arrow like when you shoot it's like you have to lift your arm up to get the arc of the arrow correct to hit it things yeah you know yeah it's good I so I I think about VR a lot just because as a video maker you're making content for the platform that people view it on and we started to get this little creeping up of like 360 videos getting really good and like interesting applications of 360 video and it's still kind of early and I don't really know if it's gonna take off or it's it was just this like medium stepping-stone format to what might be a more immersive thing or maybe just a are is gonna be way better I don't I don't know yet but I pay a lot of attention to it just cuz it's it's new yeah ar is fascinating as well I mean we discussed what was it magic leap is that what it was the Microsoft one that's the other one hololens is Microsoft and then magically does its own thing I haven't tried either actually yet and which one was the one where the ballerina was dancing in your hand magic leap but which one is that the one that people are saying is kind of vaporware sort of I would imagine that that screen on that phone would have some sort of similar ID technology it's like light-filled technologies yeah talk about that doing weird stuff with your eyes it's weird so this phone has a what are they calling it I'm not I'm gonna come remember what they're calling it Oh sir I need Wi-Fi for it actually it's got a 3d screen a glass is less 3d here's the and you you basically has a 3d screen and you look at media on it and it's supposed to sort of pop out at the top yeah doesn't have to be lower case who's the lower case no doesn't I want is it this is t ballon yeah but basically it's about it you can look like that but you can't have things actually popping out above the screen so things on the screen will look 3d but anything like outside of the screen won't it's kind of hard to explain Wow and so this is for video games or for other things as well so at this point in what they're trying to do is have media like photos and videos pop out like pop out so not just games they're gonna have games as well but they have shared with me a couple of like media files that are like a good use of the 3d and I'm curious what you think of them because they're definitely like a stretch what if I totally Gramm me holla holla graphic is the word they use but it's it's hard to explain and it's kind of trippy whoa dude this is weird and there's there's different like so there's a movie trailer version of it where there's like things coming towards you and I think that's maybe the best use of it I've seen it's impossible to show on camera I've tried many different times no this will never show up on camera this yeah this is odd yeah this year like people have to make stuff for this so any Content you have to shoot for for view they call it for view or they can take existing content and convert it to for view but that's a little less successful usually but the cameras on the back they have two cameras on the back and you can shoot for view with the cameras on the hydrogen it's crazy well what I'm looking at right now is topographic maps yeah Wow amazing man so there's it's it's hard to tell again like I try to separate things into buckets of this is something you're gonna use every day and love or this is a total gimmick that you'll never use again and I am me I started with it in the bucket of this is kind of like a gimmick but they've put so much effort into making it good and all these different conversion techniques and let's see if I can find a clip but they've they've been constantly changing the algorithms and adjusting it and updating it to look better that it's starting to convince me that it might be like worth paying attention to for more than just the first two seconds this is amazing what do you think you would like use it all the time no never use it now but still many but it's still pretty cool it's it's very cool but how much better is it than regular video that that and how long can you like look at it before your eyes started right tweak a little yeah I'm already going like but it looks good it definitely looks really good it looks cool it's kind of interesting yeah but so you can take you can take photos and videos with the camera on the phone that are in this 3d and that's maybe the best use of it cuz you can see like what's actually in the room around you the way it would show up in like a direct translation how much of an impact does it have on storage size uh not much I mean there's still video files in there like big 4k videos but they're not necessarily twice as big or anything like that it looks cool but but that video looks pretty cool too when you go into the viewfinder and you go from 2d to 3d then he can take photos and videos of things in that format so if you take if you take a capture and then look at it and you kind of like move the phone around a little bit it's kind of like shimmery in a weird way but kind of 3d sort of it's very hard to explain yeah you'd have to look at this through this thing like you would never be able to show this to someone in the video yeah exactly like I'm looking at these plastisol little figurines and as I move forward and backward you really get a sense of 3d yeah that's a pretty badass so I gotta figure out how to show it in the video of like you can't I just have to describe it use my words god that's amazing yeah and that's it well it's probably coming that's probably coming it's probably gonna be something we're all gonna have to deal with yeah I'm interested if you ask red they tell ya it is the future everything is gonna be like this I'm like you have to say that there's my reading movies were a big deal yeah get those stupid glasses and yeah I mean that was so their claim is like yes this is what's it's genuinely good like you can use it in portrait and landscape glasses let's 3d is usually only one way or the other cause of polarization so this is a lenticular technology I don't know exactly how it works but you can use it in portrait or landscape you can play games with it and things will react in depth of space on in the game well the first video that you show me is really interesting too because it's essentially like a topographic map yeah so it's like say you're paying attention to depth yeah you're looking at the layers of the mountain and the hillsides yeah so it yeah this actually was kind of weirder like seeing these little figurines and moving towards them in real life yeah yeah that's what I think is that's the best way to calibrate tier-i like what it's doing around if you just look at like a video of it you're like all right it looks 3d like it's coming at me and they had a couple like a movie trailer type of thing we're like again like it was mostly shot for this format and things would like kind of go past you and the speakers are also really good so they have this sort of a 3d conversion technique for audio as well where it sort of goes behind you but yeah it's definitely interesting yeah did you mess around with Google glasses when they first came out I did yeah yeah what did you think okay this is this is gonna be something I guess I probably did I it was glass was weird it was ahead of its time but also like not really yeah like I I had it I was in college also so I was like I can't wear it to class or like walk around I guess I could walk around Hoboken with it but the whole idea of an augmented reality this little screen that I could just check the weather and then look back down or check my text and look back down was like it could be cool but also if you look at someone wearing Google glass it's like that guys wearing Google glass you you can't get around it well people would get angry at people for wearing it had a camera filming me what are you doing yeah yeah so that was another thing as I tried I won't even say the name but like another like much newer version of that where again it was like a small projection to a prism that would you could see but no one else could and it would fit into something that looked more like regular glasses so had a battery it had everything but it didn't have a camera and you still had a screen that you could look up into the corner - hmm and I was like wonderful notice the difference between regular glasses and I went down and I like met the guys who were showing it to me in the lobby and immediately I was like that guys wearing it I can see it I could feel a little light in his eye I can see like that the extra thick glasses so it was like it's it's an interesting concept and I don't know where it goes from here if it has to be glasses based or if we'll eventually have some sort of a chip in or I or what the deal is what what the next move is but it's a cool concept yeah it's one of those things that sort of it's kind of been flirting with like for the longest time people thought virtual reality was going to be I mean there was virtual reality concepts 20 years ago yeah and people thought virtual reality was going to be the future and then it it took a long time for the hardware to catch up I think augmented reality has a more promising immediate future just because it's more useful yeah but the virtual reality has like the immersion factor going for it the problem is you have to make all you have to make a whole world so augmented reality is just like some layer on top of your current world so you get like a little screen or whatever or you look at one particular thing and it looks different from real life that's easier to build for virtual reality you have to build the whole world that you use step into yeah that's like a much much deeper layer of immersion which is great to step into but also hard to make so that's the difference I think I'm more into AR at the moment well I think they are in the sense of having all the functions of your phone in front of you in the air or when you call upon them yeah kind of movie yeah like a like one someone in a movie or like Iron Man even like they just like women like us a sheet of like this in front of them and like close it only they could see that like maybe that's the future and have some hey Siri type you know hopefully not demand yeah it's not that good it works for some things it's okay I have something Siri Google assistance better though yes yeah yeah see there well there's the have you tried Bixby that's yes easy Norris Bixby sucks he's pretty bad yeah but Bixby does a few things okay like it checks flights okay makes me has like Bigsby I think it's hilarious because it shows how good it can be and then it isn't good like it it has a couple of things that it can definitely do better than any other assistant but what it can dig in locally on Samsung phones and like do strings of commands you can say hey Bixby open my Settings app turn my brightness halfway down and turn my Wi-Fi off and it'll do all that well and Syria and Google assistant won't do that but if you say hey Bixby how tall is like the Statue of Liberty it might not really like it's really bad at a lot of basic things so yeah Google assistant I think is the most complete and useful I genuinely use it all the time Siri I mostly triggered by accident and then I wonder if it's better and it isn't what's offensive the Bixby has a button yeah hey come on why and you can't remap an unreal big speed button that you accidentally press all the time yeah it's pretty bad yeah the iPhone Siri button gets pressed a lot but what I really like about the pixel is the squeeze yeah you can try it off do you use it like this is it actually the assistant yeah while I mostly use the hey Google trigger which is like map to my voice so and see it turns on now that I said it oh wow but I started using the squeeze a little more so I don't have to yell and I can just squeeze it and say a commander question mostly a question now do you use any the home feature things like to use Alexa or the Yahoo home or first thing I got into my home was Google home so now I have a Google home home if I had Alexa first thing I probably would had an Alexa home with things that work with Alexa but they genuinely like usually work with each do your lights work with it and also what I have is I have a nest thermostat and I have a nest security camera and I think that's it and I had smart lights but I stopped using him so it's mostly just the nest stuff and I can ask what the temperature is upstairs and then say hey change the temperature to this and it'll do it so I don't have to run out and find the thermostat and changing myself I remember hearing that Bill Gates had some pin that you would put on when you entered into his home and when you go into certain rooms if you had a pin on it would recognize oh it's bill bill likes the temperature at this level he likes this art on the wall so he did have LCD screens that would display different images that's almost too much modularity like I I kind of I like a general state of like things are the same unless I want them to change mm-hmm that would be kind of weird like every time you leave the room the art changes behind you I mean you walk back in and it changes back again it's kind of a lot but yeah like just like a couple things like I have the Google home app where I like yeah change the temperature once in a while or you could there's this thing I've considered getting the ring doorbell yeah which has a camera but I don't really use the doorbell that much it's mostly packages get delivered to work instead of homes yeah yeah the Alexa and the Google home they're like what the big concern that people have that's listening to you all the time there was a store that I read about there was a murder investigation and that they were trying to get the records of Amazon Alexa while you know this murder investigation was going on because they think they could have listened to the conversation and then people like wait a minute this fucking thing just listening all the time yeah well it is but it's not yeah if you get murdered do you don't want anybody get away with it do you true yeah there's a lot yeah it's got a listen like so the whole privacy thing I obviously have to think about that a lot Mike my compromise in my own head personally is I don't have privacy and I know it so I might as well get something back for it which is convenience so like if if I'm gonna have like this Google assistant on my phone I already have a GPS and Wi-Fi and all these sensors in my phone I might as well like Google of course I know where I am so I might as well get something for it so maybe I'll get like shortcuts to like where I need to go you know where my work is just give me a shortcut to traffic to work like that's what's weird it says you'll be home in 12 minutes like bitch how do you know where I live yeah exactly how do you know when I'm home but if you're gonna know that which I know you are cuz you're Google then give me something back right and you know restaurants near me like how do you know where I am you're watching me all the time you're constantly it's basically I so it knows like I have a couple of like preferences that seem like pretty minor like what sports teams do you like what sports do you enjoy watching or like what sort of topics do you enjoy and if you open my Google assistant it will tell you like here's the score of the game you are about to check the score - here's the the traffic I have a flight later what it's gonna do I know it's gonna do this is it's gonna tell me when it's time to leave based on traffic based on my location to arrive to my flight in ninety minutes before the scheduled departure it's gonna tell me when to leave because it knows where I am it knows where the airport I'm leaving from is it knows my flight it knows my flight time and it knows I need to get to the airport in 90 minutes before the flight does Google on ways now uh I say their own ways or bought I think it yeah I think about waste so when you get something through Google Maps it does kind of the same thing that ways does right yeah yeah yeah they use data from which people who live in these neighborhoods where Waze is now rerouting people they are furious about that and I'm a ways person so like I know I'm very familiar with the rerouting and it's pretty hilarious it's hilarious people have these sleepy little communities and now it's like it's traffic streams of cars going through their neighborhood Waze is great though yeah it is great it is great I mean it's it's amazing how well it predicts your time arrival - and the whole like notifying you when there is construction or police or something mm-hmm yeah no it's excellent cars broken down the right lane you know shift to the left yeah yeah you're gonna get around it yep I'm fascinated by all these advances and where they're taking us and I spend a lot of time thinking about I spend a lot of time thinking about what where the future holds or what the future holds and where all this stuff is going and I never I mean I've never would have imagined 20 years ago that we would be all addicted to our phones and one of the big issues would be like one of the new features in the iPhone shows you how much screen time you have and because when we're doing this fitness challenge your screen is on all the time because you're looking at your screen because it shows you the the score of yours so it's like your screen usage this month is up nine hundred percent like oh no this month obviously because of that but there's something to addiction to phones and addiction to technology and the fact that it's so a part of our life that I I can only imagine it's going to get more and more immersive and we're gonna become more and more symbiotic with all this electronics I mean you're wearing a watch that I own you things on time and yeah you have three phones with you yeah I on one hand I know that it's gotten at least recently a little more in the spotlight like Google just added the same thing at digital well-being future which tells you how much screen time you've had in certain apps and we'll let you restrict your usage of Instagram by you know a certain number of minutes whatever soon the same thing mm-hmm they both introduce that within like six months of each other which is kind of fascinating but on the other hand I think I think in my own head that I am not addicted yet I still unplug every weekend to play ultimate and and then I plug back in on Monday when you say you unplugged meaning you don't check your email you know check your texts no I mean I get texts that I get them but like as far as doesn't mean so like I have my stuff with me but like when I go when we go play a tournament that's like you'll have like five games in a day so I'll get up at like 7:30 you go to the fields you put your bag down you warm up you play a game you warm up you play a game you warm up you play a game and you're done in about like 4 or 5 p.m. Wow all day no phone that's a lot of activity yes it's amazing you're not wearing your watch yeah yeah I'm you get again a lot I've you whooping some people in this competition thing but I'm clearly not so yeah like all day and then we'll have team dinner and then shower sleep wake up the next day day to the tournaments I don't know what you need you need instead of that wrist strap you need like a forearm strap that's like going out of the way yeah like on like one of those tennis things those I know I have a couple friends that that play ultimate with that on like under their jersey like the the watch is the points like I don't know if the watch if I put it up here will still measure my heart rate and all that stuff the same the my zone thing sinks to a compression shirt and I know you can sink the my zone thing to your watch they have it that way I don't know if you could I don't appreciate you mean it's thanks to a compression true impression straight that has those little thinks through their website but yeah and you snap the thing into the compressions we're all four women in a sure oh my god I got a bra yeah I'm gonna get one of those because it mines getting super sweaty man this thing is losing a lot of its elasticity it's so gross - it stinks you can wash it I thought it was electronic we're gonna sink just like just row just a fabric part yet I just assumed that because all this stuff is like but the sensors are making some sort of a contact with these buttons which makes it contact with the earth don't watch the censor plastic things just metal so don't watch this right but the rest of it it has to go through these pads to get to your skin I don't want it to be shitty yeah okay how many of the shirt it's not almost always not quite yet it's not too late for days yeah augmented reality you know I know that there is a there's talk about a contact lens that was being in development that was going to be some sort of a lens that's gonna allow you to do like a lot of Minority Report type shit yeah I think Texas Tech as I know it is too far from that to make that work just because you need like a contact ones you think of is just like this clear thing maybe some circuits on it or whatever but like you need a battery right and all you need unless it operates off your body I guess but this is a SmartWatch it operates off the heat of your body is I mean I don't know how direct like even if you do operate off of some other power sis you need to get that power source to connect to the electronics to make it work which still takes some space I don't know how much but so yeah I don't know seems kind of far out it's a it's a it's a cool idea but it also seems really really difficult to put a contact lens directly in front of your retina and be able to focus on it there's a bunch of questions I have about it I don't know how reasonable or realistic it is my real fear is that they're gonna invent a better eye for blind people and when they do like look how amazing this is we've given blind people the ability to see again optimism but now they also have all these other features that you don't have with your regular eyes so let us scoop those bad boys out and put some fucking gay robot eyes binocular eyes I'm a little worried about that yeah realistically worried about that it came it came from we were watching this video once where there was a guy who got his arm and his leg bit off by sharks he got a attacked by a shark when he's surfing so yeah this carbon-fiber hand that totally articulates like a real hand and he's standing there with his from his knee down was an artificial leg and he was walking around and moving like a regular person I was like look at this guy this is incredible I'm like he's kind of a bionic guy yes his hand was moving around he could shake your hand and he seems so normal I'm like what if it gets like many many generations better than this where it has like Luke Skywalker when you guys hand chopped off by Darth Vader remember we got that robot hand and there's people working on this every day so I kind of figured we're headed in that direction we're like what's this Jamie side just googled something it's not out yet it's this is called a macula which is a AR lens that you wear with sunglasses so in together they make an AR situation classes a lens as a contact and then sunglass shared the picture that they yeah what is he macula you have a lens here and these glasses go over top what about creepy dude what a picture it's not out yet it's just this you can invest in it so it's more it's like how magically plus about a year year and a half ago like I'm not invested in anything that uses this guy's their cover boy what's up man that's a fucking robot man he's an alien he looks like the guy from men in black remember when the alien put the skin on remember that's what he looks like here something wrong with the left side of his face man he's wearing someone's skin that's a weird system so it lens in a contact yes the battery might be in the glass and the glasses and it's working and I don't know how it's connected but Wow well we this is who knows what this is here's the other thing I don't need the information that fast that bad I'm okay with the one-second delay of picking up my phone and checking it instead of cuz like what are you getting with you thought I know the examples were like incoming call the weather your emails things like that like information you can already get in two seconds by just yep I have an incoming call I have an email I have a text like that yeah pretty quick pretty quick and I've I've said this before where someone else asking me like are we at like the final form of smartphones like where are they gonna go are we gonna get bigger I'm gonna get smaller are they gonna be implanted in you I think smartphones are at like pretty much their final form we're gonna keep evolving the insides of smartphones to be better they're gonna get faster they're gonna get more and more transparent whatever they'll get like more interesting looking but I think it's always gonna be a thing I pick up and use and then put back down mmm I think that's where we're at for a while what are your thoughts on Samsung's foldable screens that I am very curious about because again sounds awesome but why yeah do I fold it yeah what am I doing with it and how big is it gonna get yeah a my foot so like maybe so we had this idea awhile ago when we started first getting these big phones were like oh you could have a really big phone like a tablet but then you fold it in half and it's like a phone size now but like I might as well just have a phone in the tablet and looks like I don't know if I need both do you remember the Samsung what was that giant thing that they had that was bigger than a note well they have small tablets but they had a it was a phone oh the galaxy mega yeah yeah they have like us the weird thing is like that I think was like a six and a half inch screen and that's where we're at now was it really yeah it was massive compared to what we had also on the market which was like five inch screens I never saw one in the wild I reviewed one yeah it was it was way bigger than any other phone out but I'm pretty sure if I look back that was like a six and a half inch screen it was less than seven ish I think that's the sweet spot 7 inch screen tablet 6 inch screen phone yeah and I think yeah this is a 6.2 inch screen this is a 6.5 inch screen yeah so it was six point three yeah so that's bigger than the Galaxy mega that's crazy look at that thing endless entertainment luta 4x optical zoom but that thing still had the Moorhead and the bezels and the chin yeah it's not that bad really in comparison not horrible iPhone 8 it's kind of the same galaxy mega 16 gigabytes whoo baby Wow look at that thing that's so weird I wonder what year that was that was like no tell me that was probably college so like 2014 we pulled that thing out you were a pimp like what are you doing with watching shine as movies all the time battery life 44 minutes fun time yeah it's crazy when you connect your phone to your car here's the other one that just happened the this tiny palm phone I don't know if you've seen this so it's like a super small phone accessory to your normal phone so it does almost everything your normal phone does but it's way smaller it has like half of the stupidest product of the year it's a phone accessory to your phone they could have just made a small phone that would have been fine yeah but then they made this this whole thing we're like oh but it has to connect to your other phone and then it uses the same phone number but it works sometimes and Steph Curry is our ambassador and I don't know anymore why someone would want to get that so how close does it have to be to your regular phone I think it has its own data or something I don't know it's kind of like an Apple watch like it's an accessory to your phone that kind of is the same form factor as a phone you put in your pocket you like go to the gym you just bring that instead of bringing the main phone or you just go on a hike and you just don't want to bring your whole set up so you just bring a little I'd like to be in the meeting with whatever cokehead came up with that I don't know I can't think of any other really great reasons to have it I think the iPhone was the Apple watch sort of has it nailed right you get you notifications but it's nice that you enjoy it even though you're not even using it for a lot of the features yeah I'm using for the fitness aspect and what else do you use on it whether or yeah so like it's I have the 4G version I get the weather and also it has the ability to make calls I do but I never do like if I wanted to call restaurants see what kind of you know hours they have I could say hey Siri and make a call but mmm yeah yeah no is there nothing commensurate in the Google world I mean there is other smartwatches there is technically samsung also makes their own but they have a Galaxy SmartWatch that has like a kind of a cool spinning thing yeah Galaxy watch yeah yeah it's probably the best Android compatible SmartWatch and Huawei has a kind of a cool one too right so while we did this thing that I thought was is a good try it was a good try it was a SmartWatch that has a digital screen but then had a mechanical hand like so that it looked like a normal watch mm-hmm when the screens not on the problem with that is when you go to look at like your notifications or whatever you get the hands are blocking the screen so they didn't really think too hard about I mean they they got to that point and I like oh you know what we'll do we'll have this button where you press it and then the hands like move out the way and then screen the notification will like move to the side so you can read it it was they tried they really tried they tried to be different I respect the hell out of that good try Huawei but no now do people the companies ever come to you and say hey man you're you're really good at reviewing these things are we fuckin up here kinda sorta red came to me before this existed in its in this form and it wasn't a prototype phase and they were still pretty far along but it was kind of like should we do this like should we put this here should we keep the headphone jack I was I was giving them sort of yeah they kept the headphone jack little things like that but for the most part I think what a lot of people don't understand about product development is it happens many many many many months before you ever see the products show up so I don't know if your member like all the leaks about the pixel 3xl all of them guarantees six months before the phone came out it was done yeah like they knew that that's what it was gonna or than I think any phone that I can recall yeah so like that's the same as the iPhone like they've been working on the whatever the next iPhone is they've been working on that iPhone and it's probably gonna be like a couple more months and then they're like finalizing design and things like that and so when you start to see phones come out like around like September and October and they start to all kind of resemble each other and then another one comes out and it looks the same it's not like they saw the phone in early October and they were like let's copy that and then they made the next phone two weeks later they've been working on this forever so like one the whole like the whole notch thing was you know people were like oh I hope Google is trolling us and that's not really the notch and there have this phone with no nosh no it's they've been working on this for a long time this is what they planned what is that one phone where the back slides up for the selfie camera so there's two ver I think what you're thinking of is Oppo fine ten yes yeah that's a pretty I like the idea it's pretty cool but I'm like man how long is that thing in a wart that's the question it's phones are no chips in there yeah any little motors yeah phones are solid-state for the most part for good reason you don't want a lot of moving parts in a phone that you're like running around with there's another one called the vivo Apex no it's another vivo phone basically any X is what it's called and it has just the selfie camera pop up yeah I've seen that one too and that's another thing it's like well what if a grain of sand gets in there like is it toast immediately yeah you drop that sucker on the beefy drop it while it's open is that over like Evo necks yeah any excess or necks I know if I'm supposed to say necks or whatever but that's a mmm it's an interesting it looks cool cuz now look you have the fingerprint reader under the glass you have all the way to the bottom as a screen and then all the way to the top is the screen and they you just have the selfie camera it looks amazing so yeah no no bezels at all yeah or basically no bezels pretty much tiny chin at the bottom so that's the idea is like were in this sort of a race to get to a bezel this phone and I guess that's the closest we can get right now he's just having a little mechanical thing pop out I think what we want is the stuff to be behind the glass yeah a camera behind the glass but then how would you see the image yeah so I think if based on what I know about the physics of the technology you need you need an OLED display and you need the camera to be behind the OLED display and then when you light up the camera you need like a little black circle where those pixels are off so they can shine through I don't know if this is all making sense I think you're still gonna always have like some sort of a black circle in the front of the phone somewhere well what's fascinating about iPhone versus Android is that there's so much more room for possibility with Android because you have so many different manufacturers yep that are competing in that marketplace then trying to find some sort of way to shine and that was where the Huawei was it the mate RS was like the porsche design version where i thought that was a really interesting phone because it was stupid expensive but it had a gigantic battery and had an incredible 20 megapixel camera great night photos low-light photos yeah yeah they really try to do like you know porsche design does a lot of different things they do sunglasses yeah ballpoint pens they do all kinds of weird stuff it really has nothing to do with the car but what they've really the design yeah they came up with something really high-end yeah and they showed there's some sort of a market for that right there yeah that's it again yeah so now they did with the mate 20 they did the same thing it's a great looking phone but it's again when you look at like how much you have to pay versus what extra you're getting you might as well just get the mate 20 pro and not worry about the actions people want that porsche design yeah just to go look at me I'm a baller I'm a ditch they didn't they did the same like Porsche does that Lamborghini does then Ferrari does that Tesla does that there is a Lamborghini Edition Oppo find 10 yeah heard like carbon fibre and a car it looks dope on the car of course that's a dope looking phone period did you mess with that phone at all III mess with the may 20 but not the porsche design one but it comes down to like yeah using the phone itself is gonna be pretty much the same like once you get past like the design which is a little bit different you open up the phone and the software is you get a cool couple wallpapers put like it's the same phone on the inside a little more storage maybe but basically the same thing well I just I find it fascinating that they've decided to go that far out into the high-end deep end yeah I guess you have to to differentiate yourself it's just $2,000 right yeah starts at $2,000 so I guess as hype as you want to get about it like are you gonna go pay $2,000 for that not but then when the note 9 came out it kind of took a lot of the wind out of their sails battery was the same size cameras are fairly similar big-ass screen and the other thing about phones is we got all these phones that are a thousand dollars now and it's made it so easy to just bump up the price of your phone and not have anyone blink an eye I've been thinking about that a lot we have the iPhone 10 starts at $1000 right so then the iPhone 10 are came out and I think they could have priced it anywhere from 650 to 850 and they just nestled it right in there at 7:15 you're like oh that's way cheaper so then this phone comes out pixel pixel 3 and pixel XL you probably don't remember what the pixel 2 cost but the pixel 3 starts at $7.99 which seems what like that's pretty reasonable right mid-range that's $150 more expensive than last year why like what's so much better about pixel 3 than pixel 2 that it's all it's just remark two dollars more the market is just lifted everything plus $200 set $1,000 as a high-end now and I think that's what's convinced companies like Huawei like if we want to compete with Apple and really make what seems and looks like a premium phone we have to charge $1200 so that people know it's better than the iPhone if we charge $800 they're not gonna think it's better than the iPhone we have to charge more minimal charging to prove that we have more in our phone but one plus is interesting because they're really reasonable but their specs are very high I like them they they've had a good history of like they usually listen to what people seem to want in a phone and they're also good at like picking high-end numbers that look great on paper and usually translate pretty well to like using the phone but they always cut out they cut as many corners as they can to get the price as low as they can their phone last year it was about 550 bucks right all glass but no wireless charging but it's glass we have dual cameras you hardly ever use a second camera but it's dual cameras eight gigs of RAM Snapdragon 805 a lot of phones have the same specs now these days but like they've gotten pretty good at like going the opposite action like we're not gonna charge a thousand bucks we're gonna make the same phone trust us it's the same but for way less money and that's that's a much more popular direction to go as far as sales now they've done the same strategy for the newest oneplus yep and they're coming out with a new one this month Oh 16 they keep the headphone jack yeah so far so far that's my phone Jack's a weird one right it's like come on Sam so I'm gonna hold on to that sucker Samsung's been very popular for keeping the headphone jack and not having a notch there like the last ones to have a headphone jack and no not well I'm a big fan of the way the note 9 looks when I'm using it like that's a beautiful device it feels net premium in the hand yeah yeah yeah what do you think is wrong with it with note 9 yeah my biggest problem with note 9 is the front-facing camera and the software and the software is not even that bad it's just it's gotten slow for me quickly a lot of times like I've been using Note 9 I also don't think it's the prettiest software I really like Samsung screens so I know they can make good looking stuff but I think if they made I don't think member Google Play edition when they used to do that mhmmm if they made a Google Play edition galaxy note 9 I would instantly buy that phone that would be sick because I love Google's like software being cleaner and looking a little better yeah if you look at Samsung's software it looks kind of cartoony a lot of times very colorful not a problem but it's just not my favorite I know some people have figured out a way to use the Google launcher on other phones so they make it other phones look like a pixel yeah you can you can go you can only go so far RAK like you can you can use a Google launcher and you can use an icon pack to use Google icons but still you're gonna have like your settings pulldown is still gonna look like Samsung you're gonna have in the apps like the Settings app is still gonna look like the Samsung Settings app you're still gonna have three email apps and three messaging apps and all this stuff Samsung always does but yeah the messaging apps are weird you want this one to be your default and like I don't know what that is yeah this is that one I just want to use one and I message plus yeah like why is it better if you use a Verizon samsung note i think you end up with three messaging apps like verizon messages a verizon messenger and then there's the message plus on those google's messenger and it's just a lot and then there's hangouts and then how do i even get in touch with owen anymore it's a lot I wonder if there's ever gonna be a time where something happens technologically where the walled garden of Apple sort of dissolves and everything becomes accessible Apple will fight til they die to let that walk they will never let that go down that's that's like one of their biggest most prideful accomplishments is you know that wall I mean they really have nailed it yeah other than brand loyalty and other than the prestige of having an Apple product which is all very high yeah that walled garden that's where it's at did he ever tried to leave an iPhone I did like that's I do a pixel tubing yeah okay it was a fucking nightmare you know I couldn't get text messages and very common and here's the thing I even called up Apple and I said I want you to remove me from your yeah from your imma I gave them my email address I gave them a phone number the whole deal and they go why I go cuz I went with a pixel phone and there was like pause like I just ate a baby like it's a different phone you fucks I'm trying to have a different phone yeah let me out let me out of the blog so then I call my friend igloo hey man send me text send me text I sent it shit nothing I'm gonna send you text nothing nothing I'll go okay I'm gonna shut it off turn it back on nothing you have to start with a new phone number the wall yeah you have to literally start with a new number you have to start from scratch and people get that grinding that's a big reason why I don't make my main phone number and iPhone is cuz I know I'm like lowering myself into the garden like I can use an iPhone but that will probably never be my main sim I have two sims my main number the one everyone has is an Android phone I think it'll stay that way as long as that's the way it is well I feel like you in your particular profession as a you're a reviewer of all these things I think you kind of have to do that yeah because otherwise you'd be in this weird position of not being able to leave was the thing okay so there's a video Lou did actually this we keep saying Lulu from unbox therapy yeah clarify which was like it was we all went to CES in January we're all in Vegas every year in January and we just went around the room and just went what phone do you use I saw that with you yeah but just what phone is in your pocket right now take it out show us with phone use iPhone after iPhone after iPhone and there's a couple of pixels in there but every time you ask an iPhone person like so why an iPhone and they're like man I message FaceTime like that ecosystem is real Luis seemed angry more people weren't using pixels you know well there was all thing about just whatever phone there's a lot of people who do sponsored videos well they'll talk about a phone as if they use it but they don't and that was one of the things that at CES specifically that we kind of had a laugh with at our studio because you would think like if you watched everyone's videos like oh everyone is using a huawei everyone I guess while we had a big budget for CES and they just paid a lot bunch of people to make mate 10 Pro videos and that's CES so if you if you went into watching that video like what phone is in everyone's pocket I think you would just assume everyone's got a wall way mate ten-four oh and nobody did that's dirty and then the other thing is about Huawei I hate trashing Huawei but I also kind of left thrashing wooly is they have a lot of money to pay celebrities to tweet ads for Wow way basically gal gadot being one of them right and you heard this story so she's tweeted a bunch of huawei ads and I noticed that while she's a brand ambassador for a while wait tweeting ads about how much she loves her Huawei phone if you look in the details of the tweet it's always via Twitter for iPhone oh and it's like whatever she can use an iPhone I don't care but I thought it was funny so I just tweeted it it's very funny it blew up and I had Huawei reach out to me like how did you find this how did you know where did you this is a is this a mistake like could this be a like has this ever malfunction I'm like no this is that's how Twitter works like you can see the data it's clearly an iPhone and I thought that's hilarious as my screenshot and so uh not only did gal gadot gal gadot the fucking Wonder Woman lady yeah Wonder Woman ah so Wonder Woman you fucking fake from an iPhone it's just funny because look at the picture there she blocked you not only it she blocked me but Huawei since then has tweeted all they deleted like her latest tweets and reposted them from an Android phone and she's tweeted from an Android phone ever since I'll give a respect for that Wow they probably told her you know lose all that cash there's no way she's tweeting like that she has a team I get it but like whoever was on her team tweeting from an iPhone like the fact that she blocked you those rows hilarious that's gross no i didn't i think well i tagged her an inch probably just getting bashed by like people going wow you're using an edge like an iphone why I think event it was like a year later she unblocked me it was really funny oh she unblocked on blocked me thanks young thanks well I've really loved her as Wonder Woman and my friend patty is actually directing that movie a nice directed the first one she's directing the second one too so she says gal is a great gal tell her gal I said hi gal it's ok you got busted it's all gonna happen you're not alone you're a hundred percent not a lot that happened recently um razor the company made that a razor phone tweeted their official announcement tweet of the razor phone to from an iPhone how these speakers were excellent in the first one they're even better are they better in the second one yeah and the better the second one has IP 68 or 67 IP 67 I'm pretty sure so water resistant up to like 30 minutes one meter something like that you can splash it I wouldn't go underwater with it because I wash it but 68 is pretty pretty damn good yeah 68 is the new iPhone and 68 is also the note yes both are 68 mm 10 are is 67 pictures leery pixel 3 is 68 I think also but the weird thing about IP certification is it's just as far as I know the way it works is you just submit the phone for a certain test and if it passes then you get to say it's certified mm-hmm and the only difference between CIP 67 and IP 68 is ip67 is technically certified for thirty minutes one meter and IP 68 is certified for thirty minutes one point five meters and the meter ratings sometimes it's two meters sometimes it's a little more but it's basically just a measurement of water pressure like how much pressure is different half a meter I mean water is heavy but like yeah it didn't seem that significant to me but it's basically just water pressure so he splashed the phone a little harder is it gonna break versus an IP 68 phone I don't know just seems safe - good I could succeed at every time but it must be a big enough difference that some of those really do it yeah Oh interesting yeah but listen man I'm glad we finally got a chance to do this really cool a lot of fun giant fan of your videos and I really did I mean like I said the beginning I really do go you immediately I think you do a
