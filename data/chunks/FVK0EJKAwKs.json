brother my brother just has this expression where he just kind of gives me the slow not which is he's gone you know my father was dead and I went and I saw him on a gurney and shit there was so strange and I go outside and I was a smoker like cigarette smoker in those days I was go to have a cigarette and Donald comes out and I was like oh this is a shock and whatever you know we were upset and stuff and I said how was it because he was there I said what happened in Donald tells me the story if like dad woke up and had this like big reaction like just like yeah I'm hot I'm on her Stone sheets off and mom freaked touches it what's the matter what's the matter she told Donald call the call the ambulance call the hospital and he was gone within seconds so that's his you know bad enough you know he was hot and uncomfortable you don't want to hear like all he died in his sleep and we woke up and he just didn't but then my brother says this thing probably defined my life my brother goes he died screaming and I go what what and he goes he he died screaming and I was like Doug what I mean as is that a figure of speech he goes no he literally he died screaming and you could see my brother was haunted by it and my father wasn't like I wouldn't say he was a butch man or strong man but he wasn't a soft man money stretch the imagination and I never heard him get real loud or anything like that and the notion of my father dying screaming changed my life because I was like even a good man in this world he played a game he played straight you play a pot of rules you do everything you're supposed to you're gonna die screaming and at that point I was like there's no point and not trying to accomplish every stupid fucking dream I've got even if his dumb shit like fucking you know oh my god I've always wanted to collect this money fucking Wayne Gretzky cards in one fucking binder or if it's like I want to make a movie or if it's like I want to put on podcaster I want to do a TV show now or I want to write a book chase it all down chasing wimzie's what I've been doing for the last few years just smoking weed and chances when wimzie's any time I'm like back in the dead have a good idea something I really want to follow through on and they don't even get scared you start thinking about some motherfuckers gonna say and be like oh it's stupid why would you fucking do that and fucking why why a lot of why people in this world I try to surround myself with the why not fucker so you're like I want to try this like why not let's go let's give it a shot gotta be game man people help you achieve your dreams and shit so for me the last few years I've just been trying to accomplish every dopey dream the big shit the little shit you got to do them all you can't just do the climb every mountain shit you know sometimes late a bar down step over and be like tada so you feel accomplished but chase it all and do it all cuz we're all gonna die screaming and you might as well enjoy it here and when I say chase aww don't fucking do it at the expense of someone else obviously don't hurt somebody else but go after you James man if your dream is to like I want to kill 12 children that's I'm not saying I'm not talking to you but go after your dreams if then I'm gonna hurt anybody you seem I wish I knew you before you became famous cuz you seem like if I had a guess I bet you haven't changed at all yeah pretty much no how did you navigate that that's a very friends those dudes like those yeah I was like kiddin about like they don't want to do the show and that is that they really don't want but I'm not really like Kevin we don't want to do this but Walters just like oh man so you think they just grounded you so much yeah gave in to the tide of those two craziness yeah friends I mean I've never had butch friends who like fucking punch you and resting well butch hey dude like me that's butch dude those are bullies but like the hard boys is my mom used to say leave those hard boys alone Kevin I never I didn't have the roughhouse playing around like let's wrestle and shit like that what I had was more psychological more oral and that sounds dirty but I don't mean oral more like the dozens motherfuckers keeping you tight you grew up fat mm-hmm you got to be fucking sharp standards or else you're a fucking victim every time you walk in a room because most of the world don't look like you so you get sharp you learn how to fucking take yourself out first before anybody else can steal their thunder hey I'm fucking fat and then people are like oh he knows you know and then they're you've removed their fucking card you taking their biggest weapon out of their quiver the biggest thing they got and then suddenly you've changed the focus and hey he's easy with himself blah blah blah and it makes people a loser you know just all that shit you pick up over the years you see it's it's what shapes you it's what makes you who you are so being able to hang out with people who were quick enough to like shred you but you had to be able to protect yourself and funny you know it's like hanging out with ninjas all the time who just ordered not ninjas so much as Kaito from the old Pink Panther movies where he just hired him to literally attack them out of nowhere that's what your friends do they just like attack you at a fucking nowhere and so by doing this all the time it made me sharp but it also kept me very very real so these cats even when the movies would take off or we was doing this one or this one they were never like oh my god the fucking we had no idea you were hidden genius they remain the same exact individuals I'll tell you I didn't like that one oh fuck yes really yes oh yeah let you know and they'll let you like I brought them on to Mallrats to come work on the movie and stuff and they made it they were in it in a few scenes but they worked behind the scenes they quit after about two weeks cuz they're just like I don't want to do this I have no interest in this I mean and that's cool like I respected that I was that guy that's the best Brian that's Walter like that's who they are rather than be like alright man we're gonna do it cuz what might seem like that would that upset keV if we don't they're just like we don't want to do this dude what makes you sign o self kind of thing I'm sorry what makes you think that without them you wouldn't be you though what makes you think that without them you wouldn't have pulled yourself to the ground I wouldn't have had that sense of humor I think my sense of humor largely came from that and largely came from my friend Brian Johnson and and Walter also kind of shaped it to some degree I was I was funny like don't get me wrong in high in high school I write sketches for the comedy shows and shit like that but I there it was their sensibility married to whatever sensibility I had is one of three kids raised Catholic in Highlands New Jersey that clicked that like kind of made me the the version of me you know the person that you would want to meet or the person like that was different was like keV 18 years old 17 18 before he started hanging out with Brian and Walter those are the cats that kind of helped me define who I was and if you look at clerks like that movie is I'm kind of Dante and my friend Brian Johnson is meant to be Randall the guy that I most wanted to be like he knew always knew what to say was fucking funny in a room and shit like that really misanthropic and then stuff and so that it kind of all communicated without those I don't think I know I wouldn't have the jobs I've had because I wouldn't have the sense of humor I have now and I don't think I'd be if let's say I've got in an entertainment somehow I doubt I'd be as grounded knowing those dudes have kept me kind of grounded for yours that's pretty cool man it's good it's good to have something like that in your life man I have a similar to weed why aren't you smoking when I thought this is a weed show we already got I wanna get high get higher okay experiencing it higher Kevin just gave me a heart attack and he didn't even realize it well way what what by talking about all that life thing I almost died Friday night when I was out and I just told me I'm like wow I was at a karaoke bar in Burbank right across the street from the Jay Leno Show like the NBC building dimples I've seen I've see I Drive past that I've seen that place I came out me and my girlfriend around 11:30 when we walking out the front and we parked so I'm opening the door for her to get in I've know where this big tall black guy about six two wearing a fake gray beer like a Santa Claus beard that was like tied on with white strings and a hat in this big hobo jacket shows a gun in my chest and was like give me your fucking wallet home yeah keep going my girlfriend was my girlfriend was pretty drunk my girlfriend was pretty drunk because she's like social anxiety so she drinks you know when she goes out all right she thought it was a joke she looked over and thought this was like a character or something right and so he's like dude shit you're shakin tellin ya can't tell it's still funny ya fuckin a that would fuck me up keep going and so he said I he said um you know Kim your fucking purse bitch and she's like like looking at like but what like she was drunk and shocked and I'm like give her give him the purse and so I get gave her she gave him the purse and then he goes get in the car lay on your fucking stomach and he's shoving the gun in my back when I'm laying in the car and I'm thinking like all right this is like execution-style like he's telling me you know get in there and then suddenly he goes get lay down to the to my girlfriend and she laid down on her back because she was just so freaked out he said I said lay on your fucking stomach bitch and he's like she's shoving a gun in her back and then finally just like both laying there and then he slams the door and then just takes off and so now like the other day I was at the grocery store and I saw a black guy that was tall and I'm now I'm like freaking out like if it was a redhead that robbed me it would've been the same way I'm good but but now I see these guys and I'm like become like a racist from the 50s now where I'm like walking around like what's he doing on my side of the story at this point yeah you were in that moment yeah what did you what was it like it was really when I was laying there and it was like this is it and but you think what did you think what did you think you know I didn't think about anything except my girlfriend the whole time I'm like cuz hearing him yell at her yes that's just you you think that you can just gonna look around look for a weapon or something like that but wouldn't you're in that biggest shock you're just like oh I wouldn't look Vince I'm so not the butch dude that's again there's that word I'm so not - dude that's like where's a weapon I'm gonna do this I'm immediate my reaction is gonna be like let me suck your dick let us go I will suck your dick until you let her go and he's like I've got a girlfriend I'm like still yeah I'll be better than her yeah I can really deliver I that's where I go tonight would never go defensive or often these people online of course is like that's what you keep not doing jiu-jitsu there's something I like you if I had two guns in my pocket I stood you have yourself strapped the dynamite maybe again you could be a little look at this bitch right yeah people those you should have people should shut the fuck up no one knows what that's like until that happens to you and you should always give someone what they want usually they just want to fucking get your money and run away they don't want to shoot you is that the case usually you hear it once in a while though like like old lady you know did nothing still get shot or something if it's a young kid on fucking PCP it's really a game right and this is about midnight and three months before that or six months before that I was in Fuddruckers in Burbank and some guys like stealing this girl's purse and running out the door and I'm chasing him I'm like I'm in Burbank right now y-you know and we talked about the Kmart shooting up in one podcast there was a shooting at a Kmart in Burbank and the officer that got shot was the one that came to rescue me when the other night and I was like you're the one officer he's like yeah I got shot he liked the leg and stuff like that so he became like a celebrity guy because well he's been shot at in Burbank and in Kmart's like you know in two men saw him on TV like they yeah yeah yeah but but it's like it's like it seems like you always hear Burbank it's so safe and stuff yeah yeah you don't think of Burbank is like Bob Hope lived there how could it be yeah there could be no terror well Toluca Lake I wonder how many chicks want to bone that guy because is the celebrity cop that got shot well I had a bunch right gotta be right fuck yeah they're chicks that got to be chicks that want to fuck fucking a hero cop heroes cop they got shot in the leg I bet that guy he's beaten off the pussy I was waiting for forensics like I'd wait like four hours because I mean this is like they closed off helicopters and everything that was like cops it's up and then they wanted a fingerprint my cars so I'm just sitting there and he's like going asking my girlfriend like questions like weird questions like so what do you do oh you're a dancer huh and stuff like it was a comic no he was totally an awesome nice cop but it was kind of weird like hearing like my girlfriend having to talk like so was an exotic dancer no but just asking weird questions and what and then and it was he going as close to hitting on her as he could and still remaining a cop was he doing like I don't know you see me and then you see my girlfriend maybe he thought I would like paid for her like if she was a hooker you know like how long do you know this guy Brian fucks way over his head but what's weird is no buts weirdos he was talking me and ask me all these questions and he goes what and I was like yeah I would like to be a cop but I like marijuana too much and he goes yeah I see that yeah you know marijuana and he's like it's gonna be legal soon so don't worry about that he's got a fucking crystal ball yeah that was the only silver lining to that horrible story was like at the end of it the cop was like don't worry kid one day we it's gonna be clean now I'm scared of black wizards [Music] that's gonna be an internet meme my friend black wizard you're scared of monsters you know like smoking my stress not scared of werewolves bro no I'm scared of Jaguars and pants did you see on stir you see the video I tweeted the other day of a Jaguar killing a fucking crocodile somebody tweeted it to me and I retweeted it it's a Jaguar killing a fucking crocodile right how scary are Jaguars I've been looking at crocodile or reference you've made to a Jaguar you big cats to me yeah well not here unfortunately but there are Pumas in this neighborhood really oh yeah for real yeah whenever you see deer this deer in this neighborhood and there's Pumas alright so there's not let's not stay out of this one Burbank it's not uncommon that people have spotted them in this community several times really yeah yeah like mountain cats yeah yeah the minister did there's a known population of them that live like around Topanga Canyon in this area and they travel really far like one of them they tracked from South Dakota all the way to Connecticut they hit Oklahoma because hit by a car in Connecticut and they decided yeah so they did the DNA test on this fucker and they found out that it's from South Dakota so this is from a group of Dakota this thing had walked miles he was looking for a dog or two eating some of the Jaguar killing a crocodile because it's fucking amazing cuz you think you look at a crocodile and you look at that is a goddamn dinosaur designers farm related evil lizard like who would fuck with that in a Jaguar it's just like playful with this fucking crocodile like knows it's gonna kill it mmm just playing with it swats at it paws at it just looks for the right moment get sideways on it and then but sit right behind the fucking head it's crazy it's like what if they're not scared of crocodiles yeah what do we have our fleshy bags of pink you know these big black muscular evil looking cats in a world where you've been following up on wildlife attacks stories you'll be seeing all the bear stories the two bears in Yellowstone this year they animal appears two guys have been killed by bears in Yellowstone this year it's rare you read that story online about the kid who got bit by the polar bear yeah that was fuckin astounding the dude literally tells a story where him and his trooper on you know they're out in the fucking woods or something like that and there's a kid sleeping next to him and asleep in a tent and this polar bear comes fucking through the tent the kid woke up to like wailing and gnashing of teeth and the fucking thing ground and blood all over its face and the thing bit him on the head had his head in its mouth a polar bear had his kid's head in his mouth and he said it bit so hard they cracked his fucking skull and he heard it crack in his head and what he also heard in his head louder and life Sensurround style from the 70s was our growling because it's fucking mouth was over his ear dude and he starts punching this fucking beast in the head punching it in the head real hard and shit and finally it lets go enough for him to like make a move or something like that so he survived the body his buddy was right next to him died and they interviewed the kid he's talking about he's like I got a lot of guilt man like it could have been me if I had slept on that side I'd be dead but I'm like dude you got your head bit by a polar bear that's I'm not gonna say it's worse but that's pretty dense so he got away and it just went after his friend next no his friend was done for by the time the kid woke up the polar bear had taken what it wanted I think from his friend he hit Maltin instantly it says face up oh my god yeah man nature what do you think it is you think it's like they're hungry and the weather condition changes and they're just coming into the neighborhood's now actually you don't hear a lot about this back in the day but a lot of it happening now a lot of more shark attacks a lot more bear attacks maybe they're really true statistically well I'm asking I don't know more maybe it's just I'm reading more about it well we have more access to information I do know that they said with this yellowstone attack that the last time there had been a death from bears and Yellowstone's it was 86 yeah yeah so that's a long time and I mean shit yeah last time you know it's for nothing nothing to get killed and then all sudden two people get killed quickly but those two people could have been sprinkled any time along the way it's you're in the wrong place the wrong time you Zig when you should have zagged it didn't rain enough so the fucking there's not enough food and then all sudden bear start eating other things bears are omnivores that's the crazy thing about them they can eat whatever the fuck they want so it's like us but the terrible thing about bears is because they're not strict carnivores they don't kill their prey before they eat it mm-hmm they just start eating mm-hmm I don't stand for a bit and I just don't think I'm looking at my dick the whole we could all stand no I just no no I'm all good how long do I stand for it's awkward deer balls ever fall asleep from sitting too much like I've lately I think I've been sitting a certain way where it squeezes the blood pressure off one of my balls and it feels like my whole crotch is no that's the inevitable progression to you growing a vagina they're gonna melt together and then pop open like remember that scene and John Carpenter's The Thing where the chest cavity opens up and becomes a big mouth that's your new pussy no my balls are fall asleep usually never have you never it's such a weird feeling no but my good stretch I know it's horrible I do the Ari Shaffir sometimes though when I'm reading you know as I joke about taking a shit and his legs go numb yeah and you get off and fall down to the ground yeah I read magazines all the time in the toilet and you do if you read magazines you're essentially you're choking out your leg yeah that's why jujitsu works jujitsu works cuz you cut off the blood and what you're doing when your feet go numb is you're putting all this pressure on yourself and wait you're you're essentially choking out your legs and make it hemorrhoids that's what it is yeah yeah when you choke someone out and jujitsu choke what you're doing is you're stopping the blood to their brain you're cutting it off you're stopping it from happening you're squeezing it that's what you're doing when you're sitting here on the toilet if you have this hard surface beneath your leg and then you're on top of your leg you basically giving your feet a slow choke oh my god dude I all right I do this all the time I do too I sit on the toilet for so long when I get up I got pins and needles that I can't and then like sometimes I'll try to man up and get through it but by the time I hit the bedroom like you start laughing because it's so you're out of control yeah as the nerves are all dead and my wife's just like how long when are you gonna learn like you go in you shit you get out like why are you staying in there till your fucking leg falls and I was like I'm getting shit done but it's I guess that's unhealthy I read car magazines is that what you do I go on the internet tweets the only time I read car magazines I do I won't let myself go on the internet on the toilet that's where it gets ridiculous oh my god down to the occasional magazine at least let me finish a Matt Taibbi Rolling Stone article in here on the crapper do you wipe sitting up or sitting down what the fuck you mean Stan yes well you know I've never done that you never stand and wiped up only when I was a kid and this is weird Wow are you getting something out of me I haven't said publicly it maybe ever when I was a kid I remember like I take a shit and I'm trying to remember what age this stopped but I'd be like I'm done and somebody would get up you'd stand up and they'd wipe your ass for you and I think I did that till I was like seven Oh weird it is weird yeah but it was pretty good like in terms of like I didn't really have to figure out how to fucking wipe my own shit for until that point and then you had to train yourself to do it from sitting down I think you never perfected or a never perfecting art form like the art of the wipe it's not you know there's no one true measure and and I think it develops as you get older you learn better technique and stuff but I've noted that not since then I've never said I'm a more of a front wiper though yeah like I'll reach because I got a lot of back fat rather than reach around I'll reach through my lean forward and reach through my legs so I'm wiping almost like my man push right but I cleared the ball so it doesn't hit my or anything like fascinate the wet wipes have really helped my luck like they just come out of nowhere couldn't they have those in the 70s well Smith was the first one that called them to my potential I mean they had baby wipes forever but these flushable that it was have asshole cleaning a fishing area yeah big sign man he yeah he did he literally talked about an interview is just like barry barry sonnenfeld on men and black turned me onto wet wipes for handy wipes for for going he's like why would you use toilet paper when you can use this he's like i haven't gotten back sense and so one day i went out and got a pack goes it was fucking amazing it's like taking us you flush them yeah but these are flushable so yeah they say they're flushable let me tell you what happens i've used that for four years and everybody well you know but i had a problem you were probably about either septic problem yeah i had a tree growing inside my my pipe dude it was the most ridiculous thing i tweeted it it's almost impossible to find now someone someone on the internet will find it but it's a literally there was a branch growing it was huge his crazy root system and everything that was growing in my toilet i kept having this clogged up toilet didn't matter if I poured Drano on it nothing would work so I had these guys come over I figured they're just gonna snake the toilet well they cut out a fucking tree cuz nature is such a motherfucker that a tiny crack had grown in one of the pipes and these it's a root from one of the nearby trees had forced its way into this and found out that there's all this water in this area so spread apart the pipe by growing and then grew up the pipe it was incredible was just invasion by this plant species living off my poop and it was all clogged up with those little fucking flushable wipes those flushable wipes don't go anywhere you know how the flushable wipe comes in like that little treasure chest yeah you can just get like refills and throw it in there yeah I don't do that for that long because if you look at like the taint or the button of the thing you know sometimes if you get a second wipe you might have a little poo on your hand and that builds up if you smell that it's it smells like an asshole I I never used the I just open it and draw them out I don't want to touch a button ever yeah what's up with that right that's the silly move did they give you a rubber glove to use that thing with that's what they should for yeah does she give you a rubber glove that should be well I'm into the sphere wipe to the deep sincere I'll take knuckle deep too why when you're cleaning yourself out exactly you never know if somebody's would be like tonight's the night meet your ass people are so funny about assholes you know really are these people uncomfortable about it don't like you talking about your own just like certain things you can talk about you can talk all day about your y'all have psoriasis on my elbow it's really annoying it's itchy and scratchy look at my eczema yeah yeah you talk about that you start talking about man I just you guys never like just massaging your asshole do you massage your ass all the people like what the fuck are you talking about you know you could say dude when I get home I can Asajj my neck on the way home you know sometimes you get so stiff I just give it a solid massage on my own I feel so much better yeah yeah me too I know you mean I like to massage my asshole it feels really good you do feels no I don't but but if someone said that you know but do you no no that'd be awesome but it's something about you talking about your asshole and pleasure that makes me terrified does it really something I'll tell you pain stories because it's sitting on the turlet as you said all that time I got an anal fissure oh Jesus you ever have one of those no you never want one of these this I've never okay I've never been punched in the face or choked out or anything fucking cool but this was the most pain I think I've ever felt my entire life really it's that ring that sphincter is the focal your entire body you start to discover anything you do reverberates in your asshole I know it sounds deep it's not move your finger you can feel it what an arm you can feel it and you only really realize it when there's something wrong down there and an anal fissure is when there's a tear right on the fucking lip of your asshole somewhere on the ring or this one extended a little deeper and I I didn't know what it was it's painful man like so painful that like I asked my wife like my wife's never fucking seen me completely naked let alone my asshole I literally like I'm gonna ask you to do that fucking thing I never imagined I'd ask another human being to do and she's like what and I was like I'm gonna lay on the bed I'm a fucking crane open my two fucking cheeks I'm gonna need you to look in there and tell me if something looks funky I've never even seen my own asshole but I know for a fact I'm a dude I've got hair down there too so I'm I'm I'm telling her I'm like now you might have to deal with a little shrubbery down there there's no manscaping so if that's the case you might have to move hair and she's like oh my god please don't make me do this I was like there's no one but you I was like I'm sorry I wouldn't have anything I was in pain dude it wasn't I was crying it hurts so much so I lay down she's looking and she's like I I don't know I there's just so many roles you know she couldn't get to it I was like come on do you see any blood it's like I think I see some blood I think I see like an inflamed area and I went to a doctor and a doctor it's like get up on the table and whatnot and I never went to a proctologist and I'm laying on the table and he opens my cheek and he doesn't even he puts a flashlight on the outside of my fucking ring piece he done I'm waiting for like the flesh move we're moving River he takes a look with just the flashlight he goes Oh anal fissure I go really is that what it is he goes yeah I was like you're gonna you know wanna go deeper he's gone I don't need to he's going you don't want me to either and I said what do you do about him he's gonna give you two creams ones topical one a little more insertion he's going I basically was the figures I've got a camera he said in 8 to 10 weeks you'll start feeling 50% better and I looked and I'm like what are you kidding me and it may not have any to have been four or five but it was a long period of time only 50% better and I was like - that I don't like these odds he's like that's his best I could do he's like that's either that he can go for surgery but trust me you don't want that he's like a guy said what surgery he's like well basically we get in there with a needle and sew you up I'm like forget it I'll wait for a deal and it was fucking misery they get in with a needle and sew you up and then how long does it take for the other thing and then it takes for a while to fucking heal so their whole thing is like just keep rubbing this top go on at Nate a little heal itself trying not to fucking rough around with him like I don't want even go near it oh yeah doctor use those terms I said doc ah that's a rough around with it son like I said like Joe Rogan I like to massage my ass what will this mean for that but he said he was like it's very common he goes if you're in a room 45 percent of the people in the room are dealing with anal fissure he's gone nobody talks about it I said why he's gone because it has everything to do with your asshole he's gone people he was saying the exact same thing he's like people don't talk about this kind of public he's be much easier because you wouldn't have people waiting as long as they do to come in it's gone it's common practice he says you know how yours happened and I was like I don't know I thought it was gonna be like a lot of fucking bathroom activity man a lot of fucking bloke glory holes and shit I said no no I don't know how it happened and he said you sit on the toilet a lot I bet I said I do as a matter of fact he's going with your weight sittin on that toilet and he's gonna I bet you don't just go and leave you sit there for a while I said yeah he's gone it's just think about it gravity is just pulling at that you know as you sit there it's not like you're sitting on the toilet and your butt cheeks are clenched and your asshole is fucking tight that's what I said nothing's getting in here excellent posture your shit comes out through your balls yeah my shit comes out when I tell it to look out for do you never want that oh my god that sounds it horrible so I remember so six weeks only 50% fifth 6 weeks 50% how about when we done did it take until was a hundred percent Oh honestly it felt like months I think it was months like four months all I could do literally was like lay on the bed belly down and if I took it oddly enough when I took a shit it felt better but it only felt better for the moment I was taking the shit because then I guess what I don't know what I don't know I can't even tell you the science of it but when I took a shit I felt better as soon as I was done taking a shit that's when the agony kicked in of like reminding you it was there and he would literally just flinch and squirm on the bed like fucking me it's drawn or something like that it was mad nasty that's the last thing you want get off it's the folk of your body I had the internal hemorrhoid for that reason and they had to do the rubberband technique where they tie rock band around side side your asshole and it tight super tight so it gets no blood supply and it falls off well I'm like is this gonna hurt you guys no it's more of an annoying pain and I'm like all right I go home and it was like somebody shoving their like a fingernail into your asshole from the inside and just sitting there and twisting it or hurting it like a fucking Mataji shit passage it shit get caught up on now no I don't so how big is this thing you could wrap a rubber band around it it was pretty big and then yeah I've had a hemorrhoid before they said that I was supposed to go back maybe two or three times this is a whole process the first time it's probably not going to do it I wouldn't go back to the second one so now I live with the little guy he's just this little teeny guy now but once in a while if he eats like if I eat the wrong thing it blows up means like your bitch not juice you can't clam style you still have it in there tied up no no the rubber band dissolved but it but the internal hemorrhoid still exists yeah it just returns whenever it wants to whenever I like get crazy eat a bunch of hot peppers or so that was for Edie it's hot peppers it's a lot of fucking like caffeine it's a lot of like really I had heard that it's from Greece sourcing your shit out that's like pushing a - from pushing like I've got a resident just like yours they're mostly quiet it's larger but periodically hey if I'm down here and it's always from fucking I've like on the toilet and I'm fucking pushing maybe I'm not ready to go but I'm like if I don't go now I'm not gonna be able to go for a couple hours so once in a whi he shoots somebody and there's blood everywhere you know it's like a [Music] bloody nose no big deal bloody asshole Oh for reals I want to go to the fights dude some fights we got to do it roll a camera on me though okay so you could watch me okay I don't for sure well there's there's gonna be a big card on Fox coming up real soon I think it's November yet I don't want to say I think it's the 14th I have to look at the schedule but it's it's going to be on Fox and I think they're announcing tomorrow who the the fighters are but that'll be an Anaheim so that's fucking close possession and you do how all of them are you always the guy yeah yeah yeah I didn't do yeah yeah about tickets for the shit no come on thank you spend your money fuckin Smith you Kevin Smith I'm sure dude you're getting punched in that ring I'll make sure to get paid I'm happy oh they get paid a motherfucker now but they must be paid a little bit of our gate right that's how yeah yeah well it's different I mean they get different deals but you know the gates it's almost always sold out almost all the almost all the domestic UFC sell out we've had a few problems and other countries where they really weren't like hip on the UFC you know Germany wasn't like the biggest success when we're over there didn't it wasn't like it's like Australia Australia sells out in like an hour whenever we put on a show in Australia people go fucking nuts but it was a little more boy to Coulter what about they blocked us from television or something in Germany - there was something crazy where you can only get it on pay-per-view they couldn't have it on live television Germany Canada Canada's great yeah I always find it's very similar to Australia or vice versa yeah Canada is awesome I fucking love Canada I would live there if it wasn't so confusing you know if I didn't have to pay taxes to two different countries GST and psi I think Vancouver city's government and the province yeah it's you know you're paying its the satan essentially federal and state taxes yeah but then you also have to pay for American too unless you want to remember if you want to live if you want to live in another country unless you want to give up your citizenship you have to pay American taxes yeah you have to know if you're talking about doing dual citizen yeah I'm sorry I'm not saying I hate America just like I would live in Vancouver Vancouver is the shit to run greatest fucking cities ever I'd go for Toronto Hockey Hall of Fame I love Toronto buddy it's cold as a motherfucker I grew up in Boston but my lady would never let me live in Canada man yes I'm like Vancouver well my life Vancouver I went to school there I shot a TV show there and a movie there like I do but it's not I'm not into whale or all right a lot of that of their man that trees fuck tree as a comic if you know I travel too much man it would stand up and with the UFC I travel too much to risk being snowed in so if I live somewhere like Toronto I would always risk being stuck you know Boston you risk being stuck it's not it's not a sensible place to live if you're a traveler unless of course you know you can you know figure out how to get out of town before the snow hits and you know the snowcat snow can up that mountain oh man just look out for the dude behind the fucking ah with the axe I do think that I like to say that when did you didn't see that that Jack Nicholson motherfucker shining he couldn't shine that at all that was a great goddamn moon brilliant and Stephen King doesn't like it you know that ya know so much so that he made sure they made another one assist a cup make a worse one make a terrible one this other one was too good make a bad one yeah that better the TV movie wanted stuff I never saw the TV movie remember Steven Weber from wings versus Jack Nicholson right then and there I mean my disease weather because he that's balls of steel dude you don't know I'm saying you like alright I'll give it a shot right the dude or but to be fair is what Heath Ledger did years later she he stepped into a role of bat that Jack Nicholson made iconic and stuff that all being said hats off to Steve whoever that movie's a tough suit yeah currently was on so many pills he didn't even know what fucking you know what position he was taken when Heath Ledger died he was on so many different pills yeah who knows his state of mind I mean when you hear all the different shit that he was on when he died a guy I mean there's there's a lot of those don't give a fuck guys that can put in like spectacular performances like that like that Heath Ledger Joker was a fucking pretty spectacular hormones yeah when we need a dude has something like that inside of him you know you don't that's it and that's an amazing abundance of energy and you're not exactly sure how he's controlling that not everybody can have that kind of a burst of energy inside of them and put it under control some people like literally aren't capable of that kind of a performance you think he was do you think I think he's probably had a little bit of crazy in them and know a little bit of crazy pills some cats just make pretend real well yeah for sure no doubt about it but with all the the pill thing in that I don't want a place that he's like fucking like I was I got into the headspace of the Joker no no no I don't even think that Thank You Shane no I just think he's just good but I'm just thinking that being really brilliant at something like acting and being completely fucking insane or right next-door neighbors yeah yeah it's a thin line I heard that the ability to lock on to a character so completely and captivating I'm so great it real make it so real that you're sitting there like look I love that Joker performance it's spellbinding but I said dial like one movie back and look at him in the gay cowboy picture mm-hmm that the performance he gives in that movie that dude exists like the Joker performance is big and needs to be big right and like prey you never meet someone like that in your life but you would meet the care I think was Anna Serena's he played the character he played in Brokeback Mountain that performance is so fucking frightening Lee real that was the first time I was like this motherfuckers are an actor I thought he was that dude from 10 Things I Hate About You but he had shops cuz he made only one other actor well to others parks Michael parks did that for me in from dusk till dawn like that's why red state exists because I watched the opening 10 minutes and from dusk till dawn back in 95 I was like this motherfuckers Yoda like how do you I want to spend a month on set with a dude who can drop site performance science this fucking brilliant this lazer sharp this otherworldly but then the other one got who was I just had in my head what was even less at parks Oh Billy Bob Thornton in a simple plan you ever see a simple plan that fucking movie has I wasn't him God did spider-man movie was this as a movie with humming Bill Paxton a simple plan Bill Paxton bill bill what's it what I say his name was you know Billy what's-his-face yeah whatcha Billy Joe Billy Bob Billy Bob Thornton Jesus crap Billy Bob Thornton and and who else Oh Bridget Fonda is in it this fucking movie is so good so well done it's about dudes who find money in the woods drug money and then they're trying to like it's a simple plan we're going to hold it and whack it up together we're gonna wait some time and then it just gets more and more complicated and fucking horrible things start happening it should excellent movie well done but Billy Bob Thornton gives a performance in this movie where he ceases to be Billy Bob Thornton and you're just like that character exists the man who is in this movie ain't there's no connection to Billy Bob Thornton right like it's literally a dude being possessed of someone else or something like that he changes his luck changes as deliverer is every perfect example I think that to be that good you there has to be a part of you that's a little bit fucking crazy and we know Billy Bob Thornton is a little bit fucking crazy what a mouth street mushy do you think she's a little grace she just keeps it together better than a better composure maybe she just kept better composure more self-aware but that that demon inside her beats just as freely as it does in Billy Bob she just knows how to control it in their social life but she can blast it out when she's pretended to be some other person she just let that fucking demon free you know craziest fuck yes I think to a certain extent yes and no I think it's completely containable yeah I think I've seen Daniel day-lewis get interviewed and I think he's you know he's a brilliant guy who's clearly like doing it as an artist you know he's clearly got a good handle on the whole celebrity thing the guy like he quit movies to be a fucking shoe cobbler I mean there's crazy deep interesting weirdo that is one of those stories that like everybody knows that Daniel day-lewis yeah oblah think it captures everybody's imagination whether he was serious about it or not right it may have been his most brilliant fucking move because for the next 10 years whenever somebody says Daniel day-lewis somewhere in the next minute they're gonna go you know he was a fucking he quit to be a cobbler he studied shoe making like it captured people's imagination like why would a guy this good at the job go off quit and make shoes for he came back sooner or later but that shoe thing captures people's imagination you think he probably went to it because it wasn't acting it was the furthest thing from acting because you're right you look at dude who gets into the role like he does he probably does go to someplace fucking dark and you you know a crew a bunch of years of doing that one afternoon another maybe going to fucking make shoes and Milan feels good sounds good simple doesn't require much use a different part of your brain no darkness and fucking cobbling you know unless one of those fucking witches show some of his movies where he does go dark or the darkest characters in the history of cinema the fucking gang love it Jesus Christ build the butcher that's what his name was right Jesus Christ was that a fucking scary performance he accent great yeah any look he seems like he really would cut your fucking head off with a machete like you really it's real you feeling it all the way the one of the only conversations I ever had with Martin Scorsese was after screening that movie I was coming out of the theater and I hear somebody go Kevin and it sounds like Martin's Chris Hayes over like no way Martin Scorsese would be fucking saying Kevin I turn around and Martin Scorsese was saying Kevin he was talking to me and I was like whoa holy shit man how are you Paul tingle I'd very much you know what I'm saying like in a way of life like the way he called me wasn't quite pure but it was like he had no reason to know my name exactly and he's like what you think I said I fucking loved it man like and I'd stayed through all the credits at you I said oh my god I loved you you got to tell me how did he arrive at that accent and he goes we found cylinders old cylinders recorded in around was 18 whatever turn the centre 19 whatever that period the flick was set he said we found cylinders which we just sat there and played and Daniel took the accent from that worked down a little bit and took the accent from there and I was like what did the cylinder sound like he goes surprisingly crystal-clear and like you could literally hear what a person said like what that guy sounded like in that era isn't that amazing I mean it was but Daniel day-lewis is probably our best representation of it because I bet he nailed it he must have good muscles we've never heard the cylinder I've never seen him not nail something down he played a boxer and it's the best version of an actor playing a boxer ever he really looks like a boxer like as he's moving he's doing everything correctly the way he's holding his hands the way he's responding to being hit the ways following through with his punches with his footwork he was a look literally looked like he could be a professional boxer this takes so much energy and focus to get that good like he didn't just look like a an actor he wasn't they Todd had a box like he's a perfect example I don't mean to dis him but Marky Mark Mark Wahlberg whatever the fighter in the fight it was a great movie I loved his performance in the movie but when you watch him boxing it looks like an actor is boxing okay box a lady can box at Betty can box but it doesn't look like like when you watch Daniel day-lewis do it Daniel day-lewis is moving like a real professional boxer in when you watching the Mark Wahlberg thing it seems like I'm watching a movie watching a movie where this boxing in it is there's a difference in the the reality what about what Stallone did he convinced no no kick your ass the way a way a professional fighter moves is very specific you have to unless you're several Roy Jones jr. freak-of-nature athlete who can keep your hands down and do all kinds of crazy shit because nobody can touch you because you're so fast your timing is so good but there's only a few of those guys ever if you look at a classic boxer they have very you know very simple characteristics the hands are always up high the chins talked the shoulders are up nobody does that in a movie and a movie everybody's their hands are down they're throwing wild punches and flexing their muscles and it's my turn to hit you and then it's your turn to hit me and it looks very obvious nobody they do I would never get into like a 30 second 40 seconds yeah embrace kind of like where they have to get split up well you can't do it realistically unless you're gonna let people hit people and you don't want to do that because you're only gonna get one shot at it and people aren't gonna like it no one's gonna like a half way fight and it's not it's like I'm gonna let you hit me and then I'm gonna hit you back we're gonna agree that there's a certain amount of time they're gonna hit each other we're gonna hit each other realistically hard you can't do that you can't do it you can't fake it I could do it you know yeah they can do it realistically real easy excuse other than Daniel day-lewis who has convincingly fought in a movie that earned your respect where you're like all right that looks like it and Daniel day-lewis was as far as too fucking high dude yeah you know Denzel Washington denser Ashton when he played Reuters I'm sorry fucking hi can't you give me somebody it's just like nope you need a guy like that you need a bad motherfucker who just really commits over yeah and like my friend terry clay bond trained him for some of that and he would go down to the hollywood boxing gym was on LaBrea and he said that guy would be out there every fucking morning at 7 o'clock blaring his music in the parking lot fired up and he said he would run up the stairs and he would train like a professional boxer he said he did everything I asked him to do did it exactly the way I told him to do it skipped rope situps when he's in there every day he literally transformed himself into a professional boxer there's a there's only a few guys who can hit that level that Daniel day-lewis that Denzel Washington level of commitment there's only a few guys who can do that so Daniel so there's only two guys that have ever seen that looked like real fighters Daniel day-lewis and Denzel Washington's Daniel Lewis get the fuck outta my stage ends oh that's crazy well I had it's gotta be Denzel who get tired he'll gas out he'll start off strong Daniel I just have the gas if I look at the boxer that Daniel day-lewis was and I looked at the boxer that you know Denzel Washington was I think Denzel Washington looks like a very good athlete moves very well but it looks more like Daniel day-lewis as a real boxer if we base it on their movie rules then Daniel day-lewis held that a long time as John Proctor and The Crucible Denzel Washington one of the best actors ever right yeah oh god yeah and you know what they gave him when it when they gave him the Oscar for what was you know Malcolm Kong no that's the thing they should have given them to him oh that performance if you ever go watch Malcolm X footage you know on YouTube what you can now they got ton very fascinating you look at that and you realized like that do you Tim want to talk about a Denzel Washington up at six training like a boxer he didn't even have YouTube to pull clips from he became Malcolm X the mannerisms the way he holds his hand as he speaks it's an it's crazy he should have gotten I think he got a nominee he should have won that year he didn't then they gave it to him years later for the King Kong ain't got nothing on me yeah that was the training day training day yeah which he was really good in it that's the thing he's like I remember when they first came the award I hadn't seen the movie I was like oh they're making up for fucking overlooking Malcolm X but then you see his performance in that movie and what could be a simple programmer or simple a good guy bad guy he ticked that role to the next level yeah so it may have been overdue payback for a fantastic performance he didn't get enough credit for but I think he earned that 10 I agree training day I agree with this performance yeah yeah he he legitimately seemed like a corrupt cop yeah he becomes it he's that one of those guys like him giving him there like smoking though he's like you're smoking the wet and like he enjoyed it like yeah it seemed real it's very very real when he was enjoying it yeah I mean to put your minds that place to allow yourself to go there you've got to get real close to crazy you got to get right next door neighbours to crazy you got to see crazy every morning when you're getting in your car morning crazy who you worked with the hill like I've seen someone go to that place we on red state we would Michael parks I don't think I've ever seen Michael parks and Melissa Leigh I went to a weird places like incredible places where I'm like oh shit this is otherworldly stuff like true fucking actors man true across them Michael parks is the preacher yeah yeah yeah listen folks if you see one movie this year see red state Kevin watch me to this movie no listen I had known nothing what this movie I had no idea and I showed up I showed up with Aubree and we had not a fucking clue in the world as to what this movie was about I assumed it was a comedy I heard some whisper online I heard it was a horror film question mark that's all I saw so I go in with an awesome blank slate and halfway into the movie I'm like what the fuck is going on I'm like it may be 35 45 minutes in I was like this is the craziest fucking this is Kevin Smith's movie it's you don't even it's like you have to throw out everything you think of as a Kevin Smith movie Kevin Smith movies are always fun comedies you know in this movie just get so fucking crazy so quick and just keeps and goes and you know I really I appreciate so much about that movie but what I really well the one thing that's staggering right off the bat was that guy who played the preacher Michael parks amazing if that guy doesn't get nominated for the Academy Award he there's so much attention yeah oh fuck Awards right fuck fuck dick who cares I know it's up to a seven-year-old man who this business turned its back on a long time ago and clearly has better chops and most of his peers who went on to other things it means something yeah that award it may not mean shit to me it means like me getting Awards but him that award means something it's still he comes from an era where it doesn't where it doesn't mean stuff well I wish we could substitute that with the the greater opinion of you know whatever people nice people all across the country people discerning individuals if you watch this movie and don't think this guy's a fucking super genius all that shit that I said about Daniel day-lewis the exact same shit I'm saying about this guy right there he was playing this fucking preacher and he had this one long non cut monologue I mean the camera is on him for a long fuckin time and it's all one run and it's brilliant thank you it's brilliant he sucks you in to the point where you're shitting your you know this is gonna something terrible is gonna happen you don't know when you don't know what and it keeps he just holds you there with this conviction in this character and this character's belief that is fucking scary it's fucking scary you know there's imminent death yeah like it's set up right there but his performance is so riveting he's so so fucking good at the craft that you'll put cuz the movies moving along at a nice clip right there we put the movie on pause be like ladies and gentlemen Michael parks and he does a fucking essentially a guitar solo the most amazing guitar solo you've ever heard and rather than be like move on fuckin get to the murders that we knew were coming people that kick back and go like oh my god that's so beautiful and he finishes the solo and the movie begins again it's it's pretty it's so weird it's pretty astounding ATAR solo what kind of music I mean you hurt you saw it it's him it's his voice I'm talking about Oh metaphorical oh Jesus Christ I was so hungry more stoned than me I must be because you keep going you keep going and dragging me in with you bitch well I'm an idiot this ain't even happened we're in this meditation tank you're in the meditation tank and we're just having this conversation come up an authentic before it oh yeah for sure I'll let you know how the character coming back and that guy did Fred Phelps well how much of this church guy and basically a bad bad dude created that character for me did that create the movie for you yeah a little bit I mean it was kind of a two or three pronged thing like number one I saw parks in from dusk till dawn which was Quentin's movie with Robert Rodriguez and he's in the opening 10 minutes he's distending like the this tile of acting love actors love people actresses people that could take the words off page make it sing but you know there's only so many ways to skin a cat and fucking even the best of them you pretty much like conceit of strings and whatnot you know how acting works every once in a while you meet one of these performers or see a performer lucky you get to meet him it takes it off the fucking grid off the charts yeah this guy does this in the opening of this movie which from dusk till dawn is a fun vampire fucking ramp romp rather this guy comes in and drops a performance that could have wanted show in a fair just world would have won a supporting Oscar nomination like you know Judi Dench gets one for Shakespeare in Love and she's in the movie what seven or nine minutes parks is in from dusk till dawn roughly at the same time and gives a performance that's as electric as believable as off-the-charts wonderful but you know it's a genre film so you don't get the attention and stuff this guy fell in love with him I'm watching that from dusk till dawn 1995 delenn lee Lumley sunset 5 Bob Weinstein is a humanitarian Babbitt's movie has it yeah fuck yeah I want to see the vampire movie and I want to go see this vampire movie made by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Regas but what I left there was with I have to work with that man I don't know who that fucking man is that sheriff guy in the first 10 minutes who spoilers spoilers movies fucking 16 years old but just in case he gets killed in the first fucking 10 minutes whole movie I'm like no that dude was the fucking truth the absolute truth I walk out of that theater I go I gotta work with that guy just sit at the fucking feet of a Yoda like that and and like for a month on a set man imagining my mouth fucking information you could glean steel fucking benefit from he's pure pure genius in acting form a clear genius when you're watching him it's so spectacular and riveting so guarded I told him there were days on set like I did we didn't do many takes at all because we were just you know we didn't have a lot of money and she was low-budget movie and when the performances of that good man got John Goodman Melissa Leo you got parts the crushing it take one and shit so you know I'll leave it up to them and they're like I'm good if you're good I'm like I got I don't direct the movie as much as I sit there and edit it in my head on set because you don't direct Michael Park something to go up to and be like here's how I'd do it based on my experience playing Silent Bob over the years did he ad-lib any of that oh yeah yeah got in there and definitely because it seemed like he could probably just start talking in that guy he seemed so in tune with that fucking character man yeah he was well he he had that script for what two three months ahead of time by the time he came to the set and I have no I'm not the author of that performance that guy offered his own performance hands down there across the board's you don't direct a movie like red state you just let it happen but all they care and keep it on the tracks this dude's like his he would he had the script for a while when he came to the set he's like kidding can I have the space can you show him into space and we brought him to the chaplain when they were still putting the finishing touches on it but he kind of did a laid out like the way you would lay out a dance he essentially kind of didn't say the dialogue out lab I just sit there and you'd watch him kind of moving his arms and stuff and it looked like he was slowly waltzing by himself and they'd stop somewhere and ask somebody put a mark here bah bah bah put a mark here then he put it all together I got to see what he was doing the next morning he had choreographed this fucking thing like he could do it from top to bottom like he could do the entire scene which was I think in the script 12 pages 12 pages of dialogue or something ridiculous like that and he could fucking do it from beginning to end and you watch him hit his marks he knew exactly where he wanted to be and stuff so much so that like I had done a draft right before shooting and I was like hey man this is the new version of the sermon and he fucking bristled because he was like no no no I mean that's other stuffs great what do you need this for well and what I realized was because he was dialed in like he knew what was gonna happen when he hit that stage he knew where to be so that he could just let his art come out of his mouth but he was still framing the movie for still commanding the stage as a movie let's keep things moving he wasn't content to just stand there and deliver dialogue which he could have and he still would have fucking captivated you instead he choreographed his movement it was fantastic he was dude that just gave beyond given you you know I wrote it with him in mind going I know what it's gonna sound like because I'm a big fan of this dude's work now and even getting to the set he would still deliver over what I heard in my head like oh I gotta remember I'll never forget what a month a month before we start shooting we're in my kitchens me John Gordon is Bruce Lee the movie and in parks and we're just talking about when we're gonna go it took a while to get money together and so we're leaving the kitchen and we're talking about something in the script and he stops and he goes he delivers one of the lines and he delivers it so flawlessly and it was the first time I heard parks do what would behave and Cooper and so I was like oh my god parks my heart skipped a beat and shit he left and I turn John Gurdon I was like dude he's gonna win an award I don't know what it is but like there's no way people don't cite him he's like it for that one line he slipped into a band Cooper you could hear it you can the gravitas of the life that Michael parks has led in forming like every every job he did or didn't get an entire life brought to bear on this he gave him he gave a monster some soul like you look at that character on the page very two-dimensional easy to hate Michael put a soul on him where you know you still hate him but you're like oh there's somebody under there you know he's not just like a 2-dimensional cartoon you could easily write off he brought something to it not wanted him to do 2-dimensional cartoon like I was looks like I'm gonna put you in track suits cuz that's what Fred Phelps wears and you know you can talk like him he goes I don't do that if you want me to do Fred Phelps impression get somebody else he's gone man's fucking boring he's like I came to act I was like right on and he did charismatic instead wow he's a dude man he don't fuck around this is a dude as a straight shooter you need seven years old he's not pulling punches he's gonna tell you exactly how he fucking feels and he would be a little intimidating though when you have that kind of a conversation with you wanted him to do that though right you wanted him to do this because of him and like he'll give you know like I'm a grown-up so I can take good ideas leave stuff behind he gave me the wonderful I seen the movie like it ends with somebody going shut the fuck up from off-camera without spoilers spoilers that came from parks it wasn't in the script it was just you know it just ended where it kind of ended without that and Parks was like how about instead you go off of me and I'm trying to be vague so as not to spoil it but I hope you remember well yeah I do totally go off of me singing and then you go down to another cell and there you are you know and and you say even a way way too much your movie right now just a little bit but again I said spoilers but it's tuned out folks yeah but anyway he goes that you say blah blah blah you say that one and I was just like I said parks I would love to but I think it'd be weird in this moment I like the idea that line I said but cutting to me in the movie I'm not in the movie and I think people would take people out of the movie and he goes why and I was gone because people would recognize me and he goes from what and I realize like oh my god guy like not he has no clue that like I've had this whole other career as far as he knows like it's red state and red state only knows I made some movies has no idea what they are didn't know I was in them or anything that was so sweet it was going in pure you know and I'm saying like this dude went in all about the craft and he dropped science on that performance and he would sit there from time to time like him be like can I grab one more take and I'd be like Parks you can have as many takes you want we were literally all here because of you because I saw that performance and from dusk till dawn so it was kind of like the whole movie was kind of a parks celebration you're right people that didn't know him fell in love with them as we made the movie because the dude just everyday you were awed by something he did but he were sitting there going oh my god like do you remember he starts singing in the movie at one point we had the whole chapel you know everyone in the chapel singing and and I said for some other part of the movie said hey man while this thing's going on over here on camera I'm gonna push in on you you want to sing one of those Gospel hymnals because he picked the other one old rugged cross I said you got another one you want to go in and he's like yeah man I can sing farther along you want that and I was like yeah whatever sure totally and we shoot him we're pushing in on him and he sings farther along and it's kind of as it is in the movie he's got this beautiful soulful voice the man had made records so oh its it sweeps me off my feet and it's a church song but I'm still way into it next act coming to work everyone on set periodically here and go my father and they're all singing it I'm like it's good I said right like it's catchy too like yeah for a Jesus song is pretty catchy and stuff so he brought that to it to the elements of singing ever yzma charisma and and that's what he went for he said he wanted to play it as a charismatic he had this whole backstory for like you know his not only a band Cooper's father but his grandfather he's like always very close with his grandfather he wrote a backstory himself to create for the character yeah he told me he's just like look he was tight with his grandfather and his grandfather was still fire and brimstone it was charismatic but he was still strict but his grandfather still also had a sense of humor for the kids so his grandfather would be the one in the kitchen you know pulling like a train whistle down with it one fist and lifting a leg and fartin with the other so we were still kind of human so he loved his grandfather and Cooper even though he preached and preached the holy word and he loved him for it his father also preached the holy word this is has killed me because part is going on all eloquently goes his father also preached the holy word but he probably touched his dick so he don't talk about his father ever it was like that's astounding dude that's amazing bizarre and he gave it thought he gave thought into buying the outfit dude he went out and picked out the the Wardrobe with the costume wardrobe person picked every piece she was like never really done that before god I mean I've gone out with girls who are looking for specific sizes but he right down to the underwear and the socks the dude had to be involved and picking the choices that what a he fo represent yeah and he put the outfit together I remember the first time she showed me a picture of him in the alphabet Beth passed Beth Beth talk anyway regardless Beth shows me pictures of Aben in and in his outfit Michael parks and I'm going oh man that ain't it at all I was looking for tracksuit ladies dude wearing some khakis and button-down shirt and a tie looks like a schoolteacher and I had you know I'd written my bread stayed on my brain for like five years you know wrote of five years ago and I've always had very specific idea of what he looked like which was stolen from the look of Fred Phelps and I remember going like I don't know man like how do I dress this I don't want him to wear this and she was like you might want to go with it he's dialed into the costume you know such a good choice because the clothes made the man like I don't even know how else to say I disentis it sounds corny but the the outfit made him just allowed him to do what he had to do up there he felt like if you see him early in the movie at one point he's at the protests holding a cup of coffee outside he's wearing just a jacket a windbreaker and a t-shirt or something but whenever he spoke the Holy Word he would put on what his Sunday best essentially and this was his Sunday best like the button-down shirt with the tie and he believed in presenting particularly if you're gonna go up there and preach the holy word you should look respectable all this philosophy behind just the outfit and the whole time I feared it until we went in front of cameras I was like this looks beautiful like the outfit is perfect in some weird way because it gives him this just air of respectability and that makes the shit coming out of his mouth that much more heinous I realize I'm still standing so he was yeah he's that guy's a unique talent it's it's hard to believe that it's taken him this long for well it's taken me this long to find out who he is hmm like why doesn't America weten and Robert Quentin Tarantino particularly made that charming quite a story I love this story because it shows you that we're all like fucking kids in this business we go see the movie of Quentin's got his own fucking movie theaters house looks like a fucking real movie the movie seats fucking popcorn shit he's got these awesome sculptures from his movies all around by this artist named Clete Shields great own personal movie Pierce it's about 50 or 60 or something like that nevertheless so we go watch red state there's me Quentin and parks Michael parks and he liked it he'd like to see leave really loved that I want to oversell it but he dug the movie so much he watched it without us when he wasn't supposed to like he got the print two days early we're supposed to watch it with him the day that we join him and he was like I'm gonna be honest with you I watched her ready twice fucking love it you know I was like oh do you don't have to apologize fucking awesome and shit so he watched it with us again then afterwards he goes come in the house and you know because the theaters separate from the house and he brings us in the house and this fucking charmed me I will never forget this he goes I got to show you my tape I got to show you my Michael parks tape and he goes into you know he's got a big entertainment centers DVDs everywhere and stuff high-tech everywhere but he also still has VHS dude lays hands on a fucking VHS tape but it almost as if I thought I hit the fucking flux capacitor cuz I seen one in a while and their scribble on the fucking side and marker because remember we used to write on the side of our videotapes when we made our own tapes Beth the best of Michael parks and Quentin froze this tape in and what it is is he's such a fan of this guy's work he loves him going back to then came Bronson he loves the students work so much anytime this dude is gonna turn up on TV or it gets a video of him he records from tape to tape or from TV to tape the segments of his performance everything that involves Michael parks and particularly the highlights and shit so what you have is a collection of like some of the cheesiest exploitation straight to TV movies or straight you know like about of high school volleyball team or college volleyball team and stuff like that murder mysteries and whatnot like real programmers and as he shown you the clips even though it's programmers all around him Michael parks are still in each one of these scenes that Quentin has pulled off and put onto this VHS dropping science performance science where you're just like this is crazy like the students doing Shakespeare in the middle of shit and you not to put off you know anybody who made those movies down or off or whatever but clearly like everyone else is kind of like you know here we are collecting a check and this is about the best furthest we can go and this dude is like crushing and crushing it like what movies a lot of TV I don't even know them dude they're all TV movies from like the 60s and 70s is a little bit into the 80s and that's what Quentin had collected he would like the Seas guy you know he's an encyclopedic knowledge of of cinema and even bad trash sent him up there is no such trash such thing as trash cinema to this guy he watched that move and he found gold like diamonds in the midst of shit that was just maybe simple or fucking programming material and he collected them for years on a fucking VHS tape long before he ever knew he would be a filmmaker long before he ever knew he'd meet Michael parks let alone become a filmmaker make movies with Michael parks in them direct Michael parks and inspire me and make a fuckin movie where I put Michael parks in it like yeah that's what he said to me he's like oh my god he's gone as a Michael parks fan I love this isn't oh this is the ultimate Michael Marx movie I was like right right so for me it was that was I loved that the tape dude he still had it if he had just told us the story of I said this tape man where I had the best that would have been cool enough dude but he produced it and we all watched it together and I sat in a chair off to the side and him and Park sat on a couch and it was there was I would have rolled the tear if it wouldn't have embarrassed him both or made him be like get out but there they were like the man whose work that this kid filmmaker loved so much think about the shit you made mix tapes of when you were here he made him this guy's performance and there he is watching that very same tape with the guy on the tape who you know the actor he loves oh I was touching you know that's inspiring but it's also inspiring that there's guys like Tarantino out there real enthusiasts you know due to getting really fucking super excited about some shit and that's like you with with fucking anime or whatever fuck like the shit that you're into you're super into you get geeky about yeah yeah yeah fucking movies yeah and that passion yeah are an slay to an audience for everything whatever it is that you're doing man I never want to see a fucking single it was UFC yeah UFC fight but when you talked about on the show I was just like when you came on our show I was like oh you know I would go see this now like that you when you talk about it with the passion enthusiasm you do translates to somebody who was never sold before and I wasn't even on the fence really but then when i watch you talk about like it's motherfucker smart like he's one of smart dudes I ever met everyone running the organization is intelligent it's it's it's a totally different thing than what people expect right here the term Cagefighting you think wow there's gonna be a bunch of you know barbaric assholes and you know and and mean people beating up other mean people that's not what it is at all I mean what it is is people that are trying to attempt to do the most difficult thing in all of sport put your body and your health at risk to go after another person's body and shut it down and take it out it's the game of all-time but it's the oldest game of all time male dominance over other men and look we have a society where obviously that's illegal you can't you can't beat people up you can't it's good we want everything to be civilized we want but in this the midst of evolution when we find ourselves in this to this stage along the way from changing from a wild animal to a conscious being we still got a lot of chimpanzee DNA that needs to be satisfied and there's one or two ways to do it either you can suppress it you can pretend it doesn't exist or you can give it something like porn or violence on television and movies and in in and in sports you could give it something to live vicariously through I like porn yes if because if you don't have these other ways to live vicariously through there's only one other way around it you have to go find whatever it is you're looking for whether it's fine violence or fine sex but if you can get violence and sex in the television form you can eliminate it from real life the Japanese have believed this forever the Japanese believe that you know you're much more likely to commit heinous sexual crimes if it's difficult to get laid you know I mean they're so freaky over there you can buy used women's panties and dispensers that's ridiculous you put some cash you buy underwear and their porn is you there's no pubic area yeah it's only nipples and even those are kind of very strange shaking out but their animation and their comic books yeah fucking like intense a lot of bondage a lot of fucking cocks - yeah valia but vain later not allowed to see hair people kisses are theirs yeah they have it's an it's got to be weird when an entire country looks so similar physically I mean obviously you can tell the difference between one Japanese guy to another I know a lot of Japanese people but essentially the vast majority of the people that live in Japan have this one look dark hair you know the the Japanese look I mean they are a clear race you know it's gotta be so strange to be a part of such a specific ethnicity like I'm a mutt you look like you're probably a mutt you're a mutt you know we're a combination if I'm a little bit of Irish a little bit Italian but you know I'm just a white guy you know to most people but when you you know Japanese people like that is a very clear it's gotta be very strange to be a part of like a real powerful dominant like you know what I'm saying like it's like like you look at like like like it's very it's some Italians you can see this and you know you look at them and you know clearly that guy's some sort of an Italian guy you know or if not he's Armenian or something like that you know that sort of dark look but it could be a bunch of different things Japanese guys look like Japanese guys you know if you understand what like the the Asian people look like you know Koreans have a different look to them but it's it must be interesting to be a part of like one of I mean how many millions of Japanese people are there you know and to have such a similar look with all these different people that like you that you could be recognized immediately somewhere else in the country you know I think it'd be awesome to have a culture like they have a culture I feel like we I mean we have pop culture which they got because that's why I have a job but they have a culture that goes back eons and we don't write much we don't really have a culture that goes back eons would always impress me about the Japanese is the culture of discipline they've had this culture of discipline and of martial arts you know the discipline of war and strategy like way before any of the European countries ever figured out what the fuck was going on right you know the the Shogun this tattoo that I have on my arm is Miyamoto Musashi battling a tiger this is this famous samurai guy and he wrote this book called the book of five rings this amazing book man where you got to get into this guy's head that he's living I believe it was the 15th century so I think it was like the 1400s I might be wrong but whenever he was writing this book basically he was a ronin so he would travel the earth he had no no master he had no Emperor so he was traveling the earth basically having fucking sword fights at people he had like 60 duels one-on-one duels with other men and killed them in hand-to-hand one-on-one combat I mean it's a crazy thought to think about killing people with swords this guy did it to like 60 different guys swords and in some situations he he thought swords are too easy he would let them use a sword and he would use a stick and he was fucking it was a fascinating character but his his whole life was based on unbalance it was about art it was about philosophy it was about it was about seeking the correct way and for him the way of the sword was simply the way to be successful the most successful movements in any given situation as far as what combat is but he equated this combat to artistic integrity the ability to create things freely the ability to draw and paint the ability to write poetry and and to elegantly express your feelings to him it was all connected it was all one piece of excellence and that it was like a guide to live your life by and he had this this statement that I read when I was a kid and I always stuck with me once you understand the way broadly you can see it in all things the ID the idea being that once you find out how to tap into anything you like find out how to be a great movie director find out how to be a great guy who draws animation a fucking singer would you or chess player fine the once you understand the way broadly you can see it in all things this is a translation from Japanese so that's not probably not totally accurate but what what that's what he meant is that you you find greatness you find greatness as a carpenter you find greatness as a samurai does that same thing when you just tap into the zone where you're just really tuning into whatever the fuck you're doing and then you let creativity sort of spread it out for you comes better with age too doesn't it yes that it's just like comes over the one with awareness I think we're not even just the age I think the age is just experience and that's awareness yeah ventually awareness I don't think it's necessarily just age there's a lot of people that they get older and they put that box closer and closer to their head you know they didn't want to see less and less of the world right it's a it's all your your seeking as well you're not trapped in some sort of a box every day so as you get older of course you're you're gonna get more tuned into things you're constantly still asking the questions you're not trapped in a slave box I to be a destination guy I talked about it with Mosier on SModcast quite a bit back in the day I was destination he was very journey oriented for him it was all about like hey man everything's a journey and you know it's like the journey is the fucking fun and blah blah blah and I was like no destination get there I just want to get to where we're supposed to be the last few years I've flipped and now I am kind of like the journey is more important to me and you know why that is why cuz your riches fuck no it's that too but it's also you're successful you think you don't have to worry about it anymore yeah you're fucking Kevin Smith you got two million mutton friends on follow followers on Twitter you can talk to them whenever you want to they want to come and see your movies you're in this weird zone where you don't have to give a fuck anymore yeah you know there's something for the best and I love the expression and I have co-opted it but they said they said he doesn't Kevin doesn't have to work for anyone anymore because he works for the audience and I was like oh god that's perfect it's true that's it if you could get to that place where it's not about like fuck everyone Nona but you don't rely on anybody right for anything it's all coming from within you your camp or something like that not like there's no help of course you could help within your world but do you know how comforting it is to know that I don't have to do
