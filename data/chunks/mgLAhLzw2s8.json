months right yeah that's what I have been doing and then it kind of is okay for a while Yeah right and once every six months seems to keep me in but so is it not is not curing whatever it's healing it but it is seeing a moron right and going back to working out hard right but we were just saying is that soft tissue yeah heels like this is a soft tissue issue yeah soft tissue is one of the best things for things like stem cells to therapy because you can actually regenerate tissue right and it can heal things where it gets a real problem my friend Miriam Nakamoto she brought over those snacks those bags of snacks over there they're really a snack company she's a multiple time world Muay Thai champion boy enjoy muy Thai Muay Thai Thai boxing more time now never heard of that no

cruising along and just like lost five pounds just kind of like hanging around and then I realized I'm working out like this workout that I'm doing is would have it'll warm up when I was an athlete right like this wouldn't even have been a warm-up and I'm like oh that was pretty good stop being a sissy and try and really push a little more what'd you get a trainer yeah I don't like intimacy

a bunch of really good ones I don't have any affiliation with any of them so you're not naming any of them yeah you can you can you could even get a yoga one you get a 90-minute yoga one right just do yoga and it would talks you through the poses it's great yeah I used to do yoga all the time but I feel like I've got to uh I feel I have to shift into lifting weights again yeah like it's been dropping nodes but I just feel like you know a little bit I don't want to be like the pool with no arms you know I mean so many people have motivated the building by going to the beach or the pool with very little clothes on I thought about Fox summertime fuck people are gonna know reveal my secret disgusts me about yeah this is my glow look at it this is my laziness look this is what I did all this my poor food choices right here look this is drinking yes yeah this is the part right on the sides but I really just but then when I started getting after and being like don't be such a sissy like workout right try and push it then you want it then I wanted to do it more then I got into it then I'm like alright let's go now I'm going further I'm going quicker but uh this is all been cardio yeah all cardio what about just bodyweight stuff like you know I mean it's not a bad idea to start off with bodyweight first photoshop's yeah because you haven't really done much like that in a while yeah it's chin ups push ups and the bodyweight squats really don't need much it's really not really I've been doing more push-ups pins at a ferocious workout in with change grip push-ups chin-ups bodyweight squats just to just those things does that mean I have to get one of those chin up bar as it goes in the doorway that yeah I get a real one though because those things fall and people die the ones that hang folks listen to me yeah those ones that hang on the door the door jamb yeah I used to work construction those fucking things are not designed for you little tiny nails people like me probably installed them and sometimes you don't hit a stud yeah that little tiny nail is going right into the fucking drywall yeah and you're hanging that thing over there and it's pulling on that sucker no they don't mess my shoulder fuckers that drill into the side of the door you know what I'm saying then the ones that they go right in the side doing this way oh into the gym like four screws on each side it's like that'll hold your weight alright I don't hold your weight I'll get that that one will work cuz it's a pull you're pulling down on the wood yeah the way those things that's like sitting on the wood you know those ones that hit ya that shit is a recipe for a broken neck I feel like that thing was in like every 80s movie yeah I'm sure they have good ones that do that I'm sure yeah sure but you should really check out your fuckin moldings first yeah moldings a point I just lay on the ground and do some push-ups yeah but a real chin up bar man a real chin up bar is I mean if you just got one in a park just go to the fucking Park you're outside the Oh a lot of parks have like those yeah bars those little setups we could do callously yes yeah nobody ever gyms are no joke those are great for working out I know they seem too simple you seem like old ladies with us go over there bro I go to Nautilus I don't need this right exactly I do my leg extensions on Nautilus I got my membership I use once a month bodyweight squad seem easy when you do three yeah when you do a hundred they become very fucking hard right when you get to like 70 you're like whole shit you rid of that burn baby and you start counting down tens we're doing pushups 100 you're played football and you do you know 200 would be like 200 break him on a row no break them up you in a row they would we do like 30 mm-hmm and then you know split them up and you know there was a big-time workout and now I'm doing like 25 I'm like I'm good for a couple of days it is getting anywhere more than 30 push-ups it's like whoosh it starts getting crazy yeah a lot of pushing yeah to like your body has to be conditioned for that and if it's not it lets you know your arm starts shaking the funniest part is hockey around 19 though you get to like 18 19 like bro I'm feeling fucked it's smooth it's so funny how whatever number you have in your head is where you start to write if you say I'm doing 20 you start shaking at 18 if you say I'm doing 25 you don't start shaking until 23 you know it's a real mental thing you know it's really fucking cool and I gone rogue makes this thing that it's uh it's like a bamboo pole and on the end of the pole you put rubber straps yeah like you know those bands that yeah and then from those bands you hang kettlebells off of the bamboo stick yes so as you're doing this benches I can't push my lift my right arm up it's okay right now otherwise I'll show you as you're doing this thing everything's all wobbly and everything is super super wobbly because first of all the kettlebell is hanging from rubber right and the the the stick this bamboo thing is super wobbly and as you lift weights with that it's really good for your stabilizing muscles called an earthquake bar that's earthquake cool watch the video online or someone will take us offline yeah the earthquake bar yeah it's exactly the one I have we will have that out there I'll show you tf2 words and it's really cool because even lightweight like if you had to do 70 pounds yeah like 35 on each side it's awkward for that that doesn't look like something you want to use in your house you're gonna ruin your floors put rubber on the floor rubber on the floor and put rubber over your house so nothing gets ruined did you do you have grandparents to put plastic over the furniture oh yeah my Nana yeah they put fucking plastic over the furniture it was a big deal you spent a lot of money on that couch you're gonna it's gonna my fuse when I was a little kid I'd sit on that couch heavily this is terrible especially in the summer with your shorts your legs just be sweating at Manas and they they eventually got kind of like yellowed by the Sun and by you shackling so it was weird yeah is like oh you would like put like a jacket down and then you would sit on your jacket that whole generation never had comfort like their beds were hard the pillows were shit live through the fucking depression man yeah that's real that shit people starved to death no this was a barbaric time where people were brought down to you know base humanity just rival ruff and then you have like you have like 15 good years and then go into World War two and they dealt with that so yeah they were like we don't need comfort we're not laying around in our sweat pants on beanbag chairs well they knew the importance of being vigilant right like we all know do you ever do you follow david Goggins online no David you know he is no David Goggins is this Navy SEAL who now is more or less like a motivational and fitness info the run the guy who was dude broken knees though he's a fucking Savage yeah I was clipped how many 100-mile runs that he run in a row some fucking preposterous number remember I want to think that can't remember at all I want to say six or seven but then it's like 12 or three of 100-mile member I don't remember at all but there his whole thing is stay hard like he'll send me a text out of nowhere like just say stay hard motherfuckers out there yeah because like first of all yeah if you're a Navy SEAL right this is the pinnacle of hand hand combat and and the Armed Forces those motherfuckers are all special human yeah and then on top of those motherfuckers being all special humans there's guys that can just just put a little that message out like hey you you are soft as fuck compared to how people used to be right all soft as fuck compared world war two people the state you got to stay vigilant back then everybody had to stay vigilant yeah yeah you had to deal with just day-to-day life you had to deal with what was coming from Hitler what a tune in at a certain time to find out what was happening yeah everybody had to gather around the TV for the news that was all the news you got that's all the news you got I got an hour's worth that was it what the fuck is going on nothing nothing and they were better a reward and they they may just say really what's I'm so tired of that whatever for it I don't need to know not better off for it why way better off recognizing that you're luckier than those people having some fucking disciplined watching a David Goggins Instagram clip and get your fucking shit together I agree with everything you just said but I'm saying you're better they were better off not being fed a news diet 24 hours yeah mentally mentally poor the first human beings that have had to deal with this lot it's a double-edged sword because if you don't get fed that you don't find out about Julian Assange getting kicked out of the Embassy in London you don't find out about a million different stories that are in the news it's a fun story it's a cool story but do I need to know it quote for you from now on what about Julian Assange Tom Papa hands up in clothes it's a fun story it's a close story but I don't need to know it really you just redefined white privilege seriously what can I do about a lot of these you know look I think it's good that information is flowing and that moves everybody forward but you know for me sitting in there trying to tell some jokes and feed my kids it's like do I need to know everything every trouble spot going around the world oh it's like that is very good question it's like how much responsibility do you have to be tuned in to all the events of the world and to act like how much responsibility do you have outside of voting and do you have the responsibility to vote because there's some people that are very interesting people that don't vote yeah you know I don't agree with that yeah it's a I want to participate I understand that but I don't think Michael malice votes doesn't he does didn't he say he doesn't vote I think he said he doesn't forget his reasoning but it was very logical uh-huh now I understand the argument but I am even if it seems kind of false and I just I think it kind of like mentally engages you in the world yeah you you should be trying to participate I think his perspective is that as a commentator on the world that'd be better off if he didn't actually vote mm-hmm and just look at it how he really sees it on both sides right if I'm just a partial yeah I'm sure I'm butchering the way he would phrase it right I think it's a lot in the spirit of that yeah if you vote you don't have a right to complain that was deep but I think but look it's it's a lot look I think it's trying to be a good person on just a person level and trying to take care your family and work hard and be good with people and help your community that's kind of the extent of what you can do and hopefully that spreads out but you know right Julian Assange okay I mean why is that you know well like all those people that we're talking about at that generation that only got news during that six o'clock hour mm-hmm you know were they less citizens of the world because they only got that little dose I don't know they were less informed and the idea is that more people can get away with things they shouldn't be able to get away with like what's happening right now with Julian Assange Julian Assange in anybody's estimation if you look at what he did he distributed information that was extremely interesting to most people in the world that didn't know about it right exposed a lot of scary shit yeah he supposed a lot of corruption as opposed a lot of I mean what what corruption did it expose I know it exposed there was that was a Collateral Murder video that was the one of the first ones I they showed them shooting they'd shot these guys were they thought were soldiers and they were they were reporters and it was sort of just the way they dealt with it it was very scary for people watching that someone could just like dehumanize accidentally killing the wrong people right I make it like that was the military they were making it like you know hey but you kind of have to be in that mindset to be able to gun people down from the sky in the first place whoa look you gotta put yourself in the perspective someone wants to do that job yeah and you take a regular person and then you train them to do that job and then you ask them to go and pull the trigger people did they're gonna develop a coldness to them well you know they have to yeah right but to see it so mm what Julian Assange did is he showed it to us and then he released all sorts of I mean I haven't I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't really studied all the files and what was released and what wasn't apparently was the no and Ben Shapiro was here he said that people's names got put out and apparently that was someone hacked into WikiLeaks and released that information before they could redact the names this was the this is what I've been told by multiple sources so in it but again I didn't look into it I don't know if that was correct so they're gonna say that he was treasonous or that he was I don't know what they're gonna say I think that you're the first thing was a sex charge that's what they were trying to say that he had sex with a woman they where he wore a condom and then they had sex and then they had sex in the morning with no condom and she didn't consent to that that he just kind of did it or something I think was something more I think they called it surprise sex uh-huh and if I'm butchering this I'm sorry but the that didn't make sense like that there would be going after him that way well you know obviously not about that yeah you go after if you want to get somebody you go after or whatever I think yeah I'm like hacking charges now right yeah I don't know I know a little crazy in the in the embassy right he wouldn't clean up after his cat and he was on a scooter around is that true that's what I don't know who knows what's true I know that's probably but that's was part of the little story that I caught the little dog was shocked she was poetically describing what the embassy was smelled like with julian assange dirty cat shit wafting through the halls is crazy asshole you have staying here won't leave Pamela Anderson comes over every now and then they get their freak on surveillance footage of Julian Assange skateboarding and the Ecuadorian Embassy in London has been leaked kinda okay yeah but here's the thing man like what do you want the guy to do is there a problem he's there for seven fuckin years now he must have gone crazy yeah I mean that's like being you know under house arrest dude I mean it's amazing that he lasted that long what they did they waited him out and then when it they were never gonna wait him out he was gonna stay in there forever and then the guys got sick of him they just got sick of him I think there was also of the Ecuadorian president I think he took a photograph in front of like some lobsters and shit and it was from a leaked email and that photo got out and it was very embarrassing to him because his country's in a deep financial crisis oh and he's chilling in some Four Seasons somewhere he loves turning Staker yeah yeah well I don't know I mean look it's funny that when you see pictures of Trump he's eaten Kentucky Fried Chicken Kentucky Fried Chicken private jet hilarious he really loves that stuff loves it really fucking loves fast food like when he got all those they came to visit him when the government was shut down and brought him all fast food he didn't understand that look what the fuck I know this shit and then he had another team showed up months later and he broke up as food again the government was hope just imagine the fucking you're going to see the President of the United States and you're a professional athlete Yeah right your body literally is a temple and major college athletes but let's be real about that huh a fleet should get fucking paid crazy that's the biggest robbery and all of athletics yes college sports nobody get a chance to get into the NBA in the NFL yeah they do but you're making billions on these kids fucking billions don't get my sweatshirt money $20 I'm telling you man this guy in terms of like material current and future it's almost like we glutton doubt it's almost like Trump was ice cream when he was in office he was so good for comedy that it was like there's so many Trump jokes now everyone's like no more I need something else I can't have ice cream these were one more bite yeah he's gonna come chuck it out of your throat it's really true it's so he's so fucking eccentric like good or bad just look at him as a human it's such a rare yeah you know I mean you've seen it with the with the hair and the fucking constant golfing even though he's shit fucking Obama golfing and he's gone even try to pretend he's not a hypocrite no none at all he's just everything he's just the the fat American on a jet ski just letting it rip if you know it's also hilarious is good yeah I think this is a real thing Trump derangement syndrome I think it's real you mean people that are obsessed with him they're obsessed with you know this is the thing that's gonna get him he'll be out of office in three weeks instead of like looking at it look this is the argument for garlic Michael Mouse that he's an objective analyst stepping back looking at this uh-huh he's doesn't he have a vested interest in this guy winning or that Cayenne and winning he's just going what is this right sitting back and watching yeah this is if I'm going to take that position not emotionally involved because some people get so emotionally involved they can't sleep they start crying they think it's the end of the world the world is exactly the same we just have a different figurehead and I think it would present challenges that'll make us more understanding of each other I do that's what I really think I think there's there's good and bad about every situation but with the Pro I see is communication if we're just honest with the way we communicate I think people on the right and people on the left they share a lot in common there's a lot a lot that they share rather than what they don't share in common yeah you know the only thing they don't share is what they're watching right and it's also the vibe you get yeah like there's the vibe from these whatever whether it's CNN whatever show you're into MSNBC Fox News they all give out a vibe yeah and that vibe is you know we are right here's what's going on here's why that's a problem right you know and everyone has a different problem and everyone thinks they're right right and you have so you have different things you some of them have like Eagles and flags and Rachel Maddow trucks and some guns so that comes your team that becomes your club that's what it is it's the team thing most of it and and the unfortunate part is both are saying are spending so much time rather than thinking about yeah this is the problem that we have to deal with they're spending all their time thinking those other people are assholes right exactly it's being it's the the venomous attacks against fellow Americans because they have a slightly different view about health care that part is the the derangement of the culture right now they're not enemies they're Americans in the you know we're all on Team America exact we really agree to this fucking thing looking at bro exactly we're all together I'll show you something bitch it is a wild country when you travel around look at my phone Wow flag blows in the wind bro it moves with America's a concept I don't think it's a bad thing to believe in America as a concept now kind of we're getting better we're working on this I think this idea that this like people were complaining that someone put the American flag on a cop car in California that shit yeah yeah like hey this is we're in America what do you mean they put us wrong with American flag on a cop car like just draped it over it like they had like the side panel where it says the police department has the American flag incorporated into their logo now like what do you hate America yeah what's wrong with that I like it yeah it's pretty fuckin they drove up gonna be problem who doesn't like the American flag what's wrong with being a patriot this imperialism it's everything it's all the good - it's all the creativity yeah all the art all the love all the positive people all the opportunity people it's amazing we're one country look at this oh my god listen to this fucking quote we have such an amazing community of artists here and I thought the aesthetic didn't really represent our community this person said it feels very aggressive here in the winners team okay you're in Laguna be aggressive an artist in Laguna Beach just loving life margaritas every day at 4:00 its aggressive that's what you can walk around with flip-flops you fucking idiot it's aggressive it's not aggressive to you it's not aggressive police your friends the whole something happens to your house who do you want to come where this water is what a color kit or the police but they're not even saying that like the police car the colors on the car yeah well they're not saying we should map police right I think that flag is too aggressive yeah but it's the flag and the police yeah why does the flag make it more aggressive that is so stupid I don't get it but it's that thought process there's something wrong with us well there is that there is that knee-jerk reaction from people on the far left to think that everything we do is evil you know from the beginning of the country to now we're just corrupt and evil and awful well then why are you still here why are you going to the arcade they would all admit that it has great qualities the problems is the problem is when people really focus on only negative aspects right the negative aspects of this country are real they're real of course from top to bottom in every way in every in every group of human beings the negative aspects are real but this group of human beings in a relatively short period of time has a man I think this group human beings has managed to accomplish insane architecture music comedy writing that's right and dominate the world I mean it's a crazy fucking weird place but you have innate the world in a democratic sense right with with a democratic election in in their country in a mostly peaceful manner the real problem was and then you start wondering like what the United States does outside of this country and whether or not they should be doing it right it's like are they doing this because they have to do this because this is the way the rules work in that country or I mean why are they propping up this guy when this guy is clearly a dictator is it better to have the dictator in charge they have it become a failed state like Libya all the shit that's way beyond our pay grade right right exactly let's get screwy you say like yeah I don't like what America does overseas okay I don't exactly know what they do and I don't think you do either no exactly I think there's some until julia some people know right some people are super educated informed I'm not I'm not denying that yeah what I'm saying is that most of the people that have these really aggressive opinions yeah about these things yeah look this don't necessarily think they've thought about it too deeply no but you also know that you know look everybody knows the country does some dirty stuff in places that wasn't cool what country doesn't you're right guy exactly it's like the the thing thing these militaries and these countries have to do in order to keep peace and stay alive yeah and and you know you want to shine light on that so maybe it's not done again but it's a it's it's part of the thing that we talked about before about like our grandparents not having a lot of the information and in a way that you're living in the dark and that's bad but in a way you're living in the light now and you see everything the problem with seeing everything I think it kind of is a problem is that you realize that no organization no country no government is flawless no person they're flawed everything is flawed and everything and now we have this idea that if somebody isn't perfect they should be just run out of town cancel yeah cancelled kicked out of office whatever yep we're all flawed everybody's flawed and this idea because we can find everything else out you can expose everyone's flaws well we're gonna have to come out of this somehow realizing that flaw doesn't mean that they're evil or they're negative and they have to be kicked out do you think there's ever gonna be a time in in humans like whether it's a hundred years from now or thousand years now where there's no war yes yes I do how do you see that happening well it's gonna start with cop cars with flags on them and they're gonna patrol around I think it would be technology and I think it's a matter of everybody becoming more comfortable if you can if you can have people this is like a Thomas Friedman idea that if if you want to stop like people fighting in the Middle East give them all the comforts of a good society let them be able to go eat McDonald's and sit in a coffee shop and all of a sudden you don't want to fight as much and that means prosperity that means popping so I think technology if you can bring more water to people and there's less suffering if climate change doesn't Jam ruin all of that I think if you can prop these people up and give all these people if they can rise then there's no sense I mean we're at a point now where there's fewer Wars than ever before on the planet sure so we're headed in that direction so I don't see why not well as a thought exercise let's look at it this way what makes anybody decide to act as a group what makes anybody like if why would we decide to go if right what negotiations should we be having with someone in Germany like why why why are we having a conversation about anything you live way the fuck over there on the other side of the ocean what would make people act as a group and go over and try to fuck with somebody else that's right that's in another place like well people could be people can definitely be rallied all right for any cause most certainly but do you think this is my thought there will come a time where that kind of rallying doesn't work mm-hmm that people will stop believing I mean this is one of those very bizarre ideas that the system's that we've established for for human civilizations with countries or cities or continents right whatever it is yeah these systems wants all the boundaries that kept people from freely traveling although once those are broken down no country anymore they keeping it this keeping it together now is the fact that it's air travel so they know when you're coming in they get to check your papers right oh you're flying in from overseas are you mr. papa well there's only one way motherfucker you got to land right here right in this spot and then we take each individual and say can I see your paperwork what do you got who are you where are you from where are you born do you have money or you're drug addict you've been arrested and then they're allowed they could still do that that way that didn't exist if it was way easier to go to Germany oh yeah there was a technology that would allow you like a person like you or me the same way we could drive places we could just fly into somewhere and land anywhere yeah you'd have to go to a fucking specific location like an airport huh or get funneled through a road that takes it to some you know right some checkpoint station like when you're trying to drive open borders just if people could fly yeah if people if people flew anywhere they wanted to go if that technology existed good fucking luck keeping people from coming into your city good luck all those rules are out the window yeah all those immigration rules that doesn't exist anymore right and exist people can go anywhere they want to hate it but what are you saying that gives you well it gives you the interaction with human beings like you you won't be able to get them as a group as easily to go after another group right because now there's no country basically there's no like thing to right we're not part of this that has to go fight that we're all one now here's a view of one person lives in a great spot they don't want to give up the oil right right then it becomes a problem right come on resources we're all in this together those people in Alaska you know yeah they got all that fucking oil bro here's here's two things though here's two things of why it might not work one of Ecology thousand things but only two that I can think of okay one Italians are Italians and Germans are Germans and Mexicans are Mexicans and you get around your people and you feel it and you know it and I know who you are and we're part of that tribe and we're part of that thing and it doesn't matter that we grew up somewhere I just know you as an Italian and I'm an Italian and I am with you and that is very different from that Turkish guy over there hmm that thing that very human thing chemistry thing of your own blood your own thing I don't think that's gonna go away for bro you're old-school and you bake bread fix your eyes without glasses your friend your friend you give them hey the shit is actually really good for fertilizer all right well I'm gonna blow your mind with my technology end of this conversation which I just read an article yesterday that in China face recognition is the thing that's gonna stop your fantasy of everybody just loving each other and going around in China there too with face recognition they're able to recognize and categorize Muslims in the country there's like this one sect of Muslim in China and there with all the space recognition that they're seeing you know from your phone from everything they're starting to catalog the enemy and they're and they're going to be able to the police are sharing information and hotels and everybody and they're all now through this network know what type of person just walked into this building and whether they're friendly or they're the enemy and that thing that face recognition thing is could end up splitting us apart even more hmm old-timey Tommy with his technological facts here China's Big Brother surveillance technology isn't nearly as all-seeing as the government wants you to think this is kind of like they might be able to upgrade it though it says you can for sure yeah that's one now when your phone unlocked with your fingerprint and it blew your motherfucking money it's my finger even worse my pinky five fingerprints on this motherfucker it said I get to do the side of my thumb and it still knows just glasses the cop what do you mean was that a cop it's a cop with Google glass it's got some sort of face recognition thing it's like that time movie I'm a dirty report what was that real yeah I don't know but that's you know I I tried a Google glass on once I actually went through a whole UFC weigh-ins wearing a Google glass I was filming it I guess ah it wasn't ready right it wasn't ready and I think yes how are they haven't upgraded it oh yes let's hold off cuz this is not working yeah been a while did not either that dorky shit and people got super uncomfortable when you around them it's like holding a camera and everybody walking around with a fucking camera everywhere I think they'll have something eventually but I have a feeling it'll be something where there's a technology light or the outside you you can't see things when the inside you can and then they'll show you images like directly in front of you on the lens so you wear glasses like your glasses huh but it'll show you things right right in front of you like I yeah I got one that I heard that I don't know if I understand and believe that this is real but I've just googled it and then I found something that makes it seem like it so the next version of the VR headsets are supposed to have brain tracking in them and that sounds super wide but it's already like being implemented and tested you get a knock on your door oh you think about we thought you were a regular person but you're beating off a hundred times we like you imagine if they want to have a talk to you like mr. Papa you watched 14 hours of pornography this week yeah that seems a lot yeah I think your mother would think that seems like a lot I mean I want to talk to her well they say employers are gonna do that insurance companies are gonna do that and they're gonna be able to much you're beaten on how much you're beaten off how much you working out how much you're sleeping whether and what look at that whether these two share only good stuff very sure that's like Google when they said don't be evil yeah abandon that once you start making money they think fuckin paint it right over that side man I mean what is evil evil SHM evil we're going in that direction yeah man it's going in that direction yeah it's all going to some sort of a wearable thing that connects you but a weird thing that like everywhere you're going there picking off your face and then you're gonna be able to they're gonna know exactly what you are and who you are and you know it's strange it's strange but it is it any more strange than our lives today in comparison to people that lived in 1920 like we were talking about oh yeah this is way weirder when we weightless super weird way weirder we're in weird town already for sure you just knew doesn't get into the hands of people that can really mess with you oh yeah the people the money yeah put the money and all the control yeah gonna be cool with it right yeah it'll be great they'll be alright yeah it'll be fun everything's gonna be fine do you have a LexA in your house oh yeah yeah my kids do my for my one friend is always trying to tell me just get that out of your house it's listening to everything that you say and everything don't say anything bad in that room yeah it's I had a question about that you know neuro-link might be coming on soon or whatever I was thinking about like if if it got to the point where like say we all got it and then everyone you knew had it and there's like a thousand people that have it wouldn't we hit a like a threshold point we're like not everybody should have this we're good at this point right here well how would you ever deny people something like that the cost they might be really expensive no but I mean how would you ever know you can't deny people that won't like to say if someone's coming up and they want to try it and everyone else has it that would that would create a giant problem that'd be like if you said that with cell phones too many people have cell phones where we stopped you no more buying cell phones I know that's why sort of think that there might become a big problem with that why what is no link I don't hold on I understand why you think I just sort of think that if in the theory that you're really gonna let thousands of people have instant access to the world's knowledge at their finger out of thoughts like instant that becomes too powerful in the wrong hands and the people that might have it first might see the future problems of that I'm just what I was wondering I was thinking way too far Jamie got Superman so you know that probably won't be a problem or well no I thought I can't stop it I don't wonder I don't think that anyone can say that's not gonna be a problem yeah I don't know I mean what is a problem though it's gonna be something it's gonna be a something yeah it's gonna be one has access to all the world's information instantaneously first of all colleges are going under Sun how's my first class like they're gonna fight that all day and so I don't think they can but to be able to the amount of money that you would make off of something that made everybody super smart yes you would there's no way you imagine if you found out how ironic would it be if you found out that like Stanford and Harvard or banded together to try to stop this from coming out because it would kill their business and it was like you know just like a college admissions scandals going down oh yeah so great if there was a scandal that all these higher universities had banded together to try to stop this because he was gonna kill their business yeah bit like everybody can know everything we tell them more than everything we tell I'm going on some college tours already Jesus Christ yeah oh my god it really makes you think like why do they really need this this is expensive oh yeah they really need a degree and all of this I don't know it's a weird business man it's a dollar weird business I don't know why it cost so much I'll tell you why why because the administrators are all making Bank is that what it is yeah it's all the money so all these kids generations are in debt because they have to take these student loans college is more expensive than ever before well it hasn't changed running the university leaving the teachers with it's the administration of these giant universities are making so much money they're making millions and they keep cranking it out and they keep needing to up the up the rate and then they make money accessible for the students through loans and then they keep feeding themselves it's horrible it's a horrible corrupt system and it's um it's also subsidized right well the government will subsidize some yeah yeah yeah how much is the government subsidized private education private education I don't think any yeah yeah you get fast Fallone though yeah it's so expensive I mean you know it isn't that where - there's like state schools private schools yes no they're all cost money mm-hmm everything costs money yeah what is it like to get to like us see how much is like a semester at us 70,000 NoHo now that semester a year a year is it 70,000 roughly 70 50 for the year yeah that's like the that's the that's the online Google search thing that's 50 plus your room and board plus all the rest and if your kid fucks off yes which of course they're gonna do and by the way to have 50 grand you need to make like 80 right what taxes oh yeah no you gotta make 80 grand yeah for a whole year of your kid being in school yeah and if your kids just doing bong handsome totally my father dropped me off to school at school and I was like a sophomore and it just drove me into college and drop off my stuff and I was so psyched to go see my friends and like just come you know just work hard be responsible okay dad okay okay I go running into my dorm room my buddies are there I haven't seen them all break Tom they hand me a bong Hey I light up as soon as I walk in my bags or even haven't even dropped I light it with my lighter and this huge flame comes out and poof almost like lights my face on fire like blah blah hey papa your dad's outside he's in the van I'd forgot something I forgot a lamp in the van I go running out there I'm like hey what's up you know hoping I don't smell he goes hey you forgot you what happened your eyebrow your eyebrows burnt off what did you do in the two minutes I just took the lamb thanks dad see Jack sees writing checks for me to go do that no yeah it's brutal Jesus I was just tuition I saw yeah 75 $75 USC 1-year room and born at 15 3 that's gotta be low that's just about it over a thousand a month it's gotta be yeah man and that's without like if your kid if you live on the East Coast and you're flying your kid back and forth and all the rest of it but look at personal expense personal and miscellaneous 1,400 bucks for the year for the under bucks a month get out yeah yeah that's crazy get it forget it books are gonna be way more than a hundred bucks a month to the book we're gonna be 1,200 a semester probably you should go to state school you pay a quarter of that stay in get your undergrad here's the things like you could have a nonsense education like me where you just read things that you're interested in and they never get like a real base education I don't have a degree in anything he didn't go to college I went to college but I fucked off I paid attention yeah what do you mass Boston oh yeah that's some reasons to me I didn't even take my SATs oh really no there was like they had like a continuing education program he just sign up and start taking classes there oh nice did you go the whole way No I went for three years I was barely paying attention three years yeah I did I guess I realized I was doing it a little bit while I'm still doing stand-up likewise while I started doing stand-up oh it was literally only so that people didn't think I was a loser right I just wanted to let people know I'm doing something I didn't pay attention at all right well all I was thinking about was martial arts competition and then it would stand up right well yeah transition right there yeah once that happens forget it once I realized that people made money doing stand-up that's when I quit it depends on what you want to go do like there's certain you want to go in law or you want to do certain you know medicine there's certain routes where you need a degree we really need a degree and there's definitely something good to going to school and being around other people from around the country and all kind of thinking and for sure it's all positive but you should not go into debt I have all these nephews that they got out of school $30,000 in debt right this is the start of your life as an adult the worst thirty thousand in debt they can't keep up with the payments so then the interest kicks in and after four years now they owe fifty thousand and they're constantly chasing it yeah and now they ask their parents to help them out and they cosign now you have two generations and the taxes right and and they're now on their second job where no one cares anymore where you went to school they never even asked the question they don't know not instant no no in certain places yet in certain around this it really depends on what you're trying to do right you've gotta be a doctor I think they care yes I think they care well yeah that's well maybe professor you're applying for jobs a history professor go into television production whatever no one gives a shit that's true if you're gonna do Hollywood type jobs yeah nobody gives a fuck now go work in construction you could do what I wouldn't my whole thing is and I keep trying to say this to my daughter is that you should never don't jeopardize your future for this degree you can get degrees they'll be important they'll help you but you should not strap yourself with debt yeah that's wise advice yeah very wise advice and she's like how about you work harder and just pay for it and I won't have to be in debt that's a good thing for her to say yeah it's clever very smart to set you up and my other daughter I'm just gonna give her headshots three hundred dollars a head shots right in the business the business done that old show business yeah hey everybody's crazy but I thought show biz people crazy everyone's crazy every you're crazy I'm crazy yeah the people who it you think insurance salesmen people are fucking crazy they just better at hiding all day yeah it's what they do it they that's what they do they hide it they hide it all fucking day if you were really smart you just go into plumbing listeners not a lot of power's out there right now Sneed plumbing yeah and you make a really good living at it and there's not a lot of people that are learning these skills anymore that's what you should go do or do something you really want to do find something you really want to do yeah maybe you don't want to be a plumber should it be a requirement that they know what they want to do before they go into college no but see what college should be is education what it really seems to be more as like prepping you for the job force mm-hmm you know I mean there's education as well but it's prepping you for the job force and nowadays at least in a certain segment of the population you're you're getting these colleges that are also associated acht Renee ting kids socialist ideas and a lot of ideas that you know just are contrary to what probably their parents taught them so then there's this internal dispute and who's right and who's wrong and do our rebel against my parents and yeah the full social justice warrior yeah yeah yeah join the Young Republicans on campus and you know the kids are just trying to find who they are yeah there's definitely when you walk onto these campuses even just to tour them which I never did when I was I just you know picked one out and went but you go in it the personality of each university is so dominant as soon as you walk on to the campus and when to some small really left liberal arts schools and you just feel like the toasters and everything you're just like as a white male you're not welcome here at all and then you go to some other places and it's just kind of free-flowing and everybody's just it's into this they're just all about the football team have you ever seen the poster it says as a white male you're not welcome here yeah we're in my daughter's room but you know you get like very very progressive and very you know every everything is an issue and you know that's where you develop those idea what I'm saying is you can really learn from going on these campuses like oh this is well there's a vibe you get in doctrine doctrine ated into whatever vibe the campus holds yeah you get social points for like following those ideas right as as hardcore as you can yeah that's right it's really interesting yeah if you take yourself out of whichever way you lean if you lean left you can say well it's because they're young and they're passionate and they're right wrestling right like other babies and they're being taught by people who never made it in the real world they only just in academia and there yeah but just looking instead of looking at like that yeah look at it where you don't have a fucking dog in the fight and just step back and go this is fascinating it's like people are just trying to change and influence people's thinking and behavior mm-hmm and some of it is to justify their their own thinking and behavior some of it is because peeps some people just like controlling people right like getting people to listen to them and some of it is because they genuinely think that this is for the best for the human race and it's all these things are competing together yeah why you have some people that are activists you meet them they're not annoying at all you like goddamn you're really cool yes they're doing it with the right heart right the right yeah you have activists that are so what knowing are they so annoying because they're not doing it for the right reasons they're doing it to try to change people because they want to poke you they want to you want to have a reason to be upset at you because you're not listening to them you're not following their ideas write them and there those are the key words it's about them and their status and their power over you and ya know I know there's a couple people you know there's a couple people I know that have gone that way so hard that you can't even have conversations with them yeah on both sides it doesn't help it doesn't it all it does is create more more conflict like that kind of combative attitude creates more conflict you could be right on every single issue but if you're super super combative all the time that people just don't don't want to communicate with you and you're willing to enter into an honest exchange with you yes it's always a contest there's a battle going on right and you you always think you're right right it's us versus the end they're just looking for little clues and see where you're at and if you give them any kind of hint that you might lean one way they just pounce on you it's brutal it's like this it's a horrible way to live and they're angry they're just angry they just walk it's anger it's like get an ice cream cone enjoy your life a little bit like what are you doing whore Dodgers fans that's what they are yeah of course sports fans for the Democrats yeah like our fucking team's gonna kick their fucking ass in 2020 Trump's going down exactly it's really yeah it really is that hey did you see Tiger yesterday dude I was watching it while we were in Georgia we were in Georgia for the UFC right and I had a comedy show out there and we were me and Santino when I actually get on the screen on Saturday yes we watched it Friday or was a friar Saturday Saturday so I'm try to sire than anyone yesterday well whatever days it was right my thing we watched it two days in a row he was in the gym every day we were there but then I got home and I saw it on my phone I was like holy shit I don't even give a fuck about golf I know it was big powerful I made a comeback a huge comeback but that I mean that's amazing 11 years later oh my god somebody put on Instagram one of my quotes oh yeah and I attached to that it was pretty cool that I loved a guy get a like I loved what did I say I loved a success story but even more than that I love a guy fucks his life up and then it gets it back together again story it's the greatest yeah it's the greatest how much most good it must feel to that guy the world again and that he like yeah was so messed up and then the back problems and troubles and the kids and the wife and the thing and in just 11 years yeah and he didn't stop working he just went to work and went to work and went to where he's 11 years later and so he won a major championship recently right did anyone win one it was a big deal he won a major championship within the last it wasn't a major but it was it was a major this this was the first major he's won in 11 years okay so the other one wasn't a major but it was a big event yeah it was a so he wins that whenever as I Wow he might be back he can he could fucking win big tournaments again and then he just oh it was so cool to see the crowd just kept building over the weekend and by yesterday it was massive thousands of people around the greens isn't hanging on him the relief that you saw just coming out of him was so great and at the end like he walks off where as a kid he was only like 21 when he won the first time hugging his dad mm-hmm at the edge yeah and now he comes off 11 years later all this time and his dad's past and he's hugging his child his son now he's the father in the same spot I was just I was trying not to cry the whole time oh it was such a tearjerker what relief people were just so happy for him such a great story we do love a comeback why not man you love a comeback and we we were all flawed like you were saying before but yeah man being able to improve that's what that guy did he bit down and impre-- improved amazing improved his life yeah and whatever stopped yeah went south and he picked it right back up and brought it north again well 11 years of doing it and failing and failing and failing no is that beautiful it is beautiful such a cool thing yeah I was wondering like he wears that red shirt he's gotta wear the red on Sunday is it's like his that's his thing that's his thing yeah and he was in light colors on Saturday and I was like does he just like free himself from that or dia is that a superstition that you gotta kind of hang - hmm good question yeah you know what do you think would happen if there was an openly gay black guy with blond hair who only wore pink it was like the best call for a while and started dominating great some dudes like SuperDuper gang yeah and he's just got this fucking crazy Drive and and he gets down on the ground I could see the way the earth is rolling and the whole time is doing he's like Lisp in snapping his fingers wiggling but you know I put pretty what would happen if he started just winning they're probably poison him do you think they would poison like a super flamboyant gay guy who was winning okay black or white they would poison him someone do you don't think so I don't think so because golfers are so close to flamboyantly queen in gay anyway it's they're all pink and like big plaid pants they're like a bunch of old white dudes straight white dudes who want to be gay but it's all this country club life right the big part of it yeah have that guy swishing around back and forth in the locker room snapping his fingers staring at dicks no no no no he's got a catchphrase all his hair is shaved except for a curly man bun that's just straight up and it's blonde and he wears lipstick and I was a motherfucker at golf he's just killing fools I just love my irons maybe baby would open golf up to everybody else yeah what happened like do you think that Tiger Woods Tiger Woods he opened up golf for people of color right clearly yeah I didn't do it because of and how many how many people got into golf that would have never even thought about playing golf for sure Tiger could play yeah started opening up to inner-city schools were starting getting involved in it what what about the gay community are they representing and professional golf flamboyant dressed like the Bee Gees in the 70s their clothes Joe they're wearing plaid pants they're wearing Kate whistles uh you you have xenophobia that's how people from Scotland dress I was just saying they would they would be embraced you know Scotland's a weird place like you have to dress a certain way when you hunt there or at least they have a certain way they dress like a traditional way I like that but it's not like they don't wear camo it's like an outfit yeah it's like an outfit like what do they wear the world like clothes weird old-timey clothes I like that I like tradition um yeah I know you did that's why I brought it up Bourdain went hunting in Scotland there's a television show where he had to wear some crazy-ass outfit right he you get suited for this outfit this traditional hunting outfit it's pretty cool yeah a lot of those this that's its traditions like places like Scotland to from incra I think most of it was like private land right I think back in the day like that was what Robin Hood was all about right Robin Hood was originally supposed to be about someone who was poaching and hunting on the Kings land because they were hungry so they were stealing from the rich to feed the poor gentlemanly pursuit hunting and shooting attire Wow a dress does that help you helps me be a good hunter because I get to goof on them or does it like does that help does that get in the way of hunting or is that help hunting that's not helping shit it's kind of fresh though go back to his boots yeah man that guy looks boots can make them boots larger look at those fresh boobs yeah come on I start wear those on stage that guy what I get in trouble for cultural appropriation wearing someone's stuff if they're white to network and now that if they're more powerful than you than your okay like how does that work how does that work you can't take from how much what percentage of Native American do you have to have in you to wear moccasins ooh a lot the tassel jacket how about the leg the suede tassel jacket I like Roger Daltrey's rebels in the seventies war I wanted one of those so bad when I was in high school they look so cool the Easy Rider with the fringe on it it's all moving driving mission I want your arm out the window with the cards floppy nur yeah you're on stage singing the ladies must yeah look at that Oh Gloria come on strips of leather see but that goes too far see how it's because they have the Native American thing I'm a sleeve let me see this one right here no not the other one well that one's yeah you get me for that one if you do that one you better kill the bear that you use for those fucking yeah me that's - that's ridiculous now there's a white guy version of that which would be okay that's a girl claims to be a healer yeah that's what we're that see if you wear that in Texas you're okay oh yeah okay Daniel Boone yeah that one that one's dark dark one no what are you Prince what are you a trapper that's too light that looks terrible it's terrible he's get the fringe in the bottom that fits you to separate us from everybody else the curtains on the bottom and fringe like a nice Curt Menefee a fine restaurant look at Elvis Elvis had tassels Elvis had rainbow tassels you could get away with it if you're Elvis if you're working for Enterprise rent-a-car maybe you don't wear that yeah Elvis got away with some wild shit who the fuck will jumpsuits before Elvis jumpsuits it was him and Evel Knievel oh man look at that Hendrix oh my god that's yeah see but he's doing some of these playing a guitar he's moving around he's got a headband if you just if you're making snow cones you know if that's not your jacket man I wanted one when I was in high school I wore my put that back up put that beggar bear up look at that that look how good does it look and I could never wear he's got friends I don't know yet what is a greenish-yellow how would you describe that color it's like a teal like a light teal he's got he's got bell-bottoms the bondage acid-washed bell-bottoms and he's got this cool jacket with fringes that are literally two feet long yeah and then a headband - and it's just his kind of fuchsia the headband right it's kind of reddish yeah like a light red and he's and it's on Jimi Hendrix that's the thing that we can't match when we could buy all those items but it's still our head it's not only that it's 2019 - but yeah then like he was in the groove man oh man who's that yeah Phil Hartman saw him live when he was a young kid Phil was like 18 years old he got a job at The Whisky uh-huh and his job was you know how they have those giant monitors on the stage and sometimes those things would fall like into the crowd oh jeez all right like especially someone's standing on that or doing a show so they're kind of they're a little wobbly yeah standing right there so his job was to stand right by the stage like literally have his hands like ready to catch these speakers this was a fellas job yes and Hendricks is right there Hendrick is right he's 18 oh my god in front of him I was that close to Blues Traveler once that's the same and this wall is harmonicas right in his vest shortly before Jimi Hendrix died oh really yeah well he died when he was died in like it was the magic age right 35 was it it's 21 I think the magic age of 27 it's they're all dying where Marci at estoppel yeah isn't that the magic age didn't he where did he when T 7 Wow yeah what year did he die was at 69 70 70 1970 so Phil you know that's amazing film is probably like 17 years old or something Wow yeah God fuck that's amazing you know did he averaged one of those fringe jackets I don't know I didn't ask that but the pages private man whose wages crisis running into Jesus while you're out on a hike oh yeah it was great well phil was a musician too yeah so when you know he talked about it we had like this crazy clean to his ha Shay's and I was like he was fuckin yeah come on Hendrix please I wanted I wanted one of those fringe jackets when I was in high school so I played football until I was a senior and then when one football season's over I have a half a year left of school and that's when I smoked weed for the first time and started playing guitar and I'm 101 at fringe jackets they didn't have them but I did get a pair of moccasins for a little while hmm I wore moccasin did they have beads they did not have beads but they had a little French too little tassels they were like it was just a little fringe yeah no soul yeah what's the purpose of Fringe like that's like when you think of a trapper jacket right when I'm doing Davey Crockett type dudes style of them wearing that just style is really yeah why would they have any style back then everybody's got style back then it seems like they were just trying to stay alive yeah the weak ones the cool I think Daniel Boone wasn't trying to work it a little bit look at this buck skins are often trimmed with a fringe originally a functional detail to allow the garment to shed rain and to drive faster when wet because the fringe asks a series of wicks to disperse the water or quills interesting a little bit Wow my skin's derived from deerskin clothing worn by Native Americans oh wow how about that that's genius smarter than you now so it hangs down and the water goes through all the tissue in the deer and gets to the bottom so those little things get wet but the thing that you're wearing that touches your skin is dry you think right now that deer would have had fringe on their outfits I think they don't give a fuck you're really hot all right your body temperature is much higher than ours oh really yeah that's one of the weirder things about when you put your hands on one so yeah the inside of them they're really hot like if you're so for like 98 degrees what are they like I don't know I would if I had to guess I'd say it's it's more 100 oh yeah I'd say that yeah I bet they're probably like 105 something like that but what is it we just what's the wattage it brought up the cooking temperature that's why people love deer they're preheated same as most undulates which is thirty seven point five to thirty point five degrees Celsius which which we don't understand I'll just type in the preheated deer be 38.5 degrees Celsius what you think that is yeah yes I don't have a clue what was the what was the number 38 degrees Celsius oh that's a 105 is it no it's not ninety ninety nine point five two hundred yeah right in that same range that's it like that's one or two higher like some with a little bit fever oh I did something that you would you would enjoy you might have even done this speaking of body heat I was in San Francisco last weekend really performing and I was working with my friend Kira's soltanovich very funny comedian kicks ass she's Russian she grew up up there and she brought me to a Russian like bathhouse they beat you up with sticks yeah did you ever do that no they called Vanya Vanya huh man oh man you go into a sauna a 2-level sauna so it's even hotter like up at the hop at the top like an attic in a sauna it's super hot and you lay down on this bench and they take these bushes and they group they wet them and then they start beating you with them not a lot of pressure it's - it's so hot it you're in a sauna you're already looking really really and then that thing the thing is hot - and that thing's hot and with the with the steam coming off of the branches as they're beating your back it creates a little a little pocket that gets even hotter so it just brings your body to the submission what high temperature they're making wealth and making whether they really are yeah and yeah for about 15 minutes and you come out of there and just feel to jump in the cold afterwards yeah into a cold plunge yeah all the way under this really cold water amazing yeah the Russians really like that fedor emelianenko it was like one of the greatest heavyweights if not the greatest heavyweight of all time one of the things that you would see about his training what is it was that it was very old school Russian like the stuff on the parking or in a playground just like they did a lot of stuff in a playground and he incorporated the banya that was a part of it like he's you see him lying there and they're beating him with sticks there you go yeah see it on showtime so there yeah that's what yeah yeah they figured something out you know also pretty great invented sauna they figured something out there's something about that extreme temperature that just it's very good for you your ability to recuperate you feel better it reduces inflammation felt great like I went in there I've been traveling so hard over the last couple of months I've just been knotted up I've just been like I was like maybe I'll do this and then get a massage after mmm cuz that'll really a gentleman he like a gentleman yeah and we didn't have time she had to go she was driving me she had to go do something so we only had time for that part when I came out of that the the bania or banya I didn't need a massage everything was relaxed everything had changed in just like 15 minutes yeah it was great man I wish it was I don't know if there's they have them in LA or not but I'd like to seek them out there I know they have women yours one in West Hollywood there is yeah photo Sports not like that yeah hey girl bro a lot of dongs keep your pants on a lot of dogs clothing was optional hey clothing

that steam room I'm just gonna let you nuts hang why is it you want to see what the fuck are you doing with your butt take your goddamn pants off and he'll be like Oh roar roar Jesus why does everyone wanna see my keys so bad because Mike you probably is a little dick like I felt like everybody thinks I have a small one because I got my pants but that's not it um just get a different power what are you doing yeah but but the other thing is when you're around people like that right and it's not a bad thing it's a life choice but if you're around flossy people if you're a person who likes Rolls Royces and giant mansions and you know you like it a baller I got a big fat diamond ring lifestyle yeah that guys around those people because he's selling diamond rings selling diamonds right diamonds motherfucker let's get billions from some charity Wow 48 million dollars whoa look at that a blue diamond 48 OHS oh yeah million 48 million is a father bought it for his daughter Wow magic Rock damn magic you're the daughter you lose that shit drinkin you fuckin pull your panties down the pinna curbs right off when you're throwing off throwing up in a dumpster my dad's gonna kill me yeah maybe a daughter was 40 it makes you realize that the things that you that really give you worth in life is not the dough it's something that's gonna engage your head and make you feel a little useful you're way better off having less dough and something you really love yeah but that's only if you have a certain amount of dough that's the problem yeah stress of not having enough money to feed yourself and feed your family and while the roof over your head that's overwhelming for people especially as we were talking about earlier people have fucking credit card debt or student loan debt or some insurmountable amount of debt that can't get out of ya just hangs on you then you're not really thinking about what's meaningful for Mike what's of meaningful hobby for me oh dude it's the worst yeah the feeling of debt is the fucking worst and the feeling of just working for nothing that's also bad too there's the feeling of like every day you're doing it just to exist at the end of the day you're exhausted yeah what is your life yeah what is your life is your water your life all this shit you hate to do yeah well that's the answer for most people most people most of the time the answer is you're doing something you hate to do and it's been me and I know it's been you at some point in your life yeah but goddamn the the amount that your life can change if you just no longer have to do something you don't want to do yeah who'd do something that you actually enjoy whatever it is whether it's carpentry or painting whatever the fuck it is that you love to do do you think it has to be your work or do you think you could be at work through your like kind of into it but then you have some other passion that's connected but you're you're also if if your work isn't satisfying that's most of your life yeah people are gay you got to do what you got to do of course you do of course you have to do what you got to do that goes without saying yeah so figure out a way out of there everybody's got a way out yeah don't just people love to say things like that like hey some people don't have that luxury people love to say things like that you have to acknowledge that but that's that's the case with anyone who's ever done anything where it was hard to do write it so it's always going to be hard to do that that it's used for you to say of course it's easy for me to say I'm just saying that's the easiest thing in the world hey I'm gonna put a rocket on the moon see I just said it Wow think about you to say exactly but of course it's easy to say but the difference just as a person who's done both difference between doing something you hate doing and doing something you love doing it's off the charts it's better your life is no absolute if you're making less money even if you're making less money exactly because you know to use comedy is an example because it's what we are when you were making five dollars a night literally five 2009 as a comedian I was so much happier than when I had a day job oh yeah making real money it once I remember the feeling of being able to make a living with just stand up yeah what like holy cow living just getting by in my beginning was super shaky yeah super shaky right I started making money I was making like a little bit of money in Boston but I always had day jobs yeah when I moved to New York and then Jeff started managing me then I started making money like I he get me booked in places and I'll doing I was working pretty much every weekend who was Jeff Jeff Sussman let just assuming longtime manager yeah start managing me when I was an open mic er my oh nice yeah we've been together forever yeah he's the best you still with him yep wow that's amazing that's amazing he's the best I love the guy that's great he's an awesome person too and just a brilliant at his job yeah super low-key doesn't give a fuck about Hollywood that's great but you know yeah he understands it in the right do right he doesn't care I was like to do what makes you happy was he just want you to be happy it's awesome so he picked you up when you're doing open mic dude Oh scrub wasn't supposed to go onstage that night really yeah he came into town he had managed some other comedians remember Bob Nelson know Bob Nelson oh yeah Jeff you have football guy yeah yeah oh my god he managed him really yeah and he produced his HBO special and they were parting ways and they were parting ways and Jeff was like well maybe I've seen everybody that I've seen in New York maybe I'll take a trip to Boston so he took a trip to Boston and just fucking dumb luck when I was driving limos I wrote a joke that day they'll have this joke and I called up my friend Oliver who was the manager at the club and I said hey man can I come in and do like five minutes because I have this joke want to try out yeah sure come on in and he liked me so he hooked me up and I went onstage and I didn't even know Sussman was in the room well because I didn't know he was in the room I didn't give a fuck I was super loose you knew who he was at that point no I didn't know he didn't know it just didn't it wouldn't but if I knew that there was a manager from New York right that handled Bob Nelson I'd be like holy shit I probably freaked out sure had choked shakey is fucked back then anyway you know I'm only like of course it's 30 years in a college I did often ya know it was really interesting like he took me to New York to he saw me there and then he took me into New York to try out he wanted to see me perform and some other clubs huh so he said we are you willing to come down in New York so I said sure yeah I've always wanted to I was so nervous about performing in New York yeah of course I thought New York City was different uh-huh it was like more nervous than when he came to see me the second time in Boston I was more nervous to perform in New York cause I can't believe I was one of it catch a rising star which doesn't exist anymore yeah just legends forget it your head yeah that's a big thing it son because you don't know it yet yeah well it was like the New York comics were always like the smart ones the thought process the thought process in Boston the audience's are smarter than occupy your bullshit they're gonna know and what's really funny is like Sussman we were talking about like clean comedy versus dirty comedy there was no really real decision like you know like because back then people would like decide to be clean it wasn't like you're a clean comic because that's how you think right well if you want to get more work the smart moves clean as a business decision as a business to dress nice and act clean we went to a bunch of places did each side comedy club which is a cool comedy club that used to be in Long Island then he took me this place called fast Eddie's in Huntington and it was a it was a local bar that had a comedy night Wow we went upstairs and it was so the crowd was so fuckin rowdy and so drunk and there was a dude on stage name was George gallows hilarious dude yeah who was doing a reverse shit with a banana just like as you're waiting to go ah so he had a banana that he was like another slurping it like it was a reverse shit and he's doing this in front of you know these people are hammered it's like a Wednesday night or some shit right and sustance says he grabs me by the arm you don't have to perform here we're gonna we're gonna get ya and I said no fuckin way I go listen ya my people I go just trust me let me go up my pee I'm like this is what I do many all the gigs that I got embossed we're all bar gay yeah yeah we'll also plus it's once you've done a bunch of them yeah it's like chaos it's fun you know what to do what to do yeah for sure it's a different kind of comments like combat comedy yeah which it was at that time you ran into that more than you didn't run into that yeah but even today if you get rode gigs if you're a up-and-coming guy yeah or gal and you get wrote especially if you're a gal yeah girls go get it way harder in the early days people like my friend's girlfriend admitted the other day that when she sees a female comedian at a comedy club she cringes still to this day she goes I get super uncomfortable when they start going onstage and when they're if they're funny it's a huge relief isn't that crazy as a feminist I hate saying that it's terrible I consider myself a feminist I hate saying I feel like it's gotten beyond that I feel like there's so many oh yeah such strong at the top of the chain but if you're in some weird club in the middle of nowhere and some yeah I get the I get that for you I get like especially if you're feminists and you're around you just don't want her to bomb because they you think well they're all the rest of the audience is gonna think that's what always - and there's that she just doesn't think they're funny very often or just she's not a comic so she's just being honest about it and we were like oh yeah but back then it was like eight every time even when my good clubs like the comic strip or Caroline's it was just like it was war war it was war but nothing compared to like they get you ever get any of those Bob gonzo gigs in New Jersey oh yeah okay oh god yeah it was like a frat party that just threw you up they didn't want comedy though they turn you they season you in a different way they season you for like like the Comedy Store was similar to that for a long time Konami store and the early days had no crowd control right literally zero yeah so the crowd was in kids in control sometimes yeah no one ever shot anybody up no but the new regime it's it's handled so much different there's a new concept that's so much better it's so much better but it did make you bulletproof yeah you know how to handle drunk you came through that air through that time or maybe it still exists when you're going through but yeah you just if you do that many gigs that's why I don't I really don't believe in just going to your one little alt room over and over again where you know you're coddled and supported and I really believe that you have to go into all these hellish situations so you just anywhere you go you know you can go and kill yeah that's an important part to being a comedian yeah and you also as you become a successful comedian you could fall into the trap of only performing in front of your audience right you know you really do have to drop in on other people shows yeah right who people don't know who you are and why yeah that's what's great about the store lineup too right there's 15 comedians right they're probably not there to see you know here to see this guy or that car yeah no it's great yeah you know you have to be able to survive because you see people to come out of those other environments and then they get thrown into this and they they don't know how to act yeah I think comedies like a lot of other things that are difficult there's things that you can do to get better at those you know like they say that like if you take if you learn languages you could get better at chess I read something about that make sense don't make that up it sounds about right move that I would learn a new language it'll make you better at chess I might have made that up just the way your brain is trying to think if all the different like cross-training methods how could it be better at chess do you play chess no but I want to but I'm scared it's fun I'm scared why you saw me play quake earlier I have addiction oh yeah easy addiction problems chess is addicting Tom Papa walked in and Jeff and I were going to war oh it was the most intense thing I've ever seen you do isn't it both of you on the keyboard and the thing sweating your ass off in front of these monitors you are taking like deep deep breaths in the middle of it these guys just firing off at each other it was intense you got to try to stay calm and these we're in this very small map so I always know where he is he always knows where I am and there's a limited amount of ammunition and armor and when you get jacked and you come back less strong with a weaker weapon you got a run to get a good weapon quick and then you got a run to get where the fucking armor is and he knows where that shit is so it's a crazy duel like if he kills me he'll kill me two or three times in a row it was so much faster than I thought it was gonna be oh yeah I mean in real intense is it always that like you're just in one courtyard one stone courtyard many many maps you can just go yeah but this is that's a good one for one-on-one okay we have these one-on-one matches the most fun because there's no other variables right the variables of like if there's like ten people in the room everybody just shooting everybody which is a lot of these maps I'll show you that too that's more chaos oftentimes you get killed when you're fighting a guy then someone comes from behind you don't see them and they shoot you it's annoying so how addicting is this for you Oh real Rio it's real problems you used to do it right yeah yeah I'm Way better at now I'll do like for an hour and then I'll stop then you'll be good in the old days but everything's addictive to me man every time now all of it anything I like I know I like is like it becomes addictive that's why your shoulders messed up but it's not the shoulder it was more of a maintenance thing it wasn't it wasn't that bad was just getting a little sore and I wanted to get look down there's some tendinitis in there right so I just I'm real proactive at 51 I have to be real proactive about injuries and when things feel squirrelly yeah it's the problem you can get hurt and then you can't work out anymore mm-hmm yeah I like it too much yeah I like but even if it's not something as intense as jujitsu mm-hmm I just need to do something whether it's yoga or running is this like me no work out me work out I like yeah when I work out so much more I like me better it happened to me in San Francisco after the day after the banya I'm just I just woke up I good shows Friday I'm just like but I just woke up like just in a shitty mood just kind of yeah and I knew if I could just get my shoes on and go for a run I mean a whole day is gonna be different yep and it's a half hour just going out doing a comeback and I was a totally in the same room just feeling completely different not crazy it's just a mental shit you're flooding your brain with all the beautiful thoughts and ideas that happen in there and while you're running while you're breathing you got all these fucking ideas that come to your brain you get interested you're breathing and you're running you're constantly run out slow down a little bit then you're like fuck yeah we're out here doing it running it's a big deal and this who knows what chemicals are firing off in your brain did it's my dog and me because we run together a lit inseparable really it's crazy it's hilarious and follows me everywhere like when I sit down and sits right next to me it's the best I've never had a relationship with a dog like this oh man I've had dogs I loved that were great but this dogs like stuck to me like glue it's so great part of it is because we run so much yeah again so thrilled so when we run he turns and he'll run ahead of me and then he'll come back to me to check up on me well it comes back and runs with like this big smiles again how far you running with him a couple miles that's Nils just a pretty steep hill no that's good that's a workout yeah I know if I'm if I have a short time yeah Doolittle the there's one real steep trail that I run this once to each other we have to drive to a little bit but it's super steep oh yeah it's way out near like Agora no one's rough yeah that's a rough one that's got to be tough yeah because it's real long it's like the whole thing is the hills because the hills are no pounding right and get a good Hill under you it's way harder yeah why I just I base it on 140 beats a minute anytime I get below 140 beats a minute I'd start running again uh-huh but I'll do these Sprint's I'll go as far as I can I get into the 180s and then when I'm like fuck I gotta take a break I just take a break and I look at my heartbeat get my heartbeat down now somewhere in the 140 is 440 anywhere around 1:45 that I'm ready to go again right and then I'll go again and I'm usually like one 60s yeah running dudes it's rough Hills are rough I was a really referent thing but it's changed my taking power oh you actually gave me more kicking power yeah mmm I can kick believe it or not it's probably like I want to see like 10% 5 or 10% more power from the runs yeah my pips are bigger muscles around my like my butt like the hip area right you know like where your belt is like right below where your belt is yeah I never had a muscle there right what is that it's crazy they just bone hills this is all from running hills bland when I stomp like if I stomp the back like a front kick to the bag that that forward thrust is the same thing you're doing all the time when you're running right you're running you're pushing off one leg you pushing off the other leg push cuz you're going up a hill yeah you're kicking you're pushing off that leg and thrusting that other leg forward it's crazy is your dog go down the hills does your dog ever get tired yeah it's hard yeah it's we know when they get tired they get tired when you throw the ball right then it's a sprint it's a sprint and then you bring it back a sprint bring it back like seven times like y'all bro I'm coming to lie down over here like no no come on man come on man my sister has to put down her dog tonight you know sixteen year old dog a big like uh like almost like a spaniel kind of thing sixteen years and she's just she's just been hanging on she's just been the greatest and tonight 7:30 Wow just has to go just there's no joy left she just can't go anymore it's gonna be rough I've talked to her on my way in and just like what a brutal thing to have to do yeah sixteen years yeah my dog get hit by a car when I was like 14 Oh 14 or 15 right in front of me has taken her across the street and we hadn't we had a busy street in her house and some car came down the street really fast she got off the leash and ran right into this uh hit her in a Volkswagen ah yeah I was rough dude I carried her up to the house did she die instantly she died and like she died looked in like 15 20 minutes ah that's so brutal rough she started shitting all over the place how old was she she wasn't that old yeah maybe five or six oh it's brutal there's nothing worse it's so painful sweet dog - yeah bummer my she just loved being in the park and we were headed to the park and she just got a little too excited and ran you know I didn't see the car coming I didn't get a hold of her collar and Tom it's brutal it was so bad it was so bad she you know she got knocked flying I don't even know she was gonna die you couldn't tell there was all the injuries were internal water upstairs she starts shitting herself start shitting all over the place now it was very unusual for her she was yeah his house trained yeah you know I was really scared Oh have you had to go through any pet deaths with your kids yet yeah yeah the two my two dogs so I just had to put both of my dogs down my dogs oh really yeah you know they were 13 it was a mastiff he was 13 wow that's great run Mastiff at the end I used to have to carry him into that house yeah he couldn't walk anymore he would walk like literally we feel like he would walk a step walk a step and just stay and his legs would be shaking it was said had the kids handling how they were really sad yes Hardman isn't that the hardest thing when you watch your kids have to deal with it so it makes it so much harder yeah doesn't mean it's but they're trying to be brave I think there's a lesson in it you know Oh for real I think it's uh it's not a good experience but I think it's good for them to experience oh yeah yeah absolutely obviously yeah through it you know I pet deaf and and just cut just having those little relationships with animals you know when you're a kid it's like your dog you could always talk to them and oh yeah you can say crazy shit to the dog you know you're talking be sent in your room with you and you go you know what it's just you and me no one understands me your parents are acting like assholes no one likes you in the house but your dog still does you're gonna come with me let's go I'm taking the dog mom it's the best but watching your kids like trying to be brave trying not to cry that is such a heartbreaker just trying to be like oh this is the worst yeah this is like kill me hey do you notice up by your house we have mosquitoes now we have like legit then we never had mosquitoes out here aim they're just like real mosquitoes and then and they bite you only from like your knee down everybody around where I live is saying the same thing we've never had mosquitoes if you just wear pants then your promise I only wear pants so how they bitin you well I take my shoes off when someone don't do that you're right though I have noticed mosquitoes I noticed some last night we never had them yeah in Southern California before I don't know where they're coming from well we definitely had them you just didn't have many of them and this is how I know we had them I moved into a house once in Encino and no one had lived there for like at least a year I think and the pool had not been tended to so the pool was filled with mosquito larvae oh and it's like fish like schools of fish oh my gosh around there I was freaking out I was like what is that are these fish and I you know hired this guy Kevin the pool guy Kevin the pool guy came over and he was like brother those are mosquito larvae oh my god no it's a new thing I mean we used to have our doors open or windows open no screens no problem but no all of a sudden just this last year yeah we're so sad you have to live like the rest of world now I don't know why do I live here if I have to put screens on my windows do you think that'll last will it change I don't know have you heard about this do you see that shit that I posted yesterday about that yellow mustard plant yeah black mustard looks so beautiful I was like oh that's nice and it was the most ominous posting though but it's very strange man because this shit exists before like I never saw it like on the same Hills where I'm seeing it dominate the hill yeah it literally didn't exist a year ago and now it's just like an invasive plant yeah it's a crazy planet I just looked up mosquitoes in Los Angeles and the things - it's an article from the end of last year but it says have you experienced an unusual number of mosquitoes bites this summer mostly but no excuse me mostly below the knee and especially around your ankles it's a called an 8 it's called a TS an aids aids bug you have a TSA edes and that's a real problem yeah it's a problem it's a real problem it says what do I live in just read it des and it's a real problem it's funny they're spreading like wildfire says Susan clue director of scientific and technical research services for the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District sounds like Suzanne needs money for a fucking business that's what sounds like to me but our phones are exploding fake news kidding Los Angeles is home to two particularly troubling types of invasive ADEs mosquitoes oh man look at that the Asian tiger mosquito arrived first having hitched a ride with shipments of lucky bamboo from China you and your bamboo I don't think my pole barbel I think it's like a polymer China in 2001 vector control specialists monitored plant nurseries across the county and soon stopped finding the mosquitoes in their traps they thought the insects had been eradicated however in 2011 residents and El Monte began complaining about unusually aggressive daytime biting mosquitoes plaguing the neighborhood yes in the daytime this is happening they infiltrated what do you think would happen if people started seeing malaria mmm in America a second why hasn't that happened good question I'm sure dr. Peter Hotez could have explained that to us right when he was talking about infectious diseases from malaria is hilarious em and know when I was a little high Oh West Nile virus to pop up a lot with mosquitoes not like not like everyday or anything like that I know that had to spray certain neighborhoods all the time like stay and keep the kids and keep your pets and we're spraying your neighbors yeah West Nile I didn't sign for this how about how about signing up for spraying yeah and in the West Nile because the spray is gonna get to everybody they used to spray when I was a kid in New Jersey they would spray for the gypsy moths Jesus they just come with they wouldn't even tell us this is just like look at that plane and shit would be coming out of its ass and think of the difference between the way a butterfly gets treated and a moth yeah well moths deserve it dirty they're a little chalky and they have a plain color they've got like that baseball hang then the same thing the other gray or white well yeah but it's only the way they look he had a butterflies beautiful it isn't that crazy orange black like we love them love them you find a spider you stomp it you would never go to a zoo and go into the moth house if you kill a ladybug you're an asshole Oh completely your type of person kills ladybugs yeah but if you don't kill roach I can't hang out with you you let a roach run across the kitchen floor you like satnaam roach sod Nam I see you got a roach in your kitchen lady dots on it why are we racist with bugs because there's such thing as beauty okay that's why squirrels get a pass and rats don't yes bushy tail yeah looking cute style vikrant's jacket matches the tail was just because they found out if the tails grew bushy people would stop killing them yeah I mean what's more disgusting than just a skinned tail with nothing on it awesome awesome tail why somes don't even cause any problems there just see us tick possum tail yeah oh you fucking get your bad hands little hands and your little reptile tail fuck little beady eyes disgusting yeah but like we we have certain animals that we'd like like raccoons look we don't rat cook like raccoons in there eating out of your garbage but now if someone had a pet raccoon you would think that's the dopest thing ever we have we secretly want relationships raccoons if they would only be nicer to us yes we would embrace raccoons raccoons don't want to have shit to do with us they don't I don't get it we just mark what you smart for us we're nice to them I thought these people are assholes it's weights they go to sleep and eat their trash I'll just eat this fresh savory ether garbage they put lids on it doesn't work they've got that cool black mass yeah you lift the lid you throw it aside you pull the bag out their hands I know if people ends I know we can grab stuff smoke cigarettes hang out yeah the next they also kill chickens well so do we do you know who's a real predator skunks skunks or predators there's a skunk living in the back of my yard sprayed my dog oh no it's still there I think so come on bro man up what am I gonna do take out skunk hazmat suit a BB gun time to go to war I gotta go crawl under the thing and find him problem of the thing go look at this fucking hand that's crazy it's like he's flaunting he's like yeah look at that Wow his hand is so much smaller than his face it's crazy you imagine if your hand was that small and relationship T is the size of your head he's adorable though isn't he he is a cute little fella it's like look at look you think I've stayed out of your garbage no way look what I'm working with do they have opposable thumbs look what I'm working with didn't quite seem like it looks like five fingers you know thumb right that's the thing they never figured out look at his teeth they never figured it out like they had meetings dudes we just need a thumb let me see the teeth they're looking he's got his mouth open oh you're that whoa that way yeah that would really hurt your fucking sucked look one of them's chipped if a yeah from biting you in the head do you think if a racket attacked you could fight it off no well you could see lump it would you do would you give up it might cut your neck when would you decide we're going to to the death immediately immediately yeah you wouldn't try to talk to raccoon out of this no fuck off Susie makes a move I'm Randy now because I've been thinking about it since childhood oh look at that one I don't want that one bite my nose yeah a hyena no the raccoon and made that thing I've been thinking these things are coming after it's my whole life so if he makes a move it's on bro those teeth are goddamn terrifying yes look at those teeth now and they're sneaky that's a big thing and they're filled with rabies filled yeah to the top like their balls are heavy with rape it's just oozing out of them two water balloons raku swish senses touch Oh when hunting raccoons rely on their hands more than their eyes and going to touchy studies suggest that their sensitivity to touch increases when their hands are wet which might be why they always wash their food why I just washed my hands and now I am going to touch you when you sleep I know that you and your children where he was sleeping with my finger hands like if a rat was as big as a raccoon and try to kill you you'd be fucking terrified no we'd be we'd be spraying oh there were rats eyes things just going through LA yeah why do you think we'll spray for these mosquitos I think it's time to call our congressman well I think that everyone's afraid of chemtrails and if you start spraying cheese circling Greater Los Angeles dropping poison down that's the rat with the pizza I've seen that guy oh yeah the pizza rat that's famous rats are disgusting - yeah they're pretty gross you've seen that Netflix documentary on rats yeah no oh no really dude oh dude really yeah you need to watch it because it's um it's educational it's not just gross and it's really gross but when you realize how many of them there really are in major cities yeah the biomass of them yeah it's stunning really York's all rat it's just just rats this is many rat is more or somewhere in the neighborhood of as many rats as there are people really and there's 8 million people and there's how many more as as many or more cheese yeah just don't think they know I mean you see them non-stop walking around they're just guessing yeah obviously most of them are subterranean most of my living in houses and most of them I mean they burrow their way into tiny little holes how long does a rat live to a question how long does a rat live because they're born there's a lot of them but do they stick around for like 20 years dude the documentary showed how they send young rats to try out poison really yeah the oldest rats they send them out there because they don't know any better they let them die they're just assholes Wow yeah they here's a little tip if they're ever doing construction in New York in front of a restaurant you don't eat it you don't need on that Street why because they're digging it up whatever their little ecosystem is and they're just yeah so if they're digging up the street they're dying somewhere else I would imagine in New York it must be so hard to keep them out of the restaurant oh it's gotta be so hard like I guess maybe leave some in the dumpster forum what key give it to the monsters just ahead yeah a girl into the the stakes for Kong everybody else alone not a little shish kebab stick your last jobs when you're closing down the restaurant you litigate down the rats are our friends put the skulls out well what is interesting what are those various sizes of them they mostly go about two pounds says in New York City he doesn't think there's any better three because they'd be too big to be able to move around right but the physical physiological limit to their size just say how long they live average about two years one to two years in the wild up to four if you have it as a pet oh wow that's it yeah hamsters like that my wife had rats for pets when she was a kid wish Goff no she was just a Jersey kid just loved animals and she would just ride her bike around in this rat would just be like on her shoulders Jesus Christ we were at lady weird but it was but she said they were super smart and super affectionate yeah if you had it it's a whole life and you raise it right yeah why not yeah it's not dirty it's not like going through the sewers and eating poo and climbing on your hand right but it would if you just let it go maybe 100 percent she like had it out with her go rat like if you just let it let it loose in the wild how long would it take for how long would it take for domesticated rat to adapt to living in like a New York City sewer 40 seconds what do you think they were do they're crazy fucking Disney look at you from the suburbs we've been living in a house yeah with like you know those multicolored rats they have like little different colors on them are you so clean with your pink hair oh you got different colors

fucked up his neighbor's dog they killed his neighbor's dog yeah yeah man the dog was out and the javelinas will flank it like to get on both sides of it and they they like in a pack yeah they hunt in

looking rat oh you want to know what's really giant rat that's a hundred-pound rat yeah without a tail it's so gross and you know what's really crazy is those are animals they'll they're the best animal to a call now what a call is is like you've made a make a sound of a wounded animal no you may glad like something that's suffering like people take their hand these fuckers run in they run in real yes they're so aggressive it's crazy they think something's hurt and I can go he hit they but they have to act quick cuz there's coyotes out there and mountain lions out there so when something's hurtin like fuck food and they just run towards it so when you're bow hunting you almost have to have one person make the call and you're at full draw and then they start calling and the things come running in and you shoot at them yeah you couldn't do it you couldn't get to the bow one time cuz they'd see you know you'll fuck it's a guy turn off the other way again yeah are these like invasive are they all over he's already know they're natural there's no but I mean are they not invasive but I mean is there a lot of them yes there's like a ton around where they exist yeah I mean they exist in the desert I mean they they exist in healthy enough populations you people hunt for them Wow and they eat them they say oh yeah I wouldn't eat that but you eat eat a pig yeah but they're cuter wild boar yeah crazy tusks looking yeah those are gross pretty gross no my pigs my Kingsley those the ones I eat have bow ties it's climbing around this guy's garage in little tap shoes who the shit bro they're staring I'm down there in his garage there's a whole bunch of em fuck is that alright on your kid's toy look at this it's all its hairs up anyway look at that it's just gonna take a dump in your driveway who'd you do not want that in your life I don't want to live there there's fucking 20 of them in this guy's driveway see that one there in the back how many grow that back again how many were there there was like 12 what is the name in that video four people want to watch it wild javelinas make a visit to Arizona home why yeah I know you can't show though those fucking things are everywhere there's a lot of them with the wild I have a lead how many of them there are at least eight and then there's the one that was on top of the there's nine and then there's one that was on top of the truck and there's one that you could see through the fence yeah and it's probably more out there oh it's going in the car it's going into the kids little car Jesus Christ oh it's in the passenger seat of the car Oh gross fucking I feel like wild javelina is like a Dean Martin song you think so man they're weird-looking too they look like they're demons I don't like them at all a little beady eyes like they're up to no good but every little kid you're thinking like a why I wouldn't live there because that's there but if you live in New York you at night who knows what's climbing all around your building right oh it could be Eagles and shit right so we're talking about Google get into my house in Google javelina eats baby let's see if that's ever happened yeah human baby let's see if that happened what do you think if I have Alina ate a human yeah like you see those fucking things yes 20 in that guy's trial they're definitely eating babies some exaggerate it wasn't 20 someone's eating a baby right now probably 30 it was probably 12 baker's dozen a baker's dozen of javelinas yeah they would eat a baby a toddler yeah knock it down yeah I mean if they eat a dog yeah they're scared of people they were obviously weren't scared of that dude now that's a full-grown person and a baby doesn't the bird doesn't have anything I know I put it to hair up spikes up to let you know it's threatened did I ever tell you the story when I pulled a rat out of my pool vacuum yeah was it alive no did stink it did it stunk I'm like why isn't the vacuum working did you think about a divine and I pulled it up and there was a half a rat it's ass sticking out the vacuum as soon as I got it above the water flies just pull it out without it there's a quick raking where the fuck are the flies before the shit good question where the fuck are they all over there not that many like if you if you're around by a person backyard yeah how often you see flies now and then there's one it's kind of annoying but if you just pulled your pants down shat on the ground flies on that was it a matter of moments oh you mean right after I swam Yeah right after you swam right under law I mean you're after swim shit yeah yeah and then all of a sudden they show up yeah it's disgusting it happened so fast so gross all of a sudden they're all over yeah where'd you guys come from we should just stay inside well did you find a baby death from a javelina a couple of months ago it's not come people in it Arizona were attacked and they had like Oh maaaan was bit while she was walking her dogs another guy was bit while he was feeding them and he didn't feed it fast enough and it bit him that's about as much like a fine well the lady who got bit that's the scary one because the guy who fed him was an asshole Yeah right the scary one there was a lady got bit by a coyote recently in Dallas oh yeah no no no yeah I was around the Dallas area I think they think that this is one coyote that's been biting people it's a rogue unusual coyote just snapping at people oh really yeah they had bite marks on their legs oh my god that's gross man because they will kill you yeah they would kill you they're just small they're just not sure if it's worth the effort and you're around people and they're worried that you know one on one cuz you fight off a coyote I don't know if you could man I mean I think you probably could if you had to but they'll fuck you up man just keep buying there's a few of them that's where the real problem comes if they bite you in the right spot yeah man the rip your tendons apart you won't be able to run away they know what they're doing to you know though they try to take your legs out I mean they know what they're doing they're not gonna try to jump up and bite you in the neck they're gonna try to take your your hamstrings out right trying to rip your legs apart so you can't run okay so mean that's how they're alive you're not leaving any food out for them are you no I've got to do what they got to do it's called domestication that's how we have dogs you ever take your family camping I have not yeah I haven't either I would though I wanted to take my kids to Yosemite because I love Yosemite do you bring a peace sign arm nothing nothing just went solo we weren't killing we're staying in an end we're staying in an inn what about emergency food no my phone nothing oh just a phone first-aid kit nothing a bag of Funyuns and an iPhone mmm so I need and I want to show them you assembly because it's such a great part of my life I love it I've been lived in the backcountry for like a week at a time I just love the whole thing and I'm telling them about and I'm building it up they're like you know we grudgingly going they're all vegetarians they just love nature they just love whatever so I'm like you're gonna love Yosemite as soon as we drove into the park welcome to Yosemite I ran over a squirrel the horror inside the car dad you didn't even slow down what's wrong you're a monster like I can't it's two lanes there's a guy behind front I just would steamroll the squirrel they were so I hope they were in the whole weekend any time I'd be like look at this look at this beautiful view you killed a squirrel you didn't even care that's the weird part dang you didn't even care is that what this hand yeah I suppose do cry I was just laughing right like a bitch exactly that's why he killed a deer you'd be sadder right yeah I can't damn I can't believe that oh she was so nice with a little eyes and a little tail this is grow up peccary yeah if you kill him I'm javelinas he's a fucking rat thing fine it's mom then javelina would ruin your that much to bite your teeth could probably use its teeth to tear your tires apart and be stuck in the side of the road trying to change the tire you turn around there's a whole pack of them closing in on you would you not take your family because of all of this event do you not want them in the woods with you what am i a danger in the woods or become a werewolf what the fuck you just got a senior night trust me I'll be right back not that you're the threat run that you'd have to protect them from all the threats well I mean Yosemite doesn't have that many threats other than people bears they have black bears then yeah most of mountain lion mountain lions are an issue there's always something out there yeah grizzly bears or you just you just don't feel like that's because you like going out in the nature you go I do it stuff I do like one of the nature I also like be indoors like sleeping in a place where it's awesome to sleep people wiser than me I figured out that that maneuver is called a bed with a roof and a locked door and a refrigerator you fucking cave person oh I'm gonna rough it I'm gonna sleep on the ground you don't have to did you know that house yeah but when you go hunting and stuff don't you sleep in the woods sometimes most the time no I'm gonna have oh you don't you go back depends on what what guys I go with right like if I go with Steve Rinella we always almost always go camping except for when we're at our friend Doug Durin's place which is he lives in Wisconsin and he's got a giant farm I hunt deer on hunted deer on there and that place he's got a cool little little like a deer hunting house oh yeah that's near this yeah like a cabin it's like a house it's like a house how nice it's a small house that everybody like hangs out there's in different spots there yeah right right right I'd like to take my kids camping there's something nice about yeah leapin in the woods enjoy nature yeah you know else it's cool not getting eaten HBO take a shower in the morning that's nice yeah a coffee that's the big thing yeah yeah look uh there's nothing better than a campfire I know hanging out uh especially at the end of a long day of hiking yeah it's an ass campfire and and if you get one of those little grates over the campfire you start cooking kaboom the best things in life I know yeah and I feel like my kids don't have that connection because uh do you worry about being with them in the woods yeah a little bit if anybody gets hurt it's hard to get out yeah and just that you know it's like if you and I went we're both responsible for we'd help each other out but I'm gonna leave you got your act to get but I'm gonna leave you I'm sorry what I'm gonna leave say that again yeah I just planning a camping trip like we're gonna look out for each other I'm gonna leave you behind I'll tell you right now with you but I'm not I can't handle any adversity I will fall apart which don't were you going and we're not going in too far I will walk one mile when the alarm goes off dude seriously you're not gonna help me out no I'll call somebody when I go back there I'll owe someone I'll just file the blood he's got a backpack full of slim jims to be all right it'll be good he's got enough food on well I left him one liter of my piss you can drink that just not as like where I peed a horrible camping I've got good news and bad news the bad news is I don't have any water the good news is I have to pee what I wanted me to fill up your gnal gene bottle awful no but you're if you go with your kids and you're like you're responsible for everybody and everything and yeah that's pretty yeah maybe just a hike well there's nothing wrong with camping with you kids a good idea just you know you have to you should if you really are gonna go camping you definitely should bring first aid and definitely bring a satellite phone and and you can camp in places that you know you're not backcountry yeah a mile in you could just you know pull up walk 200 feet get yourself a fucking Airstream son pull that bitch behind ya part turn the generator on satellite TV yeehaw that would be fun I've won you you can rattle those floors you can rent those in just making friends yeah I think I would like to like load them up in an RV kind of situation go see the Grand Canyon Oh like a Utah vacation yeah Chevy Chase yeah yeah yeah I think that gonna be fun two more people just died in the Grand Canyon what fell yeah really yeah why they're not uh no just doing the railings I don't know I don't know what happened I just read to more people just follow their death and the grand can really let's see if you find out what's going on why are people that was one of the first hikes I did with my father we do in the switchbacks what you said Jeff I thought there's a reason why I see one guy who's got too close and slipped and I need to know stop falling if I had Google glass I didn't known already yeah if I had that memory link why everything that Jamie's worried about Jamie's gonna be the first one to get it then he's gonna like organize to make sure they know that's it my thought on that too is like we're gonna be the first one to get it and how yeah aside that um well for sure like money Marcus Brownlee and Lou from unbox therapy they'll get it first and they'll put it on and then they'll start running the world that doesn't have it early and they go out no one else gets this don't you but Mark Zuckerberg probably already has it you don't want to know what right now yeah offend his case yeah it's um it's coming something's coming yeah man what's it gonna be who knows what's gonna be yeah something's coming and something's gonna be more invasive than what we're experiencing now mm-hmm so I can be sure of they're gonna figure out to get more and more data you know Sam Harris has a really interesting podcast that's out it's either the one that's going on right maybe the two weeks ago and it was all about I should probably find it it was all about privacy privacy and what's the difference between the way different tech companies approach privacy actually makes you respect how Apple does it oh yeah yeah I mean they apparently they do it much more I guess the world would be their more ethical about it uh-huh was then they're trying not to give away any the trouble with Facebook is what it's called I was reading a thing yesterday that you know you put those doorbell things on you know like ring you know that records people coming up to you and they said you know you think it's cool for you and your family but the UPS guy all these delivery people are getting their picture taken and sent to a database every day like these people are being monitored all the time so well it's good for you it's not that great for these other people that visit you this guy's name is Roger McNamee that's the one it's the trouble of Facebook it's episode 152 it's really it's very interesting because that what it goes into is about how tech companies figured out how to tap into a resource that no one thought of and that resource is your data and how much is that worth well it turns out it's worth fucking untold billions right it's one of the most valuable things cuz it you can direct market to people you could find out what people are in tune with they're not into yeah you get a you get a lot of people you can get a hold of and we kind of gave our consent to this without understanding it yeah and they got in through a loophole and this is how they're able to make you know ungodly amounts of money just because we wanted to have that cool feature so you just say yeah here's take it from me I mean think about the amount of money something like facebook brings in versus what it is like what is it what are you doing what are you doing this making all that money right they're providing people with data yeah you know and they're also getting people to the it's like an ongoing psychological experiment in what makes people engage mm and what makes people comment more right it's out it's anger oh really yeah it turns out that what makes people engage the most as things they disagree with when they started having fights and fights back and forth so you you get people to get really into these polarizing subject right and then you once they start looking for those subjects then those subjects start showing up in their feeds it's all such things they get angry about so then they start interacting with these things the more you interact the more more it shows up in your feed and all the while they're profiting on enraging you like I mean this is essentially what they do see Facebook patent uses image recognition to scan your personal photos for brands oh my god yeah so they just take all your photos and burrito bags in the back applying computer vision algorithms to user uploaded multimedia objects to detect specific objects within the multimedia object and promoting the uploaded multimedia object from a user's newsfeed to a Sponsored Stories area that's what the patent was awarded for Wow easily a vision content detection for Sponsored Stories wow that's crazy man yeah you snap a selfie sippin a unicorn frappe at Starbucks and then shares that selfie on Facebook or Instagram Facebook's new we patented technology and theoretically scan the photo spot the Starbucks cup with the help of an image object recognition algorithm and then sell that info to Starbucks alerting the coffee giant of the fact that you like its product well they're already doing a version of that with your searches yeah things you're looking at you know when you go through their browse or they're already doing that well they're doing it also with voice your phone is listening to you all the time yeah if you have Alexa in your home it's listening mm-hmm my kids and we we do it all the time like you talking about something and then all of a sudden you see I was performing in Boise and so we were talking about Boise Boise Boise and then everybody on their Instagram was getting an ad for vacationing and Boise see that seems gesture must speaking it yeah that seems like a really serious thing it is it seems like a really serious thing that everybody is just like oh this is happening yeah I remember signing off on this the technologies ahead of our anger or our recognition yeah we don't understand you know so it's already happened by the time you're upset that it exists right yeah it's it's in full full force right now yeah yeah it's really weird it's really weird it's really weird and we're just talking about it this is just we think it's you're just in in your home you're in a private place mm-hmm yeah but these phones they're this list you know and again this is something that didn't exist 10 years ago 15 years ago these concerns didn't exist yeah what will be the concerns 15 years from now look how much more invasive as it's going to get before we even recognize that it's happening yeah cuz this is this is something the the listening in on things is something that people didn't think about before it happened right now they know it does well the face recognition thing is there's a lot of articles on that and how that we don't realize well the China thing totally makes sense right especially yeah so many people's phones use face recognition software right well the Samsung phones have it you know my Galaxy Note 9 has it yeah iPhones have it yeah yeah and you're psyched about it you're just like oh that's cool I don't have to put in my password anymore mhm I just looked at yeah yeah I'm in my app they also have one that's an iris scanner on the note the note scans your irises oh really yeah Wow it's quick to look see your eyeballs like yep you're you fuck do you know man what does that say Jamie I was trying to find this the first time you brought up but I know that there's these masks that exists that are looking quotes like hyper-realistic masks and I can be used to I don't know if it's this is used to help the face recognition but I think people are using them to trick it and do fake stuff and like you know if you could commit a robbery with that on and whoa right just like having a ski mask on now they just can't see your face but it will think if you had a hoodie on yeah what about in Minority Report remember when they had to pull his eye they were selling eyeballs on the black market for the eye scan to get into bill all you have to do with that is put like a bandana around your mouth right yeah so it couldn't no one could see your mouth moving have that thing on sunglasses yeah but my even my iPhone gets through my sunglasses which I don't know how I know so what's facial recognition so but what I'm saying is with this like if you wanted to rob someone and have something like even with the face recognition software would would think that it would legitimately think you were somebody else hopefully no and what about Philly if we won we're doing our job someone yeah and we're trying to rob so hopefully not UTIs criminals it's crazy it's gonna happen wait it's so fast I mean yeah you know this is so new also the like the special effects technology that allows people to make faces okay look how beautiful those things look yeah it's so close to a person yeah he's for 200 bucks you can fly we should do it I should buy you and that would be cool that'd be crazy see if it can open up your phone looks super creepy but oh that's so weird oh you guys are a demon if they got a little latex it could be movable it'd be kind of wow that looks pretty real though I mean you know a little creepy but that looks pretty accurate that's crazy act I wouldn't look twice on the walk down the street wouldn't even think about it now you'd be like that guy has a good shave beautiful person has skin so smooth the baby's bottom it was started off that's my face calm and it's not been switched to whatever this is your meaning surveillance that's just creepy she's there do you guys know is there a problem with doing like any of those 23andme ancestry there you're gonna have your DNA bro the government you're gonna the Illuminati is gonna check your fucking spit do they is it bad to do I don't know I do not do it what are they gonna do with it how they're gonna clone me here bro if they want your DNA they can get it just by touching your clothes getting a hold of your stuff yeah they can get a hold of you they could they could find out all sorts of stuff from hair samples right behind hair yeah if you drink a Starbucks and then they grab your cup they can get a DNA strand off your cup then someone can get your DNA sample right so it doesn't really matter as much so if I want to find out if I'm Greek or Italian should find out I should find out yeah it's pretty comprehensive have you done it yeah I've done it oh yeah yeah it's interesting it gives you a lot of other weird stuff to like that you might have certain genes for certain proclivities even including like lactose intolerance propensity to alcohol oh really alcoholism yeah mmm some super athletes have certain muscle genes you should find out if you have those genes and power athletes like almost extraordinary number of ones that are successful in certain sports oh really yeah a type of gene yeah it gives you all this you have to specify is that yeah yeah oh it's a really detailed report oh wow yeah it's it's really detailed and covers all sorts of different categories yeah it's cool too and you find out like weird stuff you know what part of Europe your parents were from you know maybe you have some Asian and you didn't know how you have it's it's really cool yeah that's cool it's cool it's um it's just it makes you really think to get here in 2019 mm-hmm what had to happen he had all the people in the past and if you keep going back you know I have a little bit of Asian in me oh yeah it was like 1% or something like that but thinking like where that come from like ooh where was that is that why you like jiu-jitsu I don't think so I think a lot of people just like jiu-jitsu bro is that why you like sushi um I don't think it's that Asia I'm from a different Asia but I don't know oh I think you know if you saw somebody though went through Asia hooked up with somebody yeah for sure but what I'm saying is I think that if you look at what technology was available like 200 years ago for finding ancestry right people didn't even know if that was their kid 50 years ago exactly two years ago yeah I guess you know yeah I mean maybe they had paternity test 50 years ago did they like just trying to find your roots like back in Italy you just have to go find like Town Hall and there's a book with your great-grandfather's name in it yeah but I mean you didn't even know if your dad was really your dad if your mom was a hoe well I knew that I knew that around sixth grade I figured that out if you wanted to know a hundred years ago if you the father of someone's child you have to look at the kid and go the kid looks like man yeah or convinced yourself that the kid looks like you're right or convinced yourself the kid just got your wife's features but it's still your kid right now you can actually get DNA test done it'd be like ooh you know what the coldest heart of shit is when you find out that it's not your kid but you still have to pay child support because you've been paying child support and you still have to if the DNA confirms that he's not it's in different states there's different rules well I believe that's how it is in California and I believe that's how it is in several other states who wear if turns out the young lady had strayed now caught side dick hey hey hey whoa gotta go now we got to keep paying yeah whoo you know that's not gonna keep an even if you do a DNA test and you find out the child's not yours I think once you have started paying unless you you might have to go to court and Duke it out but I don't think your payment obligation stops just cuz it's not your kid oh and what a weird shift to like mm-hmm you think it's this kid and you're supporting them then to be switching your head like no I'm not gonna help him anymore they didn't have testing really until the 80s whoa yeah till the 80s oh it's a whole new world Oh new world ye know J trial was one of the first ones that people didn't really even believe it remember that's kind of how that's right and they started just see us saying that they didn't know how to handle the samples and well wasn't there was some funkiness with that too stepping all over it yeah you still didn't believe the one-in-a-trillion kind of numbers they were passing out right I think overzealous aggressive like police and detectives I think that's common I think that's a sure arm it is did you see that fucking half a Tesla sentiment mowed did you see that shit no you know Tesla is a century mode and it caught some politician back in his Escalade into a model three scuffing it up getting out looking at it trying to rub it out and then taking off and they called him up because they could see his face in the video and they knew who it was because this guy had been like a kind of prominent politician and so um here it is there's those little little nick but they said it was like $2,000 to my Jesus that's a lot of money for the Little Neck yeah it seems a little ridiculous little scuff so the dude just backs into it and tries to jet yeah it's funny yeah bonk right into the Tesla to the side look at that it's always recording yeah he just backed his stupid car doesn't know how to drive he might have been drunk yeah yeah look at him looks at looks at it alright don't do well he tried to fix it he's in deep shit he tried to fix it the fuck he did he denied it when they call them oh they do yeah and apparently that guy had already been to jail for something else yeah here dirty yeah he it's not good he might be that's our man i i bumped in someone's car once and i left a note with my phone number and my my address nice and are not my address my phone number and my name and they called me up and they just so happened to be very good friends with someone who else runs with huh so then he calls me up and he tells me dude you hit my friend's car that's that i go tell him to call me man that's cool yeah it was noble well I it wasn't bad but it was something yeah you know it was like it was a little scuff on the bumper right but it was my it was I was like thank God I left a message yeah I feel like such a piece of shit yeah my friend and he was like and some fucking asshole hit my friend's car and took off you believe that shit like no crazy that's that's bullshit and now cameras have everybody doing everything so you'll always get busted yeah when do you think it's gonna be where you have a Tesla you know what those things do when do you think it's gonna be where no one's driving how many how many more years we're well we're a lot of people aren't driving 20 yeah I would say 20 to 30 you ever went Priuses were a joke yeah someone had to preach like get that fucking stupid thing away from me yeah or even the early Tesla the Roadster like do you know that top gear you want to know you know that British knob gear yes what's crazy I found out they did an episode where they pretended that the Tesla Roadster died on them while they were driving around the track but it didn't really die on though that was just a storyline that they wanted it to die so that's gross apparently the way the show is made it's like a comedy show and it's scripted so they can get away with doing something like that so Elon Musk sued them and I think he lost believes because I because they don't claim to be exactly they don't claim to be factual and they complained that they they don't they don't claim to not have narratives right they create that's so gross just to make sure that I'm gross pretty gross it's amazing how many shots that they take Elon Musk called Top Gear completely phony and his company sued for libel and malicious falsehoods a judge dismissed the suit in October saying no viewer the program could have reasonably be compared the Roasters performance on the track to a real-world performance on the street that seems fuzzy I don't know what that means yeah okay what is 2012 that way what is the case what did he said what Ellen must said that it was that they faked it and they claimed the power Tesla fire okay let's see what it says we could figure out I think I'm pretty sure that's the story after test to drop the car off Elon Musk claimed that one of his employees was along for the delivery notice that a script for the episode inside there was a segment about the Tesla breaking down but that was only the tip of the iceberg Top Gear claimed that the Tesla Roadster ran out of power while driving after just 55 miles much less than the 200 miles quoted by Tesla albeit it was being driven hard a claim that musk said was untrue according to him the roadsters logs showed that the car had never dipped below 20% charge during the entirety of the filming the clip followed with the roadsters motor overheating which wasn't addressed by musk and finally a brake failure which must claims was instead a blown fuse and not an equipment failure battery-powered electric cars will soon die altogether former Top Gear host James Mesa is it amazing so they were said it sounds like there was some horse ship for sure but it does sound like there was a real brake problem and the brake problem was a blown fuse which there's nothing you can do about that but just that it's such a strange thing that yeah you just have to attack electric cars like it's just said well I think the web them making a script if they have a script yeah sad the test was gonna break down they thought it would be funny look at how many bit it's a comedy show where Jeremy Clarkson was fucking hilarious he's really funny yeah but there is definitely wealthy people that are yeah you believe a lot of the stuff that they say and the performance of the car I would you know I always thought it was funny but I also saw them as experts well they kind of are yeah I mean they know a lot of shit yeah they know a lot of shit about cars for sure Jeremy Clarkson knows a lot about cars the problem is people go to them for advice and lap times and all that shit and if you're saying it car is breaking down you you engineered that yes script it's pretty dirty that is dirty well that's how like Sean Hannity gets away with saying that he's not a news program does he get away with that yeah dubby dub says news yeah he says it's a it's a it's entertainment really yeah yeah yeah it's way you have a little a
