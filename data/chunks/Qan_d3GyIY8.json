Pryor my my mom why she's a great old gal I guess there are a few people that talk like that but there's a lot of motherfuckers who talked like my black voice okay it's not like you have to go find them like gee garlicky gee whiz gee whiz her maker know there's a lot of dudes they'll be like we finna do this podcast that's not even ridiculous that sounds exactly what a lot of black people sound like but for whatever fucking reason man black people are so super sensitive about just a little good-natured joking around I got in trouble the other day I went to like a five-star restaurant called the Ritz I don't know if you ever heard it but it was like like the most widest place ever like there was for waiters one for district classes and they were all standing by your tables for my birthday right and I twittered a joke like I really wish they would let black people in here ha ha ha you know as a joke and people got so fucking pissed off at me and I had to explain like no I was making fun of that I was making fun how how how white how white it was it was disgusting yeah people are super goddamn sensitive I made one fucking joke and I think the joke was there was something real obvious in the news I forget what it was and my response to it was so they're telling us some shit that we already knew like what what's next you're gonna tell me that many black people don't tip you know which by the way I'm not saying all but I'm saying many I'm saying it's it's a known thing that if you work in red trots a lot of times black people don't tip if you're black and you tip god bless you you know I'm not saying is anything wrong with that but I am from Italian descent I'm Italian and Irish and I've said on many occasions that my people are fucking monkeys those fucking dummies those wannabe Soprano dummies there's so many dumb Italians it is embarrassing to be Italian all the time the Italians make some badass food and there's a certain Robert De Niro percentage of Italians that are bad motherfuckers there's a few rocky Marciano's out there in the world but by and large the great percentage of Italians are douchebags and that's me that's me we're just being realistic nothing wrong with that but for whatever fucking reason I say this thing about black people tipping and people are calling me races and all this fucking shit so this weekend I'm in Philadelphia right were there for the UFC and I'm with my boy Tommy jr. and his girl Katie and we get high as Jesus on the fucking Space Shuttle we got we got down we went deep when I come up minutes up yeah you know it's

three of us are just giggling our asses off going work to I did go outside we're so high we're so nervous and paranoid but we're going to see Planet of the Apes we had decided the the the evening was I was looking forward to this weekend very much because usually on Friday night before the UFC I always do a show we always do a show somewhere but this weekend I was just gonna play pool with Tommy and Tommy you know texted me somewhere during the week dude plan of the apes opens this week let's do that too I fuck yeah we got a you know from me man I've got kids little babies and they constantly need supervision and I don't really get a chance to just go fuck off for a whole day so this is I do the the weigh-ins are done by five o'clock and I'm hanging out with Tommy right after that I do some UFC shit for like an hour and then we're hanging out so we're so high we we can't think straight we're just giggling but little giggles silly hi it wasn't like my kind of high where it's like thinking about Jupiter and you know what happens if a planet hits another planet no it's the it's Jody s tile hi so we're giggling and we have a driver luckily I have this guy taking us around you know like a big town car but whatever those SUV things so the guy takes us to this movie theater I go take us to whatever the good movie theater is in town right and he goes well the good movie theater is over here and it so it takes me to super white neighborhood where all the movies are shit movies it's all like foreign films you know those weird those what are those theaters call yeah will you go there and you go what the fuck is this movie would either look for something that you recognize but everything's alternative I'm sure some of them are good but I've seen something that everybody told me we're good cuz they were alternative like like fucking was Ghost Dog whatever that samurai one was with Forest Whitaker episode gets so amazing it was such a piece of shit it was such a dumb movie and everybody's like it's amazing America because it's because it's an independent film so it's one of these Laemmle films so anyway we we can't go to there so I go you got to go to one where there's Planet of the Apes and we're gonna go see Planet of the Apes so I look on the iPhone app and it says okay take me to this one and the guy goes okay goes that in a good neighborhood they said yeah yeah guy barely speaks English he takes us there we get out and we're giggling plebes we walk into Planet of the Apes we walked into Africa dude we walked in the door and there was no white people there was no white people we plan the if it didn't take place in Africa I was a racist thing to say do you see what I'm saying what I'm saying is finally stuck to your hands yeah we would happen is we walked into the blackest neighborhood we could find I mean it was there was literally no white people it was amazing and everybody was super cool you know it wasn't a negative experience and this is something I wrote on on Twitter that we all went to we see Planet of the Apes in a black neighborhood and experience I highly recommend and all these fucking people started calling me a racist I mean dozens of Twitter people do I didn't know your race is fuck you like black people were saying fuck you I'm like listen man I am saying it was a positive experience if I said I highly recommend and it was a black neighborhood and we get in there right and we're so we're so particularly hot and then I realized I whoa everyone's black here like well I mean everyone's blacker this is crazy and then a bunch of people recognize me in these don't want to taking pictures and it's all good everybody's cool and friendly cool shit cooler shit like this guy goes yo man I don't yeah I know you from I don't want to I don't want to bother you man I'm not trying to use up your time wait I know you from I go fear factor I know but it's the way he said it was like so cool and weird giggling oh no one did the smoke Rox thing but I took a lot of goddamn pictures and soot like I said super cool super friendly this is not a negative story so then we go into the movie theater right it's me Tommy and like maybe there's another white person maybe one other white person movie theater filled with black people and they are having a good fucking time you know people always complain that black people talk to the movie theater and talk the screen yes they do yes they do but it's good fucking yeah if that's what you know and the way I felt like I'm like look I'm in their neighborhood this is how they go to the movies who the fuck am i to be offended by how they like to go to the movies they they were at the movies and I'm not saying all black neighborhoods do this but this particularly black neighborhood these people brought babies bro I mean there's a lot of people with babies yeah I mean it wasn't just one these these people in front of us walked in and they had toddlers like little two-year-olds sitting on their lap to see planet of the fucking apes at like 10:40 on a Friday night give a fuck about give a fuck not didn't give a fuck but I'll tell you what made me really nervous and made me feel kind of weird was watching all of these previews of all these different TV shows or over these different movies rather they're coming out and I'm watching these movies and all of them are about white people oh and I'm sitting there and I'm going wow this is weird like imagine being a black person and I always thought like people would complain like I'd hear black people complain about you know oh there's no films for black people there's no roles for black actors and I'd be like so you gonna make your movie what do you want from me you know but you go to a goddamn movie theater with all black people that's when you really feel it I'm sitting there in the audience and all these people are black but every movie preview is white there's no black characters and then finally there's this movie with Jonah Hill they show a preview for the movie and it's Jonah Hill and he's doing all this different shit he's babysitting kids but he's supposed to be like a cool guy and the way they show you who's a cool guy is there's an old black guy working like at a door at a club like the black guys there and Jonah Hill is talking black to him you know it is what it is brother it is what is and I'm watching this with all these black people watching this white guy talk like a black guy and I'm in this fucking theater filth and I'm like and up high as fuck I mean just barbecued sitting there soaking in this experience going wow this is fucked up like what no wonder why black people are angry and they feel disenfranchised like they're completely removed from the mainstream cultural experience in a lot of ways like that is a tiny percentage of black people that are included in movies so finally Planet of the Apes plays everyone's white in the movie except the bad guy the bad guy is a black guy and I thought it was so strange and I'm and not only that he's a bad guy who owns this giant company and he has an English accent it's like not only Zeo but you it's like you couldn't have a brother from Philadelphia that figured out how to own this corporation it couldn't be a guy even a brother that talks like a regular businessman type dude you know who's like well what we need to do is acquire this and you know once we get that and it will be on moving and then we get in the force we no no no no this guy has an English accent he doesn't sound like anybody you know and this is the only black guy in the fucking movie and I'm like wow and then the rest of the movie is just bad ass monkeys just bad ass chimpanzee so this was a CGI awesome was it oh my god is it good first of all the movie is the shit plan of the Apes is a dope movie it's a good movie for everybody it's it I think it's pg-13 believe it or not yeah because the violence is all sort of implied like you know what the fuck went down but they don't really show it to you but it's not removed from violence it's a terrifying movie and the like you know I don't want to say I can't oh the old ones did you watch i watch although all five watched all of them and what do you think of the first one it's still sensation it's a well you know you have to put yourself back in the tribe because back in the time it was a great movie it's like a lot of movies they don't hold up because you you have to realize that culturally human beings have evolved in a huge way from 1970 to 2011 I mean if you want any proof that something is happening to our culture and that things are expanding and moving forward in an exponentially increasing way all you have to do is look at old movies old movies are almost unwatchable unwatchable yeah the AVD concept is unwatchable don't we don't last that long well not only that this is not good like I watched altered states I try I mean you know I'm captain isolation tank you know I mean I mean I mean that goddamn thing all the time and I got I learned about the isolation tank from that movie I learned about ayahuasca from that movie I learned a lot of shit from that movie that movie was a big oldest that fucking 84 or something like that I think so I'm just talking out of my ass I'm guessing though William Hurt right isn't it it's 1980 that's even earlier than I thought that's dirty fucking one years again it's so bad or anyone fucking years ago somebody needs to redo that goddamn movie because that's a fascinating thing especially with ayahuasca being so popular you know and isolation tanks are pretty goddamn popular right now - I think it's amazing that isolation tanks a lot of while it's popular is us a lot of while it's popular is talking about on the podcast and talk about it in videos you know that's incredible that no one is talking about one of the most amazing tools for the human mind ever created and it's not like it's a fucking you know one of those things that they had to build in the movie contact and it cost a billion dollars you need fucking cranes to put it into place well it's fucking simple I mean there's directions for building these goddamn things on the Internet was the movie in 3d no not the one I saw was not in 3d I don't know it is in 3d I don't know I'm not aware know what's really crazy but it were I'm awesome is my witness we went to Philly about 18 months ago to two years ago we ran out of weed and somebody gave us a joint on the way to the club and the same thing happened to us so you don't fucking remember yeah I mean we brought some weed to Philly oh yeah it was probably 10 DJ what was the DJ gave it to us it was one of guys who works at the radio station and all four of us were like we don't want no more and it's something that you really have to think about that I got to come out here and pay 300 for an ounce and back that they're paying 125 and they get fucking blitz yeah they're getting that that indica they're crazy silly nothing like that Brown it's definitely a different high it's definitely a different that high that I got was you know that East Coast high was it's um it's a silly it's a silly high if you don't like think we weren't thinking about the universe but I was very sensitive to this whole situation you know it was like you know it made me feel like my own you know what a black people have many a fucking Tyler Perry you know they have Tyler Perry that's their mogul that's the guy who's making a lot of movies it's all these goddamn my ADA movies and what else is it I mean there's not that many movies boobs like every three months they put out an all-black funeral it's it's sad I mean for every Spike Lee how many fucking real good you know every John Singleton how many real good representatives for black people are there out there you know it's kind of it's it was really interesting to be in a black theatre and you had a good fucking tired of gray fur you know where I have a good time on Tuesdays you wanna have a good time with black people on to it and I'm not being fuckin prejudice for funny I'm just see if you want to see black people their natural environment you go to fucking Popeyes Chicken on Tuesdays they give you a wing and a breast of 99 cents and I made the mistake one night I go tell you spicy spicy we had that yeah I went to Popeyes Chicken and it's a one on Laurel Canyon like if you're gonna Popeyes Chicken on Hollywood and Cahuenga it's full it's full of brothers staying done you could do but Laurel Canyon you're like they ain't gonna be a brother I don't even think about the way and I've been there before he's a special it's a wing and a breast for 99 cents dawg they come out of the fucking would work for this you understand me around the corner but the best was I seen a real motherfucking gangster brother this guy hate 20 pieces of chicken and didn't get off the phone now one fuckin time that's a real bad motherfucker the only time he got off the phone was astir bitch for hot sauce and still I sat there and watched all suck it on the bone sucking on him breaking him in half while he was on the phone to his bitch fuck another thing that people got mad at me for for asking why is it that I keep seeing black dudes talking on speakerphone out loud by themselves I see it all the time in public black dudes holding the phone the next their face go yo what it is oh okay and they're talking on the other phone when it's not near their face we talked about this once about my ex people got mad at my ex girlfriend does that - she's black relax we'll add so much flavor flavor to the world oh if it wasn't for these fucking black people we just see a bunch of cowboys and horses listen the fuck well think about white people from Utah Dan's Lysol oh fuck it entertaining drove my wife this morning at 7 o'clock you gotta go get a blood test or some shit Donna Kaiser on the way back I cut back to the and I went to North Hollywood Park you ready for this one this is food for thought there wasn't a soul in Hollywood Park North Hollywood Park but black people teaching karate North Hollywood Park beautiful Park you know those squirrels will let you feed them oh please it's a beautiful fucking Park there's a dude a Chinese dude who sits out there with a bag of squat I'm in there dog that's a great fuck guy sits out there I talked dog to him I talked his language a guy sits out this Chinese guy sits out there with a fucking peanut and he'll just have a bag of him and he lies on his back and he puts his hands out and those squirrels come up and they just hang out with that dude they take two things like they don't even run they'd have him back up before they eat they eat right there they just take it right from them that's a great fuckin part and so as black dudes doing karate I'll turn karate sticks do it forms no nothing but they do motherfucking karate only brothers does it's a find you never you really wanted there's two movies I seen the black movie thing that was intersessional the one movie was Rambo - I told you the other day but the best movie ever I seen the one about the black what's the guy when he comes out of the black show gonna Harlem yeah I seen that Harlem glass dragon the last dragon was entertainment like them I'm sure that's the movie saying money I would just buy a black movie just go there and laugh my ass off fuck and you go over to this club what's this one on Sunset the atrium what's that one $90 to go to the movie theatres so hard play one of the fucking Bauer's what I went last year twenty two and four fifty four a sausage sandwich and I just want to see a fucking movie kind $90 of the food I just want to see a fucking movie I worked New Jack city opening night in Columbus Ohio at one of the scariest movie theaters and you don't want to go to this is a difference you don't want to go see a gangster black neighborhood notice I definitely want to go see a martial arts martial arts you don't want an action film oh I had to sit in the back of the theater the whole time and watch that movie because it was like like midnight opening night New Jack city I'm sitting in the back I'm a white general manager all my staff is black and so I'm sitting there like what is this New Jack city maybe what's the head to watch the whole thing and there was fights there was one time where there's like ladies start hitting this other lady and went into like the hallway and I had to like kick him out it was one of the most scariest moments of my life working that movie Wow and one of the best movies ever saw - so well one of the best haunted houses I haven't went to we went to Asbury Park for Halloween to a haunted mansion the city of North Bergen rented buses and they took you to different places and we went down and had this thing the Brigantine Castle I think I told you already we went in there you know they got Dracula and Frankenstein right when you walk around Abu where I'm supposed to get scared bro we had to be like maybe 12 and a half and you know you got a little scared we didn't smoke dope that or nothing we just walking around but bro that Dracula bumped into a black dude he said what the fuck do you and these guys were from East Orange that was the other town that was what the fuck is wrong with Dracula motherfucker they started beating the fuck they were 12 just like us you know we thought we were bad Dracula's drag them to the Cape like 16 little black dudes I never laughed so hard in my life one Dracula by the time I got out the cops are there nobody could cop to it they had two kids with their hands up against the wall you don't fuck with it takes a broad spectrum of people to make this world interesting you know and that is true that if you look at like our culture first of all stand-up comedy you know besides Lenny Bruce the number one contributor is black comics Richard Pryor you know in later years Eddie Murphy Eddie Murphy contributed and Chris Rock the the real greats you look at music there's so much black music so much black influence on Led Zeppelin even on fucking Lynyrd Skynyrd man you know Lynyrd Skynyrd they were influenced by a lot of black guys that fucking song The Ballad of Curtis love amazing I'm Wade song about a black guy in the south who's teaching them how to play the blues you know or playing the blues for him when he was a little kid man it's it's a it was a fun fucking experience we had a great goddamn time at that movie theater it didn't matter there was babies talking it didn't matter because that was that was the movie that was the experience that we signed up for and I'll tell you what man a lot of dudes saying shit made the movie better there was like one scene where the dude goes oh he running shit now and everybody started laughing got in they started chiming in with their own shit women were talking to each all even like this look at that motherfucker all happy and it was just back and forth and it went on for a few seconds worth as long as everybody thought it was acceptable and then the movie kept going but it was they made the movie louder the movie was really loud and I was wondering like I wonder if they make it loud because people talk in the movie theater right I wonder because it was loud as fuck but it was it's such an action movie that there's not a lot of moments in that movie that were this like you need quiet you know the mood it's a movies a good goddamn movie man they did it good like I was wondering you know I was like well I bet the CGI will be cool but maybe it'll be corny like I didn't like Cowboys and Aliens I want to see Cowboys and Aliens and it was good it was a good movie I mean I didn't hate it but it was like kind of all over the road and I'm a huge fan of Jon Favreau and I thought that Iron Man was fucking awesome and I just loved him anyway I loved him from swingers and I've met him a couple times and he's super cool so I was really looking forward to it a good goddamn alien movie and I love a good cowboy movie I'm like this gonna be perfect so I was kind of expecting that that plan of the apes would kind of be like that sort of he's probably a lot like that level no way dude it was a strong nine strong nine out of ten the fucking first of all you realize how pathetic and fleshy human beings are when you see like because they they dead these chimps super realistic you know and you think of like a super athlete like a Ray Lewis you know like oh do you think like a Brock Lesnar like the biggest strongest super athlete human and you'd look at would like a hundred and fifty pound chimp does in this movie just long in the shit throws things were I like the way he handles people was so realistic it was really it was really fucking well done man the CGI you watch me you could still kinda tell that it's not really a chimp but only in the face only like the way his face moves therefore the one that was like real human-like just a little bit I mean I hair they're so close but the gorilla god damn the gorilla looks good there's some scenes where this gorilla shows up the gorilla just runs shit but I don't want to tell you anymore I can't tell you anything no spoilers but just the way they did it the fucking the way they're able to have these artificial things interact with with what looks like a real physical environment like this chimp there's gorillas smashing things and Brady looks real as fuck man it looks real as fuck but you're getting a checkered illah to do some shit you could never get a real gorilla to do you couldn't get a real gorilla to act exactly the way you want it but that's what it looks like no it's gonna be crazier than five years when Yuri watch that movie come over shit like shit like going to see I am Legend that stupid scene where the Lions walk out like this fake-ass lion it ruins the whole movie for me like I think they shouldn't have had that scene because that lion looks so stupid like I can't believe they accepted that stupid looking fake line this is not like that this is way better than that this is the next level this is next level shit it's a good plot too it's well-made it's well directed it keeps you fucking captivated it's a perfect summer movie best summer movie to red-state I went to see red-state last week I went to Kevin Smith invited me to go to a screening and I sat right next to Marc Maron which is another kiss we did we hugged we did hug we made up who made up he actually apologized because you know I talked about on the podcast he's so fucking negative I'm like why say you know what the fuck man and that we went over some shit on the podcast he totally copped to it and said you're right I apologize I'm sorry and then we were cool like right away easily he looked really happy - he's with this really pretty girl as does girlfriend girls real pretty he's doing real good now just got back from Chicago he's telling me sold out these shows so he felt like real good so he felt good he looked good and you know it's like people just need some success they just need some happiness in their life you know now he's got a girlfriend she's really pretty and she seemed really nice and obviously they love each other together all nice so it's like good good love so you got some love now and now you willing to give the love back yeah terrific anyway red state is fucking bad-ass Kevin Smith made this movie right he didn't tell me shit about it he said dude I really want you to see this I know you'll dig it okay um he's a real nice guy he's didn't do it he's doing the podcast next week super nice guy I did his podcast I loved met him before I love the guy he's I love him I move ease that I've seen there there are always these silly comedies you know so I'm expecting I'm gonna go see a Kevin Smith movie it's gonna be a silly comedy we get there it is this apocalyptic like cult this cult that believes that the that Jesus is coming and that's what the movie is all about and how they interact with a bunch of people I don't want to tell you any more about it but it's about this religious fanatic it's like basic it's basically a horror movie you know it seems like it's kind of like is an action movie but it's really like a horror movie and god damn is it good I mean is one of the best movies I've seen in fucking years better even than Planet of the Apes as good as I said Planet of the Apes was red-state is slightly better it's good Stephen rude is in it Stephen root is fucking bad-ass in this movie man and the dude who plays the that dude who plays the the guy I don't know what the fuck is his name the dude who plays the guy who plays the John Goodman's in it - I don't know who the other guys there a point maybe where John Goodman good smoochie boo cheese no Michael parks that's the guy's name who plays the the bad guy fuck is this guy good I mean he's he's a guy who's been around a long ass time apparently he's got some crazy ass stories about dudes trying to kill him John John hurt that guy's name Kevin Spence was telling me he's like yeah I got to tell you the whole story later but this guy is famous actor like literally tried to kill this dude twice but this guy plays the he plays the preacher in this movie god damn it's good John Goodman's in it god damn is he good there's no soundtrack to this movie so during the movie what I loved about it one of the things I loved I hate when a movie gives me I mean I loved the Planet of the Apes don't get me wrong it's a well packaged entertaining vehicle it's good but I don't like when a movie plays me some fucking music and tells me how I'm supposed to think I don't that's that's retarded to me I've never enjoyed it I'll tolerate it you know but I always feel relieved when a movie doesn't have any music you know I don't need like they start kissing and fucking violins play get the fuck out of here obviously there's good examples and bad examples but there's definitely some movies that that's the soundtrack is 90% of the movie hmm I disagree I don't like earrings but I don't mind it oh that's different man you're talking about it's like some music with songs and singing and shit I like the back I don't mind yes when I hear Led Zeppelin a little holy I know it's 74 that's I don't mind but I don't like what you're saying to people you know what I'm saying I said it in the time yeah I said it I said it wrong cuz it's not that I don't like soundtracks cuz I do in Goodfellas I like it when it's done the right way well that's what I'm saying yeah except as a time yeah like remember when the Rolling Stones are playing and he's coked up but he's got a bag full of guns on the trunk and he's dried around yeah yeah look that's that in that movie it works what I mean more is the werewolf is running through the woods the fuck out of here with that stupid shit that drives me nuts there's no music in this movie man this music is this movie is brilliant it's cat you would and Kevin Smith describes it as his talking dog movie he's like as if a dog started talking he'd be like what the fuck now he goes that's exactly what this movies like you don't expect it from Kevin Smith did you I see an early cut of it that they know it's done dude it's done no it's done the movies done Kevin did it all himself he's gonna release it all himself he did it all himself no no one had any involvement and that's the brilliant brilliance of this movie he didn't you know he was gonna do a mass release of it but I guess it was just too expensive so he's gonna release it in a limited way just so that it's a eligible for the Oscars and then they're going to do it video on demand I think in September and you know you can get it on DVD and all that she is the reason that you mentioned that I have to stick up for this for the 75 piece though when we watch a movie and it's one of the 70s now it's unbearable to watch but if you really if not always though it's like they except for The Godfather there's a bunch of movies that are still good I could like are hard times you could watch maybe if it's not 11 o'clock never see Friends of Eddie Coyle tremendous fucking tremendous tremendous fucking movie I got turned on that by Anthony Anthony Bourdain no reservations what if I sold your body you wouldn't that's a badass movie I just mean that's a fucking movie Peter I just went about a month ago they had it for five they're at that movie I

way he would talk to people grab mitchum the fuck the size of his hands a big dude that's a big motherfucking country bumpkin man but you want me to tell you some but the 70s tell me something about the old better movies came after than the 70s really let's get down every which way but loose know about the Exorcist yeah I father let's just talk about Planet of the Apes right cuz bro let's get down the first I came from Rocky I came what rocky rocky I came from Cuba and the first movie one the first was I went to see was beneath the Planet of the Apes at the time I lived on 88th Street and Broadway fuck all these motherfuckers if you look at the beneath the plant apes they were under the subway systems really in New York City look at beneath it you got extract from scratch dog you're not gonna sell me to plan the hips unless you start from scratch I don't have to sell you fucking awesome you'll remember the part well you can't torture yourself by not going to say no I'm gonna go see it but what I'm trying to save you is you have to watch that again I've seen it I just haven't seen in years yeah you gotta check yourself that's all I was at 17 1970 when they rip masks off I can't like they sold me on it it's all through New York number they did buy the Statue of Liberty remember that shot flops each guy bent over and then quit what's the blonde guy remember the first one with the girl come on guy what's the first are the got the girl a hot girl that couldn't even fucking talk and he was run Jane Fonda no no the first way fucking killed her it was 1970 everybody's mad at over Vietnam though they rose to plan of the Apes Raquel Welch no baby I don't think so first Raquel was who wouldn't be right now to death 1968 who was the original chicken that Kim Hunter bro I don't know what was but next time you get a minute just watch the first two again get really you ever see that movie I returned to the valley of the dolls er yes what a fuck is wrong with that movie is that Jane Fonda it was Attucks no it wasn't Jane Fonda it was written by Roger Ebert Ebert yes i sat there and seriously tried to follow that movie that makes $0.00 kill hunter was one of the monkeys it's Linda Harrison she's the badass bitch oh god damn is she hot yeah yeah she is all try you guys together watch the first two bro I'm sorry there's a bad motherfucker too and he's like 50 Robert did you know Robert Ebert wrote a movie and it's really so bad of course it is and that's why is it critic listen I really said this I've met some good critics I've met some cool people who are fans of movies and there's there's no hard fast rule to anything there's a lot of people like Doug Benson might as well be a critic he's a huge movie but he's a still a very good comic but he's a he's a huge movie but he might as well be a critic but most critics are critics because they got nothing to contribute that's why they don't want to be critics they really want to they want to be writers they want to be screenwriters they want to be authors they don't have anything to say I don't believe critics anyway sometimes they're wrong I swear to God I thought I saw Doug Benson said that he hated that the new planet they didn't yeah this CGI everything let me see the Dragon which is one of the greatest movies all those movies yeah was stealing from today that were remaking all those westerns all those westerns were in the 70s so the timepiece was fucking brilliant that the thinking was brilliant snot these Momo's nada just remaking shit what is the Clint Eastwood movie where he plays a ghost who comes back to town and fucks everybody at the end and they can't even shoot the body because the people don't shoot the head so every time they shoot the body he'd fall down and get back up no yeah that's the one it's a Western yeah so they think he's dead no no no that guy's dead I came back to town to kill everybody oh my god which one is that he came back to town to kill the whole time they whipped him to death and he came back and he was raping bitches dude he raped this one chick and it's really kind of crazy like the way they show it was a real super realistic okay break tonight each and every movie he always told him what time it was he raped her and he like he only fucked her for like four pumps and I watched it when my friend John once my friend John in New York and he goes see that's how we're supposed to fuck we're not supposed to fuck a girl for an hour and make her cum you're supposed to just fuck four times and because that's what feels good I was like whoa how crazy are you dude uh it's not Doug Benson it's some other comic and I was really surprised cuz he was the only person I saw that didn't like that maybe everyone High Plains Drifter that's a bad motherfucker right there too that's what it is that's the one when they whip them you're right bro you know I got so many of those classics in bar yeah no it's not it that's not in high-plains drifters another one god damn it what the fuck is the movie driving me not really I can't there's Rick Remo so master of clean really so and it was one of my scooter people would let us know this for the good the bad the ugly for a few dollars more Fistful of Dollars and High Plains Drifter it's gotta be one of those maybe in his High Plains Drifter what's the one when he paints the town red paint the town lamb that's it the paint the town red when was the last time somebody painted the town red in the last 20 years you seen a movie nobody that was the most original idea of paint this fucking what do we call the town to hell yeah this is not the movie because in this one it says a stranger rides out of the hot desert into a small town in the Wild West the townspeople are scared of him and three gunmen tried unsuccessfully to kill him he takes a room and decides oh yes yes yes yes yes yeah this is a hanging high so he fucking gets his shields and he builds his shield and he puts on his chest and then when he approaches the people they would shoot at him but even I think it I think we're confusing movies yeah we're confusing all we're confusing movies but I had this gold and put him on tie I got em all I'm like I have a great movie for you guys both the watch it's a documentary of tip as Tiffany stalkers have you heard of it it's called I think we are alone now it follows two guys that are stock stalkers of Tiffany current stalker current stalkers and one of them was the stalker like like 20 years ago or 15 years ago when she you know when she was really young and stuff and I one guy is a transsexual or transgender guy that's Duke going through being becoming a woman and the other guy they both have ass burgers disease or whatever it's and which is like in the autism spectrum is that what that is yeah it's like there's a typo autism they're super super smart but but they can't shut up about it you know like I can't stop talking about it and obsessing about whatever it is so they're on coke smart people on coke smart people on coke but it is so interesting and the fact that they're both their backup like they were both like oh yeah if I would never be able to marry her but I Alyssa Milano on the other hand and both of them had like a backup Alyssa Milano why yeah and it's so weird it's on Netflix dreaming I think so they all love Tiffany but they couldn't marry her but they can marry Alyssa Malave Alyssa Milano is our more realistic girl that they both were obsessed about it's more realistic yeah Tiffany yeah why is she more realistic Tiffany's married now or something and they went through so is Alyssa mom I have no idea time ago yeah well I don't know but it's good so it's called what does it calls very creepy and very fun to watch it's called I think we're alone now Jesus after it was over there's another movie all about Dolly Parton stalkers I forget the name of it but there's $5.00 Parton stalkers and I watch that too and it's also good so it's about Tiffany the other one's about Dolly Parton to UM High Plains Drifter is the movie that is the movie comes back as a ghost and he kills everybody they killed him they whipped him to death that's movies Amanda seventies of all time can't even fuck with it warriors fucking you can't even fuck with it the list goes on can't even fuck with it fuck box office I'm talking about creativity yeah there's a palette once you know the getaway with McQueen was out all the Charles Bronson great ones were done in the 70s all those movies were original these dumb fucks to the edges we make is shit where's Momo's with their fucking things are gonna see it jail writer I wouldn't go see now that shit gun I don't see nothing what shit any of these movies that come out nothing nothing I'm gonna go see Planet of the Apes because I'm a plan of the Apes guy since 1970 I'm gonna go give it a chance but besides that the all these movies I wipe my ass with well I think something that was going on in the 70s the same was going on with music you know I've been on this Leonard Skynyrd kick for the last month I listen to Leonard scare like every fucking day my CD right now almost every day that what that CD I've been breathe don't don't ever ma Claire it's gonna fuck Weezer listening to you today garbage music today is so fucking bad for the fucking Black Keys Oh fuckin the Foo Fighters and let everybody else could suck my dick because it's garbage it all sounds the same fucking Black Keys throw that on they got a video of them you guys what the fuck is playing in Tennessee at a fucking record store go ahead put it on Alec and Tom playing a fucking drum that's Talent the Foo Fighters everything else all these kids sent me these videos like look at these guys redoing Black Sabbath you can't redo Black Sabbath bitch can't redo Black Sabbath there always is to suck my dick dawg they ain't the fucking mo ASIS it can budget Black Sabbath whatever the fuck it is they can't touch what's going on what we grew up with it's garlic what the Black Keys are is real musician real musicians that's what a real musician right now the music industry's dying and they can blame it all they want about these nobody wants to go see these people alive can your magical I love Rihanna but it's 45 minutes a dead time if you go see we have no but please don't stop the music and the other song just standing there watching somebody sing over fucking music there's no instruments on stage and that's happening right oh well it's it's also a recession man it's hard to Celtic music music when the Eagles playing last year for 350 place was sold into the three nights fuck the recession music is music well the Eagles that's why all these old-timers are coming back because the new kids can't perform live really go look at your schedules everybody's back even Steve Miller's his grandson came to see you could go on stage and say you're Steve Miller and no one would know the difference so nobody knows what Steve Miller that's genius jungle love listen to the fuck that motherfuckin Steve Malad oh yeah yeah he was genius man Steve Miller's the only guy who made it famous huge hits and we just never got a fuckin picture taken why would you I know this pictures of it but you know what Mick Jagger looks like man it's unmistakable Mick Jagger walks into a restaurant you fuckin go oh shit Mick Jagger's here Steve Miller can go to Target in his underwear and no-one knows that's true right that's weird what the fuck was going on in the 70s that led to this big creative explosion I mean the 60s and the 70s reefer and good accident no bullshit what are you eating music you can't you're eating because they're laxatives was a cough drops in the mouth was pure the people were pure they have less time to fucking take off their minds today we have all this garbage to take up on mind that creativity was more listened to and everybody was great from Jimi Hendrix Jimi Hendrix pulled out listen to the cutting-edge shit fuckin let's get it put up how was cutting-edge let's face it let's get down to basics fucking rednecks guy yeah from Florida yeah you want some other rednecks put the Allman Brothers on put all those bands on these guys had nothing to lose lose bro Joey you know what you need to do you need to do a nympho commercial for one of

that no abandons ever come five hours in a row like how beautiful is Dark Side of the Moon to where every song flows into the next flows and it's one thing to do asset to that in prettiest thing in the world because Pink Floyd did something that nobody else did they tap into your soul when you do acid if you listen to all their music it always has the boom boom boom boom boom I got molested to comfortably numb' boom boom really yeah I was 21 year old girl lived up the street you got Melissa white girl awesome she's I was 13 she was 21 she was a town slut she lost it everybody that's right

black dog and she turned me on to comfortably numb not like Pink Floyd shit everything everybody talked about all these people I wrote books on acid they did it through music which everybody could suck my dick that's well this probably would talk about drugs the psychedelic there's a great story about Roger Waters in Rolling Stone that I read he was on the cover because you know he's making a comeback you fuck the back door and watch what happens next you see if there's a recession for them they charge 350 without david gilmour that's gonna be a 500-mile ticket Gilmour let's see if there's

doing you're at 31 years and never write in a joke well they hit they hit a high that is almost like like a level of perfection perfection like that song time shit is about the world it's about the four people living the world sheep pigs and fucking dogs that's it that's what we are sheep the pigs are the politician and the dogs are the motherfucker that sling dick the rest of them are fucking sheep and they got three types of sheep and that's the name that's what the album is about it's three types of sheep four fucking sheep people think everything's cool and oh we'll read three times and I don't like Louie wasn't easy done I did that walk in the wilds already five fucking you know what who read is good for pretending you're a fool if you like the really cool Lou Reed Janeane Garofalo man walk around with a leather jacket yes get a letter J dress songs camels I'll tell you what that one song is walk on the wild side czar back was Graham you know what but tomorrow when I leave here tonight I want you to go on YouTube I'm just somebody tried to convince me that Iggy Pop was really good you gotta listen to a key problems with the Stooges and he plays he sends me just a link so I go and click on this one listen to this fucking song I'm like this is so uncoordinated it's all over the place I mean maybe if you are a big ass Iggy Pop fan already maybe R elected already and he got into this style of but then I get that way about like some music that people go nuts for like the dead I don't understand the dead it doesn't a few of their songs I think are really good but a lot of it just doesn't ring with me and I think it's like a frequency that I'm just not tuned into that other people are I went to see them and they run with me until I smelled it was like see the day I you smelling there was there were next to me out of concert at Red Rocks I want to see the dead Santana and Public Enemy dead Santana and Public Enemy or you wanna show black people with guns and a bunch of stinky people with no fucking soap anyway somebody actually shot a gun it the fucking constant that then it's my crazy Santana came on and did a black magic woman dog and it was awful even that even that listen to the Praxis get yourself the first to the second Santana album listen to that brilliance this fucking Mexican kid could took the guitar and turn fucking rock music and he mixed it with Spanish music and those fucking first two hours of brilliant oh yeah Coco vine fucking black magic woman what the fuck happened that one dude that made that really successful song with him recently like within the last 10 years what is that that's Rob Thomas from matchbox 20 what happened to great fucking singer great fucking writer I mean that dude is bad right that dude made all those songs wrote songs for a bunch of people and I think matchbox broke up and then he went did that song with Santa put another ha he put a pretty nice it wasn't a bad single arm you know that song does that song with Santana no he's so mocha good god damn it's one of those songs words like the perfect harmony of his voice and Santana and Santana was one of those dudes that he put out a Santana song and I had to figure this out when I was a kid and I was like we there's a different dude singing every time like I don't get it and then I realized oh oh oh it's not even a but he's such a bad motherfucker it's not even about the singer it's about the guitarist it's that one dude Carlos Santana his shit is so tight and so badass that who out no matter who the fuck is sing it yeah it's a Santana song pitch you this the vocals and the song itself almost plays second fiddle to that goddamn guitar now what a amazing dude that guy is who the fuck else can claim that there's like I guess is a few other guys that do that like like be like Brazil was a fuck back was no Jeff Jeff Jeff Beck Jeff Beck was another guitarist who can put out songs that weren't really Jeff better than me was you know he called the Jeff Beck song but was just because of his guitar he was an egotistical motherfucker my baby that Jam with Rod Stewart early in the morning can't sleep that was a great dispatch you Asian yeah was him and they cancelled before the fucking tour but he left Rod Stewart go out there alive without a good talk is he's an egomaniac oh so he didn't want to deal with being second fiddle to Rod Stewart Jeff Beck has a great guitar but you can't fuck with Maggie Mae that dude I saw Rob Stewart last night in a some it was some show that was at was a infomercial where they were advertising some album series it was CDs and DVDs with all these I guess it was all DVDs there's also music and comedians from some midnight special show and Rod Stewart was one of them rockin on there yeah rockin you wery well he's out there looking like a lady he looks like a ugly lady he's in this little skinny guy in this weird outfit and he's prancing around stage in this weird way but his songs are so goddamn good they're so soulful and he had some fucking songs man Maggie May when saturation was already when he wrote darling but no no he get weird he's got an album called blondes have more fun yeah oh my god they called you're insane you gotta find it on YouTube it's in that deep but garage too and I want to see him I never seen fuck Van Halen I see him bitches suck a dick right at the show writes to a guy on stage there was two people made you wanna suck my dick and that's Rod Stewart and Kenny Rogers they do with the white hair soon as that motherfucker started singing lady but Rod Stewart had such a unique voice such a unique voice like vocally and like the shit that he sang about like the way he would sing like they were like kind of vulnerable songs but in a weird way like like Maggie Mae wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you it's late September and I really should be back in school like what is this song like what is it about it's like some guy was trying to find himself you know steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool you know find myself a rock-and-roll band the knee oh I mean like the songs were so weird and unusual man like his is just his stylistically the things that he was into singing about you know he's a he was a bad motherfucker god damn that's a good song that's a song that's like it's still no matter where you are when that song comes on you're happy you know I will stay in my car until he I'm even if I'm in a rush until he said still my daddy's cue and make a living now to play I just gotta sit I gotta sit tight I don't care if I'm late I'll tell you I'll go to your house dude I would have been here five minutes ago but fucking Maggie Mae was on and I'm you know I got out of respect I gotta listen to that song there's a few songs there's a few songs call me the breeze call me the breeze comes on she is mine your sisters jump shot like Double Trouble I like fucking all that crazy skittish fucking crazy you know I knew in high school when I was 14 years old when jump came out Van Halen's jump came out I knew there was something wrong with using keyboards I knew back then like because everybody was into van Halen my house in high school okay when I was in high school in 1981 was my freshman year of high school and my sister's boyfriend at the time was this kid his name was Jeff and he was John yeah John Jewett sorry and he was really into Van Halen to the point where he's gonna be mad at me I forgot his name I'm high dog and he was really into van Halen to the point where he had it on his license plate his license plate was Van Halen on his car and everybody was into Van Halen and then the new van Halen came out it was 1984 that was the album right wasn't it would jump the new vowel album came out I remember in high school and everybody was like ah van hands out it's awesome and I was like dude dude dude dude I'm like what the fuck is this love that shit I remember thinking this is lacking in Oh lacking in soul jump that song jump might as well jump that song that keyboard that electronic keyboard man that is not as good you hear running with the devil you know hot for teacher you know those are those are real songs but Jonathan what oh shit oh god damn mean street secure that's though yeah when that album came out when boom boxes were becoming popular remember everyone had him over their shoulders in stereo boom boxes and that song was one of the first songs I remember hearing and just awesome stereo it seems so future like 80's was like all about breakdancing and you know like the future and so on women & children first no that was a second one really no warning so it's van Halen one fair warning fair warning yeah they had some fucking jams good fuck Unchained ya mean streets Unchained whoo this is love I hung out with David Lee Roth at the comedy storm once oh yeah he is coolest but we had it we had to not release it cuz he talked a lot shit about some people he didn't want it released but he he actually contacted you right the next day the next day his his fellow the guy who works for him contacted Brides like please please don't release that his David Lee Roth just he's just a free talker he just hangs around and starts talking shit he was talking shit about girls he was talking shit about you know people in other bands and music that sucks and guys who can't fucking he's like you and in a way he's a little bit of he's got a little bit he can't carry the spread he's got a little bit of that in him but he was funny man he's a funny guy he's a real guy and he had a real band and something happened they replaced him with that fake fucking Sammy Hagar I seen open for Sabbath when they had beyond people were spitting out in the Philadelphia Elfi they were rolling to spit off their fingers they call it like whatever they do when they throw it at you yeah and I've been watching fucking the singer and spit was just he's trying to duck it shit was like I always did you did you like David Lee Roth when he did his own solar stuff no no no David Lee Roth needed Eddie Van Halen Eddie Van Halen needed its look man the it's it's not just one person man it's fucking teams it's the creative juices of everybody together that's the really interesting shit it's just hard to get that to work because you got egos and then he got Valerie Bertinelli who most likely probably wanted to fuck David Lee Roth but couldn't get him and got Eddie Van Halen instead and then shit got weird and she was like why keep him around he's such an egomaniac you know because she really wanted to fuck David Lee Roth at least that's what I would assume but David Lee Roth was cool as fuck man he was one of the first guys that like I he came up to me after the show and I was actually like nervous I was like nervous to talk to you Lee Roth and when he's telling me I was funny you know I could dude I fucking loved it I was great it was like I had no idea I thought you were just that fear factor guy you were fucking we're like holy shit I'm talking to David Lee Roth like for me going back to Newton South High School in 1983 you know listening to the you know sitting out in the courtyard with everybody listening on the cassette player listen in the fucking van Halen then all sudden I'm sitting here just me and Eddie Bravo and Brian and we're hanging out in front of the goddamn Comedy Store there's no one even surrounding him there's no mobs of people just we're just hanging out he just showed up unannounced on like some random Tuesday or Wednesday or something like that hung out in the back of the paid for his fucking ticket hung out in the back of the club like a normal person and then came out to give me props and I'm sitting there talking to David Lee Roth and I'm shell-shocked I'm like I'm talking I'm like I can't believe I'm talking to David Lee Roth and we're talking about my comedy I'm talking to David Lee Roth about how much he liked my set I'm like wow this is crazy this is bizarre because when you see people at the store you know they're not looking for attention yeah when you do when you see somebody who's not looking for attention like I seen Chris Cornell at the store wouldn't I know day night I can't look around I know this motherfucker yeah I seen dr. Dre there yeah a couple days yeah I see dr. Dre there a couple times yeah I said we were there one night when he came in with that chick Michele a no that's the one who's married to my name is married to her but he came and not dating her but he came in with her like they were out in the night and they all went up to see any Griffith I kept them with her name was them you a cute little chick with black hair she's got a reality show now and all her black sisters I really kind of look the same no I didn't think it's not yeah I think our name she's a comic no no no she's a big-time singer okay but the Comedy Store was famous for that because the Comedy Store even though it's run by retards it's it's a goddamn Hollywood landmark I mean that spot first of all I would always be back just completely baffled that here this is no recession going on this is you know the heyday of the you know the 90s and the early 2000s and it's across the street from the House of Blues and yet on a Friday night there's nobody there on a Friday night there's fucking 50 people in the oh are like this is criminal you guys have the greatest spot on the planet Earth not only does it have the greatest name in the history of comedy not only is it a place where Richard Pryor filmed live at the fucking Sunset Strip I mean this is an amazing place in history and yet there's 50 people there on a Friday night like that's how fucked up it was but it's such a Hollywood icon that people are always gonna gravitate to that spot just to peek in you know it's like it's what it is is basically LA's version of the Comedy Cellar except it's not as good it's not run the same way it's not as like the Comedy Cellar in New York is where all the top guys go and fuck around and work out it's like known and it's kind of like a restaurant attached to people who eat there and shit and you know Jimmy Norton wrote his fucking wrote his book there I mean he's brings a laptop and dudes are always hanging out there it's it's a real like a place where all the comics come but in LA the Conley stores the closest thing you know it was like the closest icon place I mean The Improv is the best club in town but the Comedy Store is the best it's got the best feel it's got the best location you know he'd been to the Long Beach Laugh Factory is it really yeah that's a great location is it really what does it deal with that can you go if you're not friends with jo koy oh that's right he left Jamie but he's to keep all the other Filipinos out right all the Asians he didn't want anybody making any Asian jokes and he would work he wanted only only his filipino jokes I watched it online i watch that that segment it was there more than one segment with Louis or with Dane Cook no it starts off with Jim Martin yeah yeah I watched it is interesting it was like there's a little bit of revisionist history there you know you think it was unscripted it almost seemed like real I can almost see actually just sat down like no I think they worked it out I worked out the beats and then they did it but I didn't like the arc I did that I thought Danes argument was kind of silly like why didn't you stick up for me like like what you didn't say that I didn't steal from you like you know like I've never stolen why would I steal a joke I never stole the joke ever like though the argument was like really strange you know yeah I guess if you really think Dane Cook was guilty then yeah there was one of the joke I don't know if Dane Cook was guilty but I do know he saw louis c.k do those jokes before he did them and that's enough cause all it is all three of them are on the same seat and Louie did those in front of him and he did it in front of everybody he did in front of all of us it's not that look Louis CK's the most prolific guy working today he puts out a new hour every year but back then he didn't back then Louie was doing the same act for a long fuckin time so those bits the bit about a guy getting hit by a car he did that bit for years the dude about a guy getting hit by car Steve Martin no no Steve Martin did the naming the child naming the child a crazy name I thought you got the wrong bit really yeah hit by a car - how about what you trying to say something to him yeah really really I think you're wrong I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you're wrong I'm pretty sure the Steve Martin joke that that and this is true that Steve Martin came up with a bit that's really similar to both Danes bit and Louis CK's bit that if I have a kid I'm gonna name them some crazy name is unpronounceable you know this is being silly like that's not that's not stealing I mean I mean obviously those guys well you know what it is kind of stealing look if those guys had heard Steve Martin and forgot about it and then reintroduced the joke you know and like didn't realize that they had like like just forgotten it but you got to stop doing it once you hear about Steve Martin's bit but the difference is Louie was doing it in front of Dane so whether or not Dane is you know a joke thief that you know look I like Dane I think he's a talented guy I think he's a great marketer and I think he's a good person I really do but I also think he's wildly ambitious you know and I think that sometimes when you're wildly ambitious you don't even realize what you're doing and you're doing it you don't mean to do it but you start doing it and those bits work and then you don't want to let them go and even though someone's like hey man that sounds like Joe Diaz is a bit you don't want to let them go because they are weapons and you use them and use them to get what you want which is you want love you want that love and adulation you want to be killing up there and you get addicted to it and you can't let it go and if he's addicted if he's guilty of anything he's guilty of that so that's why I thought it was the argument was weird I was like man you guys are like you know it's weird you know but I liked how Louie's such a good dude man you know like even his whole the way he's approaching like I didn't like what people were saying about you and I didn't like the people were you know getting mad at you I was like wow like he's just a you know one of the reasons why he's doing so well is that he's he's is like the way thinks is a good way to think he's a good guy yeah he sticks to his fucking word he's not like these other pukes that we have around this 24 fucking hours a day now yeah I seen Louie he came up to me with the comedy star used to host on Sunday nights and he would come up and do a set every night very polite yeah was available next week bro and I go whenever he and he goes I want to put mama put you on my show he took my name and number and I went not gonna grandma coke and never told anything of it some days later he called me he paid me money but else has ever paid me and he took care of me he had me there for the weekend he came with his word so because of that I give him my loyalty forever because he's one of the few of the all he's fucking weak motherfuckers we got around us that sticks to his fucking work he's real he's real dude I give him props I don't give none of these fucking measly motherfuckers props but Louis deserves my heart because he put me on television without ever expecting anything from me and he just told me he was gonna put me on and two days later he called and I respect that to the end especially like I said with these fucking much we have around as a comedian he's the most inspirational guy to me and I think to everybody because he's the most prolific like you can argue over who makes you laugh the most cuz I would say you make me laugh the most you're my favorite gotta watch you know I think there's there's some moments the moment when we were hanging out at the Bray improv and you're on stage we were doing the weekend there and you did that fucking bit about about dead dick about you don't accept dead dick and you made it up on the fly he goes you take two popsicle sticks and you tie that dick up and you throw it back in like a wounded soldier okay when you see and when you said when you said it you you I knew you ad-libbed it because I knew your I know your act by heart and you knew you you had lived it and it fucking destroyed EU or beat red in the face laughing at your own shit and me and Ari Shaffir in the back of the room and we just go he's the best he's the best nobody makes me laugh harder than you but louis c.k is more prolific he's the most prolific who conversations about stand-up with Louis I believe it cool I think he's changing the way a lot of comics do it and he's making guys write more what was the conversations you had with him I had a conversation about storytelling and about jokes and he said that he had watched me and that uh my material was a little fucking crazy but he loved that he respected it but he goes you have much more to tell people because I want you to talk about what is dark to you that's why I started talking about mugging the hooker that's why I started talking about all the crimes I had done outlined that's why I'm writing them on stage now you know what you need to talk about on stage what you need to talk about finding your dead mother when you're high on acid how fucking crazy you got to tell about that on stage bro that is but that's a showstopper I got knowing what a joke I got know where the dog Joe after you find your dead mother on the floor Jesus can't follow you Jesus can't fuck I tried it already nothing you can end with it you could end with it and what about the rest of the fucking show it is so bad you know it's like going up to somebody going hey bro how you doing it you ever go to something like my mistake how's your brother yeah boom mad do you feel you had a comedy show he's a one-man show setting I could do it but in a comedy show I can't do it don't count Williams it it's too hard to recover from it what does that mean he just tried to change his act over the weekend in Ontario okay what Katt Williams tell me what happened I he tried to do something different supposedly like he tried to do more of a serious kind of like one-man show in Ontario where I'm California and brought the improv yeah and then audience I wish I knew he was there I would I want to see him the iins wasn't having it and so they started like I guess booing or doing something like that and then cat started screaming at and we're doing something and any Ontario improv support this is by the way all based off TMZ I'm Terry improv kicked him offstage and kicked him out of the building and then he wouldn't leave and suddenly they called the police and then the police had to take him off the the premises and they canceled the whole weekend well he's definitely crazy cuz he keeps getting arrested and there's a lot of shit going on with him he got caught with guns a couple times and but he did a show recently in New Mexico and a bunch of people wanted their money back cuz he got on stage shows a nine o'clock show he didn't get on stage to like midnight and he goes on stage the music stays on while he's on stage the music stays on and he takes his shirt off and he starts dancing and he's dancing around with his shirt off and then he starts doing push-ups and then he started talking did push-ups he's doing push-ups on stage with no shirt on and then he starts talking to people in the audience so there he's just like trying to come up with some new material and just going deep into the crazy bin or he's really legitimately losing his mind you know we said it before man we said it so many times brilliant people there's a lot of brilliant people that are very close to insanity and I know you've been close to insanity because I've watched you be close to Sandy's Joey Joey's been close five minutes yeah well that was normal for Joey that's pretty fucking normal I just have to wait for that storm to end but no no I see you know what I mean I feel it at times I feel what this podcast but i gotta force myself out of the fucking housewives because i'm that that's why if you go to in your head yeah you don't want to be alone with your head sometimes there's moments where you need to interact with other people just to get a sense of normalcy right you fucking mind just go somewhere bro it just goes somewhere where it just hasn't been it with stand-ups I can see it I feel myself slow I'd say I felt myself slipping a lot with the cope when I was on stage when I was talking myself oh boy I caught myself from four to eight myself wait a second I was just at four I'm a fucking I get to eight what I was talking about earlier about Roger Waters Roger Waters the article in Rolling Stone one of the things that was talking about is his childhood his dad was in the military yeah dad died when he was really young and you know he grew up but I was I mean there's photos of him with his dad and also his dad's gone that hole that void you know there's something about loss and childhood you know when you when you're you're young and fucked up things happens that creates like seemingly the most brilliant people the most but they're also the most likely to do something fucking crazy you know easy like looking fucking look at what's going on with Dave Chappelle here with Dave Chappelle did the other guy but now he goes on stage and for forty five fucking minutes he tells one joke and then he says this is a test of wills you know I'm not gonna say nothing you don't seem that neither and like he stays up there for forty five fucking minutes and no and you know and people like I just want I just want to be entertained we tell us some jokes he's like you know go see go you know buy my DVDs you know you'll see you be entertained like meanwhile he's just standing on stage like saying nothing for 45 minutes and again this is a lot of hearsay - I don't know the exact story of what happened but this is what I keep hearing and there was another video of him going onstage at some festival and he bombed there too and he was doing the same thing just standing on stage no no no no this is not this is he's not doing anything gross she's just standing on stage I don't know what happens to comedians the comedian's life and I could sit here the next 20 minutes and give you a list of that they think that they go from becoming comedians to thinking that I don't listen to what the fuck they're saying I was listening to his reading his texts he was getting X was on stage I'm reading them he has this whole new thing style of comedy that he's doing I've seen it twice my friend DeMars seen it four times or three times and what it is it looks very organic like he starts off and he automatically starts going yeah we talked about this but that's not what he's doing he's great this is not what he's been saying with this show what they're saying is he's not doing anything standing on stage not saying a word no use talking he wasn't just saying they're not just saying dude it this latest show that I am talking to you about I'm not talking the show that you saw I'm saying the show that he did recently he got on stage and he was talking about how is a battle of wills I'm not gonna say nothing and we'll see how long we last here he was gonna he was being quiet he wanted them to be quiet - lets see who breaks first he said nothing and people were losing their mind like he he told one joke and then the rest of the set he sat around did nothing he had there's a point with these fucking comedians that they think that they go from being a comic to social commentary like they did something to deserve this social commentary and that's what's really going on we've seen it with Eddie Griffin we see it with this fucking guy now we see it with a bunch of comedians I see it I thought I put on that fine whatever was just for watch Stanhope and I had to put up with your buddy from SVU and Janeane Garofalo the guy system is the fucking guy Richard Belzer you know god I've never said nothing funny this whole fucking life any that stand up why the fuck is he there but they're sitting in lines yeah yeah yeah stand open why are you here and Stanhope goes because I came to see the suck my dick fest between you and Janeane Garofalo zoast a Hobson yeah and then he goes well literally like trying to be cute you know like these fucking idiots in Hollywood do like literally how about I get up and put my dick in your mouth and provenza's not just to show you how we're gonna do this here man somewhere online these comics think that we need their social comment there and we fucking don't we fucking don't we don't give a fuck what you think just tell us fucking jokes guy just tell us jokes we don't give a fuck nobody gives a fuck that's where the show goes sour because nobody gives a fuck we paid to see you do an hour of material if at the last two minutes you want to summarize your set and do it do it but if you're gonna summarize it with bullshit that you don't live by anyway shut your mouth and just do the fucking jokes bro that's my big problem lately nobody wants to shut their fucking mouth either do the jokes - shut the fucking mouth what is all this chitchat about stupidity for that day in that green room I'm trying to watch that hole one of the most brilliant comments a dear friend of mine I could watch it Janeane Garofalo saying that the guy in in - blonde that killed the fucking with that duck tried to kill the congressman was pushed to kill him because social media forced them first of all when she said then that's not really convenient worries is she really says now with a career a real comedian doesn't worry about that that's somebody who wants you to think you know fuck I can't deal with it no more well I'm gonna make me four make me funny make me laugh I would refuse to go on stage and give you my opinion of the White House so the Tea Party because at the end of the week and no matter guy I paid to watch you do jokes I want you to take me through your world but that's it I don't want to hear no social commentary and we've seen it from a lot of comedians bro after the 55 minute mark you think I gotta listen to this shit 55 minutes well they also they've developed a following of people who hang on every word and what you know there's a lot of them that think they have something brilliant to say and so they choose the venue of stand-up comedy and look this fucking podcast is a perfect example of a lot of times people have something to say it's not necessarily funny but it's interesting but this is the right venue for it a podcast is not right this is not what I would ever do on stage when I do when I do my set I have a fucking set I'll fuck around a little bit but I'm trying to be funny period period yes and that's people used to always think that like comedy should be used in some way to like educate educate people and enlighten people and it's important to do that and almost to the point of sacrificing comedy like you know Bill Hicks had some material that was like that was not funny at all at the end bill hitch wasn't funny let's get out of the way at the end the Lance Williams garbage listen to the live from the Village Gate that's from almost you could even hear the people like ready to laugh there's like oh well some of his stuff like yeah that was actually before the live from the village gate one was earlier and what that was is like he did the bid on abortion and this is what I'm talking about and he was like you know like you don't want people to abort you then you fucking raise them you fucking raise them that's news yelling out you fucking raised the kids and there's no joke and I'm like wow this is a mess this is a mess this is a comedy club okay you just yelling out you fucking raise them and being irate yes you're right I see your point if you don't want people to have abortions then you should raise their children I see what you're saying that you should get involved I see what you're saying but you're not being funny period that's not a joke you know and that's a thing that happens to a lot of comics it's they they start to get people who want to listen to them they start to get people who think they're deep and they start listening to those people and they do this at a comedy club and then they rant about a comedy club we've seen it happen we've seen it happen so many title of fucking time there was this fucking kid from Jimmy's comedy our goddamn I forget his name but he's really was really funny he was kind of crazy he was really funny and this was like in the late 80s early 90s and he came to Hollywood he drove to LA and you know it was working at the Comedy Store for a while do you remember the kid kind of good-looking guy but overweight fucking forget his name it tries to be nuts but he was a perfect example that he would go on stage in the comedy store they fucking tortured him they tortured him can you go on stage and try to be like deep and meaningful when he was funny he could be really funny like he had some good bits yeah looking good bit about Hair Club for Men it was really funny you know they show the guy you know like playing tennis and they show the guy swimming he goes what they should show a guy it's pulling out and shooting his fucking load on some chicks back you know and she goes nice hair yeah he had a fucking real good bit about him some good bits just sit down yeah yeah he was leaning with his hands up like someone's trying to take his picture boy was Charlie Hill at the store when you stole he's back I know my name is Charlie Hill my real name was mountain but I shortened it dug I fucking lost my fucking the cookies are that dumb just kiss your hi no but that night Joe Rogan cocksucker Milwaukee this weekend I can't write the White Pass theater ribbon be a theater bad dude we're gonna have a good time this last time you went to Milwaukee was with fucking Chris McCoy at that fair yeah yeah yeah we did Summerfest I went like a year before you and a year after you some folks yeah there was some guy

big-time gangster up there I never knew it they told me after you know you Ronald robbed her I robbed threw an aspirin that's your robber I broke into a fucking house and she had 1,800 cash and a chunk of hash not this alley shit at these idiots of smokeless shit that's fat from the fucking Emperor of stamped fucking gold stamp and you see that stamp on a piece of hash when somebody gives you a piece - and you said a little rim with the stamp your fuckers smoking the good shit and what Hatch's is a THC that they just got arrested what is if they have all that shit I don't how do you make it what what am i a fucking baker cause I always knowing that it comes from you know someone they just made a fucking law recently where you get life in jail for fucking making hash you're just right I'm worse so I thought it was just no it's not so there's a method to making it I don't know what the method is safe through jail for baking we passed in some stupid state so she was for Italian from

like are you fucking what we gonna do what do you eat cheese with it well this is another part of it that a lot of people don't know with Donnie Brasco busted all those people half of the people he

tapped they call you right after the person goes to trial the government is supposed to send you an affidavit claiming to date you on the phone right that shit so I was telling this kid this I was saying on the podcast before and I think he doubted me he goes can you please bring the paper yeah you know what there's a lot of people on my message board you guys are some disrespectful fucking shitheads some of you guys who don't believe things you're so fucking rude about it and one of the things is Joey Diaz so don't don't hold this up bro we got to treat this like everybody can hear this you could read it if you like but these so many people say oh this guy comes on the podcast just laws and tell stupid stories Joey dance is not lying why do you be crazy I've known Joe if you only think of Bobby I'll give a fuck about mother your mother I got no reason they don't know like nobody else ascendeth be fly to no one why ruin it will align saying shit the people get a fucking life you fucking maggots get a fucking life it's over you don't want to say few but you just you know there most of them others just taken advantage of the fact that they're not everybody I see somebody do it you fucking like a music thing with kids fucking you what have you done and then when you go to their YouTube page they have done nothing there nothing they just put stupid videos up a birds of shit well I don't think you have to do something to have an opinion aside no but you know what if you don't actually be a cunt you'd have to be a cut cut solid straight yeah I still give it to me with an anonymous fucking and give it to me intelligently I had a chick last macho Rogan who sent me the best emm an email I ever got she said she went to a show and she was very unhappy with my comedy she didn't like that it was dirty and you know what ten years ago I would have said suck my dick and I emailed the back like a man you know what she said to me well I thought you were funny but I didn't need a necessity to curse and I said you should have said that you heard my feeling she was I didn't mean to hurt your feelings I just thought there was more to you than curse I'm picturing Joey Diaz along with his nine fucking cats answering this bitch's email no I gotta I gotta you know you gotta hand these emails to people but it's really funny like when Sony like somebody said you didn't put the Drano on your dick who would make that up why would you make that up I'm telling you I'm fuck it's like you know I have an agent like a big-time agent that moved away and now he's in Dallas so his name was first on IMDB do you know how many fucking people sent him emails once a week telling me to take the how to mug a fag video off so wait a second I'm telling you a story the fag the fuck I got confused agents what this agent is the top he moved he's in Dallas he's a big-time man you take time a gue handle athletes now was telling you to take that video tell me one morning he was dug do you have a video on there mugging fags he's in fucking Austin Texas right he's a sports agent and he goes don't I keep getting emails from people he's like last year saying that you better take the video off did you mug a fag and I go why would I lie about getting beat up by a fucking guy why would somebody lie about something like that like why wouldn't make something like that I could say if I beat up ten fags or I stabbed up and threw him over the cliff I'll fucking Joey's line but who would lie about getting beat up by a fucking guy why would somebody make people would make stories up but the point is you don't know why would I unalloyed because you're crazy kind of a crazy person ever understood what it was I can't even lie on stage I know a lot of people who lie oh they make up stories on stage they last night my god no I don't wanna hear about that but I can't even like I see I see a friend of mine that quit drinking and she still doing drinking jokes on stage why are you doing that really are you doing that you can't commit them why doesn't she just talked about how she quit drinking but she used to do this the fuck am I to say something to him I just move on with my life I'm just making it saying doing cocaine jokes don't do it that's like why would I talk about it right I talk about it yeah years before but I can't stand with that was another thing you did that night of the wounded soldier you making fun of me because I had a five-hour energy drink hey what are you doing with that fucking 5-hour energy and you went on stage with that Eagle 5-hour energy drink he goes you know what I do in the fucking I wake up in the morning and I have a fucking big line i snort a big line of cocaine here's your fucking five hours it was red bands birthday and this week mr. Rogan has a birthday this week well I forgot you're 37 now I'm gonna have to grow up eventually you know what is your birthday don't start getting the 11th August 11th day two days two days from oh shit I think you wanna fight me up for the fucking but I do have but we'll do it cuz I had to work all this week I'm back to the grind I'm back to what Fear Factor I got I'm doing them every day this week because Friday were bolting to Milwaukee for this perhaps theater that's August 13th Milwaukee paps theater me and Joe Diaz tickets are almost sold out get in it bitches don't sleep I'm looking for that we're gonna have a good time can't wait one last time we did a gig was in Vegas no oh no no Pasadena we did the Irvine in Pasadena yeah but the last theater we did I'm thinking that's the last theater we did on the road Pittsburgh Pittsburgh was fucking awesome dad that library he used to be a library fucking great yeah I'm Carnegie Library Music Hall fucking place was awesome Pittsburgh is great it's one of the things we were saying it's one of the most underrated fucking cities we didn't like it when we did that improv I didn't go which that time I had been there before I used to go to the funny bone it was okay I like the Chinese food as well when we were there that one of the reasons why we didn't like it is because there was apparently there was some fucking sports thing going on some did they're really loyal to their teams and when you got like a big game going on nobody wants to go to see nothing and even people that bought tickets didn't come to the show because it was some big sports game some football game or I don't know what the fucker what team is the first place in baseball and you know what didn't they win the World Series or something well this year yeah no no right now the Super Bowl the Steelers yeah I think so how fun is that we don't know shit about your team I can't fucking remember but are you trying to be funny Brian there cricket doesn't they don't play cricket in the rain you know that you fuck your room there's nothing in there bro empty I drink this yeah you ain't fifty of those fucking cough drops they make you thirsty do that what's up these diets fucking birthday boys in the room is shit I got peed on today by who my girl we're having sex and she accidentally peed for her first time everyone went coming yeah it was like I felt it going down my leg I'm like wait that's not normal she's like oh my god I think it is P if you ride that happened to you you might be dating a retarded girl no she said that she just didn't even know her why do you always go voxi need I've noticed every time I say something you automatically get angry well you say a lot of retard you say a lot of silly shit and I'm making fun of it okay it's not called defensive that's not defense so I pissed on myself but you mad no I just every time I say something like like angry angry but you say some ridiculous shit dude what's those pills you got no it's not angry what if I'm mocking you or good clowning at you it's like you can't just say ridiculous shit and have me not say anything yeah but a lot of times I say something you think is redic is actually resin well it's not resin resin is one of the ways they make it is that's not hash hashes there's a process to make hash it doesn't involve burning it resin is when you you scrape a pipe that's what resin is hash resin is a different process it's not the resin of like smoking I think I open not the ways to make it but one of the ways it one of that ways to make hash is resin one of the ways to make hash is scraping resin off and that kind of resident of that's I think neither one of us know enough about how to make hash to say that they take the THC but dude you're pretending that you don't like say silly shit on purpose like you're like playing a role and I mock you for it now I'll say example you're saying you're just upset because you love this girl and I said you say you just noticed it all the time okay okay you I noticed you say ridiculous shit all the time and I own you for it but that's it doesn't mean that I'm really angry at you know I know I know but why does it every time I say something you always have to comport leave a shit that was barely bashing it your girl pissed all over you and I sayin she had an orgasm and she's never done this before but she peed all over yeah and she was like whoa crazy you don't think that it's appropriate to say hmm you might be dating a retarded girl that's a giant that's a joke dude obvious I think it's a you know I like that with other and she's a nice person what's wrong with Brian the reason why it's do this because in the past we've talked about where girls are really juicy and we read that that it is a P or not and III actually said no it's not just no girls that have done that before but when she did it it felt like she was coming like crazy like like I've had experience before but when I smelled it it was 100% P hmm so with other girls that squirted it smelled difference with this time you smelled it you actually smelled it because it was just like whoa why is it all over my she have asparagus now is there anything else definitely makes you pee smell pineapples pineapples she tastes good your loads yeah pineapples are supposed to make your loads taste good but that's right here but P this is a smell of P it's always asparagus right that's the number one thing if you thought of like if I said what makes your pee stink you'd say a Paris is Paris there's nothing else where I vitamin C bright orange and bright orange well all vitamins make your pee bright I mean maybe it is the vitamin C the more you dehydrated yellow you piss cats yes or if you have a lot of vitamin C if you take a lot of vitamins that's why people say you were taking vitamins which comes out in your pee no some of it does come on European amici P a different color but a lot of it affects your body in a positive way that's like one of the weakest arguments ever like you shouldn't take vitamins just pee him out I've heard people say that so many times like Jesus Christ are you really going into every cell and monitoring how your nutrients are distributed and you know for sure it all goes out your urine you lazy fuck you're so lazy you won't even take vitamins I haven't talked to so many people like that and they say my like take vitamins or just can't be bothered like you can't be bothered to stick a pill in your mouth and drink how hard is it you're eating you're eating all this food how hard is it to remember to put something in your mouth and drink and then you're healthier you get nutrients that you're not getting from your dogs things that I do it like that all the time them like oh that's so dumb that I don't do like floss I should like I hate flossing the debt and but it's so easy it takes what two minutes flosser teeth but I can't do it like my body won't let me floss I I try it out for a couple of days and then I just hate it I think we're programmed in a certain way by the way we were raised and there's a lot of shit that people got on you when you were a little kid that you still to this day don't want to fucking do because your parents told to do it I have this problem with work man I don't like doing things that are work you know I don't mind doing things that are for me like I could work forever on okay I can train I can you know write I can you know work on things I can draw I can work forever on things that I want to do but if someone tells me I'm supposed to do something I have a hard time I have a hard time showing up for things on time I don't want to it's like part of me that wants to resist being on time and part of me that wants to resist doing work and I know it's from growing up it's from growing up being forced to work growing up being forced to you know like to say that the thought of work is dreariness and going to work is you're gonna be miserable and you're gonna have to contain your emotions and contain your disdain for what you're doing and just force yourself to follow through and I think that's a lot of us it's like shit like brushing your teeth like brushing teeth is great you know but when you're a little kid man everybody told you to brush your teeth so it's annoying so you're like fuck you I'm an adult I'm gonna eat I'm gonna go to sleep with fucking shit stuck in my teeth fuck you right you know you do it on purpose you spite yourself by by rebelling from your childhood and Joey I mean you grew up in the craziest way possible you grew up you were sort of taken in by your by your neighbors right I was 15 I come from my house get a break okay I come from my house and my mother told me wants to get in the shower brush my teeth right but when she once you got out of there though yeah once my mother died at 15 I moved when I met you right this is let me tell you something about when I met you you know when I met you like I'm you know I've known a lot of like wild motherfuckers my whole life and one of the things I say I've said this about you on stage and it's true like one of the things I love about hanging out with you is that there's a lot of people think there's rules to the way you're supposed to behave and live and think and then you meet somebody who's not following any rules I'm gonna go follow him for a minute where you going hey where'd you where'd you come up with this idea why are you doing this you just you just pulled you dick out you see you're gonna go to jail you can you smell the pot out in public like there's some people that you know when I grew up I grew up very disciplined because I was a a martial-arts competitor and my from age 15 to 21 my like what my life was very very disciplined I didn't drink I ate healthy foods I trained all the time and the reason why I didn't drink very rarely I might have smoked pot five times in my whole life from the time I was like you know ten till the time I was like 21 maybe six at the most I might have got drunk three or four times because I was always worried about going to the gym the next day and getting fucked up I was always worried like if I got drunk and then four weeks from now I have a fight would if I get my ass kicked in a fight that I would have won if I didn't get drunk on that one day I would so I would think like that so I was super disciplined and then I met my friend Johnny B and my friend Johnny when I had gone from being a comedian or from from being a fighter to being a comedian there was this drastic shift and drastic shift in the human beings that I was around so I was around all these wild motherfuckers but they were fighters they were wild motherfuckers who were fighting and tournaments and kickboxing and you know I knew dudes that would like fight in different tournaments just for a goof I knew dudes that would just go to a judo tournament they didn't practice judo they would fight in karate tournaments they weren't karate fighters they were you know they were talked about no guys they just go and just try it out they would do wild dudes who just would take chances and start boxing yeah been boxing I'm hanging out with his gym in South Boston I started boxing like you know this guy started wrestling I mean I knew a lot of dudes who did a lot of wild shit but it was always wild you like martial arts type shit it was crazy and dangerous but it was it was a discipline sort of a crazy dangerous and then when I started hanging around with comedians then all of a sudden I was hanging out with these wild fucks who are different there's a different kind of wild fuck there was like insecure and needy but they would get drunk and fucked up and dudes would do dangerous shit and you know it was a weird kind of human being was a different kind of human being that I was over around a lot of partiers a lot of people doing cocaine and people getting nuts and then I met my friend Johnny and that was the total other end of the craziness I mean stand-up comedy was a craziness but they ain't no crazier than a person who's a professional pool hustler and that was my friend Johnny my friend Johnny when I met him had no to live had nowhere to stay did not know where he was he didn't have a dime in his pocket and maybe had if he had five dollars he was playing someone for that five dollars and that was all the money he had in the world and he you know he played with a house cue or you know sometimes he had his own cue but I mean this dude was living wild like completely wild and when I met you and I you know he was my friend my best friend for years and you know he died and I think it was like shit yeah somewhere around that heaven and I remember when I met you at the Comedy Store I remember meeting you and it's probably around that same year somewhere around that same time I remembered look at this motherfucker here's another one like here's another dude just out there wild in the streets you you had a pager sometimes you had a pager you got to pay my to pay ya whole time to say yeah pink fucking page I got it from J&J beep what year was to see you at the station 97 and I held on for that page 2004 and that's what fuck these motherfuckers in that stupid you never knew where Joey was my rules bitch you never knew what Joey was and my friend Johnny on a page or two that's how you got ahold of him but that was back when nobody had a cell phone but through the all the years of cell phones Chile never had a cell phone Joey didn't get a cell phone it's all like 2004 he was checking spider-man 2 you got a cell they talked me into going to get Sam Raimi spider-man 2 was like though yo yo so far yeah Joey didn't have a cell phone he was living on different people's couches sleeping in the car until he got code yeah fucking going on the road with no clothes just fucking living off a fucking advances and just and by the way by the way he's doing comedy back then and he wasn't good you weren't good you you were a different comedian man you know and I always say that there's never a person that I've ever seen make the switch flip the switch and go from a guy who wasn't doing well on stage to a guy who was just destroyed I lost my inhibitions I lost but it was amazing it was because one of the things that was holding me down was going on my daughter it was really holding me down who I was I felt I kept thinking I was doing the wrong choice so until I committee - doing calmly and being a broke fucking Tomic the way you're supposed to commit yourself to anything you dive into I couldn't be good because I kept thinking at any time I was gonna go back to Colorado it'll be a dad that's why I kept thinking I'm like I can't be doing this shit I'm a dad but this is what was pulling me I had nothing there with my daughter I wanted to raise my daughter my way I knew I was gonna raise a daughter I wasn't a racer daughter she didn't grew up like these fucking dumb women you see that had dignity and they have fucking respect the same way my mother that's why I don't do what other people do a beat to the drum because that's how my mother raised me dog to beat to my own fucking drum if you don't like something say it and I was gonna raise my daughter and but the whole time I thought I was gonna come to LA and at a time I was gonna go back and get an apartment in Boulder I wasn't committed one day I fucking got a thing that she wanted to change her name and the mother call it was some bullshit story I said and I had to be this nice person I don't like being nice if I don't have to bro that's why I've changed so much especially after the blow I don't take nothing from nobody now nothing you can't get away with nothing nothing so what you're saying is he goes I let my inhibitions go to be a good community I wasn't committed dog that's what it really was fuck the inhibitions I wasn't committed I thought I wanted to be a dad I wanted to be a dad I wanted to be a dad but they weren't opening up the door for me I couldn't run run that shit if I didn't like what do you make the strings right now by the way this is where it all goes right now I'm gonna straighten this out this thing I happened in Denver she threw me out because a lot of people bent with me what happened for sexual harassment what are you talking about the thing was a club a Comedy Works Tommy okay because most people have no idea what you're talking about last week Joey dear here's our fillion Joey Diaz has never been able to work with me at the Comedy Works in Denver and people always ask when is Joey Diaz coming why can't you bring Joey Diaz to the comedy works he has never been allowed to do that ever since I've been performing so she told what was the woman who owns the club right and then what happened was some girl ran down and jumped when I went to grab I grab her ass there was a kid there that was like in the same league as me were starting to get star spots and he was kind of weird about star spots that's what they call him guest spots okay how many works in those days that's when you did Thursday you were good enough to do Thursday and Wednesday and Tuesday and we do like 10 minutes right minutes and you got off with Lindy like me Wendy likes Italian guys likes he's close to she's like Rocky whatever Lepore she likes those guys right so she kind of like me and this guy kept seeing him one day I hear that I'm supposed to open up for George Lopez I got a call from Wendy I did sexual harassment well the girl what girl came in here so I got the whole story but a bunch of comics had seen the girl jump into me and we grabbed her ass we were partying it's like us being at the store and Katie seeing you I'm running to you when she jumps at you right that's mr. grabber right so the girl didn't say nothing that night she didn't say nothing we kept drinking and we did a couple of lines three days later it was a she was sided with sexual harassment because one of the comedians talked her into it he's like though that was sexual harassment you should call Wendy so she called that's what happens that's all it was that's all it was and even if now was that sexual we're a small what is sexual harassment what's the definition of it though isn't it well I always assumed that it's someone who has power over someone and like like blah a boss that's like saying stupid sexual shape to avoid any unwanted but the fact that she ran towards him what else she ran so the thing was that st. can't be sexual harassment it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter girl the fucking cop buddy told her and Wendy shit and told me I couldn't come in no that was it you know what gun you know thing and then you went on the radio and then you sound the radio you know what I'm a thief I'll fucking shoot you if I have to I'm not a sexual predator so for that fat cunt to say something like that it's fucking wrong but let me give you the flip side she's still stuck with her fat ass and then when I'm here live in my fucking life so she did me a favor the best thing about was going on them that was gonna kill my ex whoa my ex-wife and her husband I was gonna kill him I was already content to get a fax machine and write jokes for fucking Leno they wanted to compress on me what they were doing for my daughter I was gonna have my buddies chip in ten dollars it was 94 doesn't happen to get me a fax machine I was gonna be in jail writing jokes for Lent I already had a plan and really I'm one day actually caught myself saying all right I'll just kill him because I can't kill her I know what it is to live without a fucking mother so I can't kill the mother I said now I just kill him and I went down there one day with a fucking butcher knife just what my bad one you don't know me dog when I got a beef up my ass I took a butcher and I smacked him when I with two felonies I had two felonies in Boulder and he caught him I picked up my daughter at the daycare my daughter got in the car and we're driving and she goes daddy what's his spec and I go where'd you hear that she goes whenever you call the house that's what John says close the fucking door close the door watch my speakers I drove of the Safeway member you know you never go out on the baseline in 20 HD that's why I had to return her I used to get my daughter on Sundays on Wednesdays so there's one Wednesday I pull up with my little girl in the car she got a little prints hello wishing three maybe four I get out of the car and I go What did he say she goes pick daddy what does that mean I get out of the car I go up to my oh me and she something John did you say spit in front of my door then he goes no I didn't like oh well she's three and she's never been to New York so you got some explainin to do angle is why I didn't say it Joe I go well you got a problem just tell me you said it and we'll end this but if you keep sitting there telling me you're gonna say this I'm gonna fucking knock you up so one more time did you say spec in front of my daughter and he said no Joe Rogan's I lit this motherfucker up right there and the Safeway parking lot with two shots for the fucking that BAM but by blood people yelling leave him alone oh my fuck you bitch but move all this in the middle of all this I turn around look at the car nice and that little three-year-old all right when I was five and six I seen my stepdad boy ask motherfuckers with your fucking hands on the street I seen him shoot a guy on a 48 Rio and I was a to me I was raised that was a fucking animal I didn't want my daughter to go through that bro at this time already she was already seeing this shit now I smacked this fucking dude I had to go to cool they didn't give me a ticket because if you check bold a next time you go if you use a racial epitaph and they say limits a boulder you got it was coming to you really yeah so in this so because he called you a spic you were allowed to be to my one clean when he went to court the next day with the black eye and the court in the judge even said to him next time you call somebody a fucking racial up attack you got one coming at all because of Jay Jay Flanagan eighty-seven football player in the early and the late eighties they had a lot of problems in Boulder with the black football players they were up there fucking those white chicks three of the time banging them JJ Flanagan kanae vez McGee and one kid says some duh JJ Frank called him and thing and he smacked him the kids I fucking flew up Oh kids fucking I flew out of his fucking head I flew out of his fucking head so something happened after that they made it to Josh JJ Flanagan law that you can't say racial epithets they sided with him in the city of inside with him but just a fucking word man yeah I agree don't say it's not nice but that should I ball knocked out ok get one side of me at the time I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers I'm telling you this is my heart right nobody was gonna fuck with me that's where my mother raised it so this is after he called you spic you wanted to kill him I was still gonna hunt them down I still had a plan to hunt them down I was gonna hunt them down I was well so what was going on you're white you broke up with your wife me and my wife broke up and then this new guy came in with him against my wishes and whatnot she told me she was gonna date nobody for me not to date nobody I got into comedy and then one day she came to me when I had a contest at the broker and she goes I was late for hours because I had a date and that's how the war started and she moved my daughter in there and there's how the war started where I come from you can't move my daughter into somewhere though it was some man's house so she if she's with your daughter you think she should have been by herself forever no you come to me and talk to me like a man you're gonna move my daughter into another man's house damn me yeah dad I don't give me the hump I'm not shrinking no no no no it's not tricky that's my daughter I paid child support before you move into another motherfuckers house and don't say tricky because it happens whew you understand the feeling still sure you don't know the feeling of when you pick up you I'm sure I was like another man so nobody could judge me on this nobody I don't ever want to hear it from nobody that's until you know that feeling don't you ever say none to me ever till you know the feeling when you pick up your fucking daughter and she smells like another man Joey I'm sure then if somebody could say something to me but until then don't ever say something like yeah but this woman is allowed to live her life yeah she's to live a life so she do you think she's gotta get your permission look going around with a man what are you specially is raising the girls well that's where it gets tricky for you so what does that mean this is still cost some money to raise the kid and she lives with a guy I don't know how that works master we mean a woman could not just move your daughter in with a man is it legal it's it's us you just can't wake up one day and your daughter moves on fucking what is her what are her rights her legal right Mason but you know what I'm saying Joey if she doesn't want to deal with you anymore if she doesn't want to deal with you anymore when she wants to deal with a guy who still has to get your permission his daughter you want to do it over fuck you want to do Joe no you do it a fuck you want to do but you can't take your daughter into some other woman's house without seeing that woman in saying hey I got a woman and I wanna that's all I'm asking from anybody that's it just calmly look at me in the eye don't give me no bullshit bro this is what men don't tell me you have somebody if you're doing your wife we're gonna move in with a guy right now would you want to come down course yes you are you on the wall Christ Joey what are you you're getting in an argument with someone who's not even human society I understand that's what I'm saying it's hard to listen to yeah you get crazy a woman has a right to be away from my man and when is she gonna go she's raising a kid well I I agree that it's got to be a very hairy situation to have some man around your child especially when you know that he's talking some shit about you and he's you know was raising your daughter Tara before somebody moves you're kidding with another person they should contact you and say hey I fell in love with somebody I want to move my kid in there but most women make the mistake when they get separated to jump in the sack with somebody just to hurt the other person I've seen it a thousand times do you think that's why they do it there's no they do it because they want to jump into bed with somebody that you know think about all the time look at what I would be in Kansas what in the bed with Zulu nation we fucked Dean Cain what Dean Cain came home one day and you didn't know the fuck knows this story well I'm talking right he's like it's like no come on everybody knows if Dean Cain stories George Washington the apple tree Dean Cain Zulu nation you know he came home and the wife had moved the kid in with another wife the fuck you know what I'm saying they were separating he did the same thing he took the bitch the court and took a fucking Jeep you did everything you cannot never come to me though without the courts yes sir that's the problem why I laughed I don't understand Court I don't understand quote we're friends don't hit me with I know you twenty years used to suck my dick I used to beat your ass had a good time with you fucking Momo smoking dope not good dope but I'm having a good fucking time the reason this is this crazy fucking argument with nobody just got started the story got started oh it's because the Paramount I'm just telling you the truth of ten or twenty third paramount there Joe Diaz returns to Dodger don't let's sort out this hurry up yeah you asked me what was going on you asked me and I'm telling ya fuck around with people you want to know I'll tell you this ain't no joke it wasn't nothing and that's what happened with me so when they came to me and said you got thrown out of Denver commie was I was bummed out for like two weeks but I knew I wasn't gonna lose that well I'm glad you never killed your buddy to come back with a hand was there any kind of love interest between you and Wendy at any time no you sure did you ever kiss her no no cuz that's what I heard I heard that there was - you didn't hear that would you hear that he's being that fucking no I smile you want to have people yellow you know I swear to God I swear to God that I know what did you hear I heard that that they were like kind of fucking around with each other I don't know who told me but somebody told you don't know told you nobody told them that he's just trying to be no III he's not going doc he's not gonna stop it's not cute anymore I swear to you maybe before me please don't let me pull it broken on you Amy funny stop it people explaining me hash online and is nothing more than compressed key for THC extracted from plant material says hi-tech con man yeah deeper also tell me that there's many different kinds of hash and there's trichomes and yeah I guess some people actually do call it a resin it's not resident as I understand resin I think I think I think it isn't as in cook it's just like it's just like the Olympics they would stamp it with like you know it would be like the the medium gray would be bronze medium would be Sylvan the best would be like gold and they used to have a platinum coating so that's how you judge hash in the old days when you got it people would say fucking platinum you can't get no brand so that's that's the Emperor I'm not kidding these aren't jokes the emperor whatever would make the hash before they shipped it over here they would stamp it for the approval and that's what you always wanted to get you always wanted to get the hash with the stamp what I was talking about earlier Oklahoma Oklahoma Senate approves life in prison from making hash if you make hash they will give you life in prison that's amazing it's amazing how stupid they are in Oklahoma that is so fucking dumb they think that somehow or another this is some dangerous drug who do they think this is meth what do you get from making meth in Oklahoma because if you get life in jail for if you get life in jail for making hash they should shoot everyone you've ever met if you make meth they should kill you and then shoot everyone you ever met everyone you love should die for the fuck has never killed anybody the only times I've smoking hash I'm like I've just said wow I'm really high that's it hash is really good if you work out in your straw and you eat little pieces of it oh there's a beautiful fucking story on a kid who had autism and his parents were giving him hash and it killed his autism it's amazing the kid like wouldn't interact with anybody the black chick no no it's a different woman she's so different was a white kid it was guy in Northern California and he'd cut off a little tiny piece of hash when he would stick it inside of a melon and he would give it to his boy and all of a sudden his kid was interacting with people he was calm he was relaxed and there was another one with the black kid - they were they given a medical marijuana meanwhile in Oklahoma that shit puts you in life in prison in April 21st of 2011 that's not any more no more that's a good move welfare is such a tricky thing because I love the idea that people can count on people to help them out if something goes wrong but human nature is a motherfucker and human nature is if you give people the ability to not work then they're gonna take it people 110 said I claim craziness 600 a month so you don't have to work and you're crazy yeah you can't live on that so I don't understand why you're jumping up and fucking down so happy for some people are happy just to know what do you move to some I just seen it about a year ago on TV if you claim crazy 640 and you does those people in that documentary I was talking about oh you see that yeah I think we're alone they claim crazy yeah well cuz they're not claiming it because they had that Asperger's or whatever it's called Asperger's you can get money from yeah look I think you should be able to get some money if there's something fucked up with you and we should help each other out we should help out our brothers and sisters the problem is like I said about hippies the problem is it's beautiful if everybody helps if you've got a circle and everybody's handing out love to the left and like the man have some love it's gonna come around back to you it's all we're all community right but with hippies a lot of hippies when they're in a circle and they're handing out love to the left the love gets to them and they step out of the circle and walk away and they take that love they don't pass it around and they're always taking and not giving and that's something that happens when you have a welfare situation you have people who it's nice if we all help each other out but some people just they're greedy and they take that money and it is they think to somehow or another does of it and other people they use it as a crutch well I don't have to work because now I got money there's so many flaws in human beings and I'm just just human behavior it's hard to make something like welfare work it's hard to make it work the way it's supposed to work here's the way it's supposed to work right here's a way society is supposed to work we are supposed to live in tribes of 50 people that's how it's supposed to work we're not supposed to be connected 300 fucking million of us all on this one patch of dirt that is preposterous the idea of a fucking community that has 300 million people of it is ridiculous especially when people go all rah-rah bullshit and fucking you oh so you would say no no no no that's that's crazy you can't have everybody in you can't have everybody in the same fucking team it's not that you should could be one community and your your community should compete against every other community you could all have be under the same idea our umbrella but the fact that all people are responsible for all the rest of the people 300 million it's too many there's too many there's too much room for craziness and douchebags and too much neglect and there's not enough people that are getting enough focus or attention it's just the numbers are too vast for a human being a human being belongs in a tribe of small people but the fact that there's so many of us a small tribe of 50 people but the fact there's so many of us that we kind of are forced into this situation where we interact on a daily basis with millions of people that we have no idea who the fuck they are we don't know anything about them and yet we're all combined under the same group that's crazy that's when welfare becomes nuts because you're getting money from some people you don't even fucking know these people fuck those people give me my money you know instead of being in a tribe of 50 people they go hey man why are you doing your work you need to contribute we're a part of a community and then you feel it you filled it you're yeah I am slacking yeah if there was ten people on an island and one person was sitting around you know if they all got shipwrecked and one person was sitting around going yeah bring me my fish yeah where's my water you go we got to kill that guy that guy's not using he's not helping you know he's using up our valuable resources we have to risk our lives fishing and getting water and this cunt just sits around doing you'd want to kill them but in a society with 300 million people it just becomes an thing you just how easy do you know how easy they make it for you I don't know about now but because what's going on but do you know how easy they make it for some people just yeah very easy I'll tell you how easy this so you could really show your pants cuz I really always drop some money when you get out of prison no matter how old you are you going there for vehicular manslaughter with a DUI you come on when you're 26 you could do paperwork and claim disability because you're a convicted felon for the rest of your life what disability well how is it a disability that you're convicted felon of a will say they can't get a job because they're felons who's gonna hire a felon so you get disability a month I probably just want to keep you from robbing somebody that's probably the logic say it's not gonna do it what's it now gonna do if you're honest just can give you a little something so it was really weird I've been believing that but when my mother died she worked under her alias she stabbed the guy in Cuban she came back she had to change her name because she came out with her friends ID but it was funny that I had a fight for Social Security when my mother died and I was 15 I needed the money like I went there ten times to fight them and oh we don't know what the fuck don't you know at least give me one of ours I didn't need the money Joe but it was just so weird there finally one there sell me this I go steal for a living I'll go no drugs I never took after all the drama they put me through for Social Security but they give it to me after I got a felony Wow just like that for the rest of my life 600 a month that would get on the fifth of every month and if you claim did they talk about the different disabilities and the different you could get up like 1,200 a month I wonder if people are ever gonna evolve to the point where a society actually can work if like what our problem is is that society and cities and these giant ideas of countries they happen so quickly in the development of the human animal that we we we haven't really evolved enough with our minds and our behavior to to to operate like to operate really in a harmonic way with a society and that's why there's all this crime and that's why there's all this bullshit that's why there's all these things that would not be tolerated in the natural group of 50 people that all know each other and love each other and support each other like we are we're designed to operate in tribes it's very obvious everybody wants to be on a team everybody wants to have a family everybody wants to have friends everybody wants to have a group you know we're the death squad look I mean we are like a little family we call ourselves a death squad all of us together you know and the reason why we call it would o be from Opie and Anthony named us that in like nineteen fucking whatever the hell it was 2003 or whatever it was I came in with Eddie Bravo and Tate and you know when he goes oh it's Joe Rogan and his death squad and then we're like that's hilarious the death squad because we're giggling we were like a cos officer test squad with the desk one now and it sounds so stupid but we call ourselves that and we have this death squad podcast network and all that but all this group of comics that we all hang out together we are like this this little tribe we all like this little family it's like a natural thing but it's not natural to do it with 300 million people if we were all together and we all live together it would be normal we all love each other we all take care of each other we look out for each other if something's happening to one of us we want to help you know that's that's normal shit I wonder if it's ever gonna get to the point where we could operate like that with 300 million people because it obviously doesn't work right now when you have crime but is that but I don't want to say never because I think that human interaction and what where we are right now it's just so different than where it was in the 30s and the 20s and the 50s and just really ten years ago social media and the interaction that we have with human beings today the interaction that we have on would just with Twitter alone it's so different then then human beings who grew up in a different generation who didn't have this and our connection with each other is very different that people that grew up in a different generation and I think that that's a part of the evolution of the human being and I think that human beings are slowly trying to figure out how to work together in these big giant ass-fucking groups I don't think it's impossible it obviously depends on raising children correctly and not developing incredibly fucked up human beings that are my ability but that's possible too you grew up fucked up and you're not a liability you know I mean you think about the crazy stories you've told just today about wanting to kill people smacking people the fact that you're a criminal and a thief and then you've been to jail and all these different things but yet here you are hanging out at my house you're one of my best friends you're very productive you're a fucking beautiful stand-up comedian you're a great guy you got a great podcast you know what I'm saying like you pulled it together to become something different and and Brian you know coming from fucking Columbus Ohio and working in a fucking gateway and you're being stuck in this town and you know and being surrounded by a bunch of knuckleheads you've pulled it together you've become someone different we all evolve we all move into some new phase of life and interact with everybody that's around us in a very different way is that possible on a mass level is that possible as a society that we all hold each other accountable all of us individually and don't become 300 million people together no society where people don't give a fuck with two fucking selfish some please computers and shit have separated us even more I think these a net winners have separated us even more I like human contact I do too but I like users kind it's not like computer you know he's good too and I said to Eddie Eddie can you call and you take a picture and this is something that were you said to me one that can you take a picture and put it on Twitter and he goes yeah my wife goes you could do it too and I said you know I'm living my life I don't wanna be a fucking computer when I'm out that means you're not fucking with it when I'm out of my house I don't wanna see Twitter I don't want to see Facebook I don't wanna see nothing I'm living my fucking life that's the promise of people they're not living no more they're on these fucking things too much and it's losing a little bit of human touch that's what we are that's what I feel I feel between the texting a lot of stuff it cuts time but we're losing human contact it's making us lazy a couple years ago commercial came out and it was about a business the guy goes I'm having a meeting and he started giving away plane tickets and the people were like the salesmen were like whoa what's this and he goes we lost our fucking human everything is a twit or a fucking email or something we're gonna go back to belly-to-belly sales to look at people in the fucking eye and talk to people again and that's I mean we're so loose now this fucking crime they're jumping up and down and fucking England Mexico's as volatile as it's ever fucking been we're in no danger we can't even drive in fucking Hollywood because people won't even put their fucking blinkers on they're so selfish that's the first way of changing Joe the way I change was to start from scratch if you can't pick up a piece of paper as you're walking you're not gonna change if you can't you know I used to when I got the longest shot I used to go to all these meetings in Hollywood and you go to all these meetings and every fucking meeting you go to some dumb motherfucker shows up 20 minutes late and says to you well they missed it traffic 1 motherfuck you live in LA you do and guess what I started doing Joe I started being late you know what this is what I'm talking about for me to be a better productive I have to show people not tell them show people and now when I get to a meeting in you're 20 minutes late I say something dog I say something to you because we're men that's how character you never looking angry is he today and never very very angry never let your character ruin your destiny and it all starts with little things it doesn't start with being a fake mm-hmm it starts with little things it's character is what people don't see you doing it's the things that be and that's what we forgotten Drive in Hollywood the other day there was a car pileup ok I agree 8 swamps I think that there's definitely a people need character Joey but you're discounting the idea that technology is connecting people that's ridiculous you're discounting the idea that Twitter connects people in the Facebook connects people yes you should have human interaction and you know what you should have human interaction showing out dog to people making out so you got a couple idiots no that doesn't mean that there's not a trend of interconnection douchebag some of them some of them not everybody which started we want to make the world I bet it starts at the little things we could talk to people it all starts with you dog oh my god because the world you know how these people are you know so creative the world and all this shit I've never seen more angry I believe in doing I know but Joey we're talking about a positive thing and all sudden you know I've learned anything we talk about into something where you're yelling at someone no no I'm yummmm isn't it Brian I'm passionate about something I'm not y'all understand everything is some fucking mall Moses fucking idiot fashion done it understand tell you you want me to be honest on your podcast right if not your buddy Joey I want you to be honest but I think we should be able to discuss ideas you screaming about some why you got to get me real stone when I guess that's what happened did you say peed on yourself I peed on myself go how did you do that fucking sleeping woke up I was so calling your bed no I didn't pee my bed I peed up once got my fucking pants wet on purpose oh yeah I was talking about you you peed in your sleep I was you know sometimes my my room was

scratching on a shitty fucking glitter and pissy litter and then they get out and just walk around your house shitty litter and pissy little paws and it's you know virus for sure I think it's alright for the podcast get it tested and we give it like live results yeah you know that we for those who don't know what we're talking about there's a cat parasite called Toxoplasma look it up on the internet a lot of people infected by this cat parasite and it alters human behavior and it makes you more impulsive and crazy and that's probably Joey you believe in what Toxoplasma no it's not it's 60 million American I've had cats with six fuckin you Joey it also makes your wife or your girlfriend whatever you were saying science you come correct because if not I walk out of the fucking room Joey we're talking about Toxoplasma is not now I got a cat disease without my cat man listening you talk that sounds exactly like they say with someone someone who has a cat disease talks exactly like

than I like Jay Jay more you don't like Jenny more anymore he's think he went a little baby did you know there was a little Twitter war out of nowhere right here's the whole Jay Martha show he's friends with Tom Segura and Tom's like hey can you please help Jay Mohr out and give him some information he wants to do a podcast if he could just talk to him so I was like yeah sure give me a call calls me up I'm like hey you know I'm really busy but I can lead you in the right direction if I ever have any free chance I'll help you out here and there and stuff like that because what can you just email me all the things I need so I emailed him like some some equipment that he should buy on Amazon you know yeah amazon.com gave him a webhost that he should go and then he wrote me back like hey how much this is all this stuff cost and I'm like well just click on the links you know anyways so I wrote back he said he asked you to add it all up yeah yeah and yeah how did he I say it he's like hey can you add that all up for me or something like that can you add that all yeah like he wanted me to click on all the links and add it up for him for some reason wow that's that's asking a lot that's asking a lot from a guy you don't know don't know the guy suddenly you went out of your way to provide him with all the information anything like like I don't know this guy I'm doing us a favor I had to go on Amazon find links and copy and paste and actually spent some time like for a complete stranger you know right and so then he said you never met Jenny Moore never met J more I so then he says can you add all this shit up yeah yeah and so and I said you know look I because I think he was kind of confused with everything he's like you know I said hey if you want to use my studio you can use it anytime you want to you know and he completely ignored that and goes hey you know they sent me another email we were on the road at the time right I missed his last email he sent me I didn't even know he sent it to me come to like a month or two later Tom Segura goes can you please write J Moore we're like a letter detailing everything he needs to do to do a podcast I'm like okay I'll make it super detailed note that's versus how you get on iTunes ya heart actually was saying take the SD card out of your computer right you know like it was that detail I suppose writing it and then like two days later like I'm still writing this letter I see that he has a podcast so I just like oh I guess with Kevin Smith with Kevin Smith so I'm like you know what I don't have to send this out anymore alright so I just ignored it and then I notice you started tweeting me like fucking crazy like tagging me if you search his timeline since March he has tweeted my names and there twenty four times I've never tweeted that dude once all right I don't know this guy alright so then finally I'm on my birthday weekend I'm out of town I'm at Disneyland and I'm like looking at my phone and it's like fuck you read ban you know once you return a phone call and he's like saying I don't return phone calls there's check my phone records he's not called me I've talked him once on the phone he's never called me again so he's like making up all this shit and telling me to fuck off and Wow I have no idea but you know from from from the people that came to me after that like a lot of big comedians came to me I was like dude you know we I have problems with him you know if this guy don't don't stand hope doesn't like them yes they hope doesn't like him that's pretty well known but yeah I mean it's you know what I don't know what his problem is I have no problem with the guy I just you know he had a little hissy fit and now just so I wouldn't assume you know though it doesn't make sense that he would just go after you want Twitter like that is like be a man yeah meanwhile he's going after you on Twitter yeah that is yeah and he's saying that I'm not returning calls and making up pretty much fake bullshit but how weird is it to go after someone on Twitter saying you're not calling me yeah like that's that's weird there would be a man are you going after someone on Twitter right and I like Jay I've never had a single problem with Jay Jay more and I have always been cool I was looking forward to having him on the podcast and I actually wrote him a message saying hey let's work this out next week I'm busy with Fear Factor I'll call you soon and then right after I wrote that then I read all these tweets that you and him were going back and forth with I'm sure they doing shake while you work or you were just getting tweeted at when he was calling you a bitch or right what the fuck he was saying to you yeah I was like this is just weird did he get drunk or something and just know from what people have been telling me that he has a side of him where he spazzes out and this is normal for him like I guess like he just goes after people who just has a temper you know you have problems with them I just avoid them when you told me you were budding up with him I just closed my fuckin ear because I knew that wasn't yeah why'd you laugh cuz it's just why why well I was just gonna do his podcast I liked him the guy said I think he's funny he's got great impressions the dude that does the best Christopher Walken on the fucking fucking face of the planet he's got hilarious Colin Quinn his Colin Quinn is as funny as Colin Quinn I mean I think he's a talented guys got precision how cool I don't know it's not the comms look what I know I know that's the problem I have to judge him now I have to judge them based on my interactions and my interactions with him have always been cool he's always been nice to me I've never had a problem he's always been cool with me but you know I don't like read all that shit I don't like seeing anybody doing shit like that but you did that - Brian - you know you even have - Brian - on Twitter just the same way back but it's the same fucking way you went after him on Twitter the exact same way the size because me and you were cool who's he was calling me back all these outside fucking forces that we call our fucking friends we're the ones that would twit me and saying all this shit so next time I mean you sit down I'll fucking tell you and that's why I got pissed off when I went to Jerry's that night and that do came up to me that's what got me pissed off because you're my brother you and me never had a fucking problem we goof around all the fucking time that's why when when they told me that you were furious and stuff I got sore I called you right away I called you right away there's no you don't mean there's a problem I call or I show up that's the worst thing about no I know looking like me and they love every move out fucking nothing like that dawg I know you know listen bro that's why I don't deal with a lot of these fucking guys because I know it's gonna end up and this is the type of person I am I don't know how to deal I don't know how to argue I don't know how to go to court I don't know how to play those games those are not games I grew up playing so when people throw that at me or be erotic so whatever the fuck that word is I can't deal with that yeah talk to me I know I know but just come talk to me like a man because if you don't if they don't come talk to me like a man Brian if they don't come talk to you like a man then you gotta suspect that come penis yeah and then you know what after a while you wanna do don't know because I know like my mom used to say if it sucks in the beginning it's us all the way through so just leave it alone if you have a bad week the first day with them you know what I like I said the moon apostle cos he's gonna stop all the way through so let's just shake him par friends because why put before status he's gonna start getting angry and someone who's not here again no I died I was fucking 12 years old I told that cocksucker then I'll tell you now ladies and gentlemen play the music let's wrap this bitch up let's bring this motherfucker home let's bring it home in a positive direction Joe Diaz and I
