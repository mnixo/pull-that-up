join my dango rocky podcast by night all day I'd be the best in the world you seen his posters amazed he's one that does all those crazy posters joke dope all Aldersgate this neither one that did Conor McGregor in an MMA glove punching Floyd in the mouth correct here's York one with all the dope stuff let me tell you here's where Conor McGregor come in here's where Conor McGregor can win MMA gloves let's have a boxing match with MMA cup I don't think you need to do this so if Floyd that boys had some serious problems in the past with his hands correct and he uses those big-ass pillow gloves because of it and he's been known to not really sit down as punch it just picks guys apart there's no doubt about it Floyd is a masterful boxer but that's a big transition for him to fighting with small gloves he's never gonna agree that the transition is for Conor to fight with Barry loves all right you're right I don't agree they're gonna do boxing but I I honestly think with how Conor moves it's all it's all going wrong forwards one the best of all time it's not the best it's a lot for him to adapt to Conor's big he it's fucking hard he can go both ways we'll see we'll see I want to see what does the war think it's gonna happen Oh season want to do the fucking the Joey Diaz and me fucking collar babe I've got him Joe chilli with his gunpoint about you got plenty of em Beckett comes flying out of his mouth because I'm not kind of really fight that's not going to happen that's right hey dude it's a lot of fucking money here's the deal four tables last two because you made 300,000 but Dana had a real good point he goes Connors lab to pay-per-views were 1.3 million in 1.5 million he goes Floyd's with 300,000 it's a great point and Floyd's asking for five hundred million or 100 million rather he goes you're out of your fucking mind he goes here's a real deal I'll give you 25 million I'll give Conor 25 billion and then we'll talk about pay-per-view I've written my thousand from rebug in fourth out it's another championship fight but at the main event look at this bone baby this is like in serious because Dana addresses it made an offer on national TV forges on Showtime last night and they go is there any boxer that could bring you out of retirement he goes nope the only fight that would get me out of retirement is Conor McGregor Smalley fight I want he knows there's so much money in that fight Conor McGregor is a goddamn job paper Vienna are can happen but see the thing is that's a fight that would transcend into the total casual person yes the same way the Ronda Rousey fight to do but this whole Lamar was oh god I feel like her email you know this might be like three million because it might be like such a freak show but I was Connery normal how about normally I think so it's loaded what happen aligned every hundred what would you say like the biggest pay-per-view fight ever like what would the number number one of all time now mainly arrest Pacquiao Mayweather exactly I guess the wrong time isn't it okay but before we look at the numbers let's guess I'm going to say two point five that's the biggest ever I'm say uh if I'm saying most three two point it is for that fight it is for Pacquiao Mayweather yeah bout your you're off on the numbers what's the number I think it's five right four point six mill well I'm saying calling them god but damn how much money may work met him making that fight revenue of 400 million Oh My Jesus so he probably made at least a hundred plus know that didn't I say made 150 hundred sixty million and Pacquiao made like 80 or 100 well him and Connor you're getting even if you hate Connor you're still getting all those MMA fans because you represents us you hate Floyd again all those boxing fans be with you hate Floyd and then the two will just go to Sh do you think that eking that they can make it up to that level that's a bigot I want to know why I want to know why Connor or how Connor isn't concerned you'll get knocked out in the first one there's nothing to lose he won't get knocked out in the first shown no you won't get knocked down first shot it doesn't work that way as a bot you mean you can protect yourself against even somebody that good cuz very high level and quick and and also Mayweather doesn't hit that hard Tom is a lot bigger right kind of moves different than a lot of boxers do because you're so used to leg kicks you still takedowns and he has a different stance that alone will be it will take a little bit of time for me with you to adjust to but Mayweather has the ability to be in the right place the right time always and also deceptive it's so deceptive because it doesn't look like he's doing anything special but if you watch the way he's moving he's never out of position and he's always popping you with that jab and he's still even at 30 7:38 3939 or like sort of like a fat doesn't take it especially lately though he doesn't take advantage get out of the way he's got these winning rounds with the jab and then dicking and dodging get out of the way I'm I just don't gosh I think four commas oh man the win-win form you imagine if Connor lands the left hand up today and I ain't gonna happen what would we do now what man listen Connor fought I mean rather Floyd fought Ricardo Mayorga yeah and no not recover my orga Lujan Madonna Madonna Marcos Maidana right yeah and Maidana connected at the end of one of the rounds he connected with a big fuckin right yeah had him sit down for a second yeah did he hit anymore I a hundred I usually haven't heard out like him well he's still he's generally hard lost shoulder you know really none on now is it really only once but it was the first fight the fight and fight Floyd Pacquiao Sugar Shane wall Paola to be in here see and Maidana is you know murderous puncher just and he would throw those crazy Chuck Liddell style overhand rights so he's all over Floyd here and at the end words being one of the rounds amazing learning but listen this guy is way smaller than Conor let's think of this we're talking about a guy here that's fighting 147 154 Conor although he's made it down to 145 he's physically much larger than guy Conor was walking around him I love that you guys are he won't put a glove on him and and he will not hit him and I think so it's going to do whatever he wanted you want to bet whatever you want to let every Lance one-shot it ain't none of them off it's very strange Conor he always runs versus hey Conor McGregor he won't land a shot no can you uh forms from everyone not at night he started swimming when what to me in Jono pouring some more well what I do know is that great fighter tips haven't done it haven't Lee I mean I know that he made no doubt no doubt look clumsy I know that sure I tell had one arm I know that yeah Martin look at what he does everybody oh seem ironic clipped him there with a left or a right uppercut brother but but at the end of one about is beautiful Bob look at that do whatever you want hey man you don't get to be 49 I know without being fucking sensei no don't he's the best defensive boxer of all time right yeah okay I would say so I mean it you know purdell weather two years Pernell Whitaker lost later on in his career he wasn't able to sustain it as long as Mayweather has so what Mayweather's been able to do is sustain it better than anybody and also keep improving I mean like when you fought Canelo he a lot of people thought Canelo was going to give him a hard time young Canelo he's too big for me fuck Canelo up [Music]
