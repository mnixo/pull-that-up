hello freak bitches and it's just because he got mauled it wasn't because skill-wise he was commensurate and then when Floyd came back in the rematch he just boxed his face off just fucked him up because you just wanted to let him know like look dude I barely took you serious in that first fight it got close but it only got close because like this slop he brought it he just put a skill clinic on him in the second fight sacrifi wasn't even close I think that that's the only cut but that's not how Conor normally fights not like a swarming face-first brawler type dude he's a guy's like cautious about getting hit yeah I'm thrilled about it but I'm also I I wish I wish I wish I knew more about your side of the tracks well we don't know enough about Connor because Connor has never had a professional boxing match you know and the thing is you see is striking but you only see striking when he's working on kicks and wrestling and all the other shit too what if you just kicked them like with that I mean just just do it just alone oh just to do it it would be fucked up he sucked up that it would be hilarious watching you'd probably is probably some stipulations the contracts they can't get them in an armbar welcome I think just kicking him in the head and knocking him out would be worth losing all the money and then getting more money out of magic he would be a goddamn folk hero if they got in close if they got any else and Floyd was like sucking and Jukka on the outside and he threw a jab to cover up a left high kick and that left high kick next I'm just doing a can you see Floyd go limp and he would go limp he never been high kicked like that Jesus that would be crazy as if he didn't know it was coming yeah he could clip them with it like if you had no idea if you hid a kick behind the punch like fighters a lot of fighters do they like throw a punch literally to cover your face so the kick is behind it already and then boom the kick comes like while your vision is already you're thinking about the next punch bang the kick lands and you get Kayode happens all the time if he did that I would be insane would it be worth it it would but it would fuck everything up because no one would ever trust another fighter from MMA to ever fight a boxer in a boxing match again we've only had the opposite happen really you know she quit and a lot of people quit I worked search and rescue in Alaska on Denali for years and and you'd be amazed at how many people are just like done you know they just lay down and they're done because they're not rational enough to know like if I sit down and I just took just a little bitty nappy and getting back up you're taking a snow nap and you're done you know unless is known now yeah it's no no I don't like that that's a turn but but with hypothermia the interesting thing that happens is you get euphoric right you go through this this stage of super cold super cold then your core temperature drops low enough to where you forea comes in so oftentimes the same people we would find are undressed so you get hot you get warm so their gloves have your losses hansen is unzipped and you know everybody's everybody's buck naked on the side of the mountain right before they die before they die so I mean not that I want to go out that way but now I can think of worse ways like it's euphoric apparently Wow because they also pull people back I've seen multiple times when we pull people back and they discuss that they described it and then we start rewarming their frostbite and it's just not right after that then I close out that art form uh frostbite is so horrible to look at to it's just you the stuff we had to see and her fingers are still half half fingers are off to get left over yes she sent me pictures she's missing fingers missing she shits yeah she's lucky some of the phalanges are going nuts off so they got her down they ended up hours and hours and hours we're tracking and we're trying to talk to him they get her down to camp four which is that tractor you saw then the trickiest part as he'll tell you because I can't tell you camp for two camps three yeah cam forty cam 3 and then Camp three to camp 2 which they didn't even do they couldn't get they couldn't get to camp two which is straight on the low to say load C face it's a it's about a sixty sixty degree ice face well which is slick so when you're roping somebody down you know does provide you know less friction you can actually see somebody down but you can't get going too fast okay you know so now you're a 25 we're at 26 27 thousand feet you're 130 pound 125 Township and you get a lower this 205 a lady down hard oxygen these guys at work in their image she's 200 pounds well she wasn't that big but you know with all our gear and although they didn't know yeah I mean yeah it 160 hundred 70 pounds worth of weight you know dead weight today I lower down oh so we got her down we got her down to where we could go in with the helicopter and we picked her up and took her back down to base camp and that was when the the meeting took place between her and her husband and the tearful rejoicing and you know saw the part you missed was the helicopter landed it couldn't land at Camp - we weren't supposed to go up to 23,500 which at the base of lotia crampon point and you got there and said I can only pick one of you and she looked at her husband and said you stay well so he made it that day and take the next helicopter out so we got her down and you she looked at her husband and said you stays like that you quit well she was mad cause you got left she was pissed off the shoes existed she got left but he couldn't have carried her no that's a good-looking man you're switching it depends there's ways looking at it both ways somebody quit somebody gave up somebody said no I mean who knows but I'm sure they had to go through through some deep ass therapy no I got home okay so I'm going to I'm going to fill in the gaps here so fast-forward 9 or 10 months and dude husband has a has a heart attack and - so he died I'm sorry I'm not should be laughing if a kind of fucked up I mean it is it is fucked up but and going to Everest menu and I'm a little more of the you know the Shandling tons and tons of paper till you're drowning and Confused Shandling you know that's a sad one man what fun dude that was oh the best that I'm doing a documentary about him yeah for HBO and so the most fun part about it is he always went to the comedy magic club and did stand up even in eras where you didn't know he was doing it that's where I met him at the comedy magical yeah and I was was great yeah he just I mean it was like for me I was a huge fan of Larry Sanders show and Larry Sanders show that's what paul sims got a start yes a producer of news radio and so when I you know when I saw him was like it was one of those ones like hum Wow so that's actually Garry Shandling right there right there were Judd Apatow's right there yeah weird one and he and use the comedy magical they tape every show since the eighties have every show taped yeah and I said can you give me the last 50 sets that Garry did at the comedy magic club and this is you know from the last few years and no one's ever seen any of these jokes except the people at those shows he didn't do them on TV he didn't do about talk shows there was no special some of the funniest jokes you ever heard just him you know working on the craft how about going around being so funny yeah but he did a lot of notes he was a his discipline guy he was well in his 70s he wrote so many jokes I found these binders hundreds and hundreds of jokes in every loose leaf binder like a guy sitting at a desk all day just crafting like two sentence perfect jokes yeah but there's like the balance right there's that there's crafting the perfect jokes and then there's just being able to be loose yeah and fun and hilarious well you also used to go on stage with just a set up and he wouldn't know the punchline and he would say the setup and hope the punchline came which is pretty wild he you know one of the one of the great things I'm doing a documentary you get to ask people for footage so Seinfeld gave me the dailies for comedians in cars getting coffee when he interviewed Gary and then the people who made the movie comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the dailies of a sequence that they only use 10 seconds of in the documentary which was Garry and Jerry going to the comedy magic club and doing sets and also there that night is Neil and in Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes it's all their performances and then their entire conversation for three hours hanging out backstage and it is unbelievable the conversation how funny it is and there's a moment where Chris Rock is doing the joke about how Nelson Mandela got divorced that even Nelson Mandela after decades of Union prison he could survive that but he couldn't survive getting a very good support immediately I forgot how he worded it but there's a shot of Shandling alone in a green room watching rock do this bit and as he's doing it Gary's like saying what he what he's like he's guessing what the bit is as rock saying it but in awe of Chris Rock and it's a really beautiful moment and that's what the best part of doing this documentary is is just finding little magical moments that no one would ever see if you didn't dig deep [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
