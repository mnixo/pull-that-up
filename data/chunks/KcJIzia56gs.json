hello freak bitches if we go back to 10,000 12,000 years ago clearly whatever happened then must have been profoundly traumatic to the survivors think about this if you are the survivor of an event that basically erased modern civilization and you were living in a small isolated band of survivors with no way to communicate with the rest of the world and no knowledge of whether there was even other survivors anywhere on the earth it could profoundly affect you your consciousness and that could be so profound that it's the imprint of those events could be so profound that it could be passed on you know for generations and be lodged in our subconscious this idea of human conflict necessary for human survival in the traumas that had been visited upon our species by nature itself so I think that once we come to terms with the possibly origins of you only until we come to terms with the origin of human conflict are we going to be able to purge it once and for all and and realize that that the modern analogue for that scenario was that coming out of that catastrophe abundant resources abundance habitat abundance space no conflict for territory resources because the human population was limited what I suggest is that if people want to understand but the viable future of the human species go out on a crystal clear night and look at the sky there is the future there's our potential future because the scenarios that have been around since the 1970s show that everything that we're extracting now from the earth the minerals the precious metals the hydrocarbons it's all out there in infinite abundance and it's basically just outside of our doorstep and we are as close now to being able to harvest the resources of the cosmic environment as we were from setting foot on the moon in 1960 you know Nick and Nate they get a painted to be these like bad guys and you know part of the persona that you know they promote not that's all well and good but like they're very very respectable we know when the wind nic beat Frank Shamrock he was on the ground after the fight and Nick reached down and picked him up and said you know you're a legend you can't be on the floor stand up or whatever yeah and this is but all people see is you know they go for the staredown and the press conference and Nick flicks them off and Frank Shamrock grab his balls but rather they're both very respectful fighters and you know I think they get they get a bad rap sometimes well he definitely gets crazy before the fight and anxious and but that's to be expected and the shit talking look son sue said it in the art of war you know miyamoto musashi talked about it in the book of five rings there's all sorts of things that go on in a fight and in any contest there's advantages to be had and there's mental advantages that if you do not take advantage of those mental advantages and your opponent does you're at a disadvantage and when Nick immediately starts to fight and he's like he's got his hands out to Anderson like what bitch what bitch and he's walking towards him come on what the fuck you gonna do come on what do you do and you see him talking like constantly talking and you see Anderson like people get flustered when Nick does that big time he doesn't sparring to tell he really is the first time I met Nick I was brought in for actually via for Nate's fight with Donald Cerrone and when I got to the gym uh Nate had hurt his neck or something was going to the had to go to the chiropractor or something and they were like I'll just wait Nickleby here you can spar with Nick and I was like okay so like Nick shows up and I'm a big fan of these guys you know like his I was kind of like you know a little star-struck and Nick shows up and he's sup yeah I'm like the coach the problem is like so what are we gonna spar are we gonna fire an Isaac you fired nom you know and it was just like just like he walks into the cage you know kind of like just looking me up and down kind of thing and then you know we we sparred it was really hard we had like a really good really hard session and after that he was like kickboxing huh so yeah you want to hang out after you know we started hanging out after that but it was uh it was very much like like his you know that's that's who he is you know just you know I grew up in Libya Saudi Arabia Pakistan I didn't come to north america until I was 24 then I grew up in pretty much muslim-majority countries and some very conservative ones you know all time and you know I just whenever I hear people say that this has nothing to do with religion just doesn't make any sense to me is that like an American liberal convenient thing to say because it makes you look super sensitive and very Noam Chomsky ask well yeah it does and then you know there's a that I don't know what goes into it I know that there's a lot of fear you know people don't want to criticize as some you know we saw what happened with Salman Rushdie all the way up to the Paris attacks so there is a fear of that there's also a fear of being seen as a bigot it was Brent and I call it Islamophobia phobia hahaha you were like that was great word and you know I'm a phobia phobia I love it it it's something that a lot of people relate to immediately try hear it it is all that I hate that term Islamophobia like look what about Cristiano phobia what's hilarious to me is that a lot of a quote unquote progressive very left-wing people will openly mock Christianity yeah while defending islam or by labeling people Islamophobic or conservative yeah that I mean you got it you got to stay consistent if you're a true liberal and everybody's saying this well unfortunately not everybody saying it I wish more people are saying it but you know if you are for instance opposed to killing gay people you should be opposed to killing gay people whether it's in the KKK manifesto or in the Bible or in the Quran or in the Republican Party you know or in Uganda it doesn't matter to what it is if you're opposed to something you should be opposed to an across the board it doesn't suddenly become respectful that ok now well it's in the Bible so we got to respect that right well no and it's a respect for ideas is just such an overrated you know that it's considered a virtue you know respecting people's ideas and beliefs and ideas are not people you know that yes and I was try to that's the problem with the word Islamophobia is that it implies criticism of an idea and there is genuine anti-muslim bigotry people do commit hate crimes against Muslims but Muslims are people they they're not I mean they're entitled to respect they have rights Islam itself is not a person it's just a it's a book it's an ideology it's an ideal a bunch of ideas in a book so it doesn't have rights and it's not entitled to respect I you know I I didn't get to meet Dangerfield and i miss Carlin and I was like I just want to work with Rickles at some point then it came up that I could work with him in Montreal and I'm supposed to go on vacation with my family and I literally sent my wife and kids I'm like I'm gonna meet I'm gonna be three days late to our
