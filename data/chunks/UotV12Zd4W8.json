hello freak bitches like oh yeah you pulled this string back and then you let the arrow fly pretty straightforward like I think that's most people's idea of what archery is but then when you really pay attention to the technical aspects of all the different stuff that's going on and all the different things you think about and how you literally cannot have anything on your mind other than all the technique involved your foot placement your technique in standing your breathing where how you're drawing it back the position of your front shoulder the position of your rear elbow how you're pulling what do you how do you respond after the arrows released there's so much going on that like when you put it all together like it has it leaves no room for homework there's no room for a relationship bullshit there's no room for taxes there's no room in there man if you want to make a nice shot like that like I guarantee you if we could have a brain scan of your head the second you released that arrow at a hundred yards to go in that two inch gap there would be nothing in there other than what you did it would there would be no other but no other cells would be fired up no no that's one thing and actually like yesterday when we were shooting there towards the end of the day you got to the point where you were almost your mind was clear it's almost like for me you know your family came home like things were winding down you knew that like work was over and we it was like right before dark and like for me I loved shooting at first light and at last light because it seems like that's when I'm not really worried about someone texting me or calling me I'm not worried about a problem at home and I shoot with a clear mind and I'm way more efficient at my practice and it is a form of meditation I mean it's like you said it's an art and if you're clouded then you it will reflect that on the target I mean it's like if your arrows are in one spot then you know you have a single focus and it's almost like the more those arrows are spread that's a representation of how many other thoughts and distractions you have in your mind I mean and I look at it that way when I shoot I'm trying to narrow everything down to just a movement and you look at good golfers the ones that swing easy and it just literally looks like flow there's such good strikers and they're so much more efficient when you see people that are trying to be robotic and and almost like hack something then it's like too systematic you know you see someone like that does professional karate or something if they're in a forms competition if they're like real rigid going around it's just not what it's meant to be I mean it's supposed to be a dance it's supposed to be like literally a mental musical that's playing and if your mind is clear then it's it's a form of meditation is it do you ever have male instincts to like buy a girl's neck when you're having sex with her like that that kind of it seems like you'd be somebody that would be like a neck bite or you'd be really into it I do not want you beating off thinking about how I fight so I will stop this conversation right here it's you know what it's different with different girls right yeah with different girls you've dated mm-hmm some some girls like to get choked they just do I hate all that when a girl tells me to slapping her children that's the worry I can't do it I'm not gonna beat you up you're gonna have to get that from somebody else yeah gonna have to call Ari do you think the daddy thing there's something there when girls are like fuck me harder daddy when is the whole daddy you think there's her to it it's a dirty yeah it's dirty they don't mean their dad thinking you they want you to be their daddy in that moment not even like a father but like like the daddy that's given the dick you know they don't even think it's like a different word it's a different use of the word daddy you know it doesn't mean the same thing it's like when you call someone captain sub captain right you don't really think that guy has a boat but what if they follow me yeah I could talk but they you say this one girl says it as a kid though and she doesn't talk like a kid in any other times except when she's having sex and she said she regresses into like intolerable yeah well she's dating you yeah some dark shit happened yeah but see I go deeper in it I was like I mean like I'm going to try to go down that path if she brings it up I'll see if she plays along and she plays along it's like fun he's like trying to learn more about this person that I'm fucking you know it's even more disturbing saying are you late for school because that means morning sex like the dad doesn't even have the excuse of being drunk coffee and fucks his daughter that is yeah that's your homework yeah you need to find better people but you know you gotta work on yourself alright I know get your own shit in order and you'll attract people I don't make it noise I don't know breathe i slobber in her hair I remember just being in awe and there was a bunch of other comedians that were at the Eastside comedy club member East Side in Cuba Devine yep Richie mentor vini me and Kevin James were sitting around after the show were shaking her head we're like god damn he's good god damn it he apparently did two different hours on like Friday night he did two shows in 8 to 10 good twos completely different hours completely top-to-bottom and they were like is both of them were slaughtering he's just a destroyer running writer I remember feeling like what he he could take premises that you didn't think there was anything there and you could turn him into like one of your favorite bits he did a premise about buying a Corvette and the guy trying to talk him into all sorts of stuff in the Corvette and I remember thinking while he was doing this Wow how is this guy gonna make this funny there's talking about buying an expensive sports car he's gonna figure out how to make this funny remember the rough thing he did I had a bunch of well you know we have problems him and I and it really was because of him I'm not saying that kind of yeah I'm sorry dad because he's dead no but what happened was we were like getting different things at the same time you know like competitive with each other well he was competitive with me and I think it's because people pitted us against each other purely because we're short Italians well I'm short Italian as well but you've never been anything but support of a nice time Thank You Joseph but I mean not you know one time I said um cos heard somebody was talking I said why don't we go out on the road together oh we will fill up theatres in he goes why would I want to do that I said I don't know make money to have fun you know he didn't understand the concept yeah he said to me one time he goes once you all comedy festival you think I should go there I said go with the idea that you're gonna meet beautiful girls go to great restaurants and if you happen to get a deal you do but have fun and he goes fine he looked at me like what do you mean fun this isn't fun this is Tara he was tortured Wow he never enjoyed it you know that's the saddest part of it he was seen never knew how good he was or he never enjoyed how good he was I first met him in Montreal yeah I first met him in like that war yep yeah I met him in 94 just we were both passing each other in in the front doors just said hi hey man nice to meet you buh-buh-buh-buh-buh what shows you doing that kind of thing just you know and he seemed to me like he just was a just a brilliant brilliant mind like I'm always thinking but just always you know yes own head maybe almost too much I saw him on a plane I was getting I was complying back remember they had three cabins and American no he's in first class he was in coach with Lenny Lenny Clarke no late Clark Lenny Africanist any Schultz crazy Lenny crazyland no not that crazy Lana not the one more pigs more shit Leigh yeah it's fucking Lenny's a comedy but Lenny you Dave Hawthorne his friend he would know them okay but anyway he spent like I walked back to say hi and he goes you know I usually fly first myself but I'm flying him I said it's okay I said you know I went it's all right let him fly ABC flew me and he didn't like that either
