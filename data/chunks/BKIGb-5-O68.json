hello freak bitches fastly I mean about the liquid around the mouth anyway myspace people that are Scientology would say this is our religion and you're taking the piss out of our watching it's an ideology that is also a very positive one in the sense that it's dedicated toward self-improvement and eliminating all these psychological barriers that are holding you back and in that way people find a lot of benefit in being a part of that religion and I think when they find a lot of benefit and being a part of it then you know they could justify all the other nonsense and just sort of ignore it because what l ron Hubbard according to the going clear book lawrence krauss book was trying to do was self-medicate but he had a lot of psychological issues himself and he was trying to cure his own issues and in using these methods to cure his own religion or his own his own issues he translated them into a religion like this is a big part of what Scientology initially was was his own attempts to self diagnose and treat his own psychological ailments quite a good idea really beginning like ants of worked really well and there are so I suppose people that it's working for I like F koala I heard I liked was be quick to see where religious people are right you know it's all really obvious where religious people are wrong you know because we sort of hear about it on the news but like where religious people are right you know together nurse selflessness relationship with a deeper self acceptance of death and the possibility of transcendence of the you know human primal self those things are all really beautiful ideas that have kind of lost their way in a scientist I&T know that term scientism the idea that sort of science has got into territories that science comedy handles we come to a juddering full stop at certain points you know like what happened on the Tuesday before the Big Bang you know right materialism materialism and individualism yeah are hard things to overcome if like if if people if we are if we have as our dominant mindset I'm only going to believe shit that I can prove then you are just an individual and you may as well just do you know why not just spend your life fucking as many people as you can and accumulating as much material as you can because thing exists unless you can see it measure it why it contain it and fuck it now if that is you know the dominant belief system which sort of materialism consumerism capitalism I think all dovetail on that premise you know this is all is real in fact you know that's how you can have the the chronic ecological disrespect is because oh really doesn't matter what happens after you're dead well what about my fucking children and just not a practical level of gonna live on this fucking pebble in infinite space yeah they're like but if you're just like well not really thought about that and I sort of an inability to accept you know like certain and I know that you're sort of like a I don't wholesale by any dominant theory but I think it's clear to me that do you know why I believe in on an individual level and on a cultural level if something is possible you should be trying to fucking do it so as soon as people realize hold on a minute that's having a negative impact or hey this is a better way of using our resources now utilities as soon as you realize it you should be moving towards it they say wisdom is acting on knowledge why don't you recognize our fossil fuels are running out right fucking it oh we better start working on the basis that we're fucked we better start looking at alternative energy sources we look at different alliances you just like knowing those things and not doing them it makes me very very uneasy because it makes me pick who benefits from ignoring this stuff who's running this show if he's having all of the you know if it's creating all this rage all this unease all this fear in your country and in my country now times of great great disease and uncertainty for me really looking for something and know that these institutions are just saying just you know carry on there's no sort of alternative no one's gonna delay in and no one now is going to see himself as part of a religious community in the same way or a sort one of the dead ideologies of the last century and meanwhile we're in this sort of peculiar state of looming crisis that feels kind of fucking mad well we're definitely in a state of looming crisis but to unpack this whole thing you started off with this idea of what happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang and how science can't really answer that well they can't answer it yet like that the problem is once they gather more data it might be a hundred years now or a thousand years from now they can say oh well here we've done the calculations and we understand now that it's an infinite cycle of birth and death in the universe is constantly expanding contracting and this is the process that we're a part of it's infinite and it's never started it's never ending it goes on and on and on I think you're probably bloody right I like that idea that you just espoused is in five thousand-year-old fuckin documents yes good like called the apana shet you know those ideas like those ideas are there already and when we fucked off religion hundred years ago cuz it was causing too much you know our sake we've got we kicked out of some of the ideas that are only now just being discovered right but those ideas are just to be contemplated right now and to be considered whereas science is trying to find definitive evidence that they do or don't represent the reality of our timeline and once they do then they'll be able to talk about it but right now what they're doing is they're examining the evidence that the Big Bang exists and what could have possibly caused that yeah that's right now see what my difficulty is is that there are that is when any ideology behaves dogmatically and prohibitively like Privett like prevents further exploration like whatever that would look what kind of what's an example of the nature of consciousness no one knows why consciousness impacts matter in the way it does in the sub quantum world no we can't fucking we've come to a point oh fuck like you need like if you would like that the famous double slit theory then an observed particle behaves differently like the other park one way you can change its essential nature the weapons being obsessed represented though when it's been explained to me by people actually understand it what it really is is that we're measuring these particles and in the act of measuring you're changing the results because you're using something to measure it yes yes yeah so it gets represented as all this whoo-whoo craziness but what what I think is interesting Joe is somewhere between this whoo-whoo craziness and there kind of a flat mundane look this is life you're born your diet food shit comes out your asshole territory somewhere in there is a mystery that there behind your eyes by and Jimbo Jamie's eyes and my eyes there is a constant there is this consciousness there is this awareness there's this inexplicable experience you've add-on DMT experiences I've had through yoga and through LSD that suggests to me that consciousness itself is the dominant force consciousness is not just one more phenomena is the seat of all phenomena and when people are saying oh there's this thing that's God what they are saying is there is an absolute consciousness and all is contained within it all matter at some point has come from consciousness these realms they're experienced through psychedelic or extreme you know personal experiments like your cryogenic things or your flotation tanks all suggest a phenomenon beyond individual consciousness there's something else and the very fact that you know that it's in for the consciousness even by the process of measuring even by the process of measuring is influencing and impacting reality I don't think that you know I'm not taking that to the extreme that I know what you mean make some people go all that means your mind can control shit I mean I think it means that it means that reality is only reality when you look at it that's when it's kind of getting towards a bloody good book I reckon your listeners will be bang into is called biocentrism by a man called Robert Lanza who he did the best breakdown I've ever read of that double slit experiment and and of the the the the you know made me understand for the first time that reality is happening within your own consciousness it's not an external phenomena at all that you know like explained in very ways that I could understand of like he went you know you think thinks I'm totally mundane II went like you know the experience of going in your kitchen in the night and turning the light on is your kitchen fridge still there when you go back downstairs he goes well it goes when you do go in your kitchen and turn the light on you go see a photon parcels of photons come down they interact with the optic nerve they translate they invert it in your consciousness you go so whatever it is that's in your kitchen when you're not looking at it it ain't the same as when you are looking at is an interpretive reality and one of the ways that I've sort of reduced this down for my own simple understanding is this but if none of us had a sense of smell if you didn't either in Jamie didn't and then how would the concept of smell make sense how it's got this painting this bacon with none of us would have the instrument to receive it so that whole thing would be off the agenda so I think that there are streams of energy streams of data for which we do not have the interests to receive so we totally discount it because we simply don't have the instruments to receive it and I said once in my stand-up as a matter of fact like my cat doesn't know there's an Internet the cat be in and it does not enter the realm of my cat's consciousness but the fucking Internet is out there where even with these fucking experiences and like all those realms that we're experiencing in these various sort of psychedelic states or you know how every era teve is an indication to me there's another reality now where does that become fucking relevant to what we're talking out for me here where it does is at one of the continual ideas that keeps from merge re-emerging to connect us back to where we will be Joe Campbell at the beginning is there is this fucking sense of oneness and believing ourselves to be individual and believing the dominant thing in our lives to be material that fucks us up because people kill each other over that material and once we sort of realize no with the true thing about us is the consciousness is the inner self that's the roofing that we're all out here we're all in the game we're all going to do shit we're all going to make mistakes but let's not have the material idea as the dominant social idea because that everyone's agreed with that whether they're communist or capitalist or fascism everyone's saying now the main thing is this shit there's our ear and it's like that connects to those primal drives because we know that if that tapped into your sexual drive you can never have enough pussy if that gets into your status Drive you can never have enough status and power you know so like is we're all going to still feel those things I'm still going to be a cunt 25 times a day but it'll be nice if the cultural ambience was I don't worry Russell you'll be back to your normal self in a minute of feeling that we're all one and we're all connected not yeah well of course I feel like that you know like that and that's what's frightened me about the culture of our countries at the moment is it's endorsing the worst aspects of our nature it's acculturating the worst aspects of our nature instead of the best aspects of our nature and for me they're no buckin difference between left and right in the current political sphere because they're all making the same argument they're all saying come and live out here in the material world yeah it seems to me that the material world and this idea that we should be accumulating possessions and status and all these different things is universal it almost seems like it's a natural progression from ancient tribal civilization life to this weird city life to this integration of electronics in our life and this symbiotic relationship that we after computers and the internet and information itself it seems like this is one of the things that drives that is this desire for material possessions because when you have a desire for material possessions it ensures that you're going to continue to innovate and come up with newer and greater and better because you always want to keep up with the Joneses you always want to have the newest Tesla because it goes zero to sixty in two seconds and you want to have the coolest fucking house with the biggest TV and the fastest internet and all those things sort of compound this technological innovation cycle that we're on so my thought has been for a long time that where we are is some sort of an electronic Caterpillar it's going to give birth some artificial life and that all of our desire for material possessions and status and all these different things is really just us pushing forth this electronic agenda and that this innovation and the construction of artificial intelligence that's inevitable is eventually going to be the next stage of life and that weird like huddling ourselves up in this sort of civilization cocoon and that boom out of that cocoons going to pop some sort of a God being and that this is what we're here for and this is what we've been doing since we're monkeys fling and shit at each other and flip it over cow patties looking for mushrooms that we are a part of a process and then if you look at it objectively all these traps that you or I or Tom Cruise or Jim Breuer been caught up in when whether it's traps of ego or jealousy all these things sort of ensure movement they ensure movement ensure interactivity and that is going to ensure innovation and progress and competition and all those things that even we look at it we go this is so pointless this is so foolish so but yet it's so incredibly prevalent not glorifying it or saying it's definitely the way to go but objectively if you weren't a human and you're stepping outside of this thing looking at it from a distance you're like these fuckers are making something they might not even know they're making something that's they're making I understand that the same way that yeah bees or ants maybe this aware of the hive consciousness and the common drives but where I disagree with you Joe is that that you see the endpoint as being the materialization of a super consciousness through technology I see the endpoint as being a realization amongst us as a species now I know that both be both and there is no there is no reason to it you know we are just another fucking are we just another species on this planet are we really better dogs and cows and monkeys III get how come how serves er if the very Sun that heats us up has a lifespan yeah where are their inventions as well the cats and the monkeys that Sam they invented being cute come in they're the real darling these parents in your lap you pet them they liked it they need to find contribute know they're contributing just a dog for a walk you come up with ideas you smelly that's a nice feeling good I do love my dog Pam um but hold on but my what was my what was my point there God well I think your paw society the brakes what you're saying is we should pump the brakes we should pump the brakes of this possession and this this idea that we're trying to accomplish these great things by accumulating things and status and it's all bullshit it's really about consciousness more than anything in fact Bill Hicks I think already said it when he said that you know that we we can be explore we can explore space in an hour together and peace not that that idea that if we look to our common drives it's like into that Hancock all the time I've heard him on your show saying like that you know that what really what's happened is a bias towards a particular aspect of our own consciousness being a problem-solving brain and like you know there's no that those drives are amazing you know those drugs they're trying to get somewhere technology is amazing we would like you to the very fact that people in bloody here as I don't understand any of it is fucking wonderful but the dominant idea behind it one of profit that dominating idea and like a nonprofit in itself is not necessarily negative but profit at all cost profit at any cost nothing so like really I'm not saying we should as a species fucking slow down and dressing Phil and fucking you know like ground vegetables and I'm funny now I want human beings to be glorious but what I'm saying is that our bias towards this one particular materialistic idea is preventing us from realizing that glory because part of our consciousness has been ignored
