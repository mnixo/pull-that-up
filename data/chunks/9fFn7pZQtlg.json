hello freak bitches but I also think like especially with these videos that have been coming up just women attacking and like Anthony get saying that woman said that he was gonna that woman who's got like if he called the police was going to say that he was raped she was raped or you know attacking her or whatever that's what he said that she said that when she was hitting him she was saying that she was gonna say that he sexually assaulted her right and by the way stay open Anthony thing that's going on yeah the open Anthony thing if you don't know our friends open Anthony Anthony ku Mia was in New York City and he was taking photographs and he got a photograph of a woman and this woman got very upset he took a photograph of her so some sort of an altercation took place some words were exchanged she started hitting him so she was hitting him it and if you don't know Anthony you don't know that he's a gun nut like a legit gun nut who actually has a license to concealed carry in New York City which is incredibly difficult to obtain but here's one strike for people who want people to have guns Anthony never pulled out that gun never I mean he obviously felt threatened he was getting hit by this one woman who Anthony's a nice guy but he is you know 51 years old loves his drinking and I don't think he lifts weights that much it's not like he's like big scary you know Quinton Jackson Rampage Jackson looking dude you know he's a he's a thin guy he's not a not a physically imposing guy and this chick is beating on him and he's got a gun on him I don't I wasn't there so obviously I don't know what the tone the situation was I don't know how it got started on I've read very little about it other than he went on this rampage calling her an animal and a cunt and all this difference but what's what's hilarious is everything that he said in his Twitter rampage that they're firing him for he said on the radio show and they hired him for the radio show if you paid attention to what he said over the years and why he's entertaining and how he says it he gets crazy see about racial situations he gets crazy about certain aspects of the african-american community and he's done it forever and so these things that he said after getting punched that they were surprising too serious who had heard him say these things and they gave them checks it's kind of hilarious and also like one of the things that people are pointing out all over all over the Twittersphere is they're showing all these lyrics to rap songs that serious has aired since Anthony got fired for tweeting and the lyrics are ridiculous I mean oh yeah dude it's hardcore rap they air hardcore rap lyrics so they've got you know nigga this and shoot suck my dick and dis bitch isn't that bitches you know the craziest most radical you know hip-hop shit and yet Anthony gets in trouble for this thing that he did where he went on this Twitter rampage and said a bunch of shit that he's I bet you could I bet if someone was a real Opie and Anthony fan you could probably go back through all the Opie and Anthony shows and piece together him actually saying those words that are in those tweet that series makes money off of races that's serious makes money off of well you know what man here's the thing I think what happens is that these companies get really terrified of the Twitter storm yeah they get like you saw that with uh well you see a lot of time with sponsors for Rush Limbaugh but you see it with or I believe conservative radio in general you see it with like Donald Trump had a I forget what it was a tie collection or some shit at Macy's then there were all these people on Twitter like tweeting the Macy's account like don't support him because I don't remember the issue was but they once it gets going the company feels overwhelmed and like you have to respond cuz a thousand people just retweeted this thing and they I think they just feel like the the best route is the 48 laws of power thing you just put a head on the chopping block and mmmm and think later oh I see their point of view I do if you but I don't think they were fans of the Opie and Anthony show that's what I think part of what's going on I don't think they listened I think you've learned a lot of people complaining it's like the money coming into good show it's a great show it's the reason why we're doing this show the reason why we're doing this show is because of Opie and Anthony a lot of ways there's a direct chain of influences one of them being Tom Green Tom Green had his own show in his house way back in the day and I remember going over there and be like this is the craziest shit ever he's got server room he's got a goddamn server room with cables all through his living room he turned his living room into a television show he just did a little too early he had a great innovative idea he did a little too early that influenced us Anthony Kamiya influenced me greatly when he did live at the compound he did he does this thing live at the compound where he set up a studio in his house in Long Island and in his in his basement he has a green screen and he'll fucking sing while he's holding guns too he's singing songs he's singing karaoke while he's holding assault rifles alright and that I don't know if they have a pager but that shit is hilarious and I saw him doing that while he was still on Opie and Anthony was doing it just for fun and I was like oh my god this is genius he set up a green screen he set up in a real like professional stage with a green screen behind the green screen he would have like video of Manhattan or he would have like like I was going to totally steal that idea I might still put a green screen behind me it for if we do get that tri-quarter cry TriCaster thing that would do it a in respect to Anthony it's a big part of what they do and the ethic of the Internet it seems to be like the social ethic seems to be evolving way quicker and way stronger than at any time that I can ever remember in in cultural history I never remember these like big movements shifts and how people talked and behaved in the words that were accepted in the words that weren't accepted and you know and just with just these giant trends that take place and just wash through culture they didn't they didn't move this quick before it's because we practice like thought mass correction which I'm not entirely convinced is a good thing yet I still haven't really decided if it's good or bad but if you look at that woman who took the flight from London to South Africa and tweeted out that insensitive shit about like you know like I hope I don't get AIDS when I land in Africa or something uh she'd finish it though she said just kidding I'm white yeah yeah so is even even worse so but they work better you mean yeah that's what made it funny before her flight landed in South Africa I think you've already lost her job and yep the global uproar so that person learned that this is not socially acceptable and then why did they learn that because the internet gave them that lesson well she should have been a comedian because that would been fucking hilarious you know if a really funny comedian said that like iliza shlesinger said that when she went to africa holy shit that'd be funny is it the wrong thing to say yes it most certainly is yeah but if you working women PR for some I think it was uh I don't want to say the company but just a big media company so you think she was on pills or something like why would she fucking sick I mean let it well how could a person look within corporate america think it's okay put some of your Twitter I have noticed kidding I'm not I'm white lol don't get AIDS I'm just kidding I'm white wow yeah that's crazy person it's funny though still funny it's a horrible thing to say yeah but the point is like crazy people are being called out they're still crazy but yeah we can call them out so you're gonna ruin a lot of good jokes you are a lot of jobs are people losing their jobs like Anthony just for going on yeah well you know the Anthony thing is it's particularly weird because that's sort of what he had been known for that like you guys had a show where it was like they were openly joking about racism all the time like the other day he had Amy Schumer on one of the best of shows it was from years ago and they were talking about interracial porn and Amy Schumer was fucking hilarious but she was saying that she she was so funny man it was really funny she's so sharp um she was saying that she's never fucked a black guy but she likes watching black on white porn and Anthony was talking about how sad it was and that his his racism won't let him watch it like his racism won't let him watch a black guy fucking a white girl wait there is a certain that is pretty racist if you do if you can't handle a black man fucking a white person that's curating that he's joking he's joking he is a comedian I think a lot of people forget it it's a comedy show that he's one of the funniest people I know that doesn't go on stage and yes it's a comic he's most certainly a comedian whether he goes on stage in front of a live audience or he goes do you think his rampage was meant to be funny though no that's the problem that's part of the problem that's not that's not done for entertainment or then you're not then your profession doesn't really matter see I'm my issue with all these things is that like many things in life they're not black and white you know this is not black and white I think Anthony's awesome I love that dude he's one of my favorite people on radio ever he's great he's just funny as shit he's smart it's fuck he knows a lot of things about different things he's very he's very interesting the way he looks at the world he says a lot of crazy shit about black people he does he has for a long time I don't know his personal experiences I don't know what he's around where he's formulated these ideas about certain black people but I also know that there's a lot of black friends Patrice and him were close you know he's a you know black comics that come on the show all the time that are friendly with him he's not a mean person he's not a bad guy if you're a nice person he'll be nice to you too that said I don't know what the fuck went down that night who knows yeah you know I mean he did get attacked which is crazy but he also at leading up to it also used to always talk about statistics about his city in New York and something that about how you know the the race issues with that and so I think that what he because he didn't when he went off he didn't really say all blacks are this you know he was kind of just talking about the person who attacked him and was a savage you know it was what he said yeah I called her a continent animal and all this different shit if it was a white chick and he called her an animal he would have been fine yeah and I would have called her the same exact words it's look it's all very tricky you know what I always say about when whenever you see a situation where two people get into a fight it's not always just one guy's fault sometimes it's both guys fault sometimes one a different person like if you talk to this guy it would have never turned into a violent altercation and maybe you would walked away shaking hands sorry man no worries dude and another guy talking to the same guy it might lead to a bloody fistfight and it's just a matter of how do you communicate with people who is this woman I've been I was in New York City with this chick that I was dating we were walking down the street and this girl was so nice she was so nice I mean she was next was it she wouldn't be mean to anyone ever no mean faces she'd have anything like that in her so we're walking in this black couple is walking in the same direction and the girl steps in between her and I and pushes this girl that I was with just push there move bitch just move bitch because you know we were walking this way and they were walking towards us and she just decided that that was her spot so Jesus elbowed this girl said move bitch and she pushed it aside and I am thinking we're about go to war I'm like we're about to go to war and I'm gonna knock out the girl first because I don't want to have to deal with her while I'm hitting out of the guy I'm like this is about to be a fight and then did that chick just turned with white bitches or something along the lines like that some white and walked away and kept going fortunately because it was like like and all of a sudden the crack but I was like that was like close to a fistfight for no reason you know and it just happened to be that that chick was black it just happened to be the girl that I was with was white and blonde but that happens there's black assholes out there just like there's white assholes out there there's Chinese assholes out there you know that doesn't make me racist that makes me scared of people that are assholes and they come in all forms bro I grew up in a Boston neighborhood Jamaica there was Jamaica Plain the place where I lived at before I moved to Newton which is all cushy and nice Jamaica Plain was filled with these Irish savages they were dangerous fucking kids these dangerous Irish kids and if you ran into him like they it didn't matter what race they were it's like who's was a savage these girls kids were savages didn't matter if they were white or Chinese you you walk down the wrong Street in Chinatown and you run into some crazy Chinese gang that wants to fuck you up you're not happy I mean it's not it's not it's not better that way there's all sorts of races every race contains savages every race contains assholes you know and the problem is when it's a black person it's getting attacked by a white guy you know you got to be real specific that it's that person that's a piece of shit and if some other people jumped in it's them that are pieces of shit it's not the whole town it's not all black people it's not you know it's just there's a certain type of person whether it's white or black or whatever that's a piece of shit you know and I don't know if it's this lady I don't know who knows what happen to her that that day you know who knows what happened to her who knows what's going on in her life and all the sudden this guy's taking pictures at her she wants to punch him in the face do you remember what time it was I I was I forgot to look to see actually what I made occur but I think it was around 2:00 to 3:00 a.m. when the Twitter happened uh but uh you know I understand he's if you looked at his photos on Instagram he was taking a lot of photos of the city a lot of photos of cops and construction workers and and stuff like that I get having a great camera that you're playing like New York's empty in your downtown and you're taking photo know a woman's walking in the distance yeah you're taking her cuz it's a Odle it's a it's cool but but but you know I don't know what happened here but what-what does seem to happen that he she did attack him and yeah he didn't have a police or a deal with the police no he doesn't call 9-1-1 cuz you feel like they wouldn't do anything right you know maybe he's right but I don't think the right way to handle it is going on Twitter and going fucking crazy and I mean I think that that's something that someone does when you just want to lash out and for him he likes to use social media to you know to get points across and that's a point though the black on white violence has been a point of interest of his for a long time you know and there there's a reality that it exists just like white on black violence exist just like all kinds of violence exist and Anthony is a guy who's particularly concerned with that it's one of the reasons why carries a gun right I mean he's a rare person that has a concealed carry permit in New York City he's one of them it's pretty hard he's got a big-ass fucking 90 minutes possibly so this chick is hitting him while he's armed with a deadly weapon and then five other people jump in apparently and the whole thing's chaos and I would have loved to for it to be avoided but I think serious lost the potential opportunity to engage in a discussion about this about violence in New York City about violence in general people interacting with each other about interacting on social media interacting when you're hot with fucking rage and you're just vent dinging and ranting and console manikanta animal and what is your actual intent and and what is my job as a representative of your SiriusXM am I am allowed to be Anthony or do I have to be Anthony that only thinks like siriusXM wants me to think it only tweets like Sirius XM once a tweet when are you clocked off work exactly now and wouldn't winner you know I'm not supporting them right in this I'm saying this is this is a very tricky situation where the company has to be real careful because part of what you do is you promote free speech and you you have a radio show and you have this network that's uncensored this now this was the coolest thing about Sirius would you get Howard Stern on it and he could swear it was the greatest thing of all time like from now on he's Unchained and Opie and Anthony are Unchained and comedy is Unchained you can watch you can hear all my bits it's totally uncensored they have them on Sirius it's beautiful so if all of a sudden you decide that you don't like what a guy says on Twitter so his opinions which are very similar that he's voiced on the radio very similar if not identical will now be silenced it gets a little squirrely the whole thing is a backlash it's a backlash to the the racism and or implied racism of his tweets you know look did I do I wish that he just went on the radio and explained himself in more than 140 characters yes because I bet he could have vented the exact same rage the next day with no Twitter thing and people would not have had a problem with it if he said it with his words if he explained what happened there's a real problem with fucking getting out anything super important where you don't want to have any mistakes and how you're being perceived with 140 characters you know you're saying cunt animal savage you know you know he's not talking he's writing a bunch of shit down so you mad that he's conveying those thoughts do you not think that he would have those thoughts off this chick hit him do you expect him to be you know angelic and his approach to violence like I don't know what you're looking for here because if it's just that you think that what he said is racist have you ever listened to that show because and listen that show he says shit like that all the time also if you have a job as a show host or a pundit you really need to be allowed to say what you want on your social media even if it kind of damages maybe Asian but no but but no because look if he said all Jews need to be thrown into an oven and pissed on while they're on fire no no well that right that's a little bit different so but but is it different because where does where does one draw the line what if he said that he's only joking it turns out he's actually Jewish is that okay I don't know nearly enough about him or the show so I really don't know I think it's the same thing I think when when you say something absolutely totally awful like that like all Jews you be like you can't be associated with my company right like that's not a serious person at that point it's a crazy person and it's a dangerous person too because who knows what percentage of the populations listening that's unhinged right it's been waiting for a guy like you to come along but he didn't do that you know what he did is respond to a person who attacked him and then talk in very racial terms about the scenario and he has in the past on the radio show about what it's like to worry about black violence on white people yeah and and that's what that like The Young Turks thing I saw I don't know if you saw that or not but that was a problem a racist I was one of the worst things I've ever seen I lost I'm sorry all respect for them just based off of that one interview because it was completely you can know that they don't know the backstory they don't know they don't listen to the show but it's an interesting thing though isn't it when you're looking at someone who doesn't know Anthony doesn't know the show doesn't know the backstory and is responding to just deciding everything right there you know that he's perving that he's taking a picture of this woman come industry not knowing about all those other pictures that he had taken and that he is an amateur photographer he loves taking pictures and a candid photo of a woman walking down a street she's pretty and she had long legs and said nice body look good you know for 3:00 in the morning dressed up let's treat yeah absolutely street meat how dear but but they jumped on him unfairly and that's like that was like Fox News it was all wait aren't you supposed to be the opposite of this no I don't think it was like Fox News I think it was like they perceived that what his world I'm telling you there's a fucking real problem with saying something like that at 140 characters it's stupid like I've said some dumb shit on Twitter before I've had people write full blogs on like one tweet that I had there was like a joke just a joke tweet I get that I I get that you could decide that you know you have a green light to write something we did 140 characters doesn't work it doesn't work for anything important if you really had a situation where you thought your life is in danger or you thought you know you were you know you were going to go unconscious you're going to lose your eyesight like apparently had like spots on his eyes wouldn't you want to hear that like the full version of it I think if Anthony just would tell the full version of it on the air and avoid the tweets notice would have happened he would have been able to express himself the exact same way that fucking cunt animal he would have been able to say whatever he wanted he would have been able to talk in depth about black-on-white violence which I'm not saying that's all that exists there's plenty of white on black violence there's plenty I'm saying that it exists I mean to pretend it doesn't exist is pretty silly to me to pretend there's not black people that will hit white people and rob them just like to pretend is not white people who will hit black people and rob them of course it exists yeah racism exists violent racism from random people on both sides can and does exist so is he right in saying that it exists from then or what do you have to qualify it first by saying that there's a lot of piece-of-shit white people out there as well I don't know you know I don't know but in my opinion what what they're doing is silly this is a quote from Penn Jillette today yeah Penn says this if I'm in a position where I cross somebody who's carrying a gun and confined themselves and hurt me and their choice is to write angry stuff on Twitter instead of fighting me back wonderful Gandhi that's Gandhi yeah I don't agree with that I think just because you have a gun that doesn't make you any more special and like well I didn't use my gun it's like that shouldn't even be on the table in the first place well it certainly should be on the table if someone's trying to take your life what's the difference between someone punishing you with their knuckles and someone beating you to death have a much of a background do you have in violence have you ever seen someone getting knocked unconscious in a street fight uh actually yeah but on YouTube I've seen in real life yeah I've seen in real life a few times and it's terrifying I saw in real life once in Hollywood there was a moment in front of the comedy store we're all hanging out it was after a show and this guy and this other guy got in this argument and there was traffic going by and they're right in front of the House of Blues which is directly across the street from the comedy store and in the middle of this argument there's back and forth and it's a white guy and a black guy and you see them start to like swing at each other and the white guy goes into a full panic all I remember is this guy like standing like wincing his eyes and flailing with his hands like literally had just in full panic and this black eyes I see him hit him and I see cars go in front of it and I don't know what happened I just I know that they're they're hitting each other because the white guy was flailing but I don't see the connection and then the car goes back you know the car passes and the guy's flat out cold on the concrete just in serious trouble he's in the street there's cars going by he's in a fight with a guy and he's completely unconscious and everybody screaming his cars honking this guy's out cold on the street that guy could die easy and again we tell you something a woman can do that to you just like a man can do that to you if you don't think that there's women out there that can punch you in the face and knock you unconscious because you've never been punched by a woman there's a lot of women that can punch really fucking hard I you know this see these snacks my friend Miriam Miriam Nakamoto she's eight-time world muy Thai champion she beat a man in a kickboxing bout she's beautiful she's nice person she makes snacks now though that chick punches you in the face your fucks ville you know like for real like a regular guy who doesn't know how to fight she'll beat the fucking breaks off you it's not not good so he doesn't know anything about this girl if the girl starts teeing off on him with left and rights and she's got like precision punching guess what you're going to go unconscious yeah so should you applaud him for not pulling out his gun yeah yeah you shouldn't pull out a gun in that situation and he did the right thing so that I agree with him yeah this one goes far saying that he is uh Gandhi like that's i joking yeah I know he's my son it's written see what it's written you get all fucked up you get all fucked up even you the regular person yeah of course is gonna get close it's impossible to tell sarcasm like I I thought that he was serious because he's a pretty serious guy guy realizes I realize he does a show in Vegas and shit he's serious he's a lot of serious ideas he is serious I mean he's joking about that by saying he's Gandhi right yeah but its premise is serious the premise is absolutely serious it's true is there any way to see a security video of how this went down good question good question given how I mean serious is a big company big implications to drop one of your biggest hosts so well the outrage was all over online you know I mean people went crazy about it there's there's petitions right now they're up to like I think last I saw was 15,000 you know there's the cancel once canceling it they have to be be getting hurt by this because honestly Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony that's pretty much you know fueling that channel I I would imagine that do you know that for sure cuz I don't know what they make their money off I have no idea I would just be guessing well I would imagine that Opie and Anthony is definitely a huge pie what's a great chai there it's a great show and by the way if it was on the internet it would still be awesome if they just switch to the Internet it'd be huge I mean might be a great opportunity for them if they cancel Anthony if they fire Anthony does Opie still under contract I mean how does that work there is what Opie said today is that him and Jim will be back on Monday next Monday one said they might have they might be making it the Opie and Jim show just based on contracts but what's interesting is is leading up to this is how much Opie has been talking about that he's done he's not going to sign a contract he does he wants to do a podcast he's done and it this whole timing of this is very interesting because sometimes on the universe yeah it's very interesting very very interesting yeah wonder man I hope they do a podcast look the shows awesome it's funny show to watch little Jimmy's the funniest guy ever on radio Jim Norton is my favorite guy ever of all time on radio no question about it consistently comes with the funny he's hilarious and he's smart he's well thought out he's an interesting dude he's honest I really loved Joey I think he's a hilarious comedian too he's so fun plus he makes me feel I don't feel like much of a pro wrestler I hang out with him like I thought my act had too many dick jokes then I went to see him and I even told him that I go dude I had the best time and you freed me in a lot of ways because sometimes I go man I got so many dick jokes why I keep writing dick jokes his whole act was dick jokes from beginning to end and I loved it it was awesome I saw him at Cobbs Cobbs comedy club in Austin Nutt cops cap city cap city comedy club in Austin Anthony's starting is a compound show this week though so that's going to be interesting to see I don't know how if he has a lawyer if he said you know he was gonna lawyer up nine if but what if he can talk about and why he can't talk about you know it's gonna be interesting well I'm pretty sure he could probably talk about the incident daddy could talk about no one can keep you from talking about a person attacking you mm-hmm how could they keep you from doing that any person that could keep you from doing that it's not a person want to be associated with they fire you for that good imagine someone keeping you from talking about you being attacked like your own personal experience how he expresses himself is entirely up to him I think we'll probably get a more balanced view of it now than when it happened you know I think he's probably going to take into consideration all the the heat and the bullshit and the time that's elapsed and the motions that have relaxed and the tension that's relaxed the sting of the punches and he'll be able to look at it and give you a funny assessment of it but the the show just be better if they go on the Internet they could do whatever they want under times you don't need anybody anymore I can move just don't yeah they could move anywhere they want you don't need anybody anymore it's it's silly it's like the amount of people that don't have iPods or iPhones or can't get their phone to stream through their radio it's common almost everybody now it's really close you know I mean especially if you're commuting if you're getting on subways and shit like that it's actually better than having some sort of a satellite that sends it to you and you can get it whenever you want you could pause it you could listen whenever you want it's just a better me you know and the dome you're on have three cars that have a Sirius satellite radio I love it it's great I love the fact that I could flip through the shit and listen to new music I love that I can get on the classic vinyl station and listen to all classic rock because I'm old as fuck I'm old as fuck and I reminisce listen to some Bob Seger I like it I like Sirius I'll keep it as a product but man you got to realize what you're selling [Music]
