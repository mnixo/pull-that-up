struggle alright ladies and gentlemen we're live the president's now blinds been staring at the Sun all day trying to see the eclipse there's photos of it Mike Baker help us out what are we doing man well I've died yeah that's probably again it's it's it's an indication that they don't have a lot of discipline in that communications department of the White House no one got him the message don't sir sir don't don't look at the Sun not only that definitely don't look at the Sun while people are looking at you yeah Jesus Christ the whole world is gonna mock you don't you know that everybody knows this since they were a kid right even even if you've never been involved in an eclipse every kid knows don't look at the Sun it's the one thing that every child learns somehow you know what I try to do though I'm a fucking idiot I took two dark sunglasses I put it looks good it does look good I only looked for a second No okay this doesn't work but you know where I could look at it I can look at it through my pool like the reflection oh sure see the Eclipse yeah but it never really got fully dark here you know we're too low yeah we I just came down from from Idaho I was up there in the mountains over the past few days and it would just it did just hippies coming in from left and right and the entire state just overrun with hippies and they're I mean they're parking in people's you know ranches they're just driving up on fields that have just been planted it's like they don't even think and so they but they came out yeah you don't hate yeah god bless him I don't know that I was intellectually curious enough to really you know worry about the Eclipse there's a balance and you know what I think a lot of intellectual curiosity is great and a lot of hippy values are great but then you go too far into the hippie retard gene pool and you get these dopey hippies that are hippies that you know they're the worst kind of hippies the hippies that don't really want to do any work but they want universal basic income and want all these hey man these one-percenters they have plenty of money so the neuen should have to work here they just passed it they passed attacks up in Seattle it's gonna probably gonna get struck down but it basically what's up and Seattle will god bless him up there they they've decided that they're gonna go against the state charter which says you can't have a tax and income tax and they've gone ahead and done it for the I think it's for the top two percent only tax them only tax there we talked to people were doing something right because you know you got to make this thing more equitable that's hilarious yeah that's really funny well what's interesting is that's the whole reason why a lot of companies like Amazon and Microsoft it's the reason why they've located two Seattle you fucking dummies and they're gonna pull out and then you wanna made jobs and then you be poor but you know somebody's gonna pay for that yeah we came from we moved out from Fairfield County from New Canaan Connecticut when we moved out to Idaho which was the world's greatest move it sucks I said over and over again docks and yeah I mean but they know it right you betta kid know it and then people but you live in a sucky spot and and they their plan the the plan of the governor and the rest of the crew there is when you need more money tax Fairfield County right which is home to New Canaan and Greenwich and Darien and Wrigley Stanford the people that work in the city or the people that are working in finance and now what they what they've had over the past three four years on ever since the governor has been running this shop is people moving out I mean ever a GE moved out General Electric the entire operation with General Electric said went to the state and said I know people think of why are we talking about this but they went to the Statehouse they said you can't keep doing this you can't keep jacking it up on us to pay for everything we're happy to pay and we are pairing our fair share but so they did that general like I said we're going to move the state didn't believe them they've all relocated to Boston they've got who else is moving to Aetna I think the the large insurance company you know now Connecticut's known as sort of the insurance capital right they're leaving hedge funds private equity groups moving down the Florida and again great pay your fair share but at a certain point everybody's got to contribute something you can't just say that's what you're gonna do and I'm not in the 1% I wish I was it used to be when you were a kid you wanted to be rich right now you know I don't know what people want you want to be in the middle you want to be comfortable yeah that's what you want to be comfortable I don't know I I always thought it'd be pretty cool to be wealthy you know and I think I'd be pretty good at it my friend Bryan Callen said it best once and it stuck with me forever he said you know what you want to be you know you want to be to the point where you don't have to worry about your bills and you can go to a restaurant and not worry about what you order he goes everything other than that is bullshit yeah because everybody know and that's that's a good point I guess because that's you take that stress out of your life yeah and then I get well I guess you're gonna worry about some people find it yes just dress a little fine stress right I mean like look at these assholes if by these five hundred million dollar yachts it's like they just realize like enough problems in my life I need to buy a fucking floating city and I got it I got a higher a crew of 100 gonna get in line bosun's mate finished Alison's made I know I came up with bows and is that a real thing I think it is yeah I think there was such thing as a bosun's mate just always like this like a band flow right I mean the people that have accumulated too much wealth especially when it comes to like hedge fund people and Finance people's like what are you actually doing right and you're using that money to influence policy and that policy allows you to extract more money from the system and it gets real slippery because occasionally you guys fuck up and he crashes the whole economy right like that kind of money is like very creepy but we're talking about someone who's developed a legitimate product they sell it and they're successful that work hard they've made something business exactly yeah yeah the hiring people there ya know there's a balance for sale up in the Hamptons now there's a house for a hundred and seventy five million dollars seems logical yeah 175 million dollars but you know what it's on the beach so it's on it's got waterfront to it so I guess that explains the price tag but here's the thing about that water fund anybody can walk in front of your house yeah that's true that's a huge problem in Malibu there's this a couple of month I'm friends with and their sons surf and they live in Malibu they have a house in Malibu and they were surfing in the water in front of this house this guy comes out and yells and screams at them you know get fuck off the beach cuz you know he's a 10 million dollar house right there on the beach and they're like what are you talking about like we live right over there you piece of shit yeah and like not only that anybody can be on this beach this is the ocean you can't yeah you don't own the we don't see any private beach signs up and for the most part that's true up and the hams I think this actually has some private beach frontage which again so 175 million seems somewhat reasonable Hamptons most expensive home there it is right there he's got a lake he's got a lake and then further past the lake Wow they all have lakes yeah what is that is that freshwater or brackish water that must be brackish water right I guess I guess I'd be pretty badass don't a fish in your front yard like that I wonder if their kitchen appliances convey how big is this house yeah is that wait a minute that overhead view was the entire property mm-hmm baller you know what though the thing look at that picture though does that look like a hundred and seventy five million dollars in your mind I mean you think the whole fucking thing should be plated in gold 42 acres Wow okay there you go that's what that's what it is yeah oh the Ford family Oh Oh is the car company yeah so hashtag ballin on Mustangs if you get I think you're right if you get to that point where you can entertain the idea of maybe I'll put 10% down and then I'll take the rest of the mortgage then yeah you've probably got too much money it reminds me of that scene in The Big Lebowski when you meet the other Lebowski and he's in the wheelchair and his wife's offering to suck dudes dicks for a thousand bucks you know it's like that's the kind of shit that happens you get a trophy wife you buy yourself a mansion and your days are just filled with stress it's such a great movie it's a great movie I used to use that movie to judge whether or not I enjoyed people's opinions it's stupid I didn't get it okay I talked to a lot of people they said I couldn't make it through the first hour right this funny jeez I let my kids watch it I mean admittedly the two youngest walked away but the older one hey you know so anyway I've taken him fishing tomorrow morning we're off to Alaska in the morning Oh Sam how about salmon nice and what if the salmon aren't you know interested in us we'll go after some halibut this is a silver salmon season right now right okay you're on open water well we go yeah well go up to catch again which is a really interesting place by itself and then we've got to take a plane out of there about about 45 minutes outside it up to a little place called yes Bay and they have a really good operation up there and you you spent a lot of time and to be honest with you if the fish aren't you know bite and then we just go hiking I'm gonna take my boy this would be the first time for him to go up there and it's gonna be great it's got but I've just now emptied the freezer of salmon and halibut and rockfish from the last trip so it's time to stock up again but it's just a great time of year isn't that a great thing to have fish that you caught in your freezer they can go back to you know was only like an hour old by the time you threw it on the ice yeah it's it's fantastic and so if and just also just getting up there people haven't been up to Alaska get up there and see it before it melts I think it's impressive it'll be fine are you worried about it you know what not in the sense that oh my god if I if I don't quit driving my Wagoneer glaciers are gonna you know all melt away I you know I'm sure we have some impact it's like everything else right it the truth is in the middle somewhere right right so I'm sure we should all do our part but do I think we're all gonna you know the polar bears are dying off tomorrow I know but yeah well there's definitely with their ideas yeah there's definitely some issues with polar bears and areas that have less ice but apparently the polar bear population that this is something that I read about Canada at least in Canada the polar bear population is higher than it's been in years now there's there's not a shortage of polar bears but if you go over there to like they have hunts for polar bears like they pay people to take them on polar bear hunts but then you can't bring the polar bear back to the United States so you can keep it in Canada you can like if you come from Europe and you want to hunt a polar bear again it's all very but you're imagine try to pack a polar bear back into the States no I just shot that you don't really you can see fit with the reaction would be I you know I think it's yeah everybody should do their part right there's no doubt about that you know don't be a douche and and and but the problem is in part it's like both sides they latch on to one piece of information right so like what you just said you know the polar bear privatized to grow so you know that one side will latch on and say see there's no such thing as climate change and the other side will find one piece of him and they'll latch on to that and then okay and like I said I'm a big believer that somewhere in the middle is where most of the truth sits but I'm sure and there's definitely polar bear problems higher north right in the ice caps and I mean I've seen some some issues where they're talking about polar bear starving up there and the lack of ice contributing to starvation deaths and yeah so i but it's it's regardless so i'm looking forward to a last guy I think it's happens to the polar bears I'm gonna have a good trip but I think it's it's a beautiful state people should get up there they haven't been up there it's amazing yeah it's one of the rare places that you could go to in America that is like real wilderness yeah that is a really wild place and you can get yeah exactly and it doesn't take it doesn't take much to get up there how many money I just mean it doesn't it's not the effort that people I think sometimes imagine it's a bear and yeah so it's it's uh it's it's a great trip kids really looking forward to it and it's weird that it's the United States yeah you think about how it was put together that's a fascinating story i what that's worth people that's another good interesting read is how we cobbled this country together and sort of some of it was you know just incredible genius on the part of some folks some of it was serendipity some of it was you know short-sighted vision on the part of the Russians or the you know the French here well they fucked up with rut with Alaska the Russians fucked up yeah would they give that us like 50 bucks it wasn't much money it wasn't much no we got it I guess we got our money's worth out of that by now yeah but anyway so yeah would do that and and and and it I planned this trip of course their school starts tomorrow there were there all three of them are in elementary school so their school starts tomorrow and and I gave my kid the option I said do you want to you know he starts in fifth grade I said do you do you want to stay here so you don't miss the first few days of school and he looked at me like what are you crazy exactly idiot I mean that's I was whether it's what as I said he didn't say that how old is he he's just turned 10 he's gonna learn more in the woods absolutely absolutely for a couple of days yeah have a good time have a wonderful experience and the kindest least because of course the Grizzlies are out looking for the salmon I mean and it's a it's just fantastic they say you know they say that's the safest time to be around them yes when there's salmon out yeah they're just fat and happy they're in there don't bother you yeah and so you know now if something happens to my 10 year old then my wife said it's gonna be my fault it's on my head and I can't blame her and that would be true but do you pack when you're out there you packing the sidearm no no we don't because we're when we go up there and we're going up with what about it does another guys and they die and they do with the lodge does stay in a small little sort it's not you know I say Lodge it's a wonderful place family-owned it's it's not a fancy place at all but it's a great little spot and they do a great job the guides are fantastic so we'll have a good time but yeah we don't we don't take anything with us I mean it's just yeah long as the people up there I mean you probably won't need anything known as the the Bears have fish yeah yeah they really have no there's an area that we've shown this video before of this enormous grizzly that gets right next to this guy who's sitting there photographing these bears eating fish out of the river and the bear literally couldn't give a fuck yeah them just looks at them and just sort of wanders off and there's actually a statistic that no one has ever died in this area no no person has ever been attacked or killed in this one area just because it's just overrun with so preoccupied this time yeah but it's also you know you talk about how things change around the planet and and the salmon runs are you know really being impacted right now by a variety of reasons you know it's not just one thing but so anyway but that'll be that'll be good and I know that everybody was really keen to hear about my upcoming trip well you know I mean it is interesting to hear people's take on the climate issue because there's hard left and hard right hard right is it's a cycle it's always having this way in your your impeding business hard left is we're all going to die yeah and then Miami's gonna drown I mean an Al Gore had already predicted in that movie An Inconvenient Truth that we were gonna be covered in water in 2014 right wasn't it 2014 they were predicting that the ocean levels are gonna rise the point where we're gonna have to start evacuating some of the coastal cities that's right he missed that one just by a little bit yeah yeah but you came out with another movie 12 people so more Inconvenient Truth yeah and nobody's nobody I watched it I don't think but did you see Bill Nye when he was on Tucker Carlson show no it was very interesting very interesting cuz Bill Nye who's not really a scientist what is he he's he uh he's in it and she's in the engine the engineer that yeah it pays to have to be smart player he calls himself Bill Nye the Science Guy he's bothered by the way as an undergrad degree son even though I got one of those and they were they were talking about climate change and Tucker Carlson said I'm willing to absolutely believe that people have an impact on climate change he goes but can you tell me how much and then Bill Nye kind of got flustered and you know he he got like a little confrontational defensive is really kind of interesting because Tucker kept pestering Emily we're talking about science so I would like you to tell me how much of an impact people had what are the numbers is it a narrow range cuz you give me a narrow range it's just what he does is he publicized his science for his own personal benefit here's that terrible show on Netflix Bill Nye saves the world bitch bitch you're not saving shit yeah okay you can't call your show Bill Nye saves the fucking world you're not saving the world with this crazy goddamn song about gender and yes you see my god you see that that was that was stunning yeah who the fuck greenlit down like I love Netflix but hey the little quality controls not a bad thing let's have somebody on set to go what in the fuck is this is like a sensor like in the movie good morning Vietnam you know somebody that sits there and reads through his material before he does it no I saw that now that you know clearly they don't have anybody who has too his content that just shows you where his minds at that he's willing to say yes to that that's someone who wants to act we ask with no uncertain terms to the left yeah like he just wants to every meanwhile he had a film out a movie or a television show out years ago or he's describing gender and he was basically saying there's two genders and it's about X and Y chromosome I mean which is what everybody's been told in science and biology class then he has this show just a few years later where thou the tide has turned politically where this is such a weird subject about gender and sexual identity and gender identity and so he's got these songs about you know like what that lady's singing that song like hey this is fucking terrible like what all you're doing it's just like the same thing is president Trump staring at the Sun yeah all you're doing is setting yourself up for ruthless criticism that's gonna diminish any potential legitimate point that you actually have but I will say this I don't think he really got pilloried for it right I mean nobody really I me there was some there is some I'm yeah I think some people make fun of him but I think Bill Nye for the most part he knows it's a very comfortable place for him to do or for a lot of people if they say look I just want to get the adulation of the the left of the far left yeah then fine I mean that's what you want to do do it but you see people that kind of shift their position and are happy to be there because they know they're gonna be coddled and I say I get why he does it because it's a base of it's an audience that he knows is gonna stick with him as long as he says the right things yeah and apparently he doesn't really give a shit about science so he's happy to say anything well I think he does give a shit about science but I think he gives you shit more about people liking him and fitting in like this crowd of people there's a weird things going on in science and there's nothing science is fantastic it's yes it's critical for our civilization I'm not a science criticized ER but there's a weird thing about people that are a part of science with their own egos and their own need for positive affirmation sort of supersede any critical thinking so there's certain subjects that cannot be discussed there's certain things that like they're they're almost like it's almost like science legend you know so there's certain subjects that aren't even open to scrutiny well I think it's right and I think part of it is is also we have gotten to a point where you can't not know how you you walk it back but you you you can't have conflicting ideas in the same statement of the same sense and an idea if things conflict all the time right and then and you can have truths that that collide with each other and don't it don't necessarily make sense so but it seems as if now everything has to be an absolute right and whether it's climate change so you can't say you you know if you if you just have this middle-of-the-road you know discussion where you say well look of course you know humans I'm sure have some impact I don't know this and then and you know this is a problem and we do have to do our part we do have to work to to try to be the best we can be but that's not good enough you've got a you you've got to be a you know sort of totalitarian about the whole issue and it's not just that it's any argument it just seems as if and it's not just the Millennials I'm not wanting to you know beat on you know the young kids or the generation of whatever we want to call them nowadays because I know a lot of good kids that are out there that are working hard or they're in the military and it's a fantastic you know group of folks so I think we're just fine in that regard but there does seem to be something about each successive generation and we've gotten a to a point where people have a hard time processing this dissenting opinion idea and that starts to shut down debate and it starts to shut down the idea that you can have a discussion about science where you have you know these conflicting ideas and how do you how do you resolve them that used to be the whole concept about Sciences that test theories and congruent with what works and anyway I think it's because we're attaching egos and personalities and virtue signaling to the actual hard data itself but here's here's the thing that we should all be concerned with pollution we should all be concerned with human waste we should all be concerned with the damage that we're doing to our water the damage that we're doing to the environment the the there's a host of different things that human beings are involved in that are creating irreparable harm to the environment we should absolutely be concerned with that but what's weird is that you hardly ever here about that you hardly ever hear about doing something to curb the plastic in the ocean doing something to eliminate that some of the sewage waste that goes into the ocean doing the oh there's a ton of different things that we're doing that are huge issues but instead you hear about climate change and it becomes this ideological left versus right battle which is it's just very weird to me and I understand that climate change is a real issue and if the ocean water continues to rise coastal cities really are fucked and if the temperature does rise we really might have to migrate to more and you know better climates but there's a lot of other shit going on it seems to get ignored during this process they just say I mean I you know I'd love to remember when plastics that was an issue right plastic bags or or you know keeping the oceans clean or you know don't be a little bug I mean it was more of a it was things that you could accomplish right it was things that you could do the community could do so you would have this community drive to pick up trash or to not use plastic bags or to yeah whatever it is and it was stuff that you could do and you could see some results and it you felt good about it and you know who knows maybe we've gone past that now and so now that's not good enough because you know now we've got to save the planet well you save the planet these little steps at a time right if every community says well you know I'm sorry I can't do anything about the polar bears so fuck it I'm just gonna worry about myself but if you if you bring it back down to those little things like you would you know maybe implying then I think we're better off you know right and eventually you you do make a difference but if all you do is talk about climate change and save the planet people just get overwhelmed it's like a lot of other things in life and you just think fuck it I'm just gonna focus on other shit but it's just so strange that climate change has become this weird ideological debate between the left and the right and is it when it comes to plastic there's a solution that's been around for years for plastic there's biodegradable hemp plastic it's existed for a long time if they just legalize hemp farming nationwide federally let people grow hemp in mass quantities you could turn that into plastic you would never have to worry about water bottles again you never have to worry about garbage bags you would never have to wear anything because it's all be plant-based plastic which is real biodegradable you put it in the ground and becomes dirt nothing so much that what's the what's the holdup well federally hemp has been legal since the nineteen thirties that's what it is I mean and all that goes back to William Randolph Hearst conning people into making it illegal so he didn't have to switch over his paper mills that son of a bitch yeah Hearst that's right I forgot you know yeah Wow amazing him and Harry Anslinger and you know what they did is they organized an actual campaign against hemp as a commodity by demonizing this thing that they called marijuana which didn't even it wasn't even the name of cannabis at the time the marijuana was a name for a wild Mexican tobacco they applied that name to cannabis to say that there's this new drug that's making Mexicans and blacks rape white women and they you know he was a piece of shit that William Randolph Hearst yeah and he printed all these articles and his papers and they made reefer madness and all that stuff all those movies that they made back in the day have you ever seen reefer madness oh it's wonderful it makes me want to huh yeah and then and then of course they made Citizen Kane that turned Hearst into a household name and and you know relatively benign character the Orson Welles yeah I wonder what he did Orson Welles he wasn't fucked for them a little bit don't you think yeah yeah yeah interesting movie come out Citizen Kane came out in long yeah now people are like why are they talking I want to say it was the 50s oh it's earlier than that I think wasn't yeah yeah was it nineteen forty one forty no RKO Pictures it's a great movie yeah still to this day I watched an airplane couldn't lose I was on an airplane not too long ago and I was looking through the movie singer am I gonna watch anything or am I gonna and Susan Cain was on I couldn't which was a strange it was right there in the middle of all these two typical Marvel and DC Comics movies that you would expect on a plane that's odd so I started watching it and the the dude next to me in the seat next to me kind of starts you can tell when someone's watching your screen right right you know over there finally attachment show he says what are you watching and he was you know not he was probably a couple years younger than me but not much and I said I watched Citizen Kane never heard of it you know never heard of it I which I guess no big deal I'm fine but you know Jerry Lewis died and people probably saying who's that he's like probably one of those dudes the gym it talks too much yeah he's one of those guys it comes up to you while you're benching hey question am I doing this right yeah or even worse to go you should drop your shoulder a little bit with all those fucking guys because what you'll do is you'll stress that and then they'll be better for you and you okay think of those guys they use big words try to convince you they know what they're talking about so speaking of Citizen Kane Orson Welles and conspiracies last night I rewatched the episode of Geraldo Rivera's good night America when they introduced the Zapruder because you know dick don't we just died yeah yeah yeah they introduced this a pruder film to the American public 13 years or 12 years 12 years after Kennedy's assassination and then I went and read that paper the articles that was printed a couple of weeks ago that you even tweeted about it about the CIA questioning the official story of the JFK assassination yeah that was interesting wasn't it yeah the CIA guy what do you think about that well first of all that's a pruder film that's the most watched piece of film in history of film has a room which is really interesting but yeah it was interesting that the you know as typical with a lot of these things that the headline doesn't necessarily actually match once you get into the body of the story but the idea being that the agency had some concerns over the idea that perhaps Cuba was behind the assassination or the Russians to some degree or some more likely in a combination of the two look I think you know I do I think that that he could have taken that shot yeah it was not yeah it was not I said I've been up in that book depository from that point of that vantage point we did a story on the on the whole issue the conspiracy theory and and what could have happened then we tried to find some new witnesses and you know could he have made that shot that was a that was it was it straight forward you know effort was someone who had some training he was you know he wasn't the world's best shot but he had sufficient training to make that shot no that's separate from you know his motivations and any potential support that he may have gotten during the course of that and you know I think that he in his mind he he genuinely felt that this was going to get him into the revolution right that this was gonna he had a very unhappy experience in Russia when he was over there living came back saw what was happening in Cuba desperately wanted to be part of that took a unexplained trip down in Mexico which could well have been in an effort to find somebody who could support his his desire to take some sort of action whether he had formed in his mind that's what he was going to do at the time or not so you know is there still a possibility that the Cubans which were the Intel service there would have had the file on him he was a very very well known quantity obviously by that time for the Russians the Russians were solely responsible for training up the Cuban Intel service so there's a massive file on him and they knew you know who they were dealing with they knew his weaknesses they knew his they knew his motivations they knew what to do in terms of trying to get leverageable you know information on him so I think that the jury's still out I'm not and I'm not a conspiracy guy but I think there's enough there that says you know yes it's kind of like what we're talking about climate change I believe this but this is all this also could be true right I think he could have taken that shot and for sure and and and and succeeded I think it's also possible that he may have had the encouragement of in particular the Cuban Intel service through the Russians there because at that time in particular they didn't do anything the Cubans didn't do anything without the Russians support blessings and direction so that is entirely possible do I think that there were a variety of other things at play you know was did they help him get the the weapon did they I mean you know was there actual logistical support in there I don't know I don't think so but maybe I maybe yeah it's it's it's a fascinating thing and you know again nobody wants to think that's something that impactful could have been just one guy who you know had a dream about being a hero of the revolution they just it's it's such an awful thing to think about you want something bigger you want something more behind it and it's it's I will say the one thing that I think there was something else too was the MLK issue of Martin Luther King assassination well let's get to that for sure but here's the thing about the the Lee Harvey Oswald assassination you know a lot of people think that there was people in the grassy knoll and that they shot at the president there was more than one shooter and that's possible too and here's the other problem with people saying that Oswald could have never made that shot of course he could have a hundred percent he could have is it likely listen people throw three-point shots that have no fucking business on a basketball court and they hit nothing but net now if it happens all the time yeah it doesn't mean it's it's not likely that a guy could get off three shots that quick but it is possible there was more time in there than they originally thought there's been there's some misinformation out there about how condensed that time frame was and now after they've you know they've researched us into a fairly well it did that time frame extended a little bit but he had more importantly he he worked up there so he had the opportunity directly that sight right so he it was like he was sitting in a blind waiting and figuring out you know what am I gonna be doing here and that's a tremendous advantage and a clear daylight targets moving right in a line with you there's no wind not only that it's not that far a shot no it's not it's not like everybody thinks it's like you know half mile away or something like that I mean how far was it it was a hundred fifty yards or something like that yeah I'd have to go back in its but find out I've stood on that spot where the limo was I have on the side stood up there and down and it's not that far and it's a total makeable shot on a deer yeah look if you were gonna shoot a deer rifle you'd be like oh yeah that's definitely a matter fact of range yeah notice there was no kuffar as there we go 265 feet 81 meters that mean shit yeah that's a bow shot yeah you could shoot a with a bow from 80 meters if you're really good and there's no wind so that's a really close shot so the idea that he couldn't make that shot he's a bad shot that is so fucking stupid he absolutely could make that shot and that way nobody could make that shot from 81 meters that's nothing we looked at the grassy knoll issue we looked at the you know that what what the the train yard engineer reported seeing with a sort of a puff of smoke that he thought he saw over by the fence line and and we're looking yeah you could you know from that position they opened that place up we were able to go back up there and you could see it we ran a couple of tests and fired a few shots and that's always fun if you want to have a good time take a rifle to Dealey Plaza and fire off a few shots without the tourists knowing what the hell is happening and the Dallas police by the way we're tremendous during the course of that but when we did this a while back for a show called America Declassified which isn't running anymore but it was on on Travel Channel Jesse Ventura did that he went up there and with a mannlicher-carcano same rifle and I was like first an impossible shot no one could make the shot everything conspiracy right I know he's significantly on that side to the point where you know that's he's leaning always towards a conspiracy what you want to do is you want to do every investigation this company that I've got we we do a lot of investigations we'd and you've got a bill just like with a homicide case or anything else you've got to build it on stable ground right right so you have to start from you know the very basics because if you start building ideas and investigative inquiries on something that's not sturdy underneath it you know not based on evidence in fact then you got a problem the whole thing becomes suspect and usually comes toppling down so you know I you got to keep an open mind about all these things and I think it's important right now people look like oh well I'm sure that agency the CIA was involved so I'm a terrible source of information I've heard that before I say you can't talk credibly about this because you know the CIA was involved nothing but here's the thing if the CIA was involved it's not you weren't there and that was 62 last time I checked that was not there in 1962 and and also I will tell you this much or is it 63 it was 60 63 if the age if the agency had been involved this is the honest to god it's true there's no way that secret is still kept people can't keep their Yap shut they can't and secrets have a way of coming out and certainly a lot quicker now than they used to so now the idea but the secrets then I mean we're talking about so long ago how much yeah I'm talking about more than 50 years ago it's like you know it's like get out it's like the DB cooper issue my biggest reason for believing TB Cooper died and his chute is hanging off a tree and that's a vast wilderness up there yeah is is that people just they can't help themselves at some point people talk or somebody somebody associated with or someone nearby or somebody involved or somebody on their deathbed or somebody says something they shouldn't know it's you know the idea that they've maintained this sort of secret over a period time I find hard to believe I'm not discounting it and again you've got to leave a little space open for something that could be just amazing mm-hmm but you know anyway so that's that was that but I I agree that shot was not was not a tough shot hey one meters ain't shit that's nothing and particularly those conditions and I will say those conditions were ideal unfortunately for that event people are like there's a video of me shooting a fucking hard drive at a hundred yards a hard drive nema second edge oh we're just getting rid of some hard drives it ought to be fun to take it to the rifle range so I take it to the rifle and obviously we're dealing with modern rifles are probably more accurate but I'm shooting something that's basically two inches high laying it down on the ground at a hundred yards and blowing it to smithereens now that's how accurate a rifle is at a hundred yards you tell me he couldn't get a head shot at 81 meters that's crazy again no she no wind of course he could good light did he though did he that's right also the question is you know we have some pretty good indication as to what he was thinking and what is obviously what his motivations were and that's important the Russian side definitely was involved in a lot of weird shit with communism who knows what his entire full background was there was a lot of covert shit going on and did he did he express a desire to do something like this to the Russians at some point and they you know that okay well here's an interesting opportunity right yeah they would have they would have sparked on that and they would have thought about they you know would they have actually you know no play on woods intended but would they have pulled the trigger on an operation trying to push him into doing an act like this indirectly through the Cubans exactly like this crazy fuck might go ahead and do this for us yeah so this is after the Bay of Pigs people have to realize there was a lot of people pissed off in the Kennedy we lost shot of people whose Jeff hey everybody hated Kenny yeah and so well that infamous video where he's banging his shoe down on the table we will bury you yeah yeah I know it was it was the the environment was right for them and they and again the Russians it shouldn't surprise anybody when you talk about what they did during this election I mean they've been doing this forever you know there you go back to 1940s and and the Russians were you know spending a lot of time and effort and money here in the states trying to keep us out of the war back before Hitler invaded Russia and when they were allotted with a Nazi still so they spent a lot of time they set up you know independent association supposedly they paid off a lot of unions and union members a you know journalists I mean they were doing everything they could to create this or to strengthen the idea of isolationism just to keep us out they've been doing this for as long as they've been around right so anybody who says oh I can't it's shocking the Russians would be engaged in this it's ridiculous they've always been again we by the way have been engaged doing that with them what that's right here fine I've heard that online I find that house jump story do believe the thing that bothers me the most about the Kennedy assassination is the universal support for the Magic Bullet theory I think that fucking bullet is ridiculous I've shot things I've shot a lot of things I know what happens to bullets everybody that I know that's a marksman everybody know that's a hunter they see a bullet that is hit bone it fucking never looks like that when a bullet goes through two people and comes out looking like you shot it into a pool of water and that's what it looks like I don't buy that at all and the convenience of finding it on Connolly's gurney and they roll them into the hospital oh look guys we found the bullet got it and it's perfect god I don't buy that for a fucking second and the problem is there's or metal fragments in Connolly's body then we're missing from the bullet itself I think that bullet itself look at that bullet caddy that thing didn't hit shit no it's exactly right I bet you know this with people that have never shot guns and they walk swoosh proven that broke bones and a bullet breaks bones they get fucked bullets a jacketed bullet when it's jacketed bullet breaks bones it gets fucked you're talking about something it's going I mean how fast is a bullet from that rifle go it's gotta be kind of that that would be interesting to pull up but I would imagine it's in the thousands of feet per second it's got to be when it hits bone it's gonna blow there's always distortion even if you only know I mean it's so I when you have a conversation about this and it is somebody who has no shooting experience or you know it's just you think all right that's fine I understand why you're fascinated by it but do when you do your research you know it's it's like with news read everything right read The Wall Street Journal read the New York Times read the Financial Times read read The Economist but read everything yes before you form your opinion right and and and everybody's so siloed nowadays and you get the same thing with conspiracy theories I absolutely believe this and I'm not gonna I'm gonna discount everything else that's out there yeah and or just not pay any attention to it yeah but it's hard to say and here's another thing the magic bullet path people like well how is that possible well let me tell you something that's the most believable thing about the magic bullet there is the path of the bullet because bullets do wacky shit when they hit bone and you can't predict it at all I know a guy who in Iraq they shot a guy in the head from the front and it went out his eyeball the bullet came out of his eyeball back forward he ricocheted inside of his skull and came out his eye you can't I mean again you can't put your right you can't protect it they'll try to model these things and figure out it but you know there's an unknown there and so yeah I agree I mean I think that again it's it's one of those things were it it's never going to get resolved and it it's gonna continue to live on because a it was such an important event and right in in the history of the country and be it I keep coming back to that same thing people don't want to believe that really awful shit can happen sometimes in a very simple straightforward way and so it's much easier to think it was a broad-based conspiracy there were lots of moving parts sometimes bad shit happens and it's just as simple as it seems that is possible conversely people don't like to believe in conspiracies especially when it involves an assassination of the president right you know the reason why they came up with the whole Magic Bullet theory in the first place is pretty shady in the first in fact the reason why they did is because the guy got hit by a ricochet underneath the overpass and they blamed that bullet on one of the one of the shots from Lee Harvey Oswald in the Book Depository so they said well alright so now we have less bullets that could have hit Kennedy we have all these wounds and we have to tribute a series of wounds to one bullet right right so that was the the thought process behind it but this is a pruder film was the one that got people weirded out by it but I tell you about man I've watched that film a bunch of times and one of the things that don't jive is if he did get hit from the front you know his head goes back to left why is the blood spray out forward see it's it's it's weird the way the impact of the blood is they it's like the blood sprays forward and then his head goes back into the left he could have possibly been that he was hit from the front and the back at the same time that's entirely possible I mean that is a tactic you would do right you would roll someone into an area where they would be in a crossfire and they would get shot well if they came in if there was if the grassy knoll was in fact a second sight for a shooter then by the time it hits that corner and starts its path just before the shots were fired from the Book Depository and Oswald if you're going with that if you had an another shooter up on the grass you know you're you are basically looking right at the the the front of the radical and because of the way that it its position in the knoll is kind of turned and then it's just that it's just that there's not a lot of concealment up there right and they had that they had the defense the picket fence it's not the original one that's there anymore but it's basically in line with it and you can there's plenty of pictures of the Oh previous offense that was up there at the time and you had that yeah you did have the train yard engineer report sometime after the fact that he saw a puff of smoke that he wasn't quite sure what that was all about he'd seen a couple of people back there so that you know that was that's an interesting thread to pull on right and I think that that it's been you know it's been researched ad nauseam doesn't mean you couldn't still find something it also doesn't mean anybody's gonna really find a conclusion after the fact right especially today ya know and that's right and you know maybe it's like everything else as time marches on you lose you know you lose witnesses you lose you know people that were there on site and even witnesses when someone gets shot especially the president not credible you'll have five different stories from five different people and gunshots heard from the moon nobody's got that funds just from a robbery just well you know it's true yeah car accident you say you say what did you see if you separate people out you're right you get five different versions from five different people yeah and you know so yeah I was an eyewitness accounts I tend not to be particularly comparable and you've got to you know you you've got to take them and then you've got a you know match it up with other information you can you can pull together forensic Leawood it's it is fascinating I you know who knows where it's gonna DB Cooper's back in the news a little bit because it really yeah yeah they initially was because the bureau was saying okay we're closed in this case and then there's some talk now over the past day and a half two days that they might have found something up in the wilderness that might be a piece of the chute that he had and I know they haven't they haven't bought him that one out yet buddy Cooper more new evidence of parachute believed found but how they know that's his parachute yeah the thing about I mean it could be but the thing about something that's that long ago we have to realize how many people died in the woods every year yeah yeah and when you go when you come out the back of that plane good luck yeah and and also he was in a suit he was wearing loafers he lost his shoes so he hits those that wilderness he hits those trees and it was cold that night and it was wet and he's gonna be on manhunt on in the morning no yet as he had his his parachute and he had the the bag with the money they'd given him money so now that was it and so no wilderness gear at all no well not that they know of I mean it who knows maybe underneath his business suit he was wearing something but he don't wear him think so what was the time of the year I was late in the year oh I think I think I ought to go back and check again but I think it was November it was part of the country up in the wilderness up in Washington State oh it's dead yeah before Thanksgiving before Thanksgiving yeah that guy's dead yeah I mean it's just yeah he might come you make your way out of there and you got yeah it's night time and you know that and and you know that again there's gonna be a manhunt even at the shelter no less trout wouldn't survive up there but there's been all sorts of theories uh he jumped out and then some people met him well maybe yeah good luck finding him right how you gonna be able to be no that's so silly people jumping out of an airplane with no GPS the odds of finding that guy he's not just not a flare yeah like what does he have how you gonna locate him yeah I'm gonna just find him in the woods that's why I think is and you know there was some talk well you know because some of his money was found you know after the fact stacked in a little part of the river that seemed unusual right it seemed like it would have had to make a pretty amazing journey from the wilderness down through the stream system out to the river and then be found on this sandbar and it was all stacked one on top of the other hmm but it had the light it had the serial numbers yeah and so there was some thought that you know how did that get there did it naturally just float down there and end up on this sandbar and covered in Santa eventually was found by some kid that was on a picnic whoa you know I'm wondering slowly how long would it take before you get busted now it was $200,000 back in the day a little bit here and there yeah by a bicycle seems goodbye envy no one say nothing but tricycle for Nia where the weather's nicer rooms got a 50-inch TV you don't even have a job you little baby what the hell are you doing where did you get that transistor radio well if it's kid who found it I'm sure I see what you said yeah yeah no he reported the kid was with his family and he reported finding Amelia the bureau went out there and dug up the entire area and in a fairly large effort trying to figure out was there more money there how did he get there run I'll switch to Tesla I think if they found his money's dead yeah this is not gonna jump out of a parachute and then leave the money well there was some thought that maybe he was doing it as a ploy right to to kind of distract and and and think okay he's dead because the money's there right but again it falls into the category of you know it's never gonna be resolved I don't think and it's a fascinating story it's America's only unsolved hijacking am I right about that I think I yeah America's only unsolved tax was it all the money did they find all of it or worse no it was just a small amount it was not it was not a large amount so he did not if he if he planted it there he was smart enough not to put it all there yeah that's a weird story that he be Cooper ones a weird one because a lot of people like they tend to look at him like some sort of a folk hero there was a connection with him that they were that they were thinking he was this guy which I'm gonna say shot family members and murdered family members and then went out and did that crime there was some suspect that was on the loose from some sort of a homicide that they connected to the DB Cooper case and they thought that somehow there was a potential that they were related that it was the same guy yeah he loses some of his charm if that's the case yeah just a guy that's you know thinking I'm gonna hijack a plane for some cash and where's he get the money how the word the cash come from they brought it on the plane they landed and they got the crew of passengers and most of the crew off of there and then everybody was in the cockpit with the door closed when the in the old days and they the back door would open up you know him with steps and he went out the back door they had a back door indicator which is how they kind of sensed about where he would have gone out and anyway I sound like a DB cooper so how high was he up there when he jumped again I had to go through my notes but that's on flight no no no no no they drop down to I want to say about 10,000 feet I can't remember yeah but they're not really sure because the door came down he could have been there for any period of time and he had instructed them to drop down I figure again what altitude he was at but he not just it's amazing that these things continue to go on and we love mysteries we love mysteries and conspiracies and which is why the the new Trump administration is so interesting well he loves conspiracies doesn't he he believes a bunch of crazy ones like he was just retweeting that one about was the general that they were chic to purchasing dippin the pigs the bullets in pig's blood yeah and there was never an attack Islamic attack at 35 years that's not even a true story no but again who why why are you doing this why just stop yeah there's there's no there's no look I didn't vote for him I didn't vote for her I I just thought we could have done better in a country this size right I tell you one thing he's doing he's fucking it up for future idiots I would not underestimate our ability to hire somebody worse think they're never gonna be as someone like maybe they'll be like a new version of him like someone like him but they dial it back a little bit yeah yeah maybe so I just think people always say well this will be a course correction and we're gonna go back to having really responded thinking what he this is America don't don't don't imagine that they could actually get better in that regard we could be even more dysfunctional from a political point of view but well what's weird is I was watching this interview today where this guy this fucking pencil neck dork was supporting antifoam violence and saying that the only way to fight against fascism is violence and I was like oh Jesus and then there was this other guy next to him who was saying no that's not true the way you fight it is with a peaceful protest like just happened in Boston like that's the best way to handle it where there was I want to say there was more than a hundred thousand people in Boston wasn't there how many people in Boston came out let's see if we could find that out and it was completely peaceful in the nut I think there was like 400 retards with KKK banners yeah it's a small small yeah group right above assholes and and you think okay but here's the thing this is where this is where the you know president Trump is just such a you know he's a great case study at some point I'm sure well I'm sure people are already you know writing up their grant proposals to do a study on on his psychology but you know you look at you look at the First Amendment and you think if you like the First Amendment then you got to be all-in right it's not like you can say and that's the kind of the beauty of this country right you know you got to let that douchebag speak right right and that's what it is it's speech but we've gotten to the point where now words some by some folks are viewed as violence words aren't violence I don't think this is just my own personal opinion words on violence you gotta let everybody speak because that's the First Amendment you go down you wanna take a juice every slow slippery slope right and so you know we but we can all agree that there there's no space for them they're assholes but there's also no space for violent you know counter demonstration there is space for protesting it because it's their absolutely wrong right I mean that's that's again this idea that you how you should be able to argue both right no you can't respond with violence and yes you guys you shouldn't you know you shouldn't be here you know I think if you're gonna hold those views it's it's abhorrent you are protected by the First Amendment and so that's fine doesn't mean we have to you know like it or in any way you condone it but but you got to know okay that those sort of fringe ideas are gonna exist and I agree the best way to resolve it is peaceful demonstrations massive pieces of those demonstrations to show you know sort of the weight of where the good thoughts are yes and then political process yeah right ensure that you know work through the political system as dysfunctional as it may be but anyway just encouraging people to violently attack people that have differing ideas in them that aren't being violent is never the answer no it's an it's just not the way to do it and and approaches to protea yeah i mean literally you're enforcing your ideas point we're silencing others with actual violence which is the mark of a totalitarian state also as if you say you can't have these views well questions I hate those views but again it's the idea that what you say is violent to me no it's not it's I can speak here's the other thing that Trump fucked up we called those protesters anti violent protesters like or anti-police protesters yeah like come on man that is not what they're protesting against please there might be a few amongst them that say stupid shit about the police right but again just like with the other side where you've got I mean how many what do you got a hundred two hundred idea who would imagine fifteen thousand where these Nazis hiding anyway I mean that's it that's the thing you know my dad didn't didn't fly in World War two you know so that somehow you could have a resurgent not that there is I think it's a small group just like it's a small group on the left right that wants a violent solution to this or you know honestly believes that you know violence against police is somehow the answer which is insane but again there you go truth is somewhere in that middle right yeah I mean they've got to get rid of the fringe and you know we got to figure out a way for for the folks that are in kind of the the sunspace yeah to work together and and and otherwise I mean a-and I don't think the Democrats care whether the Republicans get in fact they're they're happy that shit's not getting done but as an American again I didn't vote for him I didn't vote for her but I would like to see the government work now who did you vote for you know what I just said fuck it I can't I can't no you two I know I couldn't bring myself to do it I couldn't bring much and I hated doing that right now because I devote a top-down right ya know what they call it yeah yeah yeah I mean I what I did was I you know state elections Morton you know those sort of and that's fine I but it it's very painful to say I can't you know I said you justify doing that and and I know people and then people lose their minds they go well that means you voted for him or that means and I'm no it just means we should have been able to do better in a country this size you know and you know maybe maybe you hold your nose and vote for the other side I don't know but at least she represented a conventional approach to politics that's true yeah that's super conventional I don't enjoy a lot of aspects of her personality and what she's done with a career and of the obvious deception the the Clinton Foundation which is just riddled with problems and now doesn't even exist anymore apparently they shut it down didn't they yeah yeah yeah wonder what they did with the remaining balance probably just as a horsefly influence we got all this money we're gonna transfer it somewhere well there's gotta be a place to store his wad of hundreds he wasn't married Oreos I guess he's not dead yet so I don't kill him off but he's you know he's amazing political individual that guy could make you think that you know I met him once overseas this sounds dodgy but in in the Saudi I'm at a party it does sound really special and so but he had that ability right now again I wasn't a fan but I you know again you just want whichever administration's in charge you want it to work you write one country yeah but so you met him in it and it's true what people used to say about him which is that he made you feel like he was talking right to you and nothing else was important right he wasn't one of those guys that looks over the shoulder thinking is there somebody else I should be talking to right and and so yeah he was a charmer friend of mine told me he was talking to him and a woman though and Clinton like essentially almost turned his back to him and like oh like all becomes like this for single out of the picture in a party yeah you know I'll tell you what's I mean George Bush that'd be guy like to sit down and have a beer with yes the Bush family good bunch P I know people go oh my god I couldn't stand his policies but you know sometimes you just it comes down to a personal thing and you think yeah you know maybe the guys got some you know you may not like his principles you may have but he sticks with him right he looks extremely reasonable now yeah exactly right okay one time where the Supreme Court had a ruling that he didn't like and there was a speech where he gave in and I've seen it quoted in print and then you know someone showed a video of it but he was essentially saying well you know we have to uphold the decision of the court you know I'm not happy with it but you know this is the way our system works and and then it went to trump talking about the Supreme Court you know not backing his travel ban and all the different various things that he's lost in court and he just goes after man boy he just say you know I just like the the personal attacks and there's no I mean the probably there's no discipline in the White House and I know that everybody thought well let's get something different in there let's get up businessman let's we don't want the politics as usual and well you got that but there is a requirement there is a need for the machine to work in a certain fashion and in a sense and yet you know yes there's lots of things you can change and that that's a good thing there should be some change in that government but the way that the the the place works in Washington but the communications there that the lack of discipline I mean for Crowley they just they just put in place the new communications director at the White House 28 years old she's 20 years old never done this sort of thing before and she's the new communications director she replaced Scarah Moochie for his 10-day reign and why did she want to replace him because she listens she just won't to do what Trump says he just said you yeah I'm here's a guy for the job I mean yeah she says you're the girl for this and she's worked with in the Trump Organization and I guess just viewed as loyal and loyal yeah that's what he needs yeah he knows loyalty above all else yeah and so so that's it but I mean there's no consistency and you see these things happen you see you know these the messaging get out and and he gets ahead of the message or they need to play catch-up then and people like Madison John Kelly now and and Pompeyo and others are trying to race to make sense of some of these things and there's a self-inflicted wound after after wound for this administration it seems like one of those homemade Derby carts that they roll down a hill where you know the wheels aren't stay on and you kind of can't look away like wow how long is it going to take for this thing to happen completely falls apart start doing tumbles down the hill you got a name they get it you got to come up with a name for that cart you just have to name your soapbox derby card but yeah I don't know where it's it's it's gonna go I just think and it's this guy who's been in the intelligence community for so many years and you're you know stepping back and there was also a real issue with him being at odds with the intelligence community and diminishing the intelligence community yeah that was a strange or sort of an interesting narrative it didn't really it got overblown to some degree I mean the people in the sense that the people at the agency you know at the end of the day they just take whoever's in charge they take their marching orders from right it's not and I know people don't believe it because you know everybody likes to feature films and everything but it's it's that's a pretty a political organization whoever's in the administration they're gonna prioritize their national security concerns you're tasking comes out of that and then you just march on and do your job and yes the director is an appointed position and you know John Brennan was certainly much more political in the previous administration and then previous directors have been but and the operational level you know that the street level people just get on with it you know they're human so of course you know they may have their own personal preference but I'd spent a long time there and behind the curtain and and you know they just take on and do whatever you know there were people that weren't happy with Obama they're people that weren't happy with Bush to people not happy with Trump that doesn't it you know they just tell us what the priorities are tell us what the tasking is and we'll get on with it you know and go out there and do the collection operations we're supposed to do it just seems like there's no one person that's ever going to be able to fill that position it seems like that position also gets bigger and bigger like your responsibilities get bigger and bigger and the president's yeah yeah yeah I just it seems to me that at this point in our in our history the history of our society we kind of have to look at that position and and wonder whether or not it's even logical to give so much power to one person I was like what would you do I mean how do you have good question yeah yet create a Council of Elders Council everybody sits around like a hand-carved desk in an underground lair yeah makes decisions that's single good oh I like it yeah it could be like the knights of the round table yeah yeah you know I don't know I think virtuous people doing a by committee I wonder if the founding fathers I'm sure there's been all sorts you know reporting on that I just never read it but the founding fathers have they consider that as an option probably not but a wonderful opportunity the kind of population growth that we've experienced yeah the real problem with the founding fathers is it's brilliant as they were there's no way that could have ever seen the internet coming in Alan it's not nor could they have seen the people wanting to stay in Washington for 36 years 42 years and become career politicians they were all just interested in you know doing their duty and serving the way they were supposed to it they felt obligated to and then getting the hell out I came back to the farm or whatever their job was because nobody wanted to stay in Washington for any longer than they need it to so yeah you're right they could they have foreseen all in that quote no definitely not and so does that mean what does that mean though I mean it means amendments to the Constitution and as we've done in the past and think about how crazy it is that someone forms a new country and then four hundred plus years later it is the preeminent superpower in the world by far yeah that's pretty crazy and got these country that have been around for thousands and thousands of years like imagine a group of freaks and misfits that branch off from America getting a boat and float over to Costa Rica or wherever and take it over yeah and then and then it becomes the superpower it is astounding and then again going back to what we talked about towards the beginning was cobbling it together understanding that we needed to to get our hands on everything west of the Mississippi all right clearly there were some issues there but you know it's sort of that vision that says we're going all the way to the causeway of the water we have to otherwise we can control it right and yeah that's I mean it's it's it's an astounding history you're absolutely right but you know it'll be interesting to see obviously this is the probably the stupidest statement people will hear all day is is you know where we're gonna be and say another 200 years oh yeah because I've got a theory that says where every generation is making it easier for their kids and eventually you hit a point of diminishing returns and everybody's just a big pussy and so that's my theory I haven't come up with a name for you're not alone yeah just a pussy dude big pussy that's that that could cover different things soprano yeah wonder yeah I mean I wonder how much there's gonna there's of the world where obviously things are way more difficult than out here and maybe we're losing some sort of a competitive edge because we've made our lives so easy and haven't replaced the convenience of civilization with something that tempers our human instincts like some difficult tasks rite of passage for young men you know something that develops character instead we're making safe spaces and making words violence and you know making it so we have trigger warnings and there's no winners you don't have to win thank God my kids are getting old enough now where their sports leagues no longer you know for a while there was just driving me crazy as a parent and going to a game and realizing that they weren't keeping score yeah because they didn't want it that's the whole reason why people get better you fucks yeah meanwhile the kids are keeping school kids know for sure and kids don't want you to blow smoke up their ass right you don't they'd come off the court and and if like you know like the oldest boy scooter is ten years old and he's he plays a lot of lacrosse he's been playing for five years and so he's he really likes it he does he does well but you know I'm not raised in the you know a Division one champion there right I'm right but he plays other sports too so there's there's sort of a well-roundedness there but we came off the field one day and we were walking along and and all the parents were kind of marching off and the game was over and and he says he says how'd I do and I said well you know you could have done better I said I just get the impression he didn't try as hard as you could what do you think and he looked at me irritated right he looked at me like I can't believe you didn't just say I did great and so he said what and and I looked at him I'm walking along and I didn't realize the parents were within earshot I said well look you know scoot do you want me to blow smoke up your ass and you want me to be honest with you and to his credit he said you know he honors with me even though it wasn't happy about the honesty so you should be honest with me and so we tell kids that we they know better you know if you tell a kid that they're great and they're doing wonderful and they didn't what do they take away from that they take away from it that you're kind of bullshit right you know unless they're just super super young they pretty they get it at a pretty early age well here's here's something that's important to relate to children that you are not your accomplishments you are you and the only way you are going to get better at accomplishing things is to be a hundred percent honest about the amount of effort you put in and what the actual result of that effort is whether it's a failure or a success that does not define you that defines your participation in this particular activity it is not you you are an individual that will hopefully learn from all of your endeavors but you're never gonna learn shit if you lie to yourself you're never gonna learn shit but if somebody makes this nobody scores a point and there are no winners and there are no losers and everybody's amazing that's not good because good voice by the way it's not good because there's going to be people out there that are fucking driven and psychotic and they're gonna get ahead there's people that are task oriented and goal oriented and they they have an idea ahead of them gonna trying to figure out how to make this happen they have a goal they want to reach it and if you're competing with that person in any form of life and they're not burdened down by the bullshit that we give so many kids today they're gonna have a massive advantage and this idea that this kid who's been coddled and treated like he's always gonna be a winner that somehow or another they're gonna be happier is fucking crazy if a kid can't process what's true and what's not and the kid can't process criticism yeah right constructive criticism right you don't just stand there and berate your kid of course not that's just as bad absolute stand on use everybody's seen him right yeah that the dad's or sometimes the moms it's stay on the sidelines and berate their kid because kids jeopardizing his scholarship to some moron school yeah morons but no I think you're absolutely right they've got a the sooner they're able to assess that that equation effort and result yes and compare it to what's going on around them and then understand it I mean say one of my day and then one of my boys it you know they play basketball and they enjoy it but it's not their primary activity right now so they tried out for AAU man and they got in but not at the top team and they were upset about not being placed on this top team and I said you don't I did and I didn't say quite this way but I my point was you don't deserve to be on the top - yeah because you're not working as hard as those kids that are working hard and that's their thing they wanted to be there and so they put in the effort you are happy playing and you could you could be there but you're not doing it yet right and so therefore you you know hey don't get down on yourself but be don't certainly don't get down on anybody else because they put out the effort and they accomplished something that you didn't write so I mean it's it you know you're always trying to find that balance it's just I don't think we're not doing our kids any favors right now I just think we're not not obviously as a broad-brush statement but in general terms I think society is not doing us any favors we're and you see that I'm a daughter that's in college and she talks about her you know her classmates and others and and you know sort of the conversations they have in class and and the discussions and what passes is debate nowadays which is not much right the idea of the old debate where you can you can voice your opinions and they can be different than somebody else's and you can you know hash it out and you can have a winner and a loser but that's fine you go away and you come back the next day and you have another rousing debate in that class it doesn't really exist you know it seems like anyway because everybody's so afraid of saying something that might be offensive or not offensive but just might be upsetting and there's a difference between being upsetting and being offensive we're trying to nerf the world I mean that really was what we're trying to all the hard edges that you might bruise yourself on we're trying to push it put a cushion but you need to understand that when you fall down it's gonna hurt so that way next time you're thinking you might fall down you'll correct your path yeah it's the whole reason why people do difficult things you do difficult things to understand your boundaries to understand your limitations and then to try to improve those try to raise the roof on your expectations raise the roof on your your whatever limitations of your abilities learn from whatever those are and improve the SEC interrogation training you in interrogation training when you're working with people the goal is to show them that it's okay at some point they're gonna have to talk right and so when you're going through the training the point of it is to get them to that point they realize that okay you know it's not the end of the world I know that at some point I'm gonna end up talking I'm gonna say something I'm gonna have to do that because I can't otherwise I'm either dead or I'm completely broken and the idea is if you you do that and then the rest of the training and beyond that you're building them back up because they understand that now if God forbid something should happen they get picked up and there's actually an interrogation going on in the back of their mind they understand that and they're able to process it so that if they do get to that point where now okay I'm gonna have to talk I'm have to come up with something it's gonna and then it's not completely devastating it doesn't you know leave them completely broken and they can come walk back because they understand I got to that point I understand what my boundaries are but I can work within that I don't know where I'm going with this other but you seen are you seeing interrogation training like an agent gets interrogate yeah yeah I mean interrogation training in general for you know for our outfit for the military you know it's it's basically the same we do it across different this is not interrogating an enemy combatant know you being you know going through interrogation training is what do you tell them to do like and that's it's like say if someone gets captured in Afghanistan or whatever well I mean yeah bottom line is you know you you try to avoid talking right but it depends part of it is you got to assess who you're dealing with right you got to assess what you think their parameters are what could be coming down the pike in other words right so how is this and that's part of the training too is understanding what different groups what different places could could mean what would that what that interrogation could look like how bad it could get so you're processing that part of it is understanding what it is that it's okay to give up what are you what are you going to say that's not going to put anything in jeopardy anybody's lives or any operations are in jeopardy part of it is you you know you've then you've got to understand you got to stay close to the truth the problem with it if you you know where you start getting people out on interrogations is where they can't remember what they've said right the closer you are to the truth the easier it is to remember what you've said right so and these things I mean if it's a bad situation and you're in there day in and day out you know and you're sleep deprivation and they're you know knocking you around and there's no food and that's you're gonna have it you're gonna have a hard time keeping track of even the basic things so you you know you're trying to keep it as close to the truth as possible and as minimal as possible you know in terms of damage you go and you know I mean typically you you you've thought through all of this it's like everything else you do your homework ahead of time and God forbid something should happen and you know usually it won't but anyway the point being is that you know the idea is in the training portion of it you want people to understand that you know everybody's got a breaking point all right and that's just that's the way it works in someone's some it's you know it's here some it's further down the road but everybody's gonna break and you don't want that devastate the person if it should happen you know knock on wood but anyway that was apropos of nothing no it's it's important I mean it's it's an interesting topic because I mean understanding that there's going to be severe penalties and that there's going to be repercussions yeah they're you know the this is a this is a bad situation you're in and understanding that going in is gonna help you a lot more than if you go in there from you know soft hatted world where you don't think there's gonna be any adversity whatsoever no that's right and and that's all we're you know just to finish that thought is it the interesting thing about people talked about the interrogation program that we had obviously right and anyway I don't want to revisit that and you know that the left did a very fine job of grabbing the moral high ground and saying that you're talking to people or it's all torture mmm right but the point being is that even if you don't ever intend to use any enhanced interrogation techniques you don't want to tell the enemy that because once you tell them that you're constrained by the Army Field Manual as an example that's all you can do guess what every Mook out there fighting us and wanting to harm us is carrying a copy the Army Field Manual you know that's right despite the fact that they did for a while they don't live in a cave right and so once they know what's coming down the pike that's gone their incentive is gone right to talk to you because they once you know once you don't have that unknown if you're not sitting in some you know squat box and the temperatures you know up and you're haven't eaten then you're thinking what the hell they gonna do to me next you have no idea if that's gone and you don't have that anxiety that in you know intense anxiety then you're okay right mentally you get yourself to a nice happy spot you're comfortable they're feeding you they're just asking questions they're just asking questions and you're you know you can you can hold out for a much longer period of time and yeah maybe there'll be some clever you know person working the interrogation facility they'll develop a personal relationship over a period of time you know but you know what by then your operational information is lost its interest right and it's shelf life and that stuff is not particularly long typically so anyway that's yeah when you put when you're in a situation where you have to extract information in a very short period of time because it's critical because lives are at stake like in that was a ticking time yeah and if you're you're stuck in some situation where you know someone's got a dirty bomb or you know what have you there's a terrorist attack beam land you know this guy asked some information what is the best way to get it out of them is there a best way there's you know what it's not really because it's all dependent on the individual and that's where it's so much of this and you know they it just I Ganic that the argument got sort of you know corrupted hijacked whatever because of waterboarding because yeah it just became such an emotive issue but it's an enormous labor intensive process even in those cases where you think okay we've just picked up a high-value target and we feel that they've got operational information that we really need to know related to whatever it's it's it's not as if you don't go in there and start beating them over the head with a two-by-four nobody nobody does that you know maybe some maybe some liaison partners you know and in in you know fourth world countries you know would that world what's the fifth world country I I've never even heard of that New Jersey Connecticut outside of Dan Malloy is the president of the fifth world nation of Connecticut so you know it's it's down to the individual as knowing your homework it's it's having all the information that you can at your fingertips about okay well who is this person roars associates who else have we picked up and what have they said up to this point do you have anything like that that you can walk into that if you walk into an interrogation and you haven't done your homework you're screwed right it's gonna show out really quickly and they're gonna figure it out for the most part you know not to say that there every detainee would be a Lex Luthor but you know they get a sense pretty quickly so you really got to have it buttoned up have as much information as possible so that you know how to direct the conversation if anything is set at all volunteered at all is there any credibility to it what can you do with that information you take it back and get it corroborated by another series it's gonna shut that off man Siri is transcribing everything you said yeah look at that well now what about what about using like chemicals like what about like MDMA have they ever tried giving the detainees ecstasy no I mean I don't know 60s you know maybe the 1960s I'm sure I would say you'd be surprised I'm taking a series still listening to me that that big for other the government it's it's Google I hate to break it to you now Google but you can listen right now on YouTube yeah the fucking covertly attack enables phones doing that asshole stuff no it's you know what there's there are and again we they might not know enough about ecstasy I need to get on the team if I just talk to them get along I'm telling you you give these guys two heads they'll fucking tell you everything I even can massage that'll be your code names they'll be so nice to you yeah it just changes everything that's they'll be so nice to you yeah just just give them like some delicious food and give them a back rub and just go listen man America's all tell me what you know about that plot know about ya blow anybody up man they they can't be your friend how could you kill people they can't be your friend oh you're right yeah I think that would work I don't know why we didn't think about that but it seems like it wouldn't work but you know why you haven't done that yeah well there you go have you done it No yeah there you go I've done it trust me it'll fucking work ecstasy I'm serious show I tell you what I do we'll get on the jet and we'll go back to headquarters like what I'm saying is bullshit because what that stuff does is first of all it kills all of your inhibitions gone all of your anxiety gone oh and all of your insecurities gone and what you're left with is this over serotonin over dopamine state where you just love everything and everybody if you could give that to enemy combatants I guarantee you if you could talk to them you would get shit out of them that they would never want to discuss yeah I think the you know people won't buy it when I say it but there are tremendous constraints on what can and can't be done if people have gone through and actually read all those DOJ memos that were releasing me in but hey guys I've talked about the chemists some fake glasses or look maybe like in Club gear just show like high water pants yeah Italian shoes now you're talking sort of the seventies hustle yeah just bring me in I'm telling it just let me try it once yeah I could fix a lot of shit you know I'll put the idea forward I'll see what they say and if you know the reason why they don't think it would work because they haven't done it yeah if you get anybody in the bureau or anybody in the CIA or wherever who has done ecstasy they would listen to this and they would not want to say they've done it so that you're a real issue but if you I'm telling you you give people two tabs of ecstasy and then start asking them questions let's also it would've been much happier facility oh yeah the next day not the next day no next rough you fucking eye I remember the first time well I only did ecstasy once but the next day I did it I could I was in a coffee shop trying to read a boxing magazine I literally could not read I was like god I can't even like concentrate enough to read a full sentence like this is terrible and it was it just pretty much that day after no to a couple days that night I went on stage and I was terrible I went on stage that night in Dallas if you went to that show back in 2001 or whatever was I'm sorry let's apologize that's terrible shouts well I just had no energy my brain was just like I felt like my brain was a dry sponge like someone had just squeezed all the juice out of my brain yeah see it's those after-effects I just you know you think not worth it now but there's ways out of that there's a just keep on it no there's nutrients that you take called 5htp 5htp actually converts to serotonin your brains the building blocks for it so what you do is while you're tripping you're supposed to double down on 5htp and it helps you as you come off of it your serotonin jumps back up oh not a hundred percent though but to a manageable state you do have to be a chemist though to do all that right just never just by a couple of tabs at the close you know call it good well you're really smart you actually take l-tryptophan and 5-htp because l-tryptophan converts to 5-htp and you should also take adaptogens like some B vitamins and different things as well that's what is that what's in Turkey yes okay sandwich a turkey club nice turkey club apparently that's bullshit that crashed the people we say from Turkey that you know it puts you to sleep apparently that's all just Carly's yeah oh yeah mashed potatoes stuffing nicely just overeating I can believe that yeah although I do love stuffing listen bring this information back I'm talking bring it back it's happening right now yeah happening right now they're heroes in the watch center they don't know because they don't know Langly they're taking notes right now you know I'm telling you I'm right just try it once it doesn't hurt anybody they're not gonna die they might have to change some laws to to get back to hell fucking those ain't bring me in there's no laws no I show up with a suitcase and a smile I'll get you guys some UFC tickets we'll buy it no we'll get you a lab coat get you a special disguise no one even knows just let me try it once I guarantee just someone that some someone who's not totally despicable like you just gotta like a little issue with this guy talking it just changes your chemistry I mean it just will it will erase any inhibitions it sounds all very Mangala like though it does but it doesn't hurt anybody that's the thing yeah yeah I think right now people are losing their minds cuz we got back on the interrogation thing everything I thought that was over and done with oh you on your side you ain't in the business yeah well I just people in general I think everybody just people just got so tired of it and well the war on terror nobody wants to talk not that I want to talk about it but that's what happens you you think where is the end where you know and and people just tired of it I just want to move on I don't want to think about it and something happens and people are reminded that it's still going on there's still people out there that want to hurt you and yet we're all just so exhausted from it well I think that's also I mean you could you could make an analogy to some of the stupid lies that Trump is told that he tells so many lies they just like I can't even be bothered this can't even be a scandal guys it's just there's so many of them you just get overwhelmed by it to the point where you can't even you can't process it anymore it's exhausting it's exhausting and and and the idea that and it kind of works both ways right it works in the sense that the tweets and the the bizarre statements and the things are exhausting and then on the you know the other side the people that want to make all of that stuff to death of the Republic every day it's the death of the Republic that's exhausting man and you say who's who's running the shop who's keeping things moving forward right and I don't know you know I mean we've got some good people in government some really hardworking people sure trying to do the right thing and yet it's just I'm not particularly confident right now what do you think's the worst-case scenario right now so you say you're not confident well I think we could have we could see the market you know kind of stall at this point I mean I think people have been amazed at how the market was resilient and not just resilient but you know blasting upwards and showing apparently no concern for you know how disheveled the administration has been over the first you know it's been on a steady increase since 2007 or so no in the crash yeah yeah but since that since the recovery took a long time it took a long time to come back but then yeah right I mean it's not it's not but what I'm talking about is the time since the election you know the market showed this ability to kind of ignore what was happening right what was sort of the the chaos and you know that the media is reporting on all the encourage though by his remarks about business you encourage tax cuts yeah absolutely and and and some of the deregulation which has you know it's okay to be fair you know it's a there's been a fair amount deregulation but tax cuts not so much and and so I think now that you know the markets starting to look at that and think maybe we do have an issue here maybe it's not you know oh I'm gonna work out the way we thought so maybe that slows down I don't think North Korea is gonna be launching any missiles they're not suicidal right I mean they're again next to see and what the fucks is named the basketball player with those shit in his lips Rodman Rodman yes that Rodman over there definitely does so that's that now that I could get behind that's an operation we could we could work on you know because that's not targeting detainees and then of all those regulations we gotta worry about but I think you know if Rodman you know willingly offers up ecstasy and him says fine then it's two consenting adults yeah we don't even allow Rodman to go back over there anymore right it was yeah I think that Americans aren't allowed to go back there yeah but not right now I suspect although if Rodman wanted to I'm sure he didn't go to everything sent Dennis he was a hell of a ballplayer it was people forget people think this you know he's such an interesting cat yeah but people forget what a great basketball player he was yeah he just sort of went crazy yeah yeah look at him remember this leave this picture oh yeah yeah bad as I want to be was that a book he had out or something well I mean you can't knock the guy for trying to be unique yeah no he's unique but he was again he he was a hell of a player oh you definitely was man that's a good look I haven't sown that one for I got a jacket just like the tropical jacket with all the palm trees and he said he's worn around its neck is that a fishing net could be anything man it's like a silver mr. t thing see I could look at that and say I could never pull that off I could never good I couldn't do that like for Christmas yeah Halloween but not not for Christmas and besides when Christmas when the season arrives I put on my my handmade New York Giants sweater from my daughter and I don't take it off until after the Christmas season whoa yeah yeah it's pretty manky by now but it yeah that's a great way to do that it's a Giants oh also a Giants fan one of those guys mmm just cling to it I took link to her past glories maybe well yeah the government anymore so no no I might those days or even the possibility of those days you think I mean unless maybe I get older and I just you know I want to see kids just slipped out of tab you know let's see what happens tell Dad to calm the fuck down yeah yeah there's only one way I told my kids look if things get bad if I start to you know I'd be god bless my mom's 98 and she's all there she's great my dad passed away when she was 90 he was all there and and so I've got it not got what I'm hoping to make it a good long ways but you know that I've also seen folks deal with the problem of you know onset dementia and Alzheimer's problems that that creates horrible things I told my kids that well I haven't told them but I told the oldest witness it just wheeled dad out to the back and you guys all take turns shooting at me whoever wins gets the house so is that really what you told them yeah what yeah the old chute yeah yeah he'll he'll win my ways pretty good job yeah but if then he'll go to jail you don't want that all right Idaho I'm sure this goes on the books it says it's okay to you know no access today that's not true you're right where do they have that assisted suicides in California and I think Oregon you posted something about Idaho about people that were going up there for the Eclipse and i retweeted it it was fun hilarious from Lincoln County Sheriff that guy knocked it out of the park because everybody's thinking the same thing every was like a because literally you know the hippies I don't know maybe they're not hippies sorry that's not fair let's call them hippies yeah they just they pull there they're very a camper or they're you know they're there Volkswagen fan again right out in the middle of a planted field a freshly planted field you know because it's not not not everything is fenced and gated out there right there's a lot of space and and you know they come on or they'll they'll take they're like the guy said they'll take their Prius up in the back roads funny things about the dogs to the back of the truck and occasionally some slow learners take a tumble yeah don't go to pet them they will bite you your truck it's their truck and you'll see that you'll see people a they get upset because you drive around with your you know your your dog in the back of the truck and B they'll they'll like walk up and when I write pet it and you think don't do it don't do it he's a good dog but that's his truck the other thing about people having guns yes yeah everybody up here has a gun this is Idaho and the wildlife the wildlife will kill you kill you and it will hurt the whole time you're dying yeah that Sheriff it was great post yeah I mean yeah we got great law enforcement and I just got stopped I was we were up in the mountains and I was racing to get to the airport on Sunday yesterday and so I was coming through the canyon and heading back into Boise from up in the mountains and it's doing about well I know what I was doing because a sheriff told me what I was doing he stopped me said you were doing 76 now this is a it's a nasty ass Canyon following the river you know and for most of the way and you know you should be doing about 35 40 but I was just humming you know and I was thinking I'm making good time here and then sheriff was out because he's trying to catch hippies and he stops me and we had but they're just great you know that yeah if you show them respect and plight it's like a lot of places right it's not just idle right the guy was like yeah you know what I'm you know sorry guy give you a you know but yeah I was everything else and you end up chatting having a great time having to the conversation you don't mind getting the ticket and you know Bob's your uncle but anyway mister bake your white privilege is showing yeah that's what's happening right there is that what's happened to a bunch of white privilege right yeah you know what that's probably that's probably the case now I feel bad and I'm you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna double what I send into the county that's been what I'm gonna pay twice the amount that I should that's nice just so that I self-flagellating yeah it's not like that's a hobby most cops are great I've always said that I think that it's cops alike most people most people you run into her fine most people you run into her great occasionally you run into an asshole and then you have a problem and then you run around going all people are all assholes no maybe one out of a hundred you know and I think with cops it's an insanely difficult job insanely stressful did you see that video that one officer who was trying to get that fellow to stop and he was when he was wearing a body camera and so he he asked him to stop and he matched the description of I think of robbery and it's been on it's been on video of quite a bit and so the officer is trying to get him to stop trying him stop he won't stop he says I will tase you and he's coming around right so he's the guy won't take his hand out of his pocket and so the officer sees that his hands in his pocket when he gets kind of starts you know pie in that chart there and it kind of gets around and he sees the hand and he starts saying take your hand out take your hand again it's body cameras running and the guy pulls out a weapon and shoots him repeatedly and it's just it's all there it's it's it's a perfect example of how difficult that job can be right and I'm standing so I know whether that video is available yeah it is available I've seen it yeah there's there's a bunch of those I mean I've seen one of them where the guy pulls over this one man and the guy was a Vietnam vet gets out of his car he's got a rifle was yelling on him get back in the car put the rifle down put the gun down and guys start shooting them and he's you know shooting multiple rounds into the guy's car and the guy starts screaming that he goes around by the passenger side and kills him it's all like on camera and videos you have to realize this is a routine traffic stop pulls them over for speeding or whatever it was and this happens and it can happen all the time and that's something that's on a cop's mind every time he pulls somebody over and you might think hey I'm a good person I'm not doing anything so I was going five miles an hour over the speed limit you know why is this guy got his hand on his gun why is this guy freaking out well maybe watch that video now maybe he's thinking about his kids maybe he's thinking about getting home to his family right exactly and that's and there's nothing that the academy this idea that you can't say two things that that some people might you know think oh that counter actually yeah anytime there's you know a case of police brutality deal with it we got it it's hard course but it's a terrible job it's a difficult job and it's a dangerous job and those those two statements can coexist yeah right and there's and so you can support the police and you can also support efforts to stop police brutality wherever you know it takes place and ensure that it doesn't but you can also support the police and the difficult job they do in the efforts that they try to make that you know protect communities so yeah the last thing you want to do is alienate them further I mean that doesn't do anybody any good you denying the idea or the possibility there are any good cops well that's got fucking crazy but it's a really convenient thing for people to say fuck the police because you don't get a lot of pushback especially when something happens you don't get a lot of pushback you look like you know you're some sort of a liberal hero it's it's a very slippery slope and the people that want no cops well okay well what about guns what are we gonna do now you can just let criminals run everything yeah no no the good people with their flowers gonna take over shit breaks down really quickly really quick and you know spend a long time overseas in some pretty difficult environments and you see sort of the the worst nature of people or you know and and you know and again I agree with it I think vast majority people are good you know they want to do good they want to do the right thing I don't want conflict much people don't want conflict right and but but things can break down and people can do things that that other folks that are trying to do the right thing couldn't even a match right and yeah so anyway like shoot cops yeah yeah I mean you have to think I would never shoot a cop why's this copy and so mean to me cuz he doesn't fucking know you right right you know doesn't know you you're doing something wrong he's pulling you over and you got to comply and be polite and calm sir and try to defuse a certain situation and be as friendly and as polite as possible yeah and that's not and again that's that's the same you you can give your kid no matter who you are you can give your kid that same advice right look the law enforcement has a difficult job and you know so just if you're stopped just comply comply nobody's ever I mean I you just gotta you gotta be concise and smart about that and I told my kids out and I try to demonstrate by like when I stopped you know and the sheriff came up and you know my kids were in the car and I was polite and I was saying he got to the window and I said I don't have any excuse and I was racing to get to the airport I was speeding I know it and I have no excuse and that sets the tone immediately right and he understands I know it helps it he looks in there and he sees a big dog and the kids and everything and he's like that brings it down a little bit but I no doubt about it and so other situations they might be a more on edge because they don't know they're not sure and you know so yes where there's problems deal with it we got to take care of it and but we can also acknowledge the fact that the police have a damn difficult job yeah and it doesn't mean that there aren't horrible mistakes and horrible cops that are under pressure that do terrible things you know me there's some videos of people that comply and still get shot it's yeah it's a terrible tragedy no absolutely they make they make mistakes they have the wrong mindset or not trained properly and PTSD doubt and they're just not designed for that job in the first place right I mean it's very difficult to tell who's gonna crack under pressure the pressure of the day-to-day situation that a lot of cops find themselves in ya know it's it's it yeah but the idea that you write the idea that you'd remove law enforcement and somehow we're all gonna live in a peaceful community crazy anarchists drive me fucking nuts now we don't need laws man you should shut your fucking mouth and get rid of all the laws and a universal basic income that's going to be a good luck what have we do out the guns we've gathered them up and melt them down not mine make Martin Luther King jr. statues everywhere no you know we were talking before the podcast started about what what could possibly go wrong in Afghanistan and that yeah yeah Trump was gonna make some sort of an announcement and you were talking about the idea of privatizing the the military over there and you know bringing in you know contractors talking about from the point of view that I don't agree with that yeah and that's and I you know I yeah in terms of disclosure right I mean my company diligence we got a security services group and starting back in 2003 we started building up a fairly significant presence out in Iraq right as private contractors providing support to the infrastructure operations that were going on out there and what's the benefit of having a private contractor for the military as opposed to like without air force at that time most of our work was actually for the infrastructure companies right because the military is not gonna write providing support they need security and if al Burton is building up some sort of a new business there they would hire you guys to come in exactly and so that's an important effort because you know they need the same level of security that a Forward Operating Base or a military base or facility would need you know but the military is not going to allocate resources for private companies so a lot of the what the private contractors were doing was that and then also private contractors you know getting contracts to provide additional security support or logistical support to the military to military facilities where they can't you know they can't afford the allocate resources to perimeter security and to the degree that they would like so private contractors come in and help with that or providing support in the movement of dignitaries or whatever may be point being as we were out there for quite some time in Iraq doing that and we were there at the beginning of sort of this private contractor thing right and people start becoming aware of it and we started working with groups including Eric Prince's group we didn't work directly with them but what I mean is the various groups are out there doing these contracts and this work you know realizing they needed to start to form an association or started to get some sort of you know grip on how this thing would look right so that there was some consistency amongst training and what were the regulations for you know the various companies for you know weapons and everything else it's complicated but you know long story short it's you know we had upwards a 400 people I guess out there at a point providing security and intelligence support so I've got some experience in this and now what's happening with Afghanistan is that one of the options that's been being considered is is handing over we got about eighty four hundred troops out there right now doing mostly training missions training operations and support for the Afghan troops so the idea was well let's let the private contractor take that over let's let's move that out and let's not have the brave men and women of the US military engaged in Afghanistan ad nauseam you know and this idea is being pushed to some degree by our Prince you know and he's you know said things like well you know if you you know if you want to keep having this conversation you want to have the conversation ten years from now fine let's the military keep doing it you know or we can be more you know somehow efficient they explain that people who Erick Prince's from blah I'm sorry yeah it came out of a wealthy Michigan based family Betsy DeVos the care the education secretary is his sister in the current administration and so he started Blackwater and you know they they they became sort of the face of right because they they did very well it's a private contractor business they got good contract and that was good they had some issues and some problems a very controversial very controversial they sold the business renamed it then renamed it again and yada yada but the point being is that the idea that somehow you're gonna privatize this operation in Afghanistan expecting then if you here's a thing he cuz he said well it'd be about ten billion dollars a year which would be a savings on what we spend now you give private contractors you know a ten billion dollar trough to eat at you think they're gonna end it anytime soon it's no fucking way so if we want this thing to just drag on ad nauseam fine privatize it and put that profit motive up there and you think somehow it's not gonna happen and I cannot say that as a private contractor in you know it's been involved it why I appreciate your honesty now you know I just it's just it's the wrong thing to do and if and and on top of that if work and I guess the the overlying the the 30,000 foot view that I've got is that if it's important enough for us to be there then that's a military function that's that's then we have to commit in a way that you know we're not right now we've been in this sort of stalemate situation right over there and now we're somewhat surprised or people are surprised that the Taliban is resurgent well where the hell did they think they were gonna go there's the Taliban don't have any place to go so they're gonna wait us out this was entirely predictable that some and we're trying to sell them the pseudo federal democracy you know the Afghan people don't understand for the most part I don't think maybe I'm just too cynical but they don't understand what the hell we've been trying to sell them for all these years so this doesn't diminish all the pain and sacrifice and suffering of all people that have been out there and the lives that we've lost it doesn't diminish it at all what I'm saying is that we need to think about what's our what's our endgame what's our objective so if if we're worried now about the Taliban resurging and Isis you know kind of coming back in well fine but let's let's say this is our objective and to meet that objective then we're going to need more troops on the ground and let's see how that plays out I don't think a lot of people are gonna be happy about it you don't necessarily do things to make people happy if it's a national security interest if we decide that that's in our national security interest then yes we need to commit and do it but handing it over to a privatized you know force to me is is is just slightly left of insane it doesn't make any sense and you know it's always easy for people to stand around and talk tough and say we just need more troops yeah well I don't know that the objective is sufficiently clarified to say that we need more troops I haven't heard I don't care whether we improve the literacy rate of the Afghan people by another percentage point or if we build another Road I don't think that's in our national security interests and so I think we need to be a little bit more clear about why we're there or what we're hoping to accomplish at some point we wanted to be there so that we they wouldn't use it as a playground for terrorists who then develop and plot and plan and attack the west again so maybe the thing that we should have done was go in there kicked shit out of them like we did in Tora Bora and elsewhere explain to the remnants of the government if you allow that to happen again we're gonna come back and we do this again and we're very good at that we're very good at strategic operations and we could have done that and maybe that's the thing we need to do now and then that government's been corrupted for a very long time Karzai government holy shit they were completely corrupt and yet we all rallied around Karzai as if he was you know because he dressed well my mother was a heroine yes you know in the current government is it any better well if they're a little more clever at hiding their corruption but it still exists and more importantly the tribal society there doesn't really get this idea of you know a strong central government you know it kind of runs counter to thousands of years of self-governance out there but anyway so that's that's the thing so what's he gonna say tonight I don't have a clue but I think he does he's got limited opera what's gonna say we're gonna cut and run we're gonna leave that's one option we're going to increase the number of US troops on the ground that's one option is right there it's up Trump proposed down 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan is that it is that good now here's the thing about when it comes to operations over there and what are what the objectives are one of the things that I've been hearing from people that are in the military that I know is they say they are happy that Trump is supporting them and that Trump is kind of essentially giving the reins to the military saying look this is what you guys do I'm not gonna get in your way in fact I'm gonna support you and there seem to be one of the few groups that is fairly universally happy with his decisions in that regard and people that he's appointed I think that's right I think law enforcement as well I think is if you feel like you've got top cover right you know then you know that was one of the problems many people talked about the and we talked about it briefly about the idea of the you know sort of the narrative of sort of a battle between Trump and the Intel community yeah it took immunity had a problem with the previous administration because they kept shifting the goalposts they were going to criminally prosecute people in the agency for engaging in that interrogation program and rendition program that had been approved by the previous administration that you know that creates some ill-will so the fact that you know the military and and to some degree you know others and certainly law enforcement feel as if they've got this top cover the current administration that is a good thing and if you're if you're willing to not politicize all of this and and and make every decision related to national security based on how you think it's going to move the polls then that's also a good thing as long as you're getting good solid advice and you're consistent in your decision making process all those things are good I don't know enough about Trump to know how you know he makes those decisions but he does have good madison's good Pompey was a good person John Kelly certains a great guy McMaster all these people are solid people who and any other administration would you know people would be thinking yeah that's great you know they're very highly regarded but sort of there's this cloud over because it's Trump right and people are still not sure how things play out in that administration but if he does listen I think yeah that's a good thing but sending four thousand more troops that's not quite 50% on top of what we've currently got there what does that allow us to do well some of those troops are gonna have to be involved in security operations of the trainers some of those troops are gonna have to be involved in you know logistical support Intel collection support so you know will it make us more effective in defeating in the short term some of the pushback from the Taliban and identifying and taking out more Isis well sure okay and then and then what I guess that's my question and what what what are we doing there what is our objective in Afghanistan today in 2017 what is the objective I couldn't eloquently not that I could eloquently do shit but I couldn't I couldn't state what our endgame is there I think it's I would suppose in a big picture it's to create a stable society that will be a bulwark of some form of democracy have we ever done that though I mean we ever had successfully been involved in nation-building we have yeah we think about post-world War two okay but that was again different times yeah I mean so you can't compare necessarily you know chronologically yeah right so like when we've invaded places or when we've been a part of like look what's going on in Libya I mean we we supported that revolution and now it's a fucking complete disaster and a terrifying part of the world yeah it's a real hot mess and nobody wants to talk about Libya and and you know we didn't have a national security interest in Libya and and yet we allowed ourselves to get in there why didn't we do that a lot of pressure from the French and the Italians who did and I think we felt it was somehow I don't know why but maybe there was a feeling as if it would be easier more containable somehow but I mean shit there's more tribal you know history more tribes in Libya than in Afghanistan it's you know you get like a hundred and thirty some-odd tribes in Libya it's another thing I was responsive as a country yeah so watch Gaddafi's death together recently mm-hmm watch the whole capture of him and the whole thing was just fascinating to watch his brutal evil murderous dictator all the sudden get caught by these common people these rebels yeah you know like you know outside of his palace and freaking out and yeah hairs all fucked up and the weird thing is he was he was our guy he was our evil dictator renounced weapons yeah he had gotten on board for the most part on sort of a counterterrorism program to provide assistance or support or at least not impede I'm not saying he was yeah it was a it was a complete son of a bitch but it's interesting isn't it the dynamics involved and so we decided that was better to support the French and Italians and topple him and now you know it's I mean but that's always the case you know isn't always case to that we have these dictators we problem up and then after wobbler Jesus this fucking guy we gotta get them out of there like Saddam yeah yeah I sort of seemed in Hussein lasted a long time in that position when you think about the horrific nature of some of the shit that he did and his sons did oh yeah sons were completely monsters yeah yeah and that's a good point I mean you know and but you know hey how did it how did his presence when they were at odds with Iran you know how did that help our overall sense of strategic you know foreign policy so things happen and you don't you know it's you don't get to pick and choose sometimes I guess maybe you do but then of you it'd be a kind of a strange world but you got to deal with sometimes with the people that are out there and and you know so it's I don't know four thousand more troops in Afghanistan is that gonna somehow solve a problem it's going to I suspect kick the can down the road again it's like Vietnam what would you do where did the Vietcong have to go they had nowhere to go right right it's a totally different situation though isn't it because the Vietcong really didn't have any threat to us well what I mean is what did we think was gonna happen right they were gonna outweigh us they were going to help lastest they were gonna say that the suffering was nothing in their mind where I impaired to what we were going through and how we were processing and so I guess that's what I mean that you can't yeah everything is it's relative but I mean with this what would you do well I if you were in the situation to call the shots like someone said hey Mike Baker what do we do about Afghanistan yeah you know what it's it's it's I'm not saying it's an easy by any means it's a it's above my pay grade but B I think Isis creates a different situation there if we hadn't seen Isis develop and start to impact to some degree things that are going on in Afghanistan then I think we could be better off just saying okay we're gonna figure out a way to work with the Taliban I mean the Taliban I think at this stage of the game could be contained within Afghanistan without allowing their place to be used as a shelter for terrorism I say that now caveat I'm saying now you've got Isis and that's a different kettle of fish because they're at odds with each other so what are we gonna do end up you know in some weird fashion supporting the Taliban and their efforts to you know stamp out Isis right I I don't know it's it's a that gets real weird yeah this is what you were talking thousands of years of history of failed efforts in Afghanistan and do I think do I have the hubris to think that we somehow are going to solve this no so you know maybe maybe the answer is just find that point on the curve where you can support an existing government that you can hold your nose and live with its you know that it's corrupt and you know but at least they're working in the counterterrorism realm you know and they're there supporting those sort of interests from our perspective and yet you know I don't think we're ever gonna get to that point where we see a stable self-supporting you know pseudo democratic nation exist there I just don't think it's gonna happen so that's a hugely unsatisfying answer but you know maybe it's maybe it's like pollution you do little things you know and hope that it helps and maybe that's what we're doing here you know if you just start from the point if you were saying we're gonna create a bulwark of democracy yeah overwhelmed it's never gonna happen so you don't do anything you background I part of me just I hate the idea of leaving right I think a lot of people do who they think we're gonna create a vacuum right right and and quite frankly that's typically what happens you know in particularly with Isis you know when a president said they would see that and they would see an opportunity now you know they've they're at odds with the Taliban and Taliban is pretty brutal could they handle it on their own you know meaning could they you know destroy Isis on their own man who knows maybe but it's it certainly complicates the situation but now especially if we just decide to somehow or another support Isis now that's never gonna happen we never know I mean excuse me the Taliban yeah their battle against Isis I could see that I could see elements of the Taliban saying look we just want fuckin self-govern right okay we get it I can never imagine a scenario where the United States would support the Taliban because they're at war with Isis and then the Taliban could soften their stance on some things we reach some sort of common ground well look we're kind of on the same side with Iran against Isis right they're not supporting Iran right in a way we are in the sense that we're we're trying to kill the same people right so who would have thought that you know four or five years ago so it's that's how nutty Isis is yeah yeah yeah everybody can agree everybody could agree it's a it's the one group that everybody can agree on but yeah I don't know it's interesting so that's what the president's gonna talk about this evening four thousand more troops I you know he could have said we're gonna leave and the people that hate Trump would be up in arms you could say we're gonna add 4,000 troops are gonna be up in arms you could say we're gonna give it over to the private contractors they'd be up in arms it doesn't really matter so there's gonna be a lot of opposition to this regardless if there's a clear defined mission with an endgame fine I just haven't I don't know what that is you know and maybe they maybe they've said it I just haven't seen it well it seems like the only way we're ever gonna get peace and harmony in the world is if there's no fifth world fourth world third world or second world just one first world everybody has like suburban problems yeah yeah no I mean no never society where everybody's on the same footing impossible maybe I'll have universal basic income and across the world yeah and get rid of law enforcement exactly no Iraq everywhere I don't think that's it yeah it's not gonna happen and and you know that's so disheartening for people though to a guy like you as someone so many years of experience in intelligence agencies that you would say that there's nothing that could ever be done that would give peace in the world like generations from now which they're going to be dealing with the same issues we're dealing I mean maybe you know if the chemists can figure out a way to get us all next to see that's gonna solve it ya know I don't know you know it's it's the way it is it's human nature and I you know but I got we have periods of press you go through periods of prosperity and and during those periods it kind of helps to lift everybody up and they get to a certain level that they didn't imagine before we're still trailing but we ever going to get to a point where we're all you know we're all the same I don't I mean I hey great but I don't see it here's the perfect example the United States and Germany right we were at war in the 1940s and now we're absolutely a peace I mean is and Germany is prosperous and it's a great country and everything's great I mean I would wonder what would have to take place for this to be a worldwide thing where the the rest of the world sort of rises up to an adequate level of civilization and we no longer engage in the potential global or that we're all looking at right now I'm really looking at the possibility with Russia and with North Korea and all these different players there could be some sort of a twisted World War 3 going on Russia is Russia's punching over its weight I mean at the end of the day Russia's got a GDP you know equivalent to a mid-sized EU country right I mean so they just you know outen is very clear he wants to rebuild the Soviet Union to some degree in some fashion right and he's been he's done it through some territory it does it through energy policy through meddling like they always do but so I you know I don't like Russia but to your point yeah as with the US and Germany could we see a way that the u.s. and Iran for example could find common ground and suddenly 40 years from now be at peace and not only a peace but supporting each other's economy and you know have that sort of interaction and I don't know I don't think so I think so damn can I pour you some coffee no I'm good I just think I'm just like it's just at a certain point in time it just it's very frustrating to think that I guess the pace of progress is so incredibly slow when you look back in history this is probably the safest time to be alive ever so there's been some progress from you know Roman times to today there's obviously been some worldwide progress oh sure yeah yeah longevity and and you know stamping out disease and all the rest of those things yeah weird art it's like you know for what it's what it's worth it's a great time to be alive and people that are walking around every day trying to find a reason to be offended or finding that you know it's a it's because there's no real conflict yeah they have these issues right is that the the hordes aren't coming over the border right you know to to rape and pillage you know great depression this food is easy to find they did find the plague they did found the bubonic plague on some ticks right yeah where was that was that in Arizona I think it was goddamn Arizona that's what it's a in response to Joe Arpaio getting arrested if that's what talk about Trump yeah pardoning him yeah what does he Garrett is bubonic plague in Arizona fleas found carrying the infectious disease hey you go under for yeah you know and that's where it's gonna be it's not gonna be this is mine for what it's worth I put this along with my big pussy theory but it's not gonna be the North Koreans you know firing off a missile or whatever it's gonna be this idea it's gonna be a pandemic something that we didn't quite see coming mutation of a disease or something that because I do believe in the idea that you know nature takes care of its own eventually you know just like a deer herd or whatever and and eventually the overpopulation issue becomes a concern and and and that's how the earth tends to reset itself is always how it works yeah that would suck but another reason to be an Idaho bubonic plague and there are three human cases in New Mexico that article said and then they found it in fleas in Arizona yeah well everybody go see your doctor well survive the winter so Idaho what else has been going on why don't you tell me yeah the inside track yeah well there is that man with a suit coat on yeah I know I get this you know what I have in here else it was a pocket to pull that out when I do a TV interview I get square to get a little classier now people tend to think you know what you're talking about when you have a hankie I learned that from Guy Ritchie explained the pocket square it's amazing yeah schooled man it it's his right name so this is not something I was working on in developing this is his theory no son his theory but he is very well educated and very well thought out in regards to his choice of suits and a man wearing a well tailored suit damn is he still married to Madonna no we got rid of the check a long time ago I remember he had a kid with her well oh there you go yeah I remember Madonna as soon as she started seeing Guy Ritchie I was living in England at the time and she just suddenly all got out of nowhere I had a British accent I love it people do that fantastic I love that I love when white people talk like black people I love it's my favorite or a Chinese guy talking like black on that's even better Chinese guy now I would have you heard that I've seen it I've seen it many times I'm a big fan of transracial like people that think they're the wrong race yes that's a new thing it's one of the few trans things you can mock still can you mock it yes okay letting it go he's one that be Rachel Dolezal yeah and double ACP in Spokane that's right and they identified with Barbra Jean King yeah he's another one but he denies it he says that it's actually it's all that everyone is wrong his mom his dad his birth certificate people he knows they all lied to him they're lying everybody else and only he knows no one says his mom had an affair with a light-skinned black man or something somebody yeah who knows exactly exactly it's I can't I can't find enough energy given everything else that's going on to be offended by very much frankly I just don't care I like people to live their own lives if you're happy god bless you just be happy I'm Way more amused than I am ever offended by things like that I'm amused that's a good way to put it yeah that's a good way that's a good way to say it in more amusing than defended I just do you know Rachel Dolezal the chick from Spokane because she got in trouble you know because everyone's mad at her she changed her name legally to the blackest name the world has ever known with young Jamie pull it pull that name up this is a it's a wonderful name and I would encourage anyone that wants to be translational to do the game the same thing NK e CH I I don't know how I say that Nick ecchi amare Diallo that's her new name ready here we go again 'no kechi amare Diallo dia ll Oh hmm smoke I like the description of the giver she's a former civil rights activist enough oh well I guess because she was fired but former africana studies instructor what's Africana she decided to give up the civil rights activist thing mmm yeah silly goose but it was great when she had like afro like look at her over there with that yeah full white family orange spray tan from Lincoln County Montana little Ruth hands girl but she feels like she identifies with black people more she likes the culture more and you know there's always been people that like the culture more and talk well sure like they're a part of the culture you don't you don't say you are yeah that's the new thing though isn't that about creating and aren't they aren't that people that are offended by the appropriating like if I opened a Mexican restaurant people would be offended because yeah I shouldn't do that I should just you know I I know black people that were furious at her and then know other people that are also black they were laughing hysterically on it they thought it was what it what I think you mean really doesn't affect you it's preposterous and not only that don't be infuriated by the fact that she got caught I mean she's I mean this is it's not like having any undue influence this is all ridiculous right now exactly and also again it's this idea that people are walking around looking for reasons to be offended yeah it just seems exhausting it's like everything a and so I don't I don't know how people do it I don't know or why they do it maybe they just don't have enough going on in their lives don't have enough objectivity and they get caught up in the momentum of being pissed off about something but their culture appropriation or pretending you're something like look how many fucking people pretend they're Native American because it makes them seem more spiritual Jesus has always been an issue yeah yeah there's Warren Elizabeth why I was just trying to remember her name is right is she gonna run what if she's gonna run in 2020 gonna be a problem yeah you lied and said you were part Native American to get some sort of a scholarship that's right Harvard look at that yeah I will say this the world is so funny after when when when we went into Iraq in 2003 early 2003 people started looking at the business opportunities of Iraq right and I remember there was that that whole idea excuse me that there was gonna be all sorts of business opening up in Iraq because I don't know why they were thinking but so then it became people looking for contracts government contracts commercial sector contracts to do business in Iraq and so the idea was suddenly there was a mad rush to open up minority-owned and veteran owned and women-owned businesses so the idea was if you had a like an inuit indian you know eskimo who was supposedly in charge of your business that gave you extra points when you were weighed in the bid for a contract that you were going for so there became this cottage industry you know much like the casino business of trying to find tribes that you can represent in order for them to end to open up hey and you're creating essentially a tribe to have a casino right it gives them in a certain advantages which so it's it's an interesting it's an interesting world we live in well the Native American casino business is very weird in that regard and also that a lot of people in these areas because there are certain percentage and I think it's as little as 1/16 Native American you can get a check so like if if the casino is raking in the cash the people that are a part of that tribe ok free money yeah so these casinos are just generating like fucking billions of dollars a year oh yeah some of them are Cal you know Mar you know but but you know there are a number of them that two of them do very well and you know what for some of these I don't know about you but it's some of it I tell you what I if you want to be depressed go to you know there's this certain Indian reservations in this country that are just awful alcohol is down and exactly substance abuse lack of opportunity lack of educational facilities for the kids and that's just not that's not right right that's not we should we should be far better than that there should not be it just Native American reservations are very strange when you think about like how long ago it was that these tribes people were you know roaming the earth in nomadic fashion and living the life they did before the Europeans came and that now they've become the segmented part of our population that's sort of a part of America but has their own kind of like nation inside of a nation it has weird rules like the way they have it up in Canada they call them first nation people but in candidates real weird in regards to wildlife like I don't know if you know how it works up there but they can shoot anything they want all year round and they have it that way in Washington State as well right with elk you know they hunt elk all year round the rules are so different fishing is the same way they use spotlights for moose so like they drive at night with four by fours the moose see the spotlight they freeze they blow them away with high-powered rifles and they can kill them as many as they want all year round this is to go spotlighting kangaroos I lived in Australia I was stationed I've lived in a lot of places but I'm now in I'm in my last place now I know I'm not never moving but yeah we used to go in Australia would work done lived on a sheep station out there massive property we get in the back of the truck you know with the spotlights and you go out and those kangaroos are hard as shit to hit they are tough hunting no guys doing that for population control yes yeah yeah I mean that's be delicious you know it can be you know depending on how old they are but the the tail is actually the tastiest part why I grew tail yeah but now I don't mean yes I mean the tail they have a big tail - I've seen the money yeah there you go yeah so they but anyway they are hard to hit they completely unpredictable in their movement you know well you know and they just and they move fast and they they jump you know the defense's they can clear it's impressive I know why I'm talking about we played a video I think came from these massive herds or packs or whatever you call them of kangaroos roaming across the field like some people have no idea what the numbers are yeah you know I have friends that live in Australia let me tell me like there's places that are just infested and there's nothing they can do they don't know what I do yeah so they literally have to gun them down there's no predators it is it's yeah that's exactly right I mean what do you got dingoes not gonna bring down a you know I kangaroo feral cat you know it's yes or this they they just they're all over the place great little animals oh yeah yeah and they're kind of cute and they're tasty you know these fuckers yeah bouncing all over the place okay a kangaroo call starts your dad Jesus yeah nice so many of them and oh people are upset I guess people are upset at the kangaroo call yeah you always gonna have that well one got stuck I'm fine yeah that's not good yeah I mean whenever you have an animal that doesn't have any sort of a natural predator and they just free free ball it exactly yeah that's what they I mean in Australia is such an interesting place you know every time they introduce a species to try to solve a problem that species just takes off yeah yeah it's just and it's net it's it's never anything I was trying to explain to someone the other day about the cats there yeah that they hunt cats like like what we think of as a pet and they're like why and I'm like listen I know it doesn't seem right but the feral cat population is just run out of control like we did a podcast once we pulled up the feral cat population in America and what it does that they kill billions of birds and rodents in America yeah and someone was like now that can't be right I'm like listen they the scientists who did the study are shocked cats are fucking murderers yeah and we had a great cat named Charlie who's now died but he was he was not to a cat for the most part but he would he would kill Chipmunks and he would lay the chipmunks out in a row just like offering yeah yeah and he was incredibly efficient we try to keep him indoors but you know the guys who just want to be outside killing something so this is fun time yeah they come in and you open up a nice fresh can of cat food for him like thanks dad a little bit monk in his tooth yeah but the feral cats yeah in in the ranch's I mean you'd be out repairing fences or something and you know you just kind of get off in the or they'd spook the horses or you know put your hand down picks out him up they they just come out of nowhere and they're just you know they're bastards yeah they're not with a hello kitty yeah they're like a wild small predator that's extremely vicious and you know they kill things all the time though the feral cat problem in the United States is insignificant in comparison what it does in Australia though Australia they devastated ground nesting birds and all sorts of other species because they're an invasive species and there's nothing again there's nothing really grounded dingoes maybe but you know that's that I couldn't camp their regulation us know so and dingo ate my baby where you live is fascinating because you've got you got everything up there you got grizzly bears yeah you gotta you gotta got a healthy grizzly population I have a buddy who went black bear hunting up there and they could not find black bears they just found a horde of Grizzlies okay yeah this are easily after grizzly after grizzly it's amazing I mean it is and it is it's such a good thing when you see the sort of the health of the of the wildlife population just it makes you feel really good you know and it's you know it's hard to explain I mean people I was up in Yellowstone and and once again I'm always amazed at how people interact with wildlife when they're not used to it and Yellowstone is probably the best place to see that happen because there's so many tourists during them they're the the busy time of year and they'll just there's no regard for the fact that it's a wild animal right even the Bison and the Bison all kill you in a hot second if they get pissed off yeah and you'll get these tourists it'll you know get out of their car and you know and and the husband will be taking a picture and tell his wife to get a little bit closer get a little bit closer babe no maybe he's doing it deliberately right but but it's it's amazing she looks fine and but it is it's an amazing that's another place for people if they if they haven't been to Yellowstone go to yellow snow what seems like a zoo to people you know you see this gigantic furry starwars looking things out there I mean that's what a buffalo looks like when you see in real life oh yeah is that real yeah so they're so big they are they're massive and then and we were in we were there and at one point it was getting to be Twilight and came around a corner on us with a couple of the Rangers and and [Music] there was a vehicle stopped it was a what do they call was a minivan it was stopped on the side of the road and there were half a dozen people out of this minivan and they were all kind of fussing about you know and they're just a little bit in the field there on the side and what are they doing and then it became clear that there was a little calf out there Oh bison calf it was gotten separated from the herd and I guess they had seen it but it now you could hear it it was kind of over there bleeding and and they wanted to get it they wanted aloud meaning bleed it was yeah yeah yeah not not bleeding although that that was probably the next step in this calf evolution was they were they were trying to figure out how to round it up and get it back to its owner and the Rangers you know said ah here we go again and it's it and they said I mean look this happens and fortunately people don't realize its nature so they had to get out and then I stood there and listened while they explained these people look this calf is somebody's dinner now you know it's gonna be you know found and devoured by other forces of nature early wolves yeah and and there's that wolf populations coming back up there was great and so these people were horrified they were they were amazed that the Rangers wouldn't do something like I guess catch the calf put it in the back of the truck and drive it to the picket to the zoo take it to the zoo take it to the herd or take it home and bottle feed it it's not much you can do and most likely if its mother left it behind maybe there's something wrong with the mother and he as well yeah yeah I mean it's who knows what the what the reasoning was behind it but it was it was interesting it was a good lesson but that the places at the park system anyway I think we talked about that before it's just astounding and it's amazing oh my god and the natural the rather national parks that that we have and in Idaho in particularly you guys have a lot of public will Dern Asst you know and the Frank church wilderness is insane the size I've read a really good book called the big burn if anybody's looking for a book to pick up and read it's about in this massive forest fire that took place mostly in Idaho and it was during the course of Teddy Roosevelt's time and it also so it also covers Teddy Roosevelt and his efforts and the way that he got you know kind of turned on to conservation and the beginnings of the firefighting you know profession you know forest fires not and it's a fascinating read I mean you think about people get here to go freely I'm gonna read a book about a big forest fire but it's it's incredible and they weave in the history and the time of the administration and how they were declaring parks and and what they were doing and and how they tried to tackle this fire and what that meant for future conservation term and and it's it's a fascinating book so it's called the big burn I'm drawing a blank on who wrote it but if anybody's out there listening and wants a book pick it up how did they try to stop a fire back then especially a massive wildfire you know doing a lot of the same things that they do now right cutting lines and and brakes and trying to deprive it of fuel feeding it back on itself it was just manpower just sheer manpower and trying to you know putting up the the smoke towers and and you know in creating him back then that's what they were doing there we're just running our well you know out in the middle of nowhere you try to you try to space out these these outposts these little points on the top of the mountains where you can identify smoke and try to catch it you know like if you've got an electrical storm boom then all of a sudden you see some smoke and you realize you probably got a start of a fire you want to get on it as quick as possible so then nowadays you'll call in the smokejumpers and they'll go in and that's an insane job to try to contain it put it out but there's always been debate how what do you do do you let it burn do you how do you write how do you deal with it depends I'm sure up on the weather forecast as well weather forecasts and apartment down it was politics and it was me back then and in Roosevelt's time it was all the timber barons right in the mining barons and the railroad barons and you know they weren't interested in in Roosevelt's idea of claiming land for the public right and so you know it was I mean so fascinating is a fascinating read and and again sort of go back to that same thing that we talked about it before how did this nation get cobbled together and how did it end up look in the way it looked and Roosevelt had some real vision no he really did I mean we're so thankful we should be so thankful because of that vision we have this incredible National Park System and all this public land I talked to a wildlife biologist who said that that's one of the reasons why we have all these issues with like bark beetles and all these different dead tree issues that when we get a forest fire today it's like so out of control because we don't allow these burns to take place which they do naturally in nature right yeah and that's part of it you because you can imagine what happens if you if if you don't do that you develop the fuel over a long period of time and then you get a devastating fire right and and also apparently the carbon from those trees burning is actually good for the ground the soil it didn't know it is it's very--it's and the ability of the land to bounce back I mean no we see it a night all the time I mean you get up in Montana and in other parts parts of Wyoming you see how quickly the environment can bounce back and how often do you see like wolves and Grizzlies and stuff like that where you are wolves more than Grizzlies the Grizzlies just oh yeah they'll still you know they'll try to keep to themselves but we've seen our one elk yeah more wolves yeah a lot of everybody's got coyotes it's over they're so resilient they're like the cockroach of the mammal you know yeah they're pretty incredible but it's yeah it's I'd say if if you're you know if you're looking at an accessible trip you know I get this all the time what would you do where would you go if you had like two weeks you know they take the kids and drive them somewhere I would just point the car towards Utah Idaho you know Montana Wyoming and just you know just head up there mm-hm and then just see what you can see you know you got plenty of opportunity to the tremendous number of excellent parks and you know show the kids something different yeah I just let them understand these vast vast swaths of land that are just open wilderness and take the electronics away oh yeah oh yeah don't ya hide those in the trunk god we're starting the kids all start I'll start school tomorrow and they know as soon as the school year starts that's it they don't get us to electronics no that's good oh yeah no more I mean unless they have homework or something like that's just too easy to find like escape in that yeah from life in that is critical for young minds even being bored I was reading something about the power of boredom and how important it is for creativity that is the kids are there yeah kids are never bored they never like have to think of something to do they can always just look at their phone look at the TV look and it never activates that part of their brain were there searching and thinking that's really interesting I hadn't thought about that but you're right because hey we tend to plan everything for them mm-hmm okay now you got to go to your whatever your hockey lesson right go to La Crosse now it's gonna be baseball now you've got chess club or whatever the hell are you doing yeah you're right and and it's also it kind of goes back to that idea that we used to manage these things for ourselves right and yeah so kids would go out and they would organize their own teams and I worry about that - I mean I think God you know just the ability for kids to meet up at a playground and say okay we're gonna head you know maybe it happens and I'm making too much of this but we can't have that because Bobby keeps getting picked last it's terrible for his self-esteem meanwhile Bobby's gonna become a software coder that makes the AI that runs the world it's right now that's what happens right all the chicken watch Bobby yeah Bobby gets pissed and Bobby becomes Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk I just said chicks am I allowed to say chicks yes you'll say chicks a chick so just like you still mock transracial people yeah all the games all the Broads that's we gotta keep all the Broads you're gonna want Bobby decoder broads a weird one isn't it cuz they're not really that broad yeah I can't that happen in Dame's we're not really private dicks from the 1930s so I guess that what Dame was that Dame was I don't know I think of The Maltese Falcon or something like that was a damn a private no no I mean I mean they would say that they would say you had a dame home I walked in my life changed right but bronze is a weird one cuz it's fun to say bronze is like a bunch of guys fucking broads if you broad I'd love to saying that I feel like I should be smoke this cigarette alarm say yeah bring a cigar for sure yeah yeah martini there's not a whole lot of things that chicks can say about us like that though like Bros it's sort of like how black people never had a replacement word for the N word for white people like honky just does not have any negative impact it doesn't work but like it's a roll back it's a real historical throwback honky that doesn't work remember the last time I heard anybody's white trash like whatever that doesn't hurt yeah but like broads is a funny derogatory term for what women don't I guess bros their bros douchebags yeah that's probably that's probably more more to the process respected but white oriented though bros are always white people you never say about rose and it's black guys I don't know that wasn't yet Jamie because you're younger you'd be a fuck boy that's true right but that's out of people too like black people like that's Ian Edwards as a hilarious bit it's a it's everywhere it's Universal though hmm it's across the board so we can all agree on fuck boy yeah I don't know what that means I don't I don't does it mean like is he Tory term okay okay yeah cuz I mean in some circles who knows maybe that's a good thing I don't know right yeah couger wants a fuck-boy it's like speaking Italian wrong I'm sure I'm not getting it ready think you got it right because if you're in a situation where you're like an old broad who's got a lot of money and you want some young fuck boy yeah he wants a car right it's good yeah he's not good at fuck boys not gonna sell for a Prius you had some personal trainer at Cougars got to spend some cash yeah she's gotta get him a Ferrari sort of like got the guy who owned the the was it the the Clippers that guy the old man fucks his name Donald sterling sterling everybody had that broad he got her he had a broad right he did a broad though she's a broad she's a broad yeah and he got her like a Ferrari and a bat lean bought her a condo but the Broads used to work in the steno pool right I mean you know the one that in the steno pool in the office environment back in the 60s I think that's a no you know Marge to come up from the steno pool and she would take notes and then you know do the letter or the paper and you'd post it in the mail and that's how you got business done that's alert whoa that's a stem day look at that if I was one of those bras I'd be like I'd rather be a hooker there's some dudes in there though probably not be a steno pool now maybe just okay guys a little do they allow them to work with women back then I don't think so what about steno pools two cubicles and back again Wow fuck all that say you learn about stand-up pools I've learned about fuck boys that's a trap and a half though isn't it Majan working in a place like that I was like what where are you going from here yeah and the other one was the telephone command center take that picture up on the upper top that colored picture look right there the one with the color in it no the girl holding up the sign oh do that swimming in the steno pool by Lynn peril Oh God a retro guide to making it in the office look at that big that modern office equipment that there and then lower left-hand corner sense that the date of that book no more writing with a crayon see nowadays yeah to the office environment is much more dangerous now I think it's much more fraught with with potential for hazards and landmine look at that that recording device there boy look at that thing see so he was talking and she had to transcribe all that as I was gonna take a dictaphone what is with the guy with the bowler hat this is a movie Oh guys like a spy or something oh yeah that's it because you know we all used to wear dress like that I know if you can zoom in on that but that was actually we would get that after we completed training they would actually give us an outfit like that though yeah and then the bowler hat like that's nice then we would set off on our adventures likes what's that new movie the Kingsmen so what it is a bunch of spies out there kicking ass I have not seen that teaching you deadly skills like how to kill people with a pen never teach you like skills like how to use like regular weapons yeah sure field experience oh yeah I mean you know it's it's it's like knowing how to fire whatever weapon you pick up off the ground it's simply knowing you know what what would work and most of its common sense right I mean in terms of what would actually you know do the job but yeah I mean it's it's just it's just field expediency which is good was it in Madison information be polite be professional and have a plan to kill everyone you meet at Madison maddis we're talking John Madison James Madison wow they were tough son of a bitches back then no so Madison ok Mad Dog Madison love to say Mad Dog didn't he yes he was absolutely in love with Mad Dog or that name well you liked it because he had his own like hitman yeah you know I don't know what do you think this is going do you think he's in for four years and not more be polite be professional but have a plan to kill everyone you meet that's the kind of guy you want in that position you want to go things like that and anybody doesn't understand that well I'm glad you're not in that position yeah because and that goes back to Afghanistan we're talking about what's the endgame if you're gonna do this don't let it let's not draw a you know it kind of let's not do this thing where we're dying by paper cuts or whatever II want to call it just and that's kind of where it's been I just feel like we've been in a holding pattern yeah for years now when it comes to Afghanistan without really knowing where we're going or where we want to be when we get to the end of that road and and you know so if somebody like Madison and people in general the military understand if you if you're gonna do something you do it to win that's your objective and I worry that well maybe 4,000 troops is not exactly doing it to win it's doing what they feel they can get away with right and I don't know where that gets us at the end of the day yeah I don't this whole Trump thing is getting weirder and weirder with every day so to even predict where we could be six months from now forget about four years from now yeah or three-and-a-half years from now I think that when you look at some of the stuff that he does you really have to wonder about his mental health and I don't I don't say that like you know there's a lot of people that are saying that I think cuz because they would like to think that he's mentally incompetent it'd be convenient for their argument but when when I read that I don't know what agency it was was trying to get the IP addresses of people that visited an anti-trump website hmm do you hear about that accessions is working there that's that's insane yeah because I could have visited that site if somebody sent me a link you got to see this crazy anti-trump site okay that doesn't mean I'm a part of that community or anything like that you can't get IP addresses from someone visits things online either side any time I don't care which administration it is I mean you can argue I mean yeah it's just the the potential for abuse of power I've always agreed with that I'm a small government person so the potential for abuse of power is is always there and needs to be monitored you know the potentials catastrophic yeah because as soon as people lose confidence and that's one of the biggest issues with Trump as a president if people lose confidence in the institution like one of the things that was very disturbing to a lot of people was that when he had those Russians over and he was explaining how Isis is thinking about using laptops as bombs and they're like jesus fucking christ this is top-secret shit you're not supposed to say that because then this could potentially compromise people that are embedded in Isis that are distributing this information like you have a bunch of people you're giving up this information there's a trickle-down effect and it also diminishes the potential for people to trust the office right this person let's see that all the time you see that I mean the previous administration had problems were they sort of in their desire to rush to the podium to declare a victory and something there was a disregard for sources and methods and disregard for for the importance of occasionally you know secrets are good in in many cases when it comes to Intel operations you want to again you want checks and balances that's I completely get that and of course people are like losing their minds I'm going I can't believe it CIA guys talking about checks and balances because you know I'm sure he doesn't believe it but it's true the place you know for that is in the committee's and up on Capitol Hill where you're supposed to have an engaged aggressively curious inquisitive operation up there between the various committees that are supposed are charged with overseeing you know the work of the Intel community and and oftentimes they do know exactly what's going on they just play this game where they disavow any knowledge when it looks like this political blowback there's a fairly well-worn path between Langley as an example on Capitol Hill for the briefings telling people this is what's going on this is what's happening and then you know the general unwritten understanding is you know they're going to be assholes if becomes politically expedient to do so they'll disavow that they knew about it he'll demand in it's just so it's a game that gets played sometimes but yeah I think I think that it's it's hard to say I've got I've got friends who were very hard left and they're convinced that that trumps on his way out in the not-too-distant future I think that's a lot of wishful thinking and but I don't think he's gonna make it four years I might be wrong it just doesn't seem like it I think he's also incredibly resilient though yes he is he's unusual in that regard he's also a guy though that wants love and respect and wants to be a winner like everything he does like in regards to you know business decisions I mean he'll tank something personally himself to declare a victory right you know you got a wonder whether or not we would put someone in position you know to say like the fake news is so out to get him to what we've done is we've created a structure that's the best people for the job and then I'm gonna concentrate on business and helping them from the outside I mean you could escape right and have some sort of escape route there's not there again it's it sometimes seems as if there's no grown-ups in charge of the messaging that comes out of the White House all right and it's been the case since day one basically and part of it is you know maybe people say well that's the way he likes to play it he likes to play people off of each other and he likes the chaos and they well you know what he never ran a big organization people imagined or thought if they didn't if they you know if you didn't spend any time up in New York and having watched the Trump Organization for years and years and years if he hadn't done that then you imagined it to be this massive organization well it's not it's always been kind of a family business right and it's so the chaos that's around that shouldn't be a surprise what is a surprise is that you know he wasn't you know he wasn't sharp enough for what I don't know what it is they to understand the importance of inserting the discipline in there and at least if nothing else being consistent and disciplined with the messaging that comes out and just quit the fucking tweeting people say oh I love it that's what makes him him for people it's entertainment you know it's like it's a portal for fun like your fun I mean that's what you're getting out of it you're like you're seeing the stupid shitty rights and go oh my god and you correlate some of the time so that he writes it yeah I don't but that's the thing I don't you know again I get it I understand people you know people are excited to have a genuine person who's not a politician in there and you know there's some benefit to shaking the system up for sure it needs some shaking but you know how much shaking is actually been done I don't want that ima yeah I'd rather the president not spend as much time watching TV or tweeting and working to try to accomplish something major in the way of tax reform or even the healthcare problem good lawyer yeah and we're not even to get that done I think there's also a real problem from the top down when the commander-in-chief likes to personally insult people I think when you do that you you make that kind of behavior not just acceptable but standard yeah well it's like what with your kids yeah and they kids you know if they were probably more to the point it's like people we talk about the fact that nobody keep their Yap shut right so secrets get out there right now and that's because we've created this environment if it's okay for a former defense secretary or former head of the CIA whatever when they get out to write a book right and they're getting paid millions of dollars to write that book so you know they got to call up something interesting if they do that over a period of time and they've been doing that then people down below think well why the fuck yeah right I'll sign the same agreements to keep our gap shut but maybe it's okay right so it starts at the top I think you know and and and it's just like with parenting you know I mean they got to see you do the things you tell them to do otherwise kids are sharp enough to think well you're not doing it right right you know so I think it's you know they I don't know where I was going with that I tend to get I tend to get distracted whole and destroy well this is a distracting subject because it's really difficult to see how do we get out of this like oK we've obviously got this guy who's running the country's doing a lot of things that people don't enjoy they don't like they see a lot of problems in it and they don't see a real light at the end of the tunnel it's like what's the best-case scenario is this guy gonna get us in a fucking war with with Korea so we realize like Oh North Korea and us well you know we're going to war now this could have been avoided we got to get rid of them I mean what what's the worst-case scenario that has to happen where we can survive as a country but still just recover from this the North Korea thing is you know is it's kind of frustrating in a sense right because nobody should be out there thinking that and I'm sure you know very few do that somehow we got to that point with North Korea because President Trump is president right we got to this point with North Korea because we kicked the can down the road for you know two and a half decades of failed foreign policy with North Korea and in part with China and so they've been very clear about what they wanted to do and now they've gotten to that point where they've created the weapons program and the ballistic missile program that they want or that they are close to having and you know when you get to that point you naturally lose some of your options you know so the decision tree gets smaller and you know Trump happens to be the president in an office now when North Korea reaches that stage and North Korea is pretty consistent in the way that they've been behaving you know they're always you know doing the same thing they throw their teddy out of the cot when they get upset they want some attention or they feel they can get something out of it typically they do get something or China get something that then they're willing to rein them in to some degree and just like you know Trump could well be the guy sitting in office when Iran gets to that point because anybody who thinks Iran is not spinning the centrifuges and continuing to work on their weapons capabilities is somewhat insane I mean that there is no John Kerry said the whole Iran deal was based on verification you know on and we don't have verification we don't have we don't we haven't gotten access till to some facilities that we would need to see right we signed off for the previous administration signed off on a on a study or assessment basically just to get the deal done because the Iranians insisted that that investigation into their capabilities at one of their military sites come to a clause wasn't like we suddenly got answers and we were satisfied that there was no and we just okay that was part of the deal so we'll end that investigation but we don't have that verification so Trump go to my point being Trump could just be sitting in that seat when North Korea gets where they are when Iran possibly you know cuz I could happen sooner rather than later and then yeah then you'd like to think that the person in that position would be rational yes a little more reasoned I read an article today that's saying that that him saying all that crazy shit about fire and fury that the world has ever seen might have actually been what he needed to say when you're dealing with someone like North Korea and they're the I mean was obviously an opinion piece right but the art the argument was that when you're dealing with someone that's as fucked up as Kim jong-un you're probably better off having someone as crazy as Trump as president who's gonna say some ridiculous shit like that so this guy goes all right this guy's just as nuts as me there could be and then frankly those messages that he those things that he said we're probably more important in terms of how China received them than how North Korea received them and honestly 20-plus years of measured diplomatic language and restrained talk didn't really do anything it just kicked the can down the road so yeah maybe maybe a different approach in a measured fashion but the problem is because of their sort of the perceived chaos nobody has the confidence to believe that he's doing it in a disciplined reasoned way right so they don't look at it and go yeah he's saying that's a message he's sending Brian they just look out and go he just you know blasting off another tweet except scott adams scott adams is the only one that believes some large clever master plan we miss Scott at us Dilbert Dilbert yeah I know about that now Scott Adams like the most rational logical intelligent Trump supporter that's ever lived and he's not really at route support he's didn't vote for Trump because he talks about these things he doesn't want to vote for president because it have a stake in the game but he believes that Trump is a master persuader and that everything he's doing is because of the art of persuasion it's very interesting interesting yeah I yeah it falls apart under scrutiny well kind of fell apart with this argument with a podcast with Sam Harris pretty fascinating though I mean it's it's it's I can see where people and I've heard that from Trump supporters you know with a joke about how he's everything's measured everything in his own way is is is actually disciplined because I've said numerous times that I think they lack discipline and they said no no no no actually this is it's all part of the plan I don't think you know it doesn't look like it's part of the plan because you've got other people that are in those senior positions that seem to be scrambling to catch up to the plan and if it was part of the plan he'd like to think it was you know it was it was part of a conversation amongst the the cabinet yeah anyway yeah so I don't think I you know I don't think we're you know missiles aren't gonna be flying between US and North Korea I think China may actually see at this stage of the game they may see that they need to affect the different mindset for North Korea and they may be doing that and and part of it may be again not necessarily because it was a reason thought-out plan but Trump's comments about the trade imbalance with China right and if the Chinese legitimately thought that we were going to you know put that under the microscope and maybe attack them on the trade imbalance in a serious way then maybe they look at that and go okay if we can get them to back off then yes we're willing to extend ourselves and actually listen to the sanctions and take part in the sanctions and you know exert some additional pressure on North Korea that maybe they weren't in the past because trying to always accidents own best interest and so they're they're looking for something what are we gonna get out of this and maybe so maybe that's you know in anyway in the meantime it seems to have resolved itself to some degree but I do worry that you know once again we're just kicking it down the road you know I mean until there's something some sea change where you know maybe somehow we can affect a unified you know Korea with China's assistance it's going to have to be with their assistance and blessing obviously or something along those lines and to get actual deterrence you know off the table and more removal of the nuclear threat you know we're just going to be doing the same conversation in another couple of years when they rattle the cage again and we have to figure out how to resolve it and the further you go down the road and the better their capabilities get the fewer options you have so well Mike I'm sufficiently depressed thank you very much it's my job meet up again in six
