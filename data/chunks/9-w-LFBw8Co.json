young Jamie 3 2 1 ladies gentlemen my favorite farmer yo you're my favorite farmer I'm your favorite farmer yeah I don't know that many of them but you're number one all right I have a feeling that I don't quite farm the things you would rather use what do you mean like marijuana is always try saying I wasn't gonna say it but if you're gonna bring it up I love wine dude you make fucking killer wine okay I'm a fan of you want so there you go I have yet to try your food but I want to I didn't even know what an Austria was until I talked to you see I didn't know or that use falcons to kill birds and that fucking thing sent me it's dope as fuck yeah so you have hired Falcon you hired up a person in a couple that raises Falcons to kill pigeons that are fucking with starlings sparrows anything anything that's messing with the grapes they have that these Falcons come through and then the thing is the collector birds in the area they'll have a memory of that so like if you have this hawk come through the the vineyard and they just pulverizing those feathers everywhere that the community of birds kind of go oh I don't think we should go this way we should go that way the cage with the feathers everywhere and then the pigeons on the other side is like what yeah that's a snag I was in Venice recently last week I'm still jet-lagged I'm completely fucked I haven't slept solid in five whole days my body does not know what's going on I'll go to sleep completely exhausted and I'll wake up two hours later feeling like shit and I can't go back to sleep but when I was in Venice there was a guy with a falcon he had a falcon with him and I was like why does have a falcon and then the fucking pigeons come in like crazy and when the guys there with the Falcon that the pigeons just ghosts they're gone they take off so this guy stands there by the dock in Venice as the gondoliers pull up and he's just got this Falcon just sitting there too so that the people can eat their food the pigeons are insanely aggressive it's a ridiculous place until they see they see that Falcon done fuck this yeah the RC videos online where the Mongols use they use Eagles golden eagle to hunt for wolves come on dude it's wild an eagle which weighs like what 15 20 pounds they fuck wolves up they swoop these wolves are just running for their life as death swarms down from the sky we were gonna use the drone to get some footage of the Falcons and we're like she's like yeah that's probably not a good idea yeah cuz the blades he goes no no your drone cuz the Falcons will go full force into your drone and destroy it so whatever you paid for it try getting the insurance company and going hey my drone broke what did you do you're a falcon they're gonna go yeah good luck well Parrish and falcons don't they go like 200 miles an hour you're the fastest animal on the planet boom fuck fuck what 200 miles an hour yeah destroy your drone I mean that didn't he make sense well yeah this is the Mongol so look these dudes run the wolves are running away the Wolves know the fucking drill two men and this Eagle just comes down and jacks the wolf and that's how they skin these wolves look at that two of a boom good God yeah they are death from the sky and these guys raise them and then they wear the wolf hat yeah they will the skin the furs everything but it's just so so that's it what are we talking about what do you whatever you want to talk about fella I hear you got some news yeah so I figured I know there's a lot of there's probably some cool fans that will probably tune in to this specifically to hear some news yeah so rather than being a dick and waiting for the end to tell them I probably should probably tell them up front are you like softening in your age no not at all I just care I just I care about that as long as things have taken for us because we're a very difficult band we're very stubborn and we're you know we're kind of ignorant to what goes on in the rest of the world and so people are like guys come on guys and you know I mean to their credit like we did the whole Betamax thing didn't work for us and either did laserdisc so we had this new thing called digital media and streaming we're going to try it out you got extremes there's a thing it's a new thing streaming so you can just say I like Spotify that kind of deal yeah yeah it's brand-new yeah like which is on your phone or something to us it's brand-new what are you doing with it we're gonna put some songs on it Wow so you can listen yeah well you not even like plugged in any incorrect so here's what I'm gonna do now because this is by the time this actually airs this will have already happened but you're filming me doing it right you're gonna upload sweet I'm gonna do a thing that everybody know I'm I'm a Tweaker do you have it prepared and everything not really so you you're doing this because you're fans which are very rabid you have rabid fans the tool fans are particularly enthusiastic they're pretty they're pretty aggressive they're yeah well that's cuz you guys are awesome thank you you fucked up made an awesome band you got some radical fans okay so Wow when if you release this podcast the idea was that if you set it on the podcast without letting them know first yeah they deserve to hear first they've been very patient with us very patient so this Friday August 2nd don't dump them the catalog the whole catalog catalog goes up on Napster on Napster I should be worth hamster I've heard that's great that bars guys really upset about it yes you should talk to Lars about this he's got a whole thing he's gonna try to figure out figure out it undermine him yeah he's gonna stop him strike head look goes up on all digital and he's doing this on his phone right now I was we're talking dreaming so up until this time Matt's you never have had anything up and available no you're like what's his name Garth Brooks yeah he doesn't have anything up either no comment Garth Brooks doesn't he he just wants his but it's kind of like a good artistic choice he doesn't want his stuff to be broken up into songs he wants you to download or to buy his entire CD because he feels like there's a correct order for his songs he says that that's what he says yeah we tried to which I had that would for him people feel like no no we want you to hear our whole album as you know in sequence and people like like you play them like oh yeah we've never played right I'm not the guy that said no no we want you to yeah that's because that would be an absolute lie you know yeah Garth Brooks has some weird things of course Garth Brooks is being currently harassed and away we go by Tom Segura so what's up hey get up there beautiful it's out there in the ether it's out there so why have you guys not had anything on streaming up until this moment bye yeah no yeah I love my brothers I'm just gonna take the fifth on that one okay so there was some sort of internal discussion or no discussion or no discussion yeah just the the typical tool time of like what was there was a meeting mm-hmm well again this is what you get with great artists you don't get great artists who are also the best promoters correct the ones who are the best promoters usually they're not the best artists also we're gonna do today yeah you doing nothing is this like one of them late night things are you selling knives oh yeah extra yeah I do want a knife because I sell them you also have some old stock in beta yeah and samurai swords yeah no I'm gonna announce the name of the do album you like that yeah you doing on your phone first fear of a black planet and River black planet in a queue um white guy spinning on an album called the black plant which I can really go over well and yeah those are the least woke thing you could do much money would buy the first copy fear inoculum is the name of the album fear inoculum who'd you say we buy the first album I'm not gonna say that again I don't know what you said I might have said cowboy journey cowboy Cerrone yeah why would you say that I don't know cuz he swears that cowboy hat I just assumed that he's got a lot of black friends I think you're out of line I'm totally trans with all these black so now he's gonna be mad at me now I got apologize you're joking you probably want to hear this he's probably too busy jumping a jet ski over a bridge just jealous above his hat so August 30 you in the maths you got some money you got a hat of your own yes I do it's like a sinatra hat it's if you weren't so cool that would be a douchebag hat that's in Breaking Bad yeah right there I like it I like it on you I like it on you it looks good on you it does there's there's things that people like you could pull off one of those buckskin pioneer jackets with the fray you could pull you know they have that what does that stuff call the tassels that hang down from the size of the China where we go in a way we go yeah you put it on Instagram as well we've just I just put it under your man will get it on Twitter in a minute cuz I'm good more important things now people will shut the fuck up he'll leave you long I like that little setup to that you got there with the laptop / iPad I didn't know that they made that kind of a case that doubles as a keyboard No look at you all right farmers with technology right beep beep boop beep beep beep so how's the wine business it's good we're a little late this year things about two weeks behind so I wanted to ask you this because this is something that like a lot of people that are dealing with in the Arizona area that you guys had a lot of rain right yeah yeah yeah so I know like hunters and people that are like into the wild by favorite thing that are really excited about this fall because there's so much moisture it's like they've an animal population to be very healthy uh yes and I mean it it's you know with anything there's there's always gonna be both sides of it with with extra rain in the spring comes extra foliage extra ground Carver extra of grass right and then follow the root systems know then it then there's extra fires cuz then when the rain dries up you have all this raw fuel yeah so fires there's probably good a lot of it would be a pretty intense fire season I've been evacuated three times yeah I got evacuated in October it came real close burnt three houses right in front of us we we were in the epicenter of that Woosley fire oh god yeah it was pretty crazy it's what but you know it sucks and it's terrible but if you live through it the thing that it lets you know is you're not your shit you're not your stuff oh yeah absolutely when we left you know we to wake her kids up at two o'clock in the morning and I said to my wife I'm like you know what so we're fine I'm just grabbing my laptop and some fucking underwear you know you go to store and buy new pants and like if you lose all your stuff you're alive the only thing I know I make sure I know where it's at is the is the photo album yeah the photos that I haven't scanned or with Ryan MacLeod or whatever got the photo album and the dogs and then remember to grab the family yeah remember that that's important but yeah it's like natural there's something crazy but that's one of the things that I really do miss about living on the East Coast with horrible winters is that there's something comforting in the brutal force of nature that just forces you to recognize that you are helpless you're helpless to the blizzard yeah Michigan remembered you know the drifts on the side of the road fuck five feet ten feet yeah it's crazy you still make it you still make your way to school you get there you get there but there's something about people are so fucking cool when it when it's really snowy like everybody's more humble doing cool shit it's like it puts you in your place yeah it's good yes we we talked a while ago we was talking about this this idea of this sit down remember I kind of talked about that a little bit how did like how to do this and of course I'm so busy everything that with it what I got going on I I would never be able to pull this off I would never be like hey I'm gonna be the executive producer around this idea that I had right so I thought this might be a good forum to go hey you and I tee ball it up to go somebody run with this because I think it I think it's something that needs to happen and we can take about five minutes to riff on what it shouldn't be okay right because I think that's really that that's kind of what when it comes down to is trying to make sure that we're not it just doesn't turn into some other clickbait reality TV show right all right because that's not really the point of it so what do you thinking okay well you and I were discussing there's like all this stuff going on in the world every is divided and freaking out and going down the dopamine rabbit hole of of you know clickbait and we can talk about that hmm I feel like the polarization of everybody everybody has a position they're taking up the stance mm-hmm and this cause and I get that to feel connected to feel like you're part of a movement - for injustice or whenever I got completely get that you need to do that but I think at some point when you start fighting with your neighbor you start to kind of lose connection and I think these things man these are just they're a poison in terms of dividing people and forgetting they have these conversations openly yeah the concept we're looking we're gonna lay it out the idea is that we find six different people from completely different backgrounds that have a very strong feeling about something that they feel strongly about just something whatever it is and we get them on camera or in writing or whatever they state that they state their position and the idea is that get these people together with each other and not fine not talk about what they don't agree on find the things they agree on and just build on the things they can agree on mm-hmm and then at the end of it we go back and make sure we interview them and the inner the way that they went into the thing whatever their statement was about who they are doesn't change they they believe what they believe but in that without compromising the core of who they are they end up finding in somebody else an agree to disagree position where they can actually talk to each other and find out what they do like no I feel like one-on-one in person with known around people are much more likely to have those things the real problem is when it's being projected to the world and you're looking for likes and you're looking for people to agree you're looking for support and that's one of the really toxic things about the phones and social media is that everybody's playing for likes and the virtue signaling and the throwing up the the flag of righteousness it's so common and I'm just talking to a friend of mine she's working with a young woman doing a research paper on the very thing and she kind of hand me some some research that kind of I kind of suspected and I was like what about this business and kind of not not off topic but kind of on topic the purpose when oxycotin first came out was that they discovered in that drug something that interrupted and helped fix people were you know meth heroin addicts it was helping them get sober and getting off the heroin because it replaced that feeling that they were getting the dopamine womb-like feeling mm-hmm that escapist thing that they were getting from heroin so they would get you know use the oxycontin one problem is that unless she cut your hands off you can you're gonna take another one she just replaced the heroin with another thing that's like the dopamine dump and this is they're now finding that that whole process of likes and you know validating or not validating you know that you could depress cuz nobody likes your post and your concert was looking a rat you know basically the analogy of the of the rat and the aquarium that's keeps hitting the cocaine button yeah it's the same thing it affects the same part of your brain and they're finding just that absolute connection so if you can't go ten minutes without looking at your phone you are an addict yes understand that the actual chemical reaction in your body to the to the charge you get on that and the fact that it's fed by adjusted titles whatever the headline is if that's not getting it they adjust the headline to see if it gets you now and then you click on it go that's the one and then they adjust that one and it's the it's the rat hitting the cocaine button well I'm glad to use that analogy because one of the things they found out about that because some biologists didn't like the they didn't didn't jive with them the rats with the cocaine so then they thought about the environment that the rats lived in and they said well let's look at this environment because he's rats are in a cage this is a very unnatural environment there's lights on there's people staring at them so instead they put rats in a very rat-like environment woody and grass and trees and in a natural rat world guess what rats didn't fuck with the coke they left it alone right they only hit the coke when they were just destroyed like their life was top turned upside down and they're living in this completely unnatural environment they're living in prison so when you're in prison you'll do the coke but when they were in a very natural world they didn't find it attractive at all okay so on that note I would suggest just the people who help now I've read those things that I put up about the new album and everything so I'm gonna request I'm gonna beg people who have seen it now I'm not sure where this is going alive with this going you know tonight it's gonna go a couple hours or tomorrow okay great I'm gonna beg as a favor to you and to me for people who read that news and are excited about that news to do us all a favor turn your fuckin phone off turn your computer off to your TV off go for a long walk just go for a long walk somewhere even if it's in the mall or whatever just go somewhere else go out go talk to a stranger and just find out something about them no matter what it is just go talk to somebody just get and go out of your house and go have a conversation we can get people stabbed yeah probably please straight unless they have a knife and do not talk to them because they have a knife that I did that does that cover the lawyers yeah you don't want it you're not approached violent unstable people don't do anything dangerous yeah don't do anything dangerous but just go out just just go out for a walk yeah you have a family you have young ones do you how do you approach that with the kids well you can see you can see the the fight and the fury and then crazy the crazy meltdowns that we have with our five-year-old when we're saying it's time to come to dinner put your iPad down right and it's an absolute fucking meltdown and it's insane and when we actually get it away from her and we Kengo and we had to explain honey this thing is not your family we're your family this thing doesn't care about you the stuff on the other end of this thing doesn't care about you we care about you she's like let's go get the docs and we'll go get the docs and then within five minutes she's forgotten about the iPad because she's playing with ducks and she played with Doc's right we're in the you know we're in the aviary with the finches and we won't check on the wine we check in the firm answer she comes down while we're trying to record music and she's like sitting on the bed listening to what we're doing hmm she's involved in doing things and she forgets about this and you can't forget about this I'm telling you you can do it yes you can't do it I use it for you know I use it for business but I try I got caught up for a while there I would like find a video game on my phone I'm gonna play this video game before I know I've like spent like five hundred bucks and purchase something shit like wait a minute I'm doing the exact same things that I did when I first started the game it's no different I just need better armor doesn't get a buy the armor those in-app purchases of the devil yeah so I delete and you know I delete those things just get caught up in it different you can't it's it's something you don't people don't realize how you've probably heard it with a bunch of people and you're saying same thing like it's rewiring the way that we think and the way we behave yes and the only way to undo that it get away from it is to literally turn it off or unplug you walk away go do something well I know so many people that have switched to flip phones a bunch of them just like the drug dealers know Joe comics mostly they they have a flip phone to make calls so someone so just dealers know and then they they keep like a computer for the other stuff or an iPad like re my friend Ari he he he'll you can call him on his flip phone he'll talk to you but if you text him you're making him do that fucking some thing that we used to have to do we post you four times to get an ass end up that being a part of a bit yeah you're a nightmare so he doesn't have any apps there's none of that but he'll do like Instagram and Twitter and shit on his iPad okay yeah that makes sense yeah it's the only way he does it yeah that makes sense it does make sense it's like for him too he's he just recognizes that he can't he'll if he starts getting on it he'll he'll be on it for seven eight hours they're gonna be furious at himself like what the fuck have I done I've done the same thing I'm even though I've got three bands and three wineries and a restaurant and all those things I still waste I ended up wasting time on these things and I could get I could get more done if I didn't have these things in my web do you read comments I try not to yeah which is because people are just you know they're just they're they need to have a voice and they need to be identified and the gist there a lot of mean-spirited things out there and I feel like the world we're living in right now there's so much back and forth and there's so much posturing and there's so much disconnected disconnected disconnected behavior that you we really just need people to reconnect you know their loved ones especially in your community because as things are progressing in the world of the population and climate change which I believe there's some stuff coming you need to connect with people you really need to figure that do you think the shit's gonna hit the fan yeah I do yeah when how much time we have we're uh well I'm at thought you had some connection with this I want to go north okay I'm gonna go to some wooded area yeah well you'll be fine I think the the moon I don't think it's gonna happen right now I think I think and your based on some of the things that I've kind of seen online and you know that the chitchat and hearing overhearing conversations with with people that are you know part of NASA and those kind of things and they kind of go we've got 400 years and the planets done whoa 400 years yeah so if you think and you know for me I'm I'm a pipe plan right Bronner that means that if it's good if it's you know if we're not here in 400 years well when's when does that start well that started yesterday really I mean when you think about it there's natural resources and there's all those things that start to kind of fall apart and then we're disease to start showing up mmm-hmm weird funguses that take you out that didn't before well another thing to think is we'll have only been human for quarter million three hundred and fifty thousand years whatever it is there's gonna be something next yeah you know whatever it is it's coming right it's gonna be something that can survive this so if this stuff can figure out how to cool it so yeah it'll become so it may it may be huge a tree I met a severely when I was seven years old he's completely stable yeah for sure who thinks the world's gonna end in 400 years that's such an idiot why did I say that out loud that's a bad thing I don't think the world's gonna end but I think it's very likely the human beings will be drastically diminished and I'll like that's that I guess I should back up that's my point the the thing that we just are so arrogant about is that we're somehow included in the future which is not included we're not included well I've been here for again 300 whatever thousand years right that's not that long yeah you know I mean even Neanderthals have half a million years before us right so going back to now though mm-hmm and us getting along now and surviving better over the next little bit going back to our like the people talking to each other yeah how do we you know how do we see this up some we can take it and not ruin it with a reality TV show because they you know that every reality TV show you see it's been manipulated you know yeah they'll they'll poke the person then they know is going to blow up at some point so that it causes drama again the dopamine dumping oh my god yeah they're basically doing clickbait in terms of how their program in the tone right so how do we how do we make this so that it's not an opportunity to make a balk and to do that like a genuine healing moment it can be done I think it's got to be done online and it's got to be done with no one involved other than you and whoever you want to be involved no advertising I mean that doesn't even have to be you right but whoever the person is right that that facilitates this yeah but you just can't have any producers you can't have anybody with a vested interested in success okay it has to be done just purely for the idea purely for the exercise of getting people to communicate that have disagreements and realizing that so much of we know people dig their heels in the sand and they they want to be right more than they want to be right you know more than they want to get along and be harmonious with each other right there's a there yeah and I feel like that's yeah look I I acknowledge that there's monsters in the world there's fuckin monsters they're in there in there in us we have our own monsters inside of us there's other monsters that have been nurtured over years to to hate each other or hate somebody else whatever there's that nurturing you know nature versus nurture monster I get that I'm talking about the people that you can figure out a way to like let's just let's figure this out most of us yes most of us can figure out a way to evil and most of us can go south to most of us in the wrong environment with the wrong people and the wrong feelings and the wrong drugs and the wrong jobs and the wrong community we could be horrific neighbors or getting the coat button yeah or we could be a part of a community and I just think that we're not designed for this life own fucking world we're not designed for it and this getting likes and you know in arguing politics on Twitter for 16 hours a day there's a few people that I follow on Twitter that I only follow them to see how how toxic social media is to their life I go when I look at their feed and I mean I know what they're doing they're just fighting with people all the time but I'll look at it I'm like Jesus Christ this guy started at 7:30 in the morning and at 9:30 at night he's still going and he's posting every 14 minutes and he's probably reading in between that so his entire day is comprised of debating you know a Oh sees value in merits versus Trump and versus this and that and whether or not Elizabeth Warren's Native American and who's it's like chaos it's just chaos trump trump um he was he's got his name on buildings and oh he's he's the the politician he's not Briana politician and he's draining a swamp do you know and uh politicians me neither yeah he's anti-politician though you might like him okay but is he in politics why is it president United States yeah I don't like politicians you know is anybody good at that who if you if you had a magic wand you can make someone president who would you make it man yo guy I wouldn't - I'll ask I wouldn't wish that on anybody yeah three not Bill Hicks and Kesey and although he would because that would probably change him do you think it would yeah I think it changes again it's like it's a reality TV show it's gonna change you when the cameras are aimed at you mm-hmm when you would you replace recognition with attention it fucks you up mm-hmm especially like at a young age a young you know like the boy you know the gay boy band like child actor you know anybody the child actor I yeah I mean I know people that are exposed to that world early on and it's a it's a dreadful mess it's a dreadful mess but they have to go through because they don't understand that attention isn't that recognition yeah and well service development withers develop few people that have actually made made it out of that I don't think anybody is Leonardo DiCaprio I feel like I'm still an artist right he's like yeah he uh he holds his own as an artist yes I don't know what he's like behind the scenes and see like fucking shredding cast with his teeth because he's I would come out by now okay divorced thing he does he seems to like to fuck young pretty girls she's weird yeah I just I feel like I feel like that that poison of of the attention is is kind of like that it's like that dopamine do yeah it's the same thing if the likes the like buttons well it's one things that I really admire about your choices that you've decided to get the fuck out of the epicenter yeah like this is just too much gravity yeah there's too much there's too much that's and also like the the decision to start a winery and to like what you've done is kind of gone to the earth I mean I mean it sounds corny but really what you've done is that I mean obviously a very sophisticated farm system and you you know you have acres and acres of vineyards but what you're doing is the earth you're growing you you're a part of nature and I think that grounding in nature in in that way that you're doing it is a perfect antidote for like this Rockstar life which is all but I mean you know that's that's a byproduct I think for me but as far as the community I'm finding that that core of the green houses and you know growing growing vines it's actually kind of feeds into what we're talking about as far as the conversation because I talked to I talked to batshit Portlandia types I took you know a talking crystal clutches I talked to staunch Republicans that you know look at me like I'm gonna start trouble no matter what you know but I can actually talk to everybody because we're we're growing things and we're building a smoke we're building our communities so as far as politicians are concerned the ones higher up they got there by being really good con men and Liars I feel like in general as what we see but down you know at this level at the local level you're just trying to figure out simple problems that you're trying to solve within your state within your County within your town those politicians are you know you got to work with them but they're less crazy they're less owned mm-hmm yeah so you can actually kind of conversations with all these people especially if you have a grounding in terms of literally the ground literally the ground I mean your this I just think there's something's it's it's a part of the whole human experience of growing things yeah I agree yeah I mean I think what you've done is pretty badass it's the ultimate smart move you know in terms of like dealing with that especially like the rock star world is so strange because it's so image based with so many you know I mean this bunch that don't even want to talk I have had rock stars that wanted to come on here but they wanted to only do it at night and they only wanted to have it with no video they wanted it to be audio only in America we don't want steak I just wanted to be me well there was like they were cultivating a thing it has to be dark in the room I want candles like okay I'm out we're out we're doing we're gone this is not yea that's not but you know guy remember that they probably they were probably messed up the reason they're yeah the reason they're doing what they're doing is because something happened to them earlier on where was a you know an aggressive you know teacher uncle somebody that just kind of you know a dad was drunk you know there's stuff that pushes them in that direction to be you know expressive Catrina controlling and you know wanting to be acknowledged and do it exactly my way mm-hmm because I was powerless as a child yeah for sure right and then that's the thing you think you see with actors too and they finally get some success the the the whole process of auditioning for things is so brutal because you just do you like me do you like me I want you to like me do I get the part I don't get the bar oh and then you go through this for years and then finally you do get it and then finally you're the fucking man like oh look it's Mike likes the star hello Mike Mike look we've got your your bagels ready Mike and your trailers ready and then Mike is you get me a fucking coffee you look over Mike anything for you and that people act in this disproportionate very insane way and then as they get more and more famous they they feel like they're entitled yes this treatment yes yeah it's real strange yes oh you know and that and I feel like that's I've seen it in in our world between bands you know my bands to listen for a perfect score all of them you get two you get two spots where you you feel entitled you're arrogant you are greedy like all those things all those things are in all of us and you have to check yourself when they come up yeah or not and you end up being like the bands that you you are talking about yeah it has to be this we won't do it that's kind of dumb but well bands are odd to write because you you're managing personalities you're not just it's not just like one person with a creative vision and they put it down you have all these other people and their ideas and you gotta work it out together and this all sorts of weird shit going on right sorry once you do we show it off let's check out my likes no I was making sure because I posted that Indiana watch when I make sure Dino knew that and then we posted it because then he can talk to release oh yeah release that's a lot of weight lifts up my chest it just is it yeah yeah I took that's a lot of work are we are the four of us are a lot of fucking work and just to get it just together anywhere just to get an agreement where you're okay we're all agreeing yeah we're gonna release it yeah everything's a fucking committee meeting and it always gets shut down what's the hurdle well success when you get successful you think you're right about everything and you're pretty sure as that individual yeah I am right and you are wrong because I'm successful and we're successful because of me not because of you and so you it's it's not that bad with us it's like that's the dynamic yeah there's a dynamic of like you know I want this and I've I've always gotten in my way and that's why we're successful because I don't compromise on this or that and it's like I you know I'm the same way do you find any way as a parent you sort of have more empathy for like fucked up behavior and thinking because you kind of understand like oh you you got bad data as a developing unit yeah you were fed the wrong food or the wrong information rather you know I think like food I think if we discussed this before like I think there's a 50/50 on that like you can you can only guide your kids so much they're gonna bring you what they're gonna be they're gonna grow up the way they want to but you can try to do is go like okay let's just teach you about stoves before you actually have to learn about stoves yeah the wrong way so you know like the houses there yeah so you can kind of do some of that stove work early but eventually they're gonna have to do some of that stove work on their own yeah but instructor in our high school which is funny because I you know we are he's extremely public and I'm you know the Liber kid but um he used to share a lot of really you know nuggets right wisdom and he would always have a say you know what is an intelligent person a person who learned some experience who's experienced other people's experience right yeah not just your own right learn from your own experiences but also pay attention that you don't really need to play Russian roulette to find out it ends wrong don't get close to the Bison at Yellowstone don't try to get a selfie with the Bison see that video know as a nine year old kid he the whole fucking family they apparently got within five yards of this fucking bison know they know come on and then the Bison charged with a nine-year-old kid went flying through the air the thing about the nine-year-old kid landing though it seems like she landed on her feet so I'm hoping she's okay I haven't read anything to the contrary so in my mind she brushed it off and she's like whoo can't believe I flip like that well I mean it's like a you know if she survived maybe a broken bone would be a good reminder yeah sprained ankle I want this kid to have a sprained ankle yes but I just I don't want the kid I want the fucking parent to get one of those weird diseases were like when a twin falls down your disease no okay it's like the mom here it is watch me show you this bison just to leave the newscaster boom see how she lands on her feet though I'm pretty sure she's okay watch this whoo bang I think she's all right I think she's all right the thing is did it trampled or after these fucking assholes this is the problem with zoos people and this city life that we live what people do not know what the fuck a wild animal really is yeah you're not supposed to go anywhere near those things we're gonna find out they have instincts to stop predation and their instinct is to charge head forth with this fucking 200 but they do with a red shirt on too like didn't you lunch ass honey you should have jerked them she stepped in for the little kid you piece of shit okay over here you fuck I mean it's a 2,000 pound gigantic animal that has to fight off wolves and mountain lions and bears and and yep you're gonna have your kid five yards away from me you know we've had a lot of friends the musician friends yeah I want to come out man I want to work harvest you really don't know you don't want to work you really don't want to do this I mean I want you to and I can make it a pleasant experience for you I absolutely can I can make it go fairly seamless but you're gonna learn some things you didn't know about yourself fact well you have to work hours yeah real that's why we can't go to dinner tonight we've got apples waiting I got I have some Chardonnay already fermenting you have an apples oh yeah I'm gonna make cider in the morning that's what he do you picked the apples now yeah I have it on the morning I've got 40 trees my dad and Randy she's kind of in charge of the orchards and vineyards you saw that you saw some of the greenhouse footage yeah Randy's doing that so my dad and her picked probably about a half a ton maybe a ton of apples already off our trees so I get back you know tonight I fly back tonight and then in the morning we're shredding shredding apples into a bin like applesauce and gonna inoculate it and inoculate it with what I have I already have some Chardonnay that's fermenting so I'll take like a gallon of the Chardonnay just put it in with with the apples so that it'll just start different so bacteria from the Chardonnay yeast yeast is already fermenting you Wow that's about us so you so knock you later with something that's already it's a wild yeast it's already fermenting and so putting them with those letter and let it finish up and do you do this at a stable temperature like does it have to be we know we normally keep the site or we've been kind of keeping it like you know 70 68 and again a cool room not out in the Sun hot and not back in the cold cold cold room kind of you know 60 between 65 and 72 but how much cider will you make with all that how much did you say I did half a ton we did Logan there's more there's more apples coming so we'll have we'll probably end up with about 8 barrels worth of cider there and that's about good Lord 200 cases no versus about 300 cans yeah I got 300 300 flats of cans so yeah so it's fairly limited production until yeah like commercially oh yeah I wouldn't it's not gonna be commercial it just being our tasting rooms oh that's cool yeah Wow and so how long is the process how long does it have to ferment well once once they're picked we can actually the cool thing about apples is they kind of keep kind of just kind of stack them up in the in the and the walk-in cooler on site and then we gather them all up when there's a critical mass bring them in shred them so that day I will shred them probably about a week and a half later the fermentation is done the hard part is separating the applesauce from the juice that's that's our part so a lot of people will get them super ripe and they they crush and press them so they just get the juice right off the must and they firm at just the juice other people will shred them so there's just like apple sauce and I'm gonna try to press that through a very specific press that kind of gets the juice away from the what's the benefit of the former versus of the latter I do the third one I make it and I shred it so there's applesauce and I'm s you're fermenting on the at m-- on the must on the applesauce hmm and then I press as it starts to separate I'm starting to pull the juice out once it's fermented now have you done this because you tried the other methods and you like the flavor of this one better so how many times you've guess I guess I've done this 40 right that's because I'm a liar I'm good at it no I've done it once and it turned out so because I want to make sure that that wasn't an accident I'm gonna do it exactly like I did it last time just see if it turns out the same and when you did it did you do it based on someone's recommendation or did you have a I did based on my my experiences with fermenting grape signs really yeah I just kind of look to just process and went okay I see I'm we're gonna get some stuff and our cider is extremely dry it's not it's not a sweet cider you normally would think of like slightly sweet cider this is like a acidic dry cider very refreshing and is this decided it's available at your restaurant yeah at the Osteria Don and Scott sale at the American vendors location in Scottsdale and at the caduceus cellars tasting room and the closer first door and before a if someone where would like where would I go where would I go if I wanted to try your food and drink your wine like what the spot I would recommend well the easiest one a second trip if you want to take a long trip you want to go up to up to Jerome and cottonwood area to go to those locations or three locations some different things happening in each one of those but if you're just kind of in Phoenix area we have a location over in Scottsdale and Old Town Scottsdale so I'm definitely in Feeney one of my own Phoenix I've got I've got two nights in Phoenix at the Comerica theater there you go so there you gonna hits like soon you can hit pizzeria Bianco you have to hit there you got to get southern rail Beckett's tables number oh yeah so Beckett's table southern rail Tarbell's F&B which is in Scottsdale Scottsdale has a reputation for cocaine and parties yeah but it's also got great food yes so it's a very interesting place it's got it's a lot of people just have escaped some of the problems in other cities and gone to Scottsdale that is a fact yes it's a weird place I've always felt whenever we had it we had some decent success up in the valley like we put the vibe that we got with the farms you know farm-to-table not just any farm our farms to your table vibe and the you know our vines to your glass scenario that's funny John Scott feel like okay this is gonna go we did it we're like we're gonna need more makeup implants yeah that's what I'm talking about yeah it's a weird party town in that way yeah it's like a lot of really pretty women but the specific kind of pretty like pornstar pretty the dudes are super pretty - they're pretty - yeah yeah handsome spiked hair oh yeah they got the tan jacket and damn oh yeah you got a good check into motorcycles no helmet yes I mean if you're gonna be in Scottsdale it's a great location but there's so many so many great chefs and restaurants yeah in that area there really are in downtown and if you're gonna be a Comerica you're right by Bianca's you gotta go to Bianco's what is that is an Italian pizzeria taco Oh Chris Bianco he's got two locations Town and Country and he's got one downtown but he else his other place oh my god I'm gonna forget the name right now that's so dumb I'm so I'm gonna get so much shit for this his other place and right next the other person next to me I'll go is a town in country oh my god I'm having a brain fart it's great handmade pastas and the dishes are amazing again I'll check in with you in December yeah you remember it I remember it by then gotta get off the CBD lil man is Matt surrounding your brain man you can't be too relaxed right yeah that's CBD fucking it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will fuck you up though this is one in one one part if you don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel they feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on IP Provins terrible for you alright really really behind what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally dunno I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff like I just in desperation and Europe like had some sore muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to figure out how these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haines is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile moab fucking ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taken ibuprofen every day of saying taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen about what it does to your gut biome and how much it fucks you up it actually creates inflammation and it actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I calm up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that shit every day you just can't do it and you're fucking your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen two times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was fucking him up crazy death chasing that you know yeah so fuck ibuprofen okay well don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take some Tylenol or some shit it's not tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time I didn't realize it was doing what you said yes I was more icky than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom didn't hear coming ahead yeah and then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff it seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is uh people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right right you say you're in the city I just I just talked so much shit about no it was just a part of an elaborate show listen man I smoked pot all the time and I talk shit about pot it's the people it's the fucking people that are really into pot they're annoying they're annoying they just not any Rosie no Eddie maybe he's gonna jump out from an inaudible no he's gonna know this is I got this from this is from Tommy Chong yeah yeah good lord that's a baseball bat Tommy Chong's not playing games and he wasn't doing this since the 70s and he's still alive seems to be fine it smells scary like you just smell it and you're like this is gonna bring back memories I don't want anymore we got rid of those why are you bringing those back the problem is dummies the problem is not pot it's like the problem with every single thing like it's the problems not skateboards the problem is people want to ride skateboards in the edge of fucking skyscrapers right good point that's the problem it's like with everything it's not it's the implementation of the idea in a really stupid way that's the problem all right it's not pot people smoke pop it's the same thing it's but you can you can apply that to almost anything yeah hammer it got it you can destroy something whether you can build something with it exactly so it's not really a hammer it's you exactly again exactly yeah but there's some people that are functional on it all day like be real from Cypress Hill I did his show he's got this hot box show I can't believe how high they get their high all day long and then they keep going we got how so high before the show started I was like well we must be done we're gonna go sit he does this show called the hotbox and you sit in this beautiful old Cadillac and smoke weed and talk about life and I was like well surely we're done we can't be smoking more wrong it gives you these bats of weed and you climb into the car and it's just a fucking thick cloud of smoke to his be real he doesn't fuck around but he's lucid completely functional you talk to him guy exercises he's healthy it's real friendly real friendly it seems fucking seems to work out great for him yeah but not for everybody yeah I'm like I'm the pot guy that's under the table freaking out yeah what do you think of what bothers you when you get high I think just paranoia anything a noise a thought you know they're trying to get me like it's super like paranoid paranoid you just get a little bossy be Joe go potty Joe no I'll take one first I'll show ya we're gonna be fine yeah yeah thank you you know stick with wine yeah did you fuck with whiskey yeah I do I got a thing a little collaboration with with angels on the bourbon out of Kentucky they took some of my my fortified wine barrels and took them and they're finishing one of their ports and one of my barrels come on girls yeah whoo so it's port the same as whiskey port is a fortified wine from Portugal right so you also there are whiskey there an alcohol company yes yes so angels envious bourbon but they do Ryan bourbon in Kentucky and they and they basically they have a whole thing about their angels every bourbon is finished in pork barrels ah so they'll find you know I have to get him from Europe or get him from California whether you know they're a fortified red barrel that's had wine in it sweet rich wine and they finished the the Bourbon in these barrels mmm so now they have some of mine to do a special caduceus collaboration you're one of those people that I talk to that I go where the fuck does he get the time cuz I do a lot of things but then I talk to someone like you I'm like no I don't know you do a lot of things well yes it's organism you know just organizing your time and delegating yeah I mean cuz that's really what it is is when you get when you're younger you want to go I did that I did that oh I'm doing that and then you realize I can't do all of that so always I have friends there our team of people like I can't we have a Puscifer store in Jerome Arizona and it has cutting so we do we do printing in shirts we have a barber shop in it we do a full and new and used a shop yeah it's weird for a bald guy a barber shop I don't use it except for you know the man scooping new and used vinyl on top floor with all kinds of personnel you're like you know band stuff but also like a whole kind of a gelato shop do people go there hoping they're gonna run in you probably but I don't run it my wife does she's absolutely I couldn't do that I couldn't do it at all rather she runs a top to bottom all the ideas for all the Puscifer merch is all it's all her she does she runs it it's great we just added a popcorn machine oh yeah nice yeah this is just you do that and you Jitsu - yeah how well here's the thing I did you just do I just don't do it very well because I don't focus on it all day yeah I've learned about you Jitsu over the years and now I'm doing a little bit of more time I suck at that too but I'm doing some I bought a bag yeah gloves what kind of bag the first X fresh Jack's yeah that's a good bag for you especially XIV had some hip issues cuz it's very little it's uh it doesn't it's not hard it's a good bag to hit I've got a couple different bags out there all one those the one I want to have mmm because I got the shorter fat one right yeah it seems pretty heavy yeah that's a different one in the ball mm-hmm the balls good yeah and Bostic yeah the sack one yeah for knees that uh the one that I have that heavy bag is great it's cuz it's it gives like it's good for tendons and stuff cuz like a lot of people you hit those big hard heavy bags and you know you can do that when you're young but as you get older and you've got 20 years of blasting into bags full power after a while your joints just start to fucking they just start to say fuck you yeah well I'm finding that for me my friend Todd got me into doing the muy Thai because he's like look we do Jiu Jitsu so much and on the road you're like you know you got some like we know we can only find this black belt in town with you and he's too 10 to 20 so I'm you know trying to deal with this weight and like I'm kind of sore now for the show and I'm that's not good the bed is not eating beds never ideal and you're in the bus and you're bouncing down the road and some like it looks it's like a coffin right and then as some kind of palsy all the way down the road you're just trying to sleep so we he went let's just some let's do some muy Thai because it's more opening it's it's left you know you're gonna go and back them you're doing more twisting and just that rhythm and that's a good workout like I'm it's easier on your joints to yeah so I you know I got into it for that reason just to kind of stand upright more so you have someone holding your pads for you yeah well he's got a lot of you know all over the world he's done you know great trainers everywhere so we roll then and it's funny that you go into one guy and like yeah do this what are you doing don't do that last guy said I was supposed to do that like you know different trainer different yeah you get a lot of that for sure there's a lot of people that know for sure that they have the way to do it watching the infinite number of how you wrap your hands videos on YouTube no bro this is the way it's the only one the only one way this is the best way my favorite is the ones you slide on and then you just spin it and they velcro on it's like got gel that goes over the knuckles don't they slide on like a little glove it's great all right I love those it only has like maybe like 4 feet of actual wrap and then you slide these things on you do like that be sitting there like it's in the tube like some guys get super serious about folding over the knuckles to you for seven times and then you put it over the knuckles then wrap it down and through the finger bags for the gloves the gloves are supposed to be the padding it helps but you're also what helps is really strengthening your hands there's a lot of the problem that people have is that they don't do anything with their hands they just hit things like which is fine but to really reinforce the structure of your hand you should use those captains of crush grips smash down those things they'll they'll create better tendon strength and like that I like a mullet and sitting like a Camaro and do the hand thing like this those guys use the captain's a crush ones those motherfuckers are like 160 plus pounds do you say you got one that's like 190 or something when you got that load the level 3 is 280 what do they look like it's like a knurled steel pipe or aluminum outside and thick heavy spring it's like a hand gripper but it's like okay a real legit hardcore one and so I'll do it this way then I'll flip them upside down and do it that way and then also you know I do a lot of chin-ups and a lot of stuff with my hands that's what it looks like you've seen those fucking things but those are just supposed to be like in a Camaro it doing that no okay not anymore those guys are dead whoa Jesus goes to 320 to 365 yeah only like five people in the world I've ever done that is so crazy that's according to what I was reading yeah I've got the 140 pounds that's nuts so how far down do I go let's see yes sure yeah start with the 1600 but I mean it'd just be more maps you want wraps bug you just want to be able to sit around the idea is that they'd have like a ten all this most bi I've met guys who are fighters like really good fighters that have small hands and I mean small hands meaning like the structure the hand I mean the meat the meat of the hand they have they don't do anything where they're gripping all the time or pulling all the time they're strikers so they just wrap their hands up and you know when you're just doing this all the time and throwing punches you're not really making your hand stronger it's the way to make the hand strong is you've got to squeeze tennis balls and squeeze you know there's different putties that they may grip keys yeah gripping keys is fantastic doing like if you grab a jujitsu guy's hand those hands are made out of wood like a really good jujitsu guy like and a lot of that has just gi's and gichan ups and shit when you throw the ghee over the chin-up bar and do that that's that's fantastic too but when you do that yeah you do no gear just ski I do mostly ghee well so yeah yeah but I'm you know I'm finding on the road it's just traveling it's easier to do the nogi because i can rinse that out and shower and it's dry by morning do you use special soap and make sure you don't get any fucking cooties yeah that's enough it's it's crazy yeah yeah cooties are real man oh yeah they kill people well I noticed like you know and it's been I remember as a wrestler mmm you never really saw this stuff you saw a little bit of it but like nowadays it's like they're getting disqualified at Regionals because they've got a spot on the Mac and they can't go wrestle and they've worked there's a whole season to get here and it's like yeah we clean the math we do all those things we clean the stuff like where did you get that well staph is in your body and particularly when people blow their nose you know and they wipe their nose and their thing and then they were they roll that stuff your nose has all sorts of staff inside of it and people get staff in their nose as well if they get an abrasion in their nose and that stuff gets into your skin and you don't clean it out it's also your body has to be healthy and one of the things that happens with wrestlers or any competitive athlete is as your body is going through training camp you are building your conditioning but you're also compromising your immune system like when I was fighting I used to always get sick I poor nutrition I wasn't really that smart about it but I was always getting sick before like big events also nerves - yeah nerves conditioning all that stuff breaks you down so with with athletes it's that are doing any sort of combat sport where you're getting scratched and marija ly susceptible to that stuff so you got a like defense soap is my thing I fucking love that stuff because it's all-natural you're not doing anything like when people use antibacterial soap on the hand the problem with that is that kills the good bacteria - what you want is something that really reinforces the healthy flora but prevents all the the cooties from growing prevent staff send me that yeah I'll have him sent my friend Guy Socko runs a company he developed it because he was a wrestling coach and these kids were getting staff and ring weren't shit he was trying to figure out what the fuck is this so he came out with these natural cures for it so I'll just tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil okay it's just healthy yeah and after you train just wash your body with it and leave it on you leave it on like you suds up leave it on for a minute or two and rinse it off and then if you got any little scratches he's got some ointment you put a little and it's all-natural salt just good for you healthy and then also as good as probiotics like anything like kimchi is really good kombucha is really good acidophilus from yogurts really good you know so what about what is it the that's in the kimchi that that works is because they've they let it go to vinegar that the volatile acidity is what actually has the probiotics in it but yes I do I have olive ology that like 20 olive trees and so you know we do the brine solution it's its salt and vinegar mm-hmm solution that we're that we're curing them in is that have anything to do with that at all sure the the the thing about kimchi is it's a proven health probiotic like it's it's one of those things that people have been eating for thousands of years and it's just good for your overall well-being know more about this yeah so cultures you know when you're eating these probiotic cultures and there's some really potent ones you could buy that or you know they're required like there's some that you can get that they live on their own substrate so inside the little capsules there's enough of whatever they can feed off of where they can be active without being refrigerated but there's other ones that you have to buy a really hardcore ones that you're getting that they have to be refrigerated okay but the what I like about the food based ones is first of all they taste good they could be a part of a meal I don't have to I like kimchi so I eat it all the time kombucha I like it I drink it all the time and it's just it just reinforces all that healthy flora okay you know so you it's basically got like little soldiers to fight against the cooties you're just really mean you got to think of your body as an ecosystem right your body is not just you your body is a host of bacteria so much so much so there's more ecoli living in your gut than they've ever been people ever you know it's all just a part of you so you just reinforce the good stuff and keep the bad stuff away when the commune system gets compromised especially through hard training and then you get scratched and that staff just gets did you get a grip on you and gets a hold of you it starts to go and then it gets systemic I mean fucking people die from that stuff they really do staff in fact especially that mersa stuff man there's a remember Kevin Randleman the two fighter yeah he had the most horrific staph infection I've ever seen in my life where he had holes where he would lift up his arm and you could see a hole in his underarm we see his muscle all I mean through the skin look at this look at it let's you see it up there good lord yeah like look at that go go large with that look at that fucking hole that red stuff that you see in there that is his chest muscle and he died young man and I think it probably had a lot to do with that and I think what happened with Kevin is if I'm not mistaken he just let it go a little too long and that medication resistant staph infection that MRSA stuff that's the scary stuff that stuff that's evolved in hospitals and because of people using antibiotics and just you know I do my best not to take the antibiotics if I can but if you get that stuff you gotta take it they locked you in a hotel room or in a hospital room rather and they just IV the fuck out of you and you'd have buddies that were there for weeks my friend Denny his knee was fucked I mean he has a on his leg like a salmon got gutted and they had to go in there and just pull out pus and constantly try to disinfect the area and he was in a hospital for a long time just dealing with his knee and this and this is from jujitsu from jujitsu yeah he's a world champion his uh his knee started swelling up and he was I was going to ask you more time here's my gauge so many UFC fighters get it and they wind up fighting on antibiotics because of it cuz they're fighting it off you know Kevin Lee when he fought 20 Ferguson as he walked into the Octagon I was looking at his chest I was like that is a staph infection he's got a staph infection on his chest and he went up getting staff apparently the week of the fight he was like you know what we're just gonna have to fight just gonna have to deal with it like jeez but but for him like for Tony Ferguson when he's fighting a guy with staph you can get staff from fighting a guy with staff get staff from other people - Wow nasty yeah it's cooties let's not do that my friend ari was limping around the pool table once we were playing pool he's limping so what's going on he was I got a spider bite like let me say he pulls up his knee ah go Dallas I know staff I unscrew my cue I go dude we're going to the hospital right now he goes you serious I go fuck yeah I'm serious I go you could die I know that it's huge you have a pussy filled up staph infection on your knee that's compromising the way you walk I know that thing is gonna get systemic and it's gonna get in your fucking brain yeah my dad got bit by a brown recluse that's bad and he went to the hospital didn't is in an area that has brown recluse right I'll say again to do no don't problem with our hospital they're like yeah you know here put some of this on there he's like I think there was something else wrong so it comes back a day later going what do these rings mean it means now he's got a hole in his leg that he's having to stick gauze in all day long and take changing calls - yeah and he still has like a dent in his leg where it like it ate away yeah what could they have done if they caught it early just give me antibiotics you know we're not sure just take this didn't do that but just take this make sure all they do all they had to do I don't deal with that thing for a month is crater in his own leg makes me nervous about hospitals when you hear about nurses get off on killing people look every every so often there's some nurse it just gave people lethal injections or shit just one movie makes a great movie does but you know like by the way if you're a nurse I'm sure you're awesome it's not you I love I love nurses doctors I love all those people all healthcare practitioners and first responders or and lawyers yep them too but there are some dirty people out there they're monsters just happened to be nurses right spiders I'd be fucking spiders putting holes in your leg yeah call my god spider bait for laughs you didn't live around raus thanks to you got serious rattlesnakes you live well then the rattlesnakes are pretty they're pretty good about just letting you know yeah yeah they just let you know they just kind of go on their way there they don't really want anything to do with you yeah the the tarantulas same thing they just kind of go the other way tarantulas look terrifying but they're family they're pretty docile they're pretty cool yeah they just hang out the nutless gonna test at Rancho La Hawkes you gotta watch out for was that tarantula hawk or was that a giant orion be looking fingering it up fuck these things what is it you gotta get a photo oh the world is so scary you see two people that bear the lorda in the our by sharks that I'm not sure which one it is somebody can chime in oh jesus that thing's big okay yeah I've seen these things before yeah fuck that's huge they like they they find a tarantula they jump on it they infect it with their eggs and so the trench is like I made it out of there and who wanders off and then dies and they larva come out of the tarantula Oh ain't you dirty bitch yeah so their thirst their sting is like you know level their top five wing a bullet ant like that kinda yeah yeah like like a centipede centipedes on the list but like not above centipede really do you think that's why you have one yes is that you bro give me people to bite no that's me being terrified of Senate no that's your right hand right and I know hey you know what now my ring name yeah no centipedes are just there's those things like that caused me to shriek like my grandmother I can jump up on a on a counter Maynard the set appeared yeah I could it's got a ring to it I like it I like it yeah yeah they're creepy maybe I'll fight Tom Cruise have you ever seen a centipede attack or Mouse no but so apparently the centipedes sting is not as intense as the as the tarantula hawk from what I read I don't know I don't know who's doing this but there's they need to like I don't know man weird hurts what hurts words the tasers that the pepper spray get back to yet a certain job how do you know at a certain moment you know and once you get to that bullet ant level like how it's supposed to be like getting your arm slammed in a car door for 24 hours like how do you know there's something worse than that you have another one that's really bad too is like yeah also several dollars to get yourself stung by a tarantula hawk and woman see what happens it last I don't know this that's the thing this is a crazy guy he has a YouTube channel right oh yeah what is that guy's name again coyote yeah what did he get stop it I was for a while I think we're supposed to get him on the podcast what is his name again coyote what his channel is called brave water I came here he goes Oh bang look he's doing to himself get me get me ah look at him wow first I wouldn't even want to put that jar back on I'd be like weeping whoa coyote Wilson what's his name well I would say its whole name coyote gets done poke find out this gentleman's name cuz I feel like an asshole now priority Peterson coyote Peterson why they call Kylie Wilson look at him there ah that is not wise yeah but neither is that leather hat he's wearing Wow what are you gonna do the bracelets look questionable as well I think he said this was the worst of anything yeah I'd like to tone pants on some of the pants that's the worst of anything he doesn't put it like he goes and finds everything that's the worst thing you can do and does the video like this watch him just deal with it quite a few of those guys that's a what a weird way to make a living just get fucked up by the nature works for Johnny Knoxville mm-hmm I want to show you a video of a centipede killing a mouse that's what I had here doesn't show you their horrific centipede verse typed in there's a whole bunch of things that pop take your pick away you want to go with mouse because it's particularly aggressive and the way they attack mice eat mice so although it's third down third down good watch this watch this smells like hey I'm just a mouse I'm kind of cute just chilling hanging out here in this weird blue floor I'll fuckin Jesus Christ the thing about Santa bees too is they don't just say am i hungry no they know what they do and what they do is fuck up a mouse that is right out of the movie alien right oh my god dick the mouse is like Jesus fuck and Jesus look at him he's already dead I mean that is goddamn crazy the mouse is way bigger than him and he's burrowing into his fucking spine right now it's twitching and trying to stay alive the thing about it that's so creepy is it's not necessarily hungry like it just that's what it does it sees things it kills it look all me I'm here with a mouse like a bison and a nine year old yeah it's like I'm hearing with a mouse in this weird little fucking environment that doesn't seem natural at all but I'm not gonna think about that I'm just gonna kill this fucking mouse that's what's important not not why am I in this I pushed on me why did I do that now why did you because I'm afraid of these things so you put it on you yeah what else you afraid of get divorce papers on your it's so I know I just you know I put something on I had a friend do some tattoos I could I have this snake oh the rattle things that you're afraid of you put on yeah well this side is dragons because I'm here the dragon but this is like where I'd like to make your moving of I don't that movie you don't know the year of the dragon back would make you work before you went crazy all right it's fucking great I'm a young Mickey Rourke okay not Mickey Rourke and old there's two different humans young Mickey work in ol Mickey Rourke young Mickey Rourke was like this like super serious amazing actor did fantastic films like really good yeah angel heart so what had died first so didn't he get like in a motorcycle accident and bonk his head is that what happened to Kurt here's the edge yeah there's a trailer of it oh no he became a boxer he boxed as an amateur when he was young and then when he was an actor I think if I had to guess and I'm gonna just paraphrase and I apologize if I got it wrong but I think he felt like Hollywood and acting and I know he's quote he's been quoted on this was so fake and so with lack of a better term feminine it was it was so it was so soft and bullshit that he felt like he had to do something real again so he started boxing I again as a world-famous movie star and got but I got punchy he started sparring with James Toney and a bunch of other guys a bunch of legit boxers and from when I heard James Toney used to just touch him up every day and of course you don't want to be that guy you can't hang so he's in there taking fucking jabs to the face and right hands to the face and left hooks to the face and uppercuts to the face and his face got deformed and then he wound up getting like cheek implants and a bunch of weird shit right you got a bunch of weird facial surgery and stuff and I don't know they started losing his mind but I think CTE played a factor there I think just I think there's a to me it's a logical correlation so like here's a guy who's this world famous amazing movie star those nine and a half weeks and all these other big time movies me saw a fucking blockbuster movie star and an interesting movie star like a really good actor and then all of a sudden he becomes this crazy guy and in between them he's getting punched in the face a bunch of times like it doesn't take a genius right to make these connections right I know a lot of guys that were pretty normal when they were young and then somewhere into their MMA career they lost it and they went off the rails there's a there's a growing list of those guys growing yes yeah and some gals are on that list as well okay yeah so it's uh it's the gals are theirs as they as Ronda Rousey's opened up the door for women's MMA to become more popular that's gonna be more and more women that are taking more punishment including ones that you're never gonna see inside the USA just and the other thing is that just training if you just decided I just I don't want to fight but I want to train well that counts all that stuff counts all those right so are you sparring when you're doing more time no no thank you just trying to get in shape and stretch you know yoga you fuck with yoga do yoga yeah I do it on my own sometimes it's my hotel that's all we do that's how we do it yeah my wife and I she hasn't she has the online service room would do that but we are opening I just bought a new place you got a bit of a fucking yoga school yeah Jesus Christ man how are you doing all these things I'm not doing I'm yes I know but I'm delegating how much bandwidth does that eat up the fact that someone else is doing something that you're a part of and even though you delegate you still have to like figure out what that person is doing hey why does why is our business going under and Mike's driving a Rolls Royce like you know I mean all right those kind of things yeah well I got a lot of good people around me mmm we have a nice little community so you just stay chill take your sandwiches like before we just look at though what's the what's the business plan is it gonna is you know I think that's the that's thought that's that was very good for me because I you know we lived to lived within our means when I was a kid in Michigan my parents were high school teachers which not a huge pay right so we're leaving you know living paycheck-to-paycheck in a way that putting some money away but you know grew our food he would hunt put meat in the freezer but then getting into all sudden now you don't cut too many years later then there's band and there's like there's touring money and there's stuff and you kind of lose touch with understanding that most businesses operate on a 10% margin mmm you know so getting back to those kind of things to look at this because I'm moving my jiu-jitsu Academy to another building we're gonna put in the bag we're gonna put on it kind of yoga that's right you don't want a goddamn jiu-jitsu Academy too right but you know looking at trying to make it work it's a it's a it's a it's a puzzle that's worth have it's a puzzle that's worth solving because if you understand how to survive this thing on that microcosm that you can survive a lot of things right you can make sure that when shit doesn't go the way you want it to go you've done the work to figure out how to survive in those extreme circumstances in terms of business in terms of you know you know if the economy goes the way it goes and if not we've got greenhouses and we have some wine so we'll eat some salad and drink wine and die happy it's good way to think but it's just I just can't believe how many different irons you have in the fire and I know you're delegating I know you have good people around you but god that's so much do you ever think of simplifying do you ever think like maybe I should just like pare this stuff down like in a way we are and I think this next couple years the last couple years has been like establishing something in Arizona establishing the green establishing the vineyards establishing the businesses we've kind of branched out in various ways but I feel like in a way we're expanding to retract and once we figure out what works we're gonna bring it all back in centralize everything make it simpler and it's when we're sustainable at that point right now we're kind of extended we're all over the place kind of human things but I feel like you know getting a few getting few rounds in getting some sparring in once twice a week three times a week then you know having the vineyards going out that's hard work too I don't really have time to train jiu-jitsu or do my Thai or any of that you know but you seem to enjoy all these different varieties of experiences to like Puscifer perfect circle tool vineyard restaurant jiu-jitsu Academy they like you seem to enjoy having all these different plates spinning yeah it's fun yeah it's my dopamine yeah if I'm gonna have an addiction at least it's gonna be some some awesome community attached yeah that's what I'm saying is like you seem to enjoy having all these little puzzles yeah those little things going on yes absolutely the puzzles are important to keep you alive keep you irrelevant keep you fresh yeah goals pause yes goals deadlines harvest yeah yeah yeah harvest is great because it's not up to you right you're half that you're marching to the beat of a whole different drummer at that point and how do you schedule touring do you do you schedule touring directly by when your harvest season is and how the the wineries yeah I mean luckily with with tool we're popular enough to where we can we can get offers we can do the touring you know anytime during the year nothing's gonna really adjust or affect how you know what weed what we make is a living for doing that touring something my Puscifer way harder puzzle much it seems smaller seems like it's not on the same scale but in a way it's a more difficult scale because there's less margin for error so when we tour with that and have to be a very specific way we do it because you got to make sure we don't pay to do it I just just started thinking about that thing you did was it Ronda Rousey and who else was in my what else that guy you said was president oh that guy that's right Trump was in it yeah oh I bet my balls and lost what year was that those 15 those before the elections yeah oh yeah I was like right when he announced that he was around the time yeah yeah what the fuck is he doing yeah did you get all the different Ronda Rousey versions no I look like I know we've got um miss miss Krissy cyborgs in there we have a Miss Holly Holm we have cat Zingano we have me we have Ronda I'm the hot one it's all arias no again where do you have the time to do this I didn't mean is that these are friends of mine who did the whole video I go here's what I have in mind and they were like okay we'll do it I don't mana mate I have no idea how to animate you got a lot of shit for this uh not really I mean cuz it's just pure it's you know it's just pure comedy but it's like it's not you know whatever I'm not you know I I'm political to a point only when it's like when it comes to assholes so I don't like most politicians are easy targets because they're you're already know they're lying brother speaking so that they're just it's good comedy right away I think the best comedy we've had in many years his pen Trump cuz he just he sets him up for you he does but it's almost it's it's what he's doing is so strange because he's not even pretending to be what we think of as a president like he'll attack people on Twitter yeah like he it's weird crazy it's weird like I wonder if the thing we talked about the 400-year line okay this is me going back to conspiracy theories and there's no I just didn't sneak in yet nobody's working right now all right so class right I feel like it's almost like that is the distraction to keep us all divided and keep us all guessing what the fuck's going on on purpose yeah maybe maybe you know if you're if you're a good if you're good conspiracy theorist you're gonna put those connections together look look the every show that's ever gone like okay well we find out that there's just meteor speeding toward Earth we can't tell anybody hmm so if there's anything weird like that going on like there's a there's a fungus that's gonna kill everybody don't tell me just cambree arguing get them like you know distracted by you know you know football hey who's which who's your team football all right you know just the bread and circus of it all mm-hmm you get caught up and having you know having food and some gladiators and you forget about your civic duty right that would have to be orchestrated by some genius component of our government that doesn't see us and if I think it's accident I don't think anybody I don't think advice pulling the strings I think it's just like part of the progression of what happens okay so it happened the kali-yuga madness yes yes just so just it because of the natural progression of where things are going it just comes out as a symptom that makes more sense to get that that that makes more sense to me than this grand conspiracy I don't think there's I don't think anybody is that organized no I don't think so yeah no no I think there's chaos going on a people capitalizing on that chaos and I definitely think there's lying and I definitely think there's conspiracies but I think more than anything it's just this is the way the world is turning right now because of just how society is set up and how disconnected we are to the natural world and how connected we are to the digital world and it's and there's I don't think there's any way out but I think in the interim I feel like at an attempt to reconnect is gonna help I think generally generationally there's a way out the problem is for our generation I don't know if there's a way out you know I think especially people like us that grew up without any sort of internet and then have watched it transform and completely take over the world whereas the idea of a world without internet is impossible to us it doesn't even compute but we grew up without it so what happened well we were taken over were taken over by some sort of digital entity I don't think for us I think that this world has to be figured out by the people that recognize that we've fucked up like we were talking about learning from mistakes learn from other people's mistakes well they're gonna learn from our mistakes they're gonna learn from our mistakes and they're gonna see people who grew up just like I mean just like every other really fucked up part of human civilization that people have managed to overcome and avoid whether it's slavery or war with bows and arrows like they've figured out like that was not the way to do it let's move past this let's figure out what the folly of our ancestors was and let's let's adjust accordingly I agree with them long as we don't poison the earth long as we don't make Satan if you're in Arizona that's a hot spot what actually hot I believe any a lot of water there yep lots of water where you are what just in general Arizona has water that's what you know you drive by those lawns and pools and Riverside and Palm Springs that's Arizona water is it really yeah I thought that shit was like called a filter yeah yeah you have all the mountain ranges around Arizona and down through Colorado all that kind of filters that way and that's that the Salton Sea that's all because of that Colorado your fuck around with that place Jan just went through there she showed me a bunch of photos it's pretty amazing that's insane most people don't even know what it is there is an amazing documentary on it chichay how it just she just she just bought it so I'm gonna watch it what's fucking crazy that used to be a place where everyone from Hollywood went like you they called the Inland Riviera like California's Riviera and they would go there and Sonny Bono while he was alive was trying to figure out a way to detoxify the water and pass bills because a lot of it is runoff from the agriculture from North yeah it's crazy the people that live around there just it's just a rotten wasteland look at that all the dead fish the there's seat around the sea there are it's like sand but it's white and it's not sand it's actually the bones of dead fish but it's so prevalent that you would think that it's sand what a crazy ass place that is that's one of those places great it's worse all the time and apparently if you're in Palm Springs during certain times of the year it wafts over and hits you Millie they have dead zones where millions of tilapia will just wind up on the beach dead and just rotting and smelling through you know the grasshoppers in Vegas yes it's crazy that's a Bible yeah it's in the Bible that is the slope radar that's what locusts are locusts are grasshoppers yes so the Jesus is trying to tell us something stay out of agus or don't you can eat grasshoppers to this yeah tasty forgot about that part yeah well we will find a way to survive so you guys have those javelinas an area oh yeah how's that creepy little fucker isn't it yeah that will tear up an entire vineyard in one night Oh will they really yeah they're crazy it's like that you see the lot of guys in Texas that the boar are like running wild and they'll give you permits in a helicopter you go over the boar herd that's just destroying agriculture I still go over and though they'll try to fit him out but it's yeah it's just no there's no stopping it we don't have that much of a problem with the javelina in Arizona but it is a problem yeah well that's at least a wild natural animal it was introduced javelina was yeah really yeah I didn't know that yeah by who what piece of shit brought that goddamn thing I had no idea I don't know but it wasn't it's not native to the area was a broad a nice that's I that's what I was told oh so I know that by its a peccary it looks like a pig but it's a peccary which is like her cousin to a pig I got a rat or something yeah yeah it's Wayne a rat a pig Doug Stanhope lives down in Arizona and he said his neighbor's dog got killed by a pack of javelina yeah because the problem was the dog chased the javelina the male flipped around while they while the kids and the other part of the hurt took off and he went well and he like gored him yeah cuz I we had a we had a dog origin Tina that almost died because a big dog and that and that little that's a little they all have a you know whipped around and that's like trying to fight Mike Tyson it's like it's this compact thing yeah with spikes they're a really unusual animal to hunt because they respond to calls the way you wish animals would respond to a call like if you're trying to call on an elk and you know man man they're like hmm maybe I'll come over there is that a chick looking for some dick yeah they'll get close and they'll don't try to figure out which way the winds blowing with a javelina what you do is you make these sounds like a wounded animal like to have these little predator crawls where it's like well you're making something like it's like something's writhing in agony and making noises and they sprint towards it and then when they realize that it's not what they want they try to turn around that's when you shoot them right but they run like no other animal to a predator because they live in this horrible environment the desert and it's all mountain lions and jaguars and whatever the fuck else lives out there yeah they're weird - you see them and that there's a silhouette and then they turn and they're like thin you're like what the fuck is that like so if you try to shoot it head-on the bullet is gonna bounce off that skull they turn and you can like the side shots the way to get it but like there's like a flounder yeah it really is are weird it's a fucking strange he's a is that a introduced animal it says that it migrated from like South America and Mexico up over a couple centuries but hmm and maybe someone brought it up first well the pigs are the pigs have only been here since the 1500s the Spaniards those crazy Europeans they brought them over here for food well just let these pigs go no one's gonna care hey next thing you know they're in almost you know I think they're in every single County in Texas yeah and they're making their way across the country just devastating things yeah they're in San Jose and Silicon Valley people's lawns getting torn up by wild pig populations yeah I'm not cool but the tasty if you hit them right there that they have that that the gland you like you process it wrong and it's that good you just got to know what you're doing just don't fuck around with their their glands just like men you know please leave my glands away alone but your that desert environment such an interesting thing because you think it's desolate you think but it's a really thriving ecosystem yeah that really are like just the simple things like our herbs and the tomato is things like that they just they thrive yeah they're very aromatic the Basil's and the Rosemary's and things it's just really intense intense stuff what kind of tomatoes do you grow to grow like an heirloom style of tomato well that doesn't really grow well the ones that really do well in our greenhouses with a little like the cherries or a little pear Tomatoes those little smaller you know smaller versions of tomatoes they do really well why do they do better than the ALM ones I think that they're as far as flavor I like them and I think it's because just the size the skin contact how much more compact they are there's just more flavor in one tomato rather than the pulp being the flavor I would imagine the skin in the outer part is actually more of the flavor than just the pulp I gotta get a greenhouse I really do that's something I've been thinking about a lot lately cuz I I've had vegetables like when I said I just got back from Italy god damn they're tomatoes taste good yeah I mean you realize that tomato is actually a fruit yeah and it tastes great they're amazing but you get a tomato over here from the grocery store and it might as well be a tennis ball I mean it's it bounces like a tennis ball at lasts this lasts for tomatoes don't you know we picked them because we're gonna eat them today more oh yeah that's the way to live man that's how people are supposed to live this goddamn waiting forever to eat your food while it just sits on a shelf is nonsense yeah it's like yeah I got I got used to that now that we have the the greenhouse is going for the last couple years it's like you get that stuff that's what we're making do you have well water we're on the around the spring that comes down from Minges Mountain so Jerome is on on spring water and then we have well down on the sites so your tap water spring water mmm Wow so do you have does anybody add anything to it probably because it's a it's it's a talent so they try to treat it just to be safe yeah unfortunately Sarada we had a well we have - we have three wills i site has its own well as you get spring water we have a bitch rights because we have the you know we have the oak creek and that's that's at the page spring is right there so we have water dish right so we actually irrigate the vineyard on those but i went ahead and put in a well on every one of them just as a back-up plan did you get a guy with the stick trying to figure out where the the water is a diviner guy is that she at work worked for us how is that real I don't know I had a buddy of mine a bill to well and his property and he had the guy come over with the stick I'm like I can't talk to you anymore I want got that I want to say like they know that there's a general area where the water is yeah there's some dude with a cell phone and the corner go watch watch this you think I think it's right here but it's the thing it's a lifetime lot of practice but I've seen it I've seen I've seen it done we're like he's just walking around on said boy it just goes down like oh really let's go here yeah how the fuck can that possibly be where you don't know it's good here it is here's this guy it's called water witching water with all its witchcraft look at this guy fuck this guy look at the way he's moved his hands fuck her too she's full of shit - look at him oh I ain't even done ready to be controlling this right here right here okay shoot shoot the fuck out of here with that that's nonsense that's like three-card Monte hey asshole I've drilled four wells and they'll burn or fourth would you just try to drill a well out of the fucking blue just somewhere yeah ten ten paces right here BAM oh well we're under can of network of Wells yeah the only thing I worry about Wells is every movie where there's bad people they always throw the bodies in a well like the Larson's Tarantino he can't really fit the body down that no that's 8 edge kissing pink but you can try I mean those people that have yourself a limb meat grinder or some hogs guess you're good remember the well baby the kid that fell down the well it took like days to get him out mm-hmm Jessica yeah yeah it was her right yeah I said him yeah and she eventually became like a hot hot broad here's another guy doing it he's calling this is called a dowser I might be might be multiple names divorce whether I'm not mustering this guy is a bottle of water on the ground he's like proving well how about we put a bottle of water where he doesn't know where it is yeah there's lines yeah blind him right look he's moving his arms this guy's a dipshit he's like the worst magician ever he's really like moving czar nothing under my feet presto watch his hands fuck you fuck you Melvin Jon Baker professional dowser a professional hoser he's a hoser this guy John if you're listening I'm sorry I'm just this is comedy I'm sure you're real I'm sure you would do what you're doing is real bro let me see let me see your hands let me see your hands let me see your hands what oh Jesus look at it it's moving down with my coincidentally my hands are thrusting down at the same time yeah nonsense he's a professional dowser what's the name of the religion they have the snakes that bite him in the face Pentecostals yeah those are my favorite those are the folks that talk in tongues mm-hmm there's no Pentecostals talk in tongues I'm thinking I'm conflating them I don't think they necessarily the snake Hamblin well I was I was raised Southern Baptist and we did some tongues did you oh yeah sigh my mom my ding dong you have to do that like that one really I didn't say it like that because that would be you know was his name is it Robert Paulson is that the guy he's like the slicked-back hair preacher he does that he'll just be on in the middle of talking about Robert Tilton yeah that's right [Laughter] one of my all-time favorite quotes every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye that's easy farting preacher yes yeah that's him yeah yeah that's good
