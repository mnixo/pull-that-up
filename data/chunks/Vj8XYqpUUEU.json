the girag and experience there's a blog i read about Finn privilege just to sit there that's another thing that's another way of saying fat shaming the other side of saying fat shaming is that being thin you are enjoying thin privilege and that by radiating success and all now oh not just dating success but the way people address you and the way you move around in society that you enjoy thin privilege and what they're trying to do is compare being in shape with being a white male like white male privilege who's white male privilege is almost shameful you know it's almost shameful to have this white male privilege while people are stuck it's it makes you feel like the like if someone talks about white male privilege what do you think of you think of someone being aloof to the concerns of brown people and poor people and racism and also aloof to the fact that they got super lucky they got this lucky roll of the dice and we're born in this way that allows them to be I mean if you think about white males think about white males and you think about wealth majority of like super wealthy people are white males the majority of the people that are in positions of power whether it's presidents mayor it's what white males so that white male being a white male and have that privilege is almost like being a pig it's like being the man so thin privilege they've figured out a way to make being thin being a pig you've gotta knock will power of that list there is no lack of willpower and fat people you will powers a finite resource you have so much you games we prove this beyond a doubt what do you mean willpower there's a whole book about this now and I'm of course for getting the name of the author but they actually show that there's so many decisions you can make I wrote about this while back there's decision-making fatigue and there's X amount of willpower and you can apply that willpower to change the world or you can apply that will power to say no to the bowl of chips in front of you right and if you're a fat person and your energy reserves are low and I say this from personal experience the amount of willpower takes to get up off the couch and walk across the street and do whatever you're going to do it requires a hell of a lot more power more willpower than you would think it would as a healthy person because your cells aren't working you don't have energy and yet you get up and you do it in every step you take is sapping your willpower in a way a healthy person doesn't have oh I see what you're saying yes so you're saying that even though willpower is sort of an individual characteristic and some people have and some people don't with fat people it's almost like catch-22 because although they need it to drop way they're not going to have it because they need it to just move around their energy levels are lower so they have less willpower and they're using the willpower to do simple things that are effortless for you and it's not effortless for a fat person that is such an interesting point and one that I really didn't consider that's a very unique point because I I never really considered that fat people like it's almost like they can't help themselves it's almost like they're so or it's so much more difficult for them to pass on shitty food than it is a regular person well think of it like this okay if you're a regular person that's thin privilege would branch the military in army how long we in for 33 years while six years total what year was this eighty-two to eighty-five and then reserves from 85 to a tu that's here ba boom you're handsome pounds not a wig that's just real yeah did you get anything out of being in the military yeah discipline yeah just you know just again just being being responsible responsibility the ability to respond yeah people that have gone through that it's it's it's very interesting to see I had a friend who was a real lazy and kind of shiftless and never got anything done and then went away went to boot camp came back and this motherfucker always folded his napkin after that SAT up straight and got shit done and I was like wow they turned this dude around like they're really did I wouldn't recommend it today because joining today you have a high likelihood of either being forced to assassinate someone for the government or finding yourself in a position where you really wouldn't want to be people shooting at you that don't like Americans and unless it's your calling I wouldn't really recommend it but goddamn for some people it really is a game changer I agree um yeah and don't you know not all not everyone can make it through it it's but the a lot of guys had kind of washed out you know during that whole basic training what made you join College Fund for art school oh really yeah were you pretty convinced that we weren't going to go to war during those times completely I was like war you know I didn't I just didn't believe it and then I got I got appointed to go I got it through long process but basically got handed an opportunity to go to West Point by going to the preparatory school for a year and got to the end like when I finally got my appointment to go to West Point they said basically you have to forfeit your army college fund to go to art school and I didn't really go into be a career military person I kind of went into good college fund so i can go push through the arts but you know but you're being again I was being my behaviors being reinforced as far as my way I was excelling as in in the military so it was very tempting to go I could be an officer let's do that and then you get you know I got to that moment ride to like I have them make that decision in that moment you have basically I had like three hours to check the yes box that except my appointment or check the no box and you know go back into the regular army and then go back to an end go to art school and it shows I chose art school alright and if I have not done that I would have provided i made it through West Point which is not a guarantee but I made it through West Point I would have been in the first Gulf War as a lieutenant wow that's fucking crazy well you know it all so it begs the question all this stuff begs the question like first of all everyone's favorite argument is if you have nothing to hide then what are you worried about and it's not that right what what what it is is first of all why do you need so much information and what what have you done that has made so many people so angry you have to check everyone's email like what is the actual cause of all this that never gets addressed like whenever we're talking about how this group hates us that group hates us this group is playing Why Why What did we wouldn't want to take what we do I want to go with what you said that if you have nothing to hide because I was just I was trying to get a show up before I came here and I failed miserably but one of the things I was going to talk about did you see that story the lawsuit filed from that incident in New Mexico with the driver who didn't do the full stop leaving walmart you saw right right so so the police pull him over for California stopping the stop sign decide that he looks like he's clenching his buttocks in a weird way and this is the part I love goes to a judge and says to the judge while this guy sitting on the side of the road he's clenching his buttocks in a weird way I think we have somebody trying to hide drugs in there and the judge goes I guess judging from the story yeah that would be probable cause so they take this guy to a doctor who refuses to do with the police officers arrest because they got to go to another doctor 14 hours of anal cavity searches enemas they sedated him and did a colonoscopy they examined his stuff right in front of him 14 hours found nothing x-rayed him multiple times nothing and then apparently send him a 6000 dollar bill for the procedure so when you say what have you got to hide if it unless you're hiding that's what can happen to you you if and not just that what I love is the police department spokesman said we didn't do anything wrong this is policy and we had a judge sign off on it so when you say if if you have nothing to hide what do you care this guy had nothing to hide and that happened to him he clearly did because he was clad she's mocking it weird away I know but now now that story is true and the lawsuit claims witnesses and all this kind of stuff and the police officers think nothing was wrong there that's what happens to you when you get rid of these protections that keep you from being searched willy-nilly or anything like that after a story like that everyone in the ward was going to be stopped by the police is gonna claim she's back weird way it's just the fear of the safaris like oh shit Lord little doll scope it up getting your people that are but freaks and that's what they're into their into cops checking them out there's touch treasures up there put secrets up there I didn't mean I didn't mean to take the conversations wrong people direction it's a great direction it's hilarious it's it's well it's fucked up that if you search someone's ass for 14 hours and there's nothing up there that guy should be able to search yours for 28 that should be the the rule you should be able to throw firecrackers in there and you come on man he checked his ass for no reason like you owe him something what bothers me about that is that there's no penalty that actually affects the people who did this in other words that this guy wins his big lawsuit against him that's the taxpayers who are going to pay that the people who did it don't suffer at all you
