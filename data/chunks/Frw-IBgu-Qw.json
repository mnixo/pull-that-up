a lot of shit on this table yeah this is just tables ridiculous I'm a mess and might this tables reflecting of the busyness of my life right now I need to take some time and clean this fucking table the things when people keep bringing me shit but it's all stamp shit I love you buddy but you gave me a mushroom hat this hat is please put that off I don't know which is this the way to wear it like this way I think so so people keep giving me cool shit yes save me this mushroom what's a dried mushroom people give me all this cool shit and so I go oh thank you and I don't know where to put it I got Dan Aykroyd's vodka in the corner they are cool skull vodka thank god I've never seen someone push Bacchus so hard on a pot roast rate promotion it's very smooth and it's dan Aykroyd say like I'll buy it just to lit I want to hear you talk the Blues brother I'm in come on man I bought it he was a conehead he's he's one of the original Saturday Night Live Slayers like the real OG Brothers blues brother yeah hey man we started this podcast off talking look off the record and I thought it was probably good for everybody here like when I'm so happy you're not fighting you know and what we're saying is I know that I was a dick to you to get you to stop doing it but I felt I felt like there was almost no other way that you were gonna let felt like I felt scared I've seen too many people that are just there's this there's a moment where it changes where they stop being that person and they keep fighting and you see it you see the deterioration and no one steps in and no one stops them and then that Todd you'll talk to him alone man maybe you run into him in Vegas maybe you both have a couple of drinks you see each other at the bar and you're like hey how's things and you have these conversations and then the reality sets in things are not good for a lot of these guys a lot of these guys that have taken punishment for too long there's no bringing them back man they get to this spot where you know everyone knows there's something wrong and no one says anything to them and I was real scared that that was gonna happen to you I was real scared you know like I didn't anticipate when we did that crazy podcast that wound up being you know this like intervention I didn't even know what was gonna do it but while was happening I was like I just you got to stop that's all I was thinking is you gotta get out I was a little high I don't even remember we were drinking but we probably were but I remember that being so sensitive to it like there's something has to be done like now you kind of you you had so many other possibilities that there's if like most guys that are all in on fighting they don't have anything on the side like there's almost nothing else there there's almost just fighting and maybe a family right but you were you were starting to flourish you're hilarious on podcast but you know that can go away being guys become shells and mad right now that you're out you see it right yeah I think thank god or whoever's up there man for you and Bryan Callen thank fucking I know it came out Dickie I know it did and I know I know I apologize then and I apologize now but I think that's the only way you could do it I don't know you was gonna listen I knew you had this pride like you were like we were talking about before the show you were a top ten professional heavyweight in the biggest organization in the world that's a that's a identity thing to men that like the you people get strapped into that identity it's one of the harder things about fighters is when you quit you you have to find meaning in your life like what did what are you good at now but dude for me I know I never did anything professionally but it was the formative stages of my life where the only thing that gave me any feelings of good was martial arts you feel like a loser the only thing the only thing everything else I felt even the I was kind of good at drawing but even then I was like my drawing teacher didn't like me I had friends that I was close with in the class we all drew and we liked our stuff but man I felt like a fucking loser except for martial arts so when I quit and then I'm just doing comedy and I suck at comedy eating shit and I was like what am i quitting for like I'm quitting something that I was good at to be something that I suck at that I maybe think I have this pipe dream that I could eventually make a living out of I remember that feeling of not having an identity and obviously when you're 21 no one has an identity anyway you're always so fucking confused you trying to figure it out I was super fortunate where I was surrounded by guys like you Kalin Bert Tom and it's just like where that I wanted to be in that party I was I was so fortunate I get the stars align for me where I was at this party over here and guys were getting CT and you know you're fighting and it's a fucking grind and then you guys were over here I'm like well I want to be one of them I'm I'm good man I'm good I want to do that yeah and I think it took that bridging that gap you and to be honest I think that would that's the only way that you could have done it because the the ego that I had at the time especially fighting men begin to that level it was like that ego is insane the narcissist and the the dream of oh I can beat cane or Steve Bay these guys and I I think the only way that I could have bridge that gap is by you going so hard in the paint dude I was so scared about in gone oh I'm so scared they were gonna fight you with in Ghana or someone like that you know I mean I was so scared you were gonna get murked by some some when you weren't all in anymore yeah those big fucking when you watch like when when Francis merked over him with that left uppercut Jesus Christ like if that was you know and I was calling that fight man dude it would be an I love Alistair he's a great guy I have a deep appreciation for him as a fighter I mean I'm yeah and my feeling was when he came over his k1 grand prix champion like this is the most celebrated striker we've ever had and in my main you saw it in his fight with brock lesnar phenomen dude he people and that one of the things that makes that Francis ko so fucking crazy insane I mean this he did the same thing to Junior dos Santos remember Overeem did it yep he hit him with a beautiful left hook very similar punch super worried about that with you man but but I also I also think too for me was like this quick ascension into into this UFC and I'm and I'm fighting his top 10 top 15 guys I'm in this I'm in this world but it's like I was almost like a cheat code because I was really athletic I was really really athletic with my background so I got I passed a lot of guys fast my athleticism but then you get to a certain point where you're fighting these vets where they've they fought big powerful athletic guys before but then it comes down to the experience and technique and that's always always gonna win nine times that then that's always gonna win the thing is about striking too is like striking when you mix in with wrestling you can kind of get away with a lot more a lot more crazy shit happens people knock people out that maybe wouldn't knock people out normally you know like Kevin Randleman was an amazing example that he knocked out Mirko Cro Cop at the left hook that yeah now if they were in a straight kick boxing match it's definitely possible that Kevin could do that Kevin was an incredible athlete but you had favored heavily that Mirko would be able to stuff that all day all day most likely because he was so elite in that realm but you add striking to MMA and you know there's like there's so much craziness going on that sometimes it's hard for people to clearly establish like who's actually better on their feet until someone can stop the craziness if there's a cleared lines yeah and then you get to this level there's this level we get like a monster doll he's a perfect example cuz he's so goddamn good he's so smart he's so technical and he finds these openings that maybe other people don't see or maybe they can't get to where those openings are and he finds us so you think you're doing good you think you're doing good but he's waiting he's waiting for the moment where he sees this spot that he's been looking at and boom he cracks dare until with that step in left hook and puts him out you know a fucking animal like dare until you're no cold come on I think John's one of those guys who's like we kind of because of his last few opponent there was like God maybe he's older he's lost a step and I watch and I go oh he's playing with his food he's playing with his food it's not I'm not disrespecting those guys who he's fought or da McRae's who he's gonna fight but for Johnny look at his legacy in the legends that he's fought it's tough for him to get up for the challenge so he's playing with his food right now wait till he fights I'm telling you wait till he goes to heavy weight you're gonna see the old John when eat when when there's actual where he thinks it's a challenge wait till you see him fight a steep AR Francis you're gonna see the the monster come out right now he's just picking with this food yeah I'll do that all right let's do it I think I think he's in cruise control I think you're entirely correct and I think when you are at that Elita level when you've never been defeated you have one loss it's a bullshit loss everybody knows - bullshit loss he really should get his record clean I should eat something do you mean they cleared him with this whole pika gram shit they found out that this is we just have this new ability to measure substances in the most miniscule amounts that it's so ridiculous that just some random sort of vitamin that has some contaminant when one millionth of a fucking gram or whatever the others dick P protein while the funny shit test positive that's not a drug it's not like so much cheating it's just so they cleared him on that right you saw it it makes this whole statement about the the new way they're viewing this stuff because the fact their equipments just amazing you can't hide from shout out to you side of them I like that you silent yeah it's so good you guys are flagging yes we're gonna back off yeah and I learn from it I love it I love that they did the same with marijuana they realize like we're not dealing with in a performance enhancer so all these guys aren't fighting hi this is just like them sleep and relax not hurt it's not helping anybody in terms it's like not making him stronger or faster so and it might help them with anxiety and a lot of other things so they release that right they're doing good things but with John it's cleared that he wasn't taking anything this is just some some shit that's a residual like a residue that's on something else some contaminated supplement same thing would happen with Tim means to means God bust the same way they mean they dragged it out with him for months a lot of guys when he was at its peak really I know when he was peaking in the UFC and he's won one of the most interesting welterweights all of a sudden boom he gets a suspension from tainted supplements you look at the guy he's not a fucking steroid you how about Tom Lawlor yes yeah this is career Josh Barnett I know same thing people are upset if you you sorry like we're not like we're trying to move forward and get better right it sucks for those guys and I feel so terrible for those guys review sorry like our bat we learned though man there's nothing the thing is you sada has a long career you know when you got a guy like Tim means or a guy like Josh Burnett there's a window well josh has had an extremely long window obviously youngest-ever UFC heavyweight champion the longest yeah but that extremely long window I mean it's gonna come to a close and they took away a large chunk of it for something it turned out to not be accurate but they're gonna last a long time with these guys like they say that like at their peak the best fighters have nine years at their peak that's a long time it's a long time the only guys really hit that nine years stride at peak form I think it's like Anderson phaidor there's like a few like real legends GSP obviously GSP John John obviously right John is undefeated right now I mean they took his title away wins it back rides never it never lost a title fight and you're dealing with the guy wins the title youngest ever in the sport flying the opener on Shogun had just nothing but success since then people are like inspecting him with a Micah spikes expecting him to fall off like you're dealing with the goat it's hilarious he's the goat and he went after the Santos fire my common sense was at one leg so I went back and watched John Jones fight and you watch you're like oh he's in he can give two fucks about being in there right now well he was smart to be smart it's dangerous but at the same time he could have took him down his coach is like dude I'm talking his manager like we were like dude take him down he's like now I'm saying this but he won it's hard for him to to because you look at the resume of guys he's beat and then they're like again it's not a knock on tom ik race and I'm not gone Corey Anderson or Anthony Smith but like here's Anthony Smith and John's like all right you know let's do it man so it you know that's he's fucking with his food right now well he's so good but he's still able to fight out like the Gustafson fight the early one the first one was a perfect example of him falling into a trap right partying too hard didn't train train for two weeks or barely right everyone camp was like they were like saying what what do we do here he goes out and guts it out wins in the stretch winds down the stretch like he had to be pushed I went down the stretch right then I train and for that fight I'm talking the best I've ever seen in the training room as I imagined oh this guy's never gonna lose yeah oh he's the best I've ever seen he would spar five rounds with me then jump in with a heavyweight professional boxer and fuck him up five five five five pound beat the fuck out of me and I'm like what he's never gonna lose John didn't you not understand didn't train didn't drink what the distance and wind down the stretch one dumb stretch gutted it out dot and Gus fans the best light heavyweight of all time if he was in a different air and there's no DC or John Jones he's there go but you can't say that's how good yes he's but don't if those two fucking guys aren't there yeah you might as close to being the good with the first fight yes with in the second fight John just runs him over cuz John took it serious very seriously I wanted to promote he's good check this out yeah how about the DC fight all right Beach in decision that's cool run it back boom okay a head kick yeah and not just a head kick but head kick on the side where DC said you're not gonna trick me into leaning towards my right well you could hit me with that left kick like they actually had a conversation about it the goat hears about this his light heavyweight is so I wish I'd Swiss John would get powned back you guys do your thing build though no no no no no no I like what he's doing well no he's defending it sure but here's here's the thing he he's not stimulated by that he's talking shit to the middleweight champion the world he's busy talking shit is Israel's talking shit to him - that's they're having a lot of it's entertaining yeah they're having a lot of fun but listen ultimately I think it's good for everybody I think that's the that little feud between Izzy and John John's first of all it elevates Izzy because all these people that didn't know who he was like why is John Jones talking shit - oh look at this mother for holy shit he's good and then they watch his fights ago this is why John Jones talking shit - because he's starched Robert Whittaker basically the end of the first round the fight was over I mean Robert Whittaker was fucks ville do anything social media he's like Jamaa where he's good everywhere how about this great guy the best these are my fucking a great guy love him Len honest is fuck you know I bought a McLaren 720s when he told me I was good I get my hug I was so excited for him I thought it was a car guys I give me an awesome a nice spot it cuz it looked like this anime character we got the right car is it on the right side when I know a car is awesome but it's got a steering we're on the wrong side I'm like I know I saw this incredible Porsche they had like this 1972 RS but I had the steering wheel on the right hand side of my kid out of here with that car on the wrong side what's crazy is is he told me they actually offered the fight to him already do you know that jeez and he went smart he's smart because he went ona canelo me Floyd Mayweather Canela me you're trying to get me while I'm really young in the game no no we're doing two years we're doing two years in Vegas yeah that's a beautiful car man that's they sound good too it's a spaceship inside mmm they're beautiful man that's a beautiful car that great fuckin he's special man I think he's gonna be the next big superstar I really do he's got everything going for him talent great personality he's fun I mean he fights with his much skill as we've ever seen a striker I mean he's Anderson Silva 2.0 he really is man his striking is out of this fucking world man but he has all the skills Anderson had but he's amazing on the mic yeah you know it was like fun of it though it was almost like well don't talk but he was so good it didn't matter agree like Anderson was so good it didn't matter if we didn't understand we said everybody loved him man because he was like who's the goat at the time also but also that the game's different now it's so much of a Spectre like entertainment yeah we're and still be Anderson but you're different back then we were more appreciative of those guys yeah I feel like I don't know maybe the fanbase understood the sport more because like GSP was huge not great shit talker Anderson Silva not a great shit like we loved those guys Cain Velasquez terrible talk never talk shit those were the big boys yep yep GSP is a perfect example nothing but nice always never talk shit no no never max mean to max talk a little shit but it's more playful ya know and we'll see we'll see but stop and I really didn't talk shit unless you shade it if you initiate it game match oh it's a it's a Devastator and he's good at it so he likes people that uh him and john jones going back and forth it's kind of fuck it's good for both of them it's great for Izzy because if John is that concerned about him everybody's got to realize like oh this guy's for real and I always said I wouldn't entertain it when people bring it up I go is he too small it's just a fucking it's nothing it's like Bigfoot we're never gonna see it get a big difference there's a big is he's fuckin big man when he walked up I've never met him before when he liked the one damn dude you're not small no but he's only about 200 or so pounds like 205 somewhere cities 203 I think yeah he's in that range John's probably 235 right now right and John has two brothers that are elite NFL athletes Provo bro he comes from fantastic genetics I mean he's just got super athlete family they're just and he's huge that size different big like could you see is he as a heavyweight I don't know my good know he would be overblown it would be too hard for him to deal with the really big guys you know they swear it's gonna happen though is he loves it he's a John Jones is he's gonna go up he's down for what he's like I don't care man he doesn't care well he's so good technically I mean who knows man maybe he's doing specific kinds of training that keeps his body light and maybe if he lifted weights we'd actually get better the only thing I would worry wearing me about that fight and I'd be rooting hard for is he in that fight with only thing that worries me is John's wrestling oh yeah man you forget how could remember to count DC you know he wanted to make a point first round so if he wants to play that game and can play it but John can do everything and when he does one thing he does better than anybody that's ever ever fought utilized distance he utilizes distance better than anybody he's the very best at keeping you here and a lot of people accused him of poking people in the eyes there have been some incidents I don't think he's doing it on purpose I think and I agree with you he shouldn't do it he should close his fist but what I'm saying is the way his style is he keeps you out here and then bang keeps you out here bad sadistic shit to the leg oblique kick leg kick pops you with a jab hits you with a knee keeps you here keeps you here these are Santana's just feeling out like a snakes tongue yeah he's got space like this much space where he could fuck you up but you can't hit him he's got this because he's he's also he's so comfortable in World Championship fights he said nothing but World Championship that's all he knows yes so when you're at the top of the food chain with the bright lights main event and you're like holy shit this is the big one John's like this is a fight all his fight another day another day that's how Tyson was when Tyson was crushing people that's how Anderson was when Anderson was crushing people thrive in the light think and they get to this point where you're you have to be so much better to beat them because you're shitting your pants going in you're compromised and you're fighting a guy who's at the peak he's in the zone I mean Anderson like when he fought Stephan Bonnar in Brazil never that shit dude he was in the zone man when he fucked up Forrest Griffin huh he was in the zone there was this zone where a nurse knows when he front kick Vitor in the face there was Anderson for a few years it was like holy shit holy fuck people forget it's hard when you look at it retroactively well you got to go back and understand the times we were living in we're talking about 2005-2006 do you remember when he first came on like we knew of them and pride if you are hardcore you know Vernon time but you didn't know like how good is and then they go hey Chris Leben we got someone for you Chris Leben goes I'll fight him yeah Chris Lee even had that noggin that had tape punches and fucking Anderson Silva let that dude up you're like what the fuck is happening right I have friends that bet on fights and that was one of them gonna listen to me bet the house on the Brazilian I mean bet the house tiny about Big Nog was like now you gotta keep going dude crazy he was he was fighting over in Cage Warriors I remember when he fought Jorge Rivera and Cage Warriors and let Jorge punch him in the face oh that's right let's hand stood right in front of him let him punch him in the face let him punch him in his face he smiles at him and kicks his ass and stop some dude he fucked everybody up over them and when he fucked up lemur oh my god and Lee Murray was Merkin people with one punch will forget - oh the murica's goblins yes that guy could crack relevant horrible yeah Rob a lot of banks yeah yeah shut up Robert see how ya know jail for life son oh they gave him life he's gonna be in there forever they don't even know where the money is they listen like 50 million dollars it's a goddamn Guy Ritchie movie I know isn't Guy Ritchie making a movie about that unli Murray here's a little thought people don't know Lee Murray came into prominence because he got in a street fight with Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell was there but Chuck didn't fight him though right what was my other friends but the rumor is is Lee Murray starch Tito well the was that he hit him yeah I knew that he hit him but I think Tito had I'm not making excuses for anybody but I think what I heard this Tito had like dress shoes on yesterday I talked to chuck about it and he goes here's no one got knocked out it was a scuffle no he separated he was Chuck hates Tito yes but I'm not gonna spread the rumor he didn't get knocked up no I heard he got punched Tito's fighting this weekend by the way yeah who's he fighting some guy who got wear a mask and got destroyed by cro cop oh that guy that guy I merely gave rides like all right out but I'm gonna wear this gown under the mask dude it's like a movie it's a horror movie it was a hormone get that dosed carros go get the KO from Mirko Cro Cop verses dosed Carl's Mirko hits him with left kick cemetery right to the fucking dome and when the dude goes out as he slumps blood is dripping out of the inside of the mask across his eyes so horrible but it's like if you're gonna Tarantino was gonna film this you like come on bro you're like come on the Bloods dripping down get ass watch this it's fucking first of all the Japanese people are so mean though here it is it's right when he gets him up against the the corner is when he lands us let it let it roll here a little bit he cracks him a few times just to let him know sky's a wrestler you're making a huge mistake you fucked up so bad cuz this guy has no business being in there and Mirko at the time how is the peak he's the best kickboxer we had ever seen in a sport at that time in the heavyweight division this was like Alistair was still not Alistair back then you know he had made it Mirko was the first he was the first real k1 superstar because he was explosive like a lot of guys like Ernesto Hoost and maybe Peter Aerts they maybe wouldn't have made the transition to me Mirko did Merkel was like oh look at that sign one shot bang now watch when they close up on them watch watch the closing on me see the blood come on bitch wears a mask oh these fucks the other Treader at the mask off see you find those carros bar open and make up the blood part I don't think I did no blood comes out it's when they're trying to get it off yeah okay so when they go back to the dude okay there's blood but let me see where the blood comes out of don't they show it dripping maybe I saw it on a photo you know I remember seeing it too but it might be one of those things like the Berenstein bears where everybody remembers it wrong you right know they got blood that there's obviously some bleeding on his head cuz they're there cleaning up but I remember seeing him slumped and then the blood trickles down hey what the fuck was that guy thinking fighting where I had that shirt the Japanese okay what the fuck were they no are you what was he thinking oh man Jews are big this idea like they can just do it Oh it'll be fine oh what's the big deal Mirko I've been in a fight before oh my god dude you knock that guy out I know about that haters we just kicked kissed his ass Brendan knocked him out yeah he up yet he was still doing the damn thing to row his heart of Wanderlei Silva is one of the most horrific in the sport the best because that was two fights there's one his first fight with mixed martial arts rules like modified rules remember you can only go to the ground for like X amount of seconds and it's some weird rule and if it went to the distance it would be a draw so the fight went to the distance so then after that Mirko has a series of fights with high-level competition and gets way better at sprawling also brings Dean Lister into his camp for a doom as well for doom so he gets real comfortable with jiu-jitsu real comfortable grappling is working with these elite guys powerful wrestlers the whole deal then they have the second fight the second fights in the heavyweight tournament and varan delays on all the Mexican comments I love that Vander that's the best Mandalay the Berserker find that Mirko Cro Cop versus Wanderlei Silva - it's a great fight and vandal II got bigger than cro cop van de Leeuw weight if I remember correctly I may be wrong but I think I'm right Wanderlei weighed 218 and cro cop blade 214 I think vandal he was actually heavier Wanderlei of pure brazilians if I was right about that if I really remember those numbers great great mind Wanderlei Silva I know we had an issue sorry while we were talking the was that the whole thing go down or just the TVs Wanderlei Silva versus Mirko Cro Cop - because in that one that one Mirko was fully comfortable with with MMA he wasn't getting taken down he news Vanderley wasn't a rest tape down offense was in sand he wasn't worried about being submitted either because he'd been training with Dean Lister and Fabricio Werdum so he's just smart send in missiles you know he's the one who got Werdum into pride and into MMA he really brought Perdue me and for jetsons but doom's like I was kind of cool wow that's crazy that's right that's right before Verdun fart Junior dos Santos remember when no one who dos Santos was and I think it was like a late minute substitute yeah wait a minute yeah and junior hit him with the uppercut see see this is a second fight in the second fight Vandelay is facing a completely different animal because look at that shakes him off cro cop was physically strong as fuck he was moving like a real MMA fighter who's also an elite kickboxer it was a different animal how big his like dude you weren't submitting him he's been rolling with Fabricio Werdum so he lets him up and he's just battering Vandelay this is a straight left hand boom boom I mean before the KO it's horrific right he's beating the shit out of a meeting breaks up Dandeli is supposed to be fighting 185 that's his real weight class he's just bulked up and you just can't hang with a guy that's this fucking good as a heavyweight and so then Vandelay gets up to give him a yellow kick to the body and then sets up the big high kick to the head I mean if vanderley's trying man he's swinging and swinging for he's swinging for the fences he is but dude that fucking left kick to the forearms right there just numbed his arms oh and there's a head kick back up to the kick to the body back up before that watch this kick to the body do because you see van delays arms you know how when a dude gets shin slammed into the arms they have this like like oh look at that one right he seemed up yeah oh my god dude I mean he's slamming it's hitting forearm and gut and here's the high kick boom so you eat a couple of those to your body or to your to your arms everything just goes off everything is fucked up now and then he hit some with that high kick whoa shoutout to cro cop shout out the cro cop right leg hospital left legs imitating yeah dude but that was a perfect example of pride at its peak you wanna know how cocky I was when I was a fighter when we came out you know the first thing I did I threw a high could get cro cop yeah no I threw a head kick and he blocked and smiled like I just wanna let you know that dude how about fuckin cowboy Connor that's a very good fight it's probably time overdue right big time for it too neat is uh agree I like how cowboys fighting now he's so calm and relaxed in there he's lost his last two but yeah they were to the top you know top of the heap yeah I mean he fought ehe who is the scariest fucking guy in the division right now he scares me because gage he's like he's it's like he's on a suicide mission it's like either he's gonna go or you're gonna go and a lot of people say that but they don't really mean agree he fucking means it and he's backed off of that a hair so he's still controlled wildness if you say he's a brother he does not like it I don't think he necessarily is you think what he is oh he's just he's wild but it's intelligent controlled chaos it's any better than ever and he has a great chin phenomenal wrestling dignity those fights were didn't go his way because of the chaos I think it's just making him be just a little bit more calculated because just a little bit I'm sorry bro didn't we fucked up our bows I was like Jesus here's the thing because I thought they were gay cheese kind of left out in the cold with all these matchups be announced with khabib tony connor cowboy khabees kind of left out what he's just like alright the fuck we do now man yeah kg is a little bit left out in the cold but nice cab irritates you you said gazing then you said could be but I know what you meant yeah I get G is a little bit left out but if anybody gets injured he's right in there see like we're in this weird place where we're pretending these fights are all going to happen we hope we hope and pray who don't do to me Tony we hope and pray that cowboy and Connor actually make it to the dance but they might not make it to dance so maybe somebody doesn't make it a dance guess who gets a phone call just engaging was it o-o a monster at all but moslems 170 he's God say I'm saying for Connor for Connor because that fight you know Connor burs Cowboys at welterweight yes which when it was first announced I was like oh at 55 man that's a tough fight for cowboy slow starter Connors a finisher comes out the gates like a fucking banshee and then my brother takes me to this man you know it's at welterweight why the fuck would they do that because Karan doesn't want to lose any weight dude I think that guy tortured himself to get down 45 so hard and when you looked at what he looked like when he was on the scale he was flexing he looked like a goddamn zombie skeleton it's horrible so I think do you don't nobody you whether he complains or not about that nobody rides for free you do that to your body for a couple of years you're doing some fucking damage and it makes it harder to lose the weight afterwards right so then he's going up to 55 he's you know he's obviously elite at 55 wins the title at 55 has the the great rematch with Diaz at 70 right and then comes back and fights could be even 55 again and gets mauled you know he has a fight with cowboy you're gonna he's really a 55 or that can fight welterweight that's the right size for him versus I don't think Nate is fighting 55 and any time in the future now they too big now he's too big but my only issue with 70 and I'll assume his team decided to do it at 70 is when I look at Conor McGregor's a welterweight is his power the same as it was at 45 and 55 is his timing the same as speed no case he's fighting a guy who I think in his eyes is not really a welterweight you think well 55 or kids do most his work at 55 because he think he I think he thinks of cowboy as a guy he'll fight at 170 but he's really a 55 that's fair my only issue with that and I'm a huge karma geiger fan I've seen Cerrone he's a friend of mine so I just wanted to have a great fight but it when people were complaining about this fight when dinner that's like cats whatever to me I think it's a phenomenal fight because I think if you're a Cowboy fan you know I always said cowboy is too much of a company man did UFC and Dan Regal cut weight dude fight this fight do this turn out a quick turnaround right cowboy the the legend of cowboy is born he's jumping on fucking ships and whatever the hell he's riding fucking bulls and whatever the fuck he is doing the week of the fight yeah and he's kind of kill himself to make weight and I just went does it ever work out for anybody who says who's a yes-man to the UFC not really but now we've seen it's worked out for cowboy because this is his you know III don't put too much into titles anymore like this is Cowboys title shot you got the biggest fight in the game you fighting Conor McGregor you're making here make millions of dollars this is the Golden Goose when he talked if you talk - come on Iseman Coby Cummington Maz Badal khabib Tony maybe not those two but it talked to anyone who do you want to fight anyone says Conor cuz you know it's the biggest fight you can get in the game cowboy got it by being he's he's paid his dues he's earned it he's getting millions and millions dollars win lose or draw it's a good fight for cowboy I think they should make a red panties night belt I'd be cool whoever gets to fight Conor you get a red panties night belt because the belts the belts like the belt or whatever now you know because cuz like think about hire some like superhot actress to wear them for a day Dude Love and they win those be so sick a belt with like framed red panties gonna be so dope I think he's you know Connors calculated in his comeback and I think this is a smart fight for him because he's not fighting someone who's too big right where I feel like you know that was the argument about Nate even though Nate did of course fight at 55 for a long time big dude he's big dude you know and then there's some other guys that want to fight him at 170 that are real one 70s like Maz Vidal was a perfect example that Maz Vidal was a 155 for a long time but he's not anymore if you look at his frame like you would go looking back when he fought like michael Chiesa which was like 2000 and 13 14 14 somewhere around then right so MOSFET all back then was like a skinny guy yeah he was real skin wasn't defined you know wasn't a man yet almost well like eek ruined his body he was also killing himself to make 55 right and and you can't pack on any weight can't put any muscle when he went up to 170 we got to see who he really is we knew who he really was before me knocked out Eve Edwards in Bulldogs high school remember that yeah and those and Eve was a monster he was probably the best 55 pounder in the world people forget about that today do forget but I one of the reasons why I was trying to think why they would do that 70 I think you're right we're cowboy is the natural 155 is not a huge yeah welterweight but the other thing is is now that Connor fights at 70 now he has options him play in 70 and play at 55 right in 70 and I know his team wants to do it his manager Tony maws would optimist they won't be the comb co-main event against Nick Diaz and they want to Conor fight is Nick taking fights he announced on his Instagram there's big news about a fight on it Graham story I guess so did you see his interview with Ariel yep would you think would you think I didn't I didn't think he looked happy no I thought you know was real troubled and a lot of rambling I mean a lot of thoughts trying to get out of his head a lot of rants you know I mean I I think I don't it's like but have you ever watched an interview and be like goddamn that was with him yeah that was super close I mean I don't think that's his jam you know he's Jam it's fucking people don't talk about that human Nate they're just like adds a little I know it's it's tough cuz because again we kicked this pot death off with CT and stuff like that so it's like is is that a combination of him fighting is that what's going on there those are the years of the wars or is that just right is that just him we don't know but what I don't know him well enough but I mean I know guys but you know that are in that same era they're having real problems big time you gotta remember when he was fighting in Strikeforce god remember his fight with Paul Daley oh my god how about a cyborg fight how good was he man is so good about his Frank Shamrock fight holy fuck man it's a shame what happened with him and his brother in the UFC we didn't get enough of it well big smile Nate didn't get appreciated enough and after that he got fucked yeah and I had always said that after the Conor fight one of the reasons why those fights were so big was Nate and for whatever reason no one was putting that together I'm like this guy's a superstar people go crazy when they see him like this is not their like a regular fight it's fucking he smokes weed he's a STONER champion and and he says fuck you to the man every man for that yeah and even the vegans loved him cuz he sometimes he follows a vegan dude checked all the boxes for a lot of Anson's so he's like he's got so many good things and he's tough as shit and he'll fight anybody and he's been a veteran he's been fucking fighting for every so many war did you think of his fight against miles but all we haven't talked in a long I know MOSFET also good man he's so good I got my little out of the three rounds I thought it was best case for Nate to that they did that that doctor stopped the fight because I thought Maz Woodall was setting up to finish him and not in you know Nate's never been finished so she has been finished Josh Tom but that's right but I'm saying you know it's it it was going that way yeah it was best-case scenario it could be like dude what the fuck where he doesn't lose any of that you know right yeah well the Josh Thompson fight was more competitive up until the moment Josh landed that high correct that hike is it good fight Josh I think josh is still winning that fight I have to go back and watch there's more competitive it was more competitive this modeled off I didn't find it that candid when they got the mic and went Oh rematch went no there's no way and when Dana was like no that's not have another guy it was certainly competitive in that Maz Vidale was in a fight it wasn't like you ran him over know what's gonna harden ground sir but that first round was devastating Maz Vidale is fucking good man he's fucking smart he sees things and he can act on things that other guys just they just either don't have the ability to the or they don't throw themselves in the fire correctly like he does and then he gets out good his defense is on he's doing everything he stands straight up to he's got a totally different style like when you see Maz Vidale stand like he's now he's harder grab the chain dude he stand straight up he's got so much confidence in his wrestling takedown defense and his striking and his his octagon IQ that when he puts it all together he's able to fight with his best stand up stance you know he's fighting like and he makes you aware very clear very quickly that you're in danger with his hands he's throwing bombs at your fucking God think about his experience think of the guys he's beaten so now it's here so you know when you talk to him he's like the belt fuck the belt I get the BMF title yeah he's like Kobe and and kymaro or just that their third or fourth options for me man there I'm looking at Nick Diaz I'm looking at Connor you know there's just he's like I don't care about the belt man I see why he would say that but I think it would be a real shame if right now in his prime of primes he didn't fight for the title I just feel like he's so close and that that would be he's huge right now huge you wouldn't rather see him fight Nick or Connor no interesting no well I want to see first no matter what Kolby in who's mom you and you're getting that yeah that's getting super excited about that phenomenal fight once that's done I want Maz Vidale to fight for the title whoever's got the belt I think if Maz Vidale and Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz don't fight on the undercard yourself deal I don't know if it's gonna fight if they have no idea I know they want it and his management said the USC has reached out to Nick and they're trying to figure that out if they do make that fight happen I mean of course I'm gonna be excited to see it of course but my thoughts are that right now we're experiencing Maas Vidal in this very strange zone where you see fighters enter into it whether it's through this rededication or refocusing of his his his intent and his discipline you know he you know a story how he went and did that reality show he came back and was like yeah he didn't have any food man he saw this is fucking South American reality show he had to go to this village and ask for food he also said he got like he had time to like get out from in like sit back yeah think about everything going I was like alright this is what I want to do and then came back was like let's do it man then just he became this superstar nice I just you know when when when I meet those guys and y'all say I know their store and you get around them but you just I have this sense of just like I'm so happy for them man like that that's why I talked about a Nick Diaz fight for Jorge and I I talk about a Conor McGregor fight because do you not the title like kymaro and colby they're not making real money man you don't think that the colby that Kobe's gonna bring in a lot of people know what record would say does it and I love Kobe's fantastic fighter but as far as ticket sales and pay-per-view snow does from the UFC from the UFC this colby was one big win right now like see he hasn't fought in a while right he fights Robbie Lawler before that it was a whole year yes there hasn't been a lot of activity him and Dana hate each other but his crazy shit talking with his $3 suit and his fucking maggot hat and his bone the strippers if he gets through it right yeah it's tremendous if he gets through and he beats Camaro Oman and any and it gets on the internet and it becomes like a thing he could be the next huge superstar he knows what he's doing and you and I both know him he's not like that at all this is a fuckin character he's a really nice guy best he's smartest shit and his fucking discipline is unparalleled and people look at him with that stupid suit on and the Magna hat he's carrying around Donald Trump Jr's book and to strip it's fucking amazing dude he's good he's got the best act the whole she's ever put on in the UFC because he's got an act all these other guys are talking shit he's talking shit to a character he's playing game he made a guy he's playing games you think he thinks that suit looks good oh oh Sood is the cheapest suit he can find well I did a food truck with a food truck like you could see me like like dude you don't have to do this man we can just say yeah no it's cool smoothness strippers egos can you uh how about you know I'd be fun if one of you massage what are you massage my shoulders she goes get the fuck out of here look at him sitting there with his book triggered with his fucking will this suit is so funny closing on the Hat by Donald Trump versus White House when he was the interim chair oh he's still the interim champ yes you can't just take it from him but what's in string2 is you know remember him and Mosel all had they were training partners so there's a story there yes but again I think for my friends apparently yes but also yeah it's like a Andy Kaufman thing so if but I just for Mozilla right off in the sunset and be set up with his kids I want to see him fight Connor see if a fight Nick I know he made a ton of loot for that last ride he made a ton of loot for that loss right so it was a big success right everybody wanted to see that fight it was big and I think Maz rolls names never been brighter whoever wins the title do you think about the story of him burst Nick Diaz I love Nick's going my little brother that's the most I've ever relate to the Diaz brothers when he goes dude you beat my little brother cuz I have an older brother I was like oh hell yeah get him Nick I mean now bro yeah fuck you man and people will love that too I mean it'll definitely be successful but I would like to see Nick be real active before no I know you're right you're right I think that's what's crazy about the UFC warm up fight excuse me Conor hasn't won a fight in three years then before that the only fight he's had against khabib he he gets done boxing then fights fucking khabib hasn't beaten anybody since the idea Alvarez fight when he won the title it's crazy yeah it's crazy three minutes something fucking half a billion dollars this is where you got it whatever you want to say about Conor I've seen outside Don antics are have been crazy but you got to respect the guy who has all that money and goes yeah fight us aroni in January at welterweight now you know number five lightweight in the world he's like yeah fight that guy do you think that he can reignite the fire that he had like when he Khao Derek Brunson nope when he was coming up no not with that money in the bank that's I don't think fighting comes from that place but how come some guys when they have hundreds of millions dollars who still fuck people up like Tyson in his prime Lennox Lewis in his prime Tyson fuck people up until he until he until the bully fought back Oh even then he got fucked never the same hmm I think he's also tired of it too man I think it was a combination of the the he fought a guy who wasn't scared and didn't back down and was like yeah bring it dude yeah and you got fucked he's lost every fight that the guy was like I'm ascared he lost those fights but I'm not saying texting wasn't great boon Evander Holyfield's a better boxer man he's a better fighter but he don't get the respect but there were some guys that weren't scared of them that that's that stood in with them and he beat him by decision you know like didn't he beat razor Roddick by decision they had a lot of shit talk and he came out Bonecrusher Smith right yeah but when we're talking about tip of the spare like the Holy feeling these involve and Holyfield at that time Evander Holyfield there's a real good argument for sure that he's one of the greatest of all time only guys ever win the title four times easy but not but but I just think you know with Conor especially this day and age the UFC is different than boxing where it's such a grind man I was just guys are so good oh my bad guys I was evander spent all that money oh yeah and that one like one [Laughter] Rick Ross the fake Rick Ross house oh yeah you got the real freedom Ricky the real drug deal uh yeah who's out there do browser things in the community yeah the rapper the rest of his name he lost in court tried to get his name bagged try to get that guy to stop use as a name or pay him to use his fucking and how about that rapper Rick Ross used to be a cop and I thought yeah dope and all the security guard at a prison fight their own house dude so Evander Holyfield made hundreds of millions of dollars 5.8 oh it's not bad because it's outside of Atlanta but it has 37 rooms and like all his family shoved in it cost a million dollars just to keep every year I think that was the word there was a million dollars to run for maintenance yeah just everything holy fuck dude he moved into Bellagio Rick Ross made that with another dudes name just talking shit what a great country you could just talk shit in this country and you can make fucking millions of dollars and and and the other thing Rick Ross is he owns like a hundred Buffalo Wild Wings Buffalo stops wing steins to own shaft at wing stops crispy stops that's a good move right people always want wings wings have been around forever do I fucking my mouth lovely lovely they used to be a place right outside Boston Comedy and village we do sets at Boston comedy and there's this winged spot and they had there are different levels and one was suicide this you would get this suicide sauce on this fucking on these wings all Mike purple like it was a purpose I didn't know at the time I didn't understand hot peppers but it was definitely habanero because it was an orange color like a real orange color and you would eat those wings and just be like gee it's like a weird combination of pleasure and pain takes your breath away your lips go white ah I fucking love wings yeah I don't want to do that wings show though so I've done a good way to talk man you know it's like the interesting ones coming crying you do well it'd be fun though just to see be fun to see you on I know but why are you asking people personal questions why they're crying what's hot as fuck some guys just like some guys just crush it where the evening phase I'm like how does that happen oh there's my friend Tommy Hirsch go I've talked about him before we used to be a place called chili my soul in Encino and it was just crazy chili place this guy was into the most ridiculously hot chili it was so hot you would have to like sign a waiver if you wanted to buy the stuff that they put in it and then you say he was telling me that even with that the hottest shit that they had they had like a number system I think I think ten you know I think I ate was like the most I could tolerate but they would have these guys from Nepal come and even with the ten number ten the hottest shit they had these dudes be putting some extra hot sauce holy fuck do you like spicy Stein no I don't like your dad spice I like plant hand by sea but I like spicy I like I love um jalapenos with elk it's like my favorite I mean yes I slice up like four or five jalapenos and I'm in bunch of slices every time I take a piece of I'll put a piece of jalapeno on that bitch right now you when you coat when you post it and then fall asleep in a cheese pizza oh my god dude stuff keeps you alive gives you fuel you eat that stuff the spice from the pepper fucking just natural muscle of the elk meat oh that's the menu man that was it it was it was a number system yeah so ten demon is ten see that ten will fucking end your life ten plus and when oh my god ten plus oh and when they let you try it they would let you try it in the tiniest cup like a little little paper cup like that big and they've gives you a baby spoon like when I'm baby spoon you get at the ice cream store I'll try that different flavors that your friend to try that french vanilla and they give you a little something the plastic that's what it's like they would give you that and you would put it in your mouth and I would immediately start hiccuping your body's like what in the fuck are you doing to me man there's been a there's been a few people who on that that wing whatever the fuck the hot ones is yeah hot ones that's right the hot ones like Shia LaBeouf took all of them at the end put them all together the guy said I wouldn't do that dude and he did it in his he was like about to throw up it like bring him milk or some shit well Shia has got other issues probably justice for know laughter though very good very good actor you know peanut butter fell it's a hard road for all of us yeah he just meant wanted to get a little further down the road spice he's not for me did Randy boy Logan Paul in Hawaii did you really he was wandering around Hawaii do you see where they talked over nice kid right very nice nice I've talked to him before I talked to him with you oh that's right we're at the Omni story is there and he had a good fight man their fight was good it was a good fight they didn't get tired I mean they fucking went after it for six rounds for guys like that to go you know I've seen guys who have experienced an amateur box and like would gas the fuck out in front of a crowd like that pretty impressive it's interesting you know here's a guy also doesn't need to do that he makes a lot of money a ton of money makes a ton of money you like it or not that's the reality of it well someone likes it that's why he's making the money but I mean whether someone listening likes to hear it or not the truth is he makes a ton of incorrect you can lie all you know marries broke took a loss hoes money no no it's got all the madmen is s and he'd still decided to fight which is interesting it's like okay you know if you have that competitive drive in you you know if you really do have it in you I think I think for him and those youtubers especially at his level is just like what's the next thing that we can compete like getting everyone behind right and it was that they could have done ballet dancing whatever it is it would have sold millions and millions ago like they could but they chose this which I respect but that chaos a guy who I've never seen I'm not familiar with him I know he's British I like British people so I know he was like they're like a wonder a room at she's like fuck I'm like in the face again this was here dude I'm done well he won for sure so you know for him that's the best way to end it yeah he was like I'm out and it was real controversial you know what the RAF the penalty yeah again I thought was ridiculous it was rough like in he's respected ref but it's also like you're in there for this you know this kind of show like didn't take it for what it is he doesn't have fought for don't take two points from Logan Paul because of that two point yeah I didn't got a warning that's ridiculous I didn't agree with that and I think with more fights Logan could learn how to relax he gets wild and starts swinging for sure but Logan stop boxing yeah you have a jillion dollars keep doing that dude yes exactly exactly but it was interesting watching I'm like this kid can punch she's athletic man very athletic driven has a work ethic and in the heat of the battle and he was trained by Shannon Shannon the cannon Briggs let's go champ let's go check let's go champ was training them yeah Shannon cannon knows how to fucking fire he know you did a real camp and it's just like I respect it but it's a stuff I exactly don't maybe well no maybe well yeah like you check that box you're good man dude what do you think about Adesanya and Yoel Romero is that real it's not confirmed yet is it no I sent you something he sent that to me and I was like holy shit i precise that I fell asleep I woke up in one mic here we go but is it not confirmed somewhat roll me know I one of the websites I follow on Instagram but usually though they leak there and then it gets announced but if he does fight yo Romero and when I was talking to Jorge and you're Emile's manager when I was doing the food truck with Jorge he was just like Oh Jorge's getting a fight man I was like no he's coming off philosophy owes think about his fucking losses he was he has us do you think you lost Apollo coast I was like like no one got robbed but I can see why they get Paul but you have no unit there he was think about before that the Robert Whittaker fight yeah fuck with that too he definitely got robbed in the second Whittaker fight oh Christ I thought he won that fight yeah I've had that many many times too and I haven't really heard a good argument against it he had him hurt real bad yeah at least two rounds yeah I'd have to go back I remember at the time I did score it for Whitaker here's my thing that's fine pinky one yeah all right I can see that I see both sides but that's an argument forgiven you'll Romero the title shot because it's not like you got if you got starched in the game title shot you like what are you doing is it real this is on you off page shit March 7th here's the problem you still hasn't heard if you-all hasn't heard anything but that's one you all's Paige I know but he goes a lot of people pudding saying we fight March pudding saying we fight more how about should I be ready should be ready gay Jesus how about Andrew Schultz okay Andrew Schultz is super close with Izzie and he saw that and he goes dude why would is he fight this guy doesn't speak very good English I'm like what I'm like dude hold on what did he say yes he'll speak English she needs a guy to speak good English right be good you don't understand your Romero is such a fucking nightmare and for Izzy to go after you well it just ups the legend of Izzy this is what he's doing is perfect trust me it's perfect Andrew stay in your lane fuck this if he talked is he out of it I'd be so mad at him you would but imagine if he did what if Angier had some fucking magic hypnosis power dr. Schultz I am I'm not going to talk English like what the fuck are we dude why'd you do that don't forget for gay dude how about one that fight is confirmed Ferguson khabib is how the fuck did people not understand he was saying don't forget you know out of all the times that I've ever not done post fight commentary that was the time I was the most mad would they not let you I wasn't there I wasn't there for that fuck hose him so when he was saying it was a fight that I wasn't there but it was if somewhere where was that I don't know don't forget Jesus look I I know a lot of Cuban people I know what fuck he's saying he's saying don't forget Jesus it's not dope go for gay don't forget why would he say what what rank it up so we can hear it there's a fight night that's why you didn't do it now John he's got a Bible quote on his forehead not forget Jesus ah dude the thing is he's going what's wrong with you Americans what's wrong with the Americans you forget you forget you forget Jesus you gay people no that's exactly what pause for a second I'm gonna be honest I'm gonna be honest I did a little bit I was like we know because he lines it up with what's wrong with you America what's wrong with you here's the problem here's the problem he said forget pretty clear that's what fuck you forget you forget right buddy forgive Jesus believing J Jesus is that really what he said yeah play that shit again bro okay no you forget the back USA you forget you forgot the best in the world good not for gage eases people maybe but maybe not forget Jesus it's like what happened do you not forget Jesus there wasn't like there was some gay thing that was going on and he was commenting on and I know but he's so bad at English so bad it easily could be don't forget Jesus is it go for Jesus don't forget Jesus the only promise he goes what's wrong with you USA what's wrong with you you forget the number one Jesus what's wrong with you go back go back don't don't forget G don't forget don't forget Jesus but he says don't forget right one more time because it first of all pause for a second you gotta remember he just got hit in the head gang times right I mean what fight was this do we remember and look he's got John 3:16 or 318 a nap but bandana around his head he's got a Bible quote on his fucking dough for Jesus not forget Jesus people go for Jesus not forget Jesus yeah not you'll forget you forget Jesus it's it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense period you're trying to say not for gage eases that don't make sense no no no there's no rumors saying don't forget it started a rumor about Jesus being gay magically were the first ones after all these years and then it becomes like everybody's talking about it like you always tell there was a scroll shut broke it down shut chopped down Jesus was Jerry of course he loves everybody it's confusing though I can see how people mix those when we first watch on it oh it's gonna harden the paint on the USA and gays but I remember thinking don't really turn it that he was saying don't forget because a lot of Cubans with that accent they might say don't forget yeah don't forget don't forget we go out yeah we be here they have that sort of way of talking so when I hear don't forget always say that make sense get Jesus I'm gonna assume he said don't forget Jesus it doesn't make sense that we'd say now know for gage kept saying USA you forget USA you forget and then for gay for gay but he's barely speaking English that's barely that's not there's no way you should hold him accountable to be able to accentuate every word correct but I think I think most people got over it yeah and we just realized dude he just rehab listen man that guy is one of the most scary athletes I've ever seen in the UFC when he knocked out Chris Wyden with that flying need it just comes out of nowhere I mean he does shit to people man he throws people like he took our fucking straight head kick from Derek Brunson right to the neck just walked it off like it was nothing pretending like nothing happened does it really use his wrestling either well it does a little but really doesn't really fuck yeah he just wants to knock your head up I think with his mass right the amount of muscle that he has so much muscle and the explosive energy required to try to take somebody down I don't know if he can do that for five minutes for five rounds no especially the guy would take down defense yeah no and then he's a little bit more vulnerable with his striking if he can't explode see he's not a technical striker in the vein of style bender style benders a technical striker Kyle Bender is setting you up he's giving you look sand traps doing things to you to see how you respond and then he'll fake things and high kick he'll do some shit to you that you don't know it's coming your wells not that your well is exploding at a way that you can't handle you can't be on guard all the time you can't be like this because you're gonna burn out so there's gonna be a moment where you relax there's gonna be a moment where you you can't quite move out of the way quick enough and that's what he's gonna leave on you hits you with that flying knee when you hit why but you like it yes I I think first album though and just look it up the matchup and what stubborn did a Robert Whittaker mmm-hmm III do think is he finishes them I do it's all about it physique and just keep him from taking them down because if he if he's there standing up just thing about Yoel is these these power just these giant explosive movements but is he's gonna be aware of that he's gonna try to assume that I saw it look at Robert Whittaker never really had an opportunity to explode like that is he so good at distance and he's fought big powerful guys before so he's seen that you know the one guy that knocked out is he is starting to fight in MMA again that's Alex Pereira do you know him yep he's fucking terrifying yeah that dude is a ruthless striker houses MMA come and I have no idea I know you talk to shit dizzy but it's like that's cuz UK owed him in a kickboxing fight yeah horrific left hook Robert I mean alex Pereira fuck's up everybody for sure I'm amazed different animal very different different very different animal but in kickboxing as a ways to go it's too bad people don't know who that guy is I know you know because in kickboxing I mean you see what he did to Jason wellness no leave fuck dude tore him up holy fuck kickboxing foot pull up Alex Pereira versus Jason willness on glory for the world title dude he's a fucking terminator he smashes people who's he fighting with well it's no man he's fighting glory no I'm saying MMA is heat right no no I heard that he's about to do it again I don't know if a match up has even been announced but his fucking striking so dangerous because in a lot of ways he reminds me he's very big not with the Phenom well that's the kind of knocked out is he not with the finality of like the way Deontay Wilder punches but with that kind of he's got that strangely divinity yeah yeah Deonte something special him he really is I mean nobody 316 pounds nobody knocks people out with a punch like that to get a forehead I mean I've never seen it he's he's he's like the new next level in terms of strike you know Ruiz and Joshua's rematch of Saturday that's right that's right at the 7th so in this fight he sets him up and I think he hits him with a knee and then and then a high kick he stops them or high kick first and then a knee it's coming up here but Pereira is one of those guys we're in it okay it's right there you just missed the knockdown ready here it is Pereira is one of those guys that can really do this to anybody it's just a matter of if he hits you so illness is his top boom there's the direct dam willness Jason wellness is as tough as they come he's been in there with some fucking killers in fact is he lost to Jason wellness by decision it was a I thought he I thought it was kind of a bad decision I thought style Ben will get that fine back that up again I was talking let's see that again watch this this is how good Alex fucking Pereira is son watch this one more time look how good that knee is watch that left knee by God that shit perfect perfect look at that again watch this boom that is that is a perfect flying knee and that's just how tough Jason Wolman where was his MMA fight Jamie do you know so he's gonna be trouble for sure for everybody if he gonna stop - what remember eco van Hoven came over and ran it yeah he's training that a K and have we heard from did he just got that rematch with Badr Hari in cake box yeah that's coming up real soon but I thought he was gonna keep doing MMA and eventually come on over to the dark side I think he wants to do that after Badr Hari but the bottle hari fight is the biggest fight in all of kickboxing okay so he's had two fights that he would and one fight that he lost so he lost his you his MMA debut by submission rear naked choke but then he won two fights by KL and TKO fun three years yeah he's fighting in Jungle fights which is kind of like the elephant yeah yeah but that was listen I mean who knows who he's fighting now but see if you could pull up Alice Pereira fight soon so how old is he oh say six thirty oldest a third to even find two years he'll be tough there what's all about whether or not he's got a ground game I don't know anything about his ground game yeah all I know about is his striking his fun ferocious dude he's so scary and he could do that to anybody if you could do that to style bender you could fucking do that to anybody for sure if you see the style bender fight he catches him in a clean left hook and just shuts his lights out but shows you a good style bender still yep boom look how good this guy is Jesus Christ but how about stop banner has the skill set to fight a guy like that that wasn't style button right there that was a different fight was that different current champ champ instead of glory yes he won two device yeah he's fighting 205 and 85 right is that though with the two differences in the weight classes I think so either way murderer just a murderer scary guy there's a but there's this everybody and then there's Wilder does everybody everybody with power you've ever seen and then there's Wilder while there's powers like what is happening like he's got super power yeah like his techniques not phenomenal it's just not you see sometimes he throws from the hip it's just like such as you it's over here's the thing he's not like a George Foreman or like these bigger dudes he's he's little floats around to 13 to 2:19 yeah like he's not a big dude not even not even remotely big it's insane it's insane when he hit Ortiz on the forehead and just draw and that's not an easy fight no or no monster no and it showed Ortiz is winning in my book who's winning I'm winning and now you got fury Wilder in February can't wait for that and what do you think about Saturday night what I mean Oh with Joshua pieces I'm up do you do I do really I hate when people say you know oh it's like a Buster Douglas situation it's not because someone doesn't like Mexicans so yeah we're kidding folks yeah my girls make some my yeah kids make some for god sake jeez Andy Ruiz has got a shot he has a shot but because he was also be it's not fluke like Buster Douglas Mike Tyson because injuries is winning most the fight before he even knocked him out yeah not got knocked down third but he was winning he had more rounds went in the bank well he got knocked down but then he got back up and knocked Joshua now correct so he was ahead on the scorecards too so and then he just stopped them right but I think it was the perfect storm for Anthony Joshua to lose the fight I think Joshua knows what he's dealing with remember that was a late replacement he specified big baby Miller and also going in that camp he was dealing with some personal issues which everybody does but the other things he gotten the rumor is it's coming got knocked down and camp by a Philadelphia heavyweight you know I forget that he's a stud I definitely heard the rumor from multiple different sources that he got knocked out legit source I heard guys who would know it seemed like it there was another rumor that he had a nervous breakdown in the locker room that he knew he shouldn't been fired and his dad was like no let's not go out there so that's why see his dad arguing with Eddie Hearn yeah and here's what else is interesting too is now they're doing the rematch it's in Saudi Arabia they they didn't have arena there they built it for this seats 15,000 people putting so crazy he's making seventy five million dollars some shit like yeah for this fight and it's I think it they're they know what's going on there's something going on because it's away from everything like media is not gonna be the Saudi Arabia so there's like the pressure of the English crowds not there so I they're trying to protect the Golden Goose here in Saudi Arabia what do you think he's the golden goose here's what I think I think if Andy Ruiz knocks him out again he's he's bigger golden gooses there is in the world injuries you know how many fucking Mexicans are my bro I don't have to tell you made to yourself Mexicans man and the guys soft-spoken he's a sweetheart he's got fantastic hands I mean he's got a fluidity to him that you rarely see in the heavyweight division wears a lot of heavy weights feel like big one punch guy so he's it's like bobbin and Weavin a different combination as people are confused because if you've just discovered a new reason then empty and Joshua a fight he's not a finisher he's not a knockout artist that was just that fight it was balls to the wall he just had nothing to lose he was like playing with house money but now he's a better pure boxer than Joshua but Joshua but you finishes him under 10 interesting yeah well he definitely heard him in the first fight he heard him first and then threw caution to the wind and got cracked yep because he underestimated Andy's resolve and his ability to recover Andy is inside that you know close quarters no imagine what would happen if instead of going crazy and trying to stop them what if he just boxes on the outside and keeps trying to a shot yes yeah that's gonna do yeah instead of going in like he did in the first fight correct is I think is gonna he's gonna stay on the outside use a jab set him up he's gonna win rounds with footwork in boxing and then a vent in the jab and then eventually six seven eight Ruiz can be way down on the cards that guy go-for-broke I think it's not coming interesting who knows see who knows for sure I feel like Ruiz is gonna have incredible confidence because he's going into this fight knowing that he's able to beat the heavyweight champ of the world win the title and he's got fucking Rolls Royce now okay he's going in there with champ attitude you think yes or is he going there down him so don't think so two things I don't think so I think you realize he can hang with the Jets he knocked him out he won the title I think he's a fucking champ and I think he's got more love and more respect than he's ever had in his life I think he likes it it seems like he's having a good time I think we see an even better Andy Ruiz I think we see beaten up I don't know I don't know if he beats him but I think he's gonna be better I think I think Josh was gonna be better too I think both guys realized this is Joshua but also Joshua loses this fight it's a good where does he go for me I don't know man I don't know I mean look you tell me you wouldn't want to see Joshua Wilder oh I'll watch Joshua Fury all goddamn day Wow door knocks Joshua cool I want to see everything me too I wanna see it all let me see everything I want to see all of it I think Andy lost weight was Andy way now I think he's down his speeds trouble man who did his combinations she's so fluid so simple forget about Joshua though man I remember can't forget who was a gold and he got dropped by Vladimir Klitschko member that kid came back and just beat Dillion white like his resume is insane oh yeah I mean Olympic gold medalist you know and probably the best body in the history the division seriously especially when he fought when he fought Ruiz he was a little thick I think he's lost little blade himself I think one of the things he's done is he's gone less strength and conditioning and more pure box he was so big he was talking about that he said essentially his word the way described it is I was listening to this interview with him some English gentleman and he was saying that you think about it you have a hundred percent of your energy if you put 50% of its strength conditioning and 50% of it to boxing you're not going to achieve the same amount of you put a hundred percent to boxing something to that effect yeah so the idea is he's doing less roadwork he's doing more conditioning in the gym and he's doing like heavy bags man smart yeah it's because if you look at you know in degrees of advantages over and be speed combinations so you just be this big heavy bulker also if you're looking at future matchups Fury and Wilder they're all lighter on the feet yeah you know move better better cardio so how much weight as he lost him this is Joshua he said he's taking on a prison workout mindset for this fight well his career is on the line I think yeah here's a thing - then it's same with Conor McGregor Connors careers on the line as well against cowboy oh for sure yeah so when you put these guys Andrew East has tricked fans into thinking he's lost weight did that Bert Kreischer trick for this picture he said crasher trick first of all how dare you there's a video of him hitting the shield and he misses and catches his trainer on the chin get a little wild fuck yeah he dropped his trainer I would be worried about anybody's you know he's seen the spotlight and that money and there's the Rose Royce and he might have been partying San Diego I'd be worried about him I'd be worried about him you know being like oh this is the life yeah that's possible you know but I don't think so I think I think he's a disciplined guy I think he just goes wild and just can't be that discipline with that body no no no he looks a certain way that you're you're not gonna get away with discipline doesn't come to the food well it's not gonna win any best body contest but he fucks a lot of people up fucks a lot of people up I don't think he's gonna have a trick Joshua this time no I think the first time we tricked him Joshua is probably looking at I'm like I'm gonna fuck this boy I was like oh well that's what you do I've seen this in the millions of fights I've had in Olympics yeah watch this that's what I think is gonna happen now Ferraris wins alright but you know I just I just I don't see it man it's it's so interesting because it becomes as big a fight as Wilder fury - it becomes a giant fight while their fury - to me is the heavyweight fight that's the heavyweight fight I'm really interested in this fight Joshua's third I thought Josh or Joshua's like it used to be Joshua number one the golden child and you know see lost they fell off but wild and fury have just been doing their thing well this is the fight that I want to see more than anything is wild of fury - that's the number one - just because the first one was so controversial and fantastic so good and you know I rewatched it yesterday in fact you can make a real real solid argument that Tyson Fury got robbed a hundred percent they don't the only argument for Deontay Wilder is you know he did knock him down Oh dad if the fight was a fight if it's a fight fight you know like in the streets and - guys were going at it like that and one guy dropped the guy and blasted him and then dropped him in the end and who's laying on his back and he got up and they you know at the end of the round they decided that was the end of the fight you would say man I think he won he fucked that dude up but as far as boxing rules goes and contests purely one that fuck you ever won the box you're on first but Deontay Wilder I like to draw them because jianci Walter had did the most damage in the fight so I was like all right when is the drum like oh I dig that here's the argument against a draw though he gets dropped Tyson fearing is dropped in the the final round right loses one point for sure right it's definitely now a 10-8 round for Tyson for Deontay Wilder after that knockdown is a bad knockdown but then he gets up and wins the rest of the rounds the wrestler so what do you say there you give a point for that so you know Fury won the fight so what is it nine eight what is that then if it's a 10-point must system how does that work does that mean then would it go back to even can you have a seven seven round you both drop each other twice I don't think so I don't think so no right what happens there do you ever imagine guys but that wouldn't just go back that you want to score that round ten eight you'd do a ten shouldn't we know this it just be a ten nine I should I should definitely know this boxing judges but even we use the same scores in the UFC don't think dude it's not were you at all so khabib Tony I'm like fuck yeah finally best fight skill-wise all-time lightweight division won the best fights the US could ever make but same place Brooklyn Brooklyn might have voted why are we doing it there dude you got and guess who's the doctor probably homeboy freaked out when he saw blood on eight deals that's right so he's a doctor you don't think Tony FERS and be using those elbows oh my that's so true doc take a fucking Hut so true he's gonna use those elbows from the bottom to son he's not scared of getting taken down not at all not at all enjoys it you're gonna fight off his back he loves it you're gonna get that for I think you're gonna get one of the greatest trilogies of mixed martial arts history of those three he can Timbo in a way that other guys can't this other places could be oh yeah when you look at the matchups that you're just like holy shit tony is a perfect kind of faux fur could be well particularly because he's so good at submitting people from his back went with everything with arms and with legs I mean he beat Kevin Lee with a triangle think about how many people eat Darst how about that Barbeau is a fight yes Darce a guy that's completely covered in blood which is so hard to do here's the other thing you got to remember Tony doesn't get tired doesn't get tired it's a wave it's a slow wave so in the fifth he's actually better than he was in the first how is that possible what the fuck is he doing strength and conditioning why's that other people and he's just always been that way I think it's a genetic thing I think you know I used to train with Tony a train he would he would spar with everybody else keep going to guys like I'm good then go to the bag or Brent Sprint's he's just he's just in his DNA to keep going you talk to Eddie about it like did I was doing six hour-long practices yeah they said there's no one like him and they said that everybody else gets exhausted all the people that train with him they're all getting exhausted and he's lapping them running hills does his hill sprints laps everybody I mean just a freak like the Cain Velasquez thing like what's going on right what is happening there but you know it is both Mexican - there's something about that some gilbert melendez - back in his prime known for having cardio actually he said it I think a lot of his uh just like powerful Mexican genetic Mexican DNA listen man you know any endurance and Irie says hold my hand say my fuckin tamale if he wins dude come on man you know what operation we're gonna have an LA if he beats Ruiz he beats Joshua brother yeah maybe I mean Canelo is the fucking canals he's the fucking man - here's the really crazy thing ready for this if Amy Ruiz lost all the fat on his body how much you think he weigh [Laughter] but what is like he's probably 250 right 250 260 he's not tall either he's maybe 6-1 6-2 okay and that's on there so it's really 511 now what's his weight Oh boys 250 you see 215 he's thick like a bowl of guacamole yeah make yogurt drinks they don't make guacamole drinks it's so the fuck out of here I'm a fan of him I just think it oh did he really was he against tight Anthony Anthony Joshua in the first fight dude 511 262 up boys or not or he's just like what why dude I'm fucking do I'm the heavyweight champion of the world he has three belts he has more belts than Wilder it's more belts than anybody here's an argument that I always used to make about Roy Nelson was that he could take body shots better cuz it's like he's wearing eight sweaters yeah they hit like a Mack truck belly roar would take a shot to the belly like it was not a people would kick him but remember like Frank was kicking when everybody's kicking the crow cop Rock them in the stomach yeah it listed I couldn't find a nineteen stones and two pounds to 68 you 270 bro 511 270 just think that he trains hard he trains hard but he must again shit out some Mexican food Mexican genetics food Mexican food to will pack on the pounds if you're looking up some calorie dense food row there's a place up here what is that place on Canoga where is that place that Mexican joint that we go tell my soul no no been assaults one the best places this is one little joint on you want to say the name cuz I don't want them to get flooded oh don't be so good dude so good and so authentic you go in there good the Mexican soap operas are playing now freak out pickled jalapeno tell me off it stopped on the way home a freak the fuck oh my goodness they got languages my baby six days old already if I had one food forever it might be Mexican Mexican or Italian yeah one of those two if I could only have one thing forever like a specific ethnic food Mexican so good oh it's gotta know what I might say Brazilian really mates they chew Hoss Korea if I had money short yeah I wouldn't miss the meat yeah dude all the carne asada with Mexican oh that's true that's true yeah but like if I'm if there's a Mexican joint next to a fogger - ciao I you know what I'm not a big fucking a child guys stresses me out are you flip the green they just keep coming I'm sweating and I don't you know and I don't eat the salad bar Mikey ain't honeydicked me on that dude that's how you keep your Oh digestive tract clean never I know I only to fillet the real expensive one I know what I'm looking for my delay I'll do that I forget what is the way to go I think that's it roast yeah yeah link or the sausage I'm like bitch I didn't come here for sausage go get the fucking red meat bro what's with the dried tomatoes I know you're you can put away some food I guarantee you Ari Shaffir will eat you under the table in that place I agree I don't eat that much food there's some but you can if you want I could you could you got a lot of room yeah big fella bigger than Ari Shaffir I'm telling you I never seen nothing like it he just goes for plates and plates all of us including Diaz it's always the skinny guy sitting back home what the fuck is going it's right he's what you want I'm gonna keep eating so I think Ari when he knows he's gonna go to Fogo to child he like won't eat for like a day I think Jew in a man he just gangster about it it's I think it's competitive as well it's like kind of this fun jerk you think you gotta make me pay this much and I'm not gonna eat more than that's worth did we uh we had danced so around you heard the comic comic he's fucking the best he's from a new HBO special right yeah damn yeah he's from Aurora did we played against John oh shit he played a linebacker Smoky Hill I played at Overland so we know each other that's hilarious yeah so we had him on the show day but he was talking about he was talking about how the culture in LA the comics how they like help each other out and I was like well that's because Joe Rogan cut is the guy that cultivated that kind of atmosphere where you know it's we help each other out in the podcast game in the comics like Joe's one started that and he goes you know who start in New York and I'm like I don't seen him in New York I know you guys and Andrew Schultz kind of part of the squad over here now but and he goes when Ari moved from LA because of Joe when I moved from LA came to New York he came in there I was like fuck's wrong with you guys what's wrong with you guys and just kind of like took over I was like no no we're gonna help each other out man and he's like that and he learned that obviously you and I are close but he took that same attitude and brought to New York that's interesting my take on it was always she treated like martial arts like we're in there we're doing battle it's not us versus us and if you're better I get better yep it's better for everybody and we got into this because we're fans of comedy yeah I got into comedy because I loved watching it I want to watch it I want to watch Diaz like I want to watch Theo I want to watch count I want to watch you want to watch every I want to watch people kill but we're all friends watching I want to watch Mikasa tell your friends like I don't see that nobody's bomb why don't we laugh when someone bombs but do we know so many good comics bill burr I mean cut the fucking shit there's so many of them now Dahlia there's so many murder Whitney this is a bunch of murderers Bert Scholl - there's so many Schultz's murdered mark Norman Solaris there's so many good comics now and if you really love comedy we're supposed to do that for each other we're suppose there's not many of us man the idea that like your success somehow or another is bad for me that's crazy what am I gonna be in Tennessee when you're in Tennessee you know you're gonna come follow me around we're gonna back for the same customers is fucking people everywhere there's 300 million people we've also done so in the same town and you're doing these giant arenas job we just not done the in problem they all sell out or sell out my solo yeah dude we we have a unique thing and this unique thing is really only appreciated by the people that are doing it like everybody that's doing it like realizes like this is unusual we haven't had this before but but I think it comes from you you need someone in your position to do that people oh that's he's killing and he's nice like that oh that makes sense you know well I think that's where it comes from very happy yeah I'm very happy because it's a it's a it's a different time it's a different feel it's a different time you know like when I was coming up when I was my early days the comedy store was like very backstabby and very like people didn't didn't help anybody and they weren't happy when you got good things and you know this wasn't a lot of camaraderie you know like me and Diaz that was like my first real comrade at the store you know when I became like really good friends with Joey cuz I realized like Joey's like a real guy you know what I mean it's like he's an animal like he grew up I mean he when I met him it was only a few years after release for armed kidnapping but I knew who he was like I got it I got a good mic this is a man like like I'm his friend with friends I'm that guy's friends to the death yep I'm his friend to the death and I know that about him with me 100% we became friends like real early on in our life and you guys would go on the road together oh yeah man I would eat it man I ate it going on after him once Jersey oh dude I wasn't ready I had only been doing comedy got to realize when I came out to LA I'd only been doing comedy six years two four six 84 94 yes yes yes yes and I shouldn't have been you know and I ate it a few times I ate it once I was headlining four years in and Jim Breuer made me fucking go down in flames one of the most horrific bombings of my career but I learned something out of it when I learned by watching Jim Jim was murdering just destroying and - I learned that I was servus I was real nervous before I went on I wasn't enjoying him I wasn't laughing in him instead I was scared I was like sitting back there scared that I had to go next how am I gonna follow this instead of laughing and enjoying it and going there's a guy who's having a good time and wants everybody to have a good time I was going up they're selfish they can smell that like oh this guy's myself I wasn't thinking about having a good time I wasn't thinking about being the director of having a good time so I had to learn that with Diaz I I learned that with with with Breuer for sure but I never had a follow Breuer again after that other than maybe like a small spot at the the like Boston comedy or Caroline's or something like that but not Lemmon he was doing like a half an hour he was the middle and I was a headliner I wasn't supposed to be a fucking headline you know Brewers doing like he's open up for a while it's a delicate yeah but I think Hatfield just checked into rehab yeah I know so yeah donut Brewers a monster but but so but me taking Diaz on the road with me first of all like I knew like I want to take guys on the road with me that can hang that were fun we could talk shit we can have fun we can go to dinner and laugh yes well you go to dinner with Joey Diaz you've been dinner with us it's the guy I'm Joey Diaz show the best we're just crying yeah he knows that we love him and he knows were giant fan he turns it on so he turns it on yeah I gotta tell everybody that's the funniest person that's ever walked the face of the earth he said things that I couldn't believe he fucking said in restaurants were fallen on the ground pounding the carpet under the table can't breathe can't breathe and he's a fucking animal but like to have a guy like that and to go on a road with a guy like that you also have to be sharp like you have to you have to pick your game up you should I mean it's basically your sparring with the best of the best you can't slack off no you just can't there's none of that you can't do that you have to be ready and you have to enjoy it so what I learned to do instead of being scared to go on after him which I what definitely was a couple of times I check his hat one time in Jersey I remember I did okay I did good like I didn't bomb but there was moments where was rough it was today I'd want to kill mice anyway you know I mean I go I could barely get through it anyway but I remember just it was like whoa like there was like ten whole minutes where I was struggling before I picked it up it was bombing his bad date it wasn't the worst kind of bombing where they don't clap when you leave yeah but thank you good night there's nothing like fuck you mean a bomb like that but expected but then so then we all started hanging out together right and then it was like Ari and red band and Duncan and we all support each other and we all started just spreading this idea like we're all friends okay like just because we're all doing the same job we're not in competition with each other we're supposed to be the opposite yeah we're supposed to be in support of each other and then if you do that then we can bring other people along too and instead of it being a network like NBC or ABC or CBS or whatever these people you don't know and their job is just to find people that they can sell on television they're trying to find to bring us to the network try to find a product whether it's The Tonight Show or its friends or whatever the show is they're trying to figure out how something could go in there and everybody feels like they're competing for that well I'm like well that's we're in the opposite situation now now the more people the better so it's not like you and I are both competing for some fucking role on Cheers it's not what it is now it's the more the better yeah like the more if you know funny people and then they go oh Brendan says that guy's funny he must be funny he knows funny and then they watch that guy and that and you can and then it's a real Network so then it's a network of friends so it's a different kind of network there's no contracts no but everybody knows if feel Vaughn tells you somebody's funny that guy's got to be funny cuz Theo Vaughn is funny as fuck yeah so it's just like nice little thing where everybody's kind of helping everybody and then when you go there now it's like a feeling of family like every time we go to the store it's all hugs everybody's hugging you know it's all like what saw was out it's all friendly it's that's not all the weirdness man and it helps people it helps people get over the hump because sometimes someone would keep someone from a professional is like you don't you know you don't have supportive friends and you don't put the extra effort into it because it doesn't feel good to be there because you're not doing well cuz you bomb too often that's a big one you need someone to like pull your side when you're ba many go hey man you gotta stop open with that bit you make people uncomfortable but also go I've been there too I've been there do it anybody tells you they have a bomb is either a thief either they've been stealing all their jokes or they're just not telling the truth in that real comedy it's hard you it's fucking hard and you you get humbled every time you come up with something new and every time you have to do a new special and every time you have to put away the old jokes and write new ones you're humbled you're eating shit all the time there's no way you're not going to if you're coming up with a new bit there's gonna be a time where you're gonna say it well you've never said it before that's just that's as a fact and it's never gonna be that good when you're in that scampi yeah that's Bambi like it's all Bambi on ice it's so embarrassed trying to fucking it's so big you're forcing it it's clunky that's the game though yeah that's what we do and the more we do it together the more we help each other the more it makes people want to come see it too so it's like the stores never been more packed but never never been more packed it's sold out every night every night it's and it's everybody's got a good vibe it's nice everybody you see there everybody's happy to see everybody everybody's happy it's nice people very nice I'm happy to help I'm happy to help but I'm just trying to promote the thing that we all want we all want you know it's not like trying to show people something they don't want everybody wants family everybody wants Brotherhood and sisterhood everybody wants like a nice community everybody wants to feel good but like some people think everybody has imposter syndrome to men when you meet famous people I was had a phone call the other day with Johnny Depp you did me and Johnny Depp were talking on the phone and I'm like what is going on in my fucking life I'm here having a phone call with Johnny Depp you wanna come on the podcast oh I don't know it's just I just want to talk to him it was just a cool conversation really yeah yeah good guy oh he's a nice guy I'm a big fan he's a sweetheart of a guy phenomenal but it's like talking to on the phone Michael what is this life you know and people every even I bet even Johnny Depp feels like he's full of shit everybody feels relgious well your fraud let's go pull the curtain up yeah fuck and when everybody said like you saw up you're a fraud like yeah you're right everyone's cool man everyone I guarantee you Daniel day-lewis probably feels like a fraud sometimes it's imposter syndrome everyone gets it but so uh talking to Johnny Depp you're like what the fuck is happening like what is before that was Kanye West yeah that was weird to to you that wasn't insane - um that was weird - it was real weird it's weird I met Paul McCartney once at the improv I was like Hello what and the fuck am i doing staring at you how are you a real thing how are you really Paul McCartney crazy I didn't even stick around to talk to him just said hi kept moving stand up to thinking about him why was it Brynn I hope you can handle it Paul McCartney gets really bummed out ones wife what if like did like the Caitlyn Jenner thing and heckles you doubt me you know have you ever talked those guys answer on the podcast I need anyone said no or you don't even push it Chappelle is an interesting one cuz they have talked about it yeah no Mike no Rick Chappelle motherfucker his cousin Dave is uh you know David said it was like he's like I'll do it sometimes and go but I don't know you know and I was like dude I hear you I don't do anybody else's mail honey tell me why would you yeah many time and second of all I get it man you you say enough with your comedy and it's like dave is a smart guy man he figured it out he figured out where was slipping away when they were fucking with him when he was doing the Chappelle show he was like you know what just sit back for a bit just sit back for a bit and he started dude do you know what he did here what an artist Dave Chappelle is he wasn't scheduling shows instead he would bring a speaker to the park I know in Seattle he set up a fucking speaker and do an impromptu stand-up show and everybody was like what is doing on and at the time he could have filled up arenas man crazy I mean still can for sure you know still can still does the ones I did with him were phenomenal we had so much fun but he decided to take time off he decided that like let me just sit back and you know this is such at the level you're at this step away is probably the hardest to say no is probably the hardest thing he's our biggest genius he's our biggest comedy genius and he might he might be one of the biggest comedy geniuses ever oh yeah but he's certainly our biggest comedy genius of today he understands comedy like nobody else did you hear what he said Trevor Noah was on a show and they asked him about opening for Dave Chappelle because chappal bought him on a bunch of dates and Trevor Noah was like he was saying he was I mean I'm I'm fairly good at stand-up I'm not the best but you know I've been a stamp a while now and he goes I'm in the green room with Dave Chappelle he goes then I'm thinking why the fuck would he have me open for like he has all these guys like great comics what do you mean so he said that to him he goes hey Dave I don't know man why the fuck do you have me at your shows why I'm open for you and he was you know a million better comics he goes I can find any funny there's a ton of funny people there's a ton of funny comics but you're funny and then an interesting so to your point he's like we can go to dinner like you're an interesting person and people care about interesting people so there's guys that can bring out we're gonna murder but they're not interesting people don't care you're you can murder and you're interesting that's why you're here I like to talk to Dave see if that wasn't actually work wrote yeah Tommy was cool Jesus he just Trevor Noah just kids as he said I'm here because I'm really smart Donovan giant did he start his podcast I tried to talk him and do it for literally a year really I think I started talking about it last February or something like that February or March was when did he do the podcast the first time you told me to do a podcast from then on I'm like what are you doing man you were born funny he's about anything he could ramble okay so almost you know like whatever that is ten months so it's ten eleven months ago you gotta go and finally got it going so funny and he's doing it with Kate Quigley which is per phone ice dynamic yeah it's perfect and have someone to bounce off shit you know or you can bill Bert or Chris D'Elia they're just the mic that's a special yes he has done that but it's better to have cake quickly baptizes yeah first of all Kate understands like comedy she knows what he's doing for sure and get away if he goes on a rant yeah you know it's perfect you know she'll bring people there herself so she'll bring people to the podcast as well it'll help you know who else start like podcasts and finally is Whitney Cummings I know I was killing it to course illness you should have been doing a long time ago curry she's another one she would do other people's podcast I know she would like prepare she's like one of the rare people would prepare for podcast no time she would say no shit to talk about she's so smart she's ambitious people I've ever met in an interesting way not ambitious like wants to be famous no but wants to complete projects she's always like well I'm in the middle of directing this documentary I'm so much going on what are you talking about are you directing of you're directing documentaries aren't patoot our neighborhood is whitney Thompson girl like it's all of us right there man it's a vortex bro it's a vortex you see Tom's gears dance video yes it's fantastic bro Bert oh the shish and I he said the direct remember it want him to stab take a gun and keep shooting oh my god and Tom was like all right I'm down but I guess thought that there was too long so he's like we cut that out just me stabbing you yeah the stabbing thing is the way to go yeah but it's dancing I mean Duke and dance he can dance you know he's starting to do Tommy shows in Spanish oh my god how crazy in Spanish yeah he just did a special in Austin or maybe he's getting ready to know I'm Jesse just for conflict he's just filmed it but that one's not in Spanish no no that's regular but he's yeah it was the other thing I was thinking about this cowboy versus Connor fire that's the most Irish guy versus the most American guy it's Bud Light verse proper with actual bud the real shit fuck your blood light if you're like eating clams or something you want something cold dude its Budweiser first proper whiskey that's what I'm saying and I like my Budweiser in a can I like to know I'm a pussy me too is Connor reaching for his whiskey while Cowboys reaches for his Budweiser I mean I guess I wish they would have done it in like Dublin or something like a giant stadium in Dublin where are they doing it Vegas I guess well they probably had an agreement with Vegas anyways I think the thing about Vegas is like there's the most people that can come it's easy to get to there's the most amount of hotels you make the most money make the most money you make the most media it's it's look it's gonna be fucking great just on TV or watch it live it's gonna be fucking great I can't wait and if Connor can you know can catch him early it could be very interesting it's literally a you know a sprint versa marathon because cowboy has stick around and yeah you know five rounds for Connor at welterweight it scares me man if cowboy can use his distance and he's very good at doing it you know and he can avoid that straight left you know cuz Connors got a piston over left hand man I think Connor is better with his hands but Cowboys better with his feet and also the one thing everyone's forgetting is cowboy can fucking wrestle man Enya's phenomenal submission so yeah if he wants to pull that out it's a point of the fight he can definitely do it I don't think he's going to I don't think he's going out of ice the Mike Perry fight opened a lot of eyes cuz Mike Perry is a gorilla gorilla that guy is fucking strong as shit and when when cowboy arm Bardem you know Mike Perry sent him a picture of x-rays of a broken arm that wasn't really his arm oh really this what he did to my arm so he's like oh hell no and cowboys like but really didn't really break his are fake broken arm in the x-ray this arm wasn't broken they didn't like Perry you do like 21 I mean there's like 0.01% of black and you just started dropping there's just no I was like fuck is happening Mike Perry's wow dude he's hilarious is what does it say platinum tattooed on his eyebrow is it yeah I don't know he's wild real here's a fight coming up yeah who's he fighting he's fighting someone good right Jeff Neil is he fighting Jeff Neil yeah whoo that's a good fight Jeff Neil do you know who is Ellie how sweet you know who we'd leave out when we're talking about welterweight and it's so fucked up Leon Edwards oh he's won eight in a row well how about Maz Vidale fucking sucker punches him and it cuts his face and they're in the you know the the middle of this whole thing after he'd knocks out till I know and he's in the heat of this but it gets no traction there was a guy whatever they actually got in the fight straight fight yeah and everyone's like yeah but Leon nobody don't see you I'm sorry I know what anybody sees one monster well he beat cowboy by decision but cowboy was sick going into that fight yeah not to say Leon couldn't have won anyway but uh that's there's a guy who never pulls out of a fight well the last time you heard cowboy pull out of a fire never he would have to be on death's door again he he's been a yes-man for the UFC he's gone through so much shit Kenan wait on three days notice and fight losing Sara Lee even then he's a yes-man it was like he's just down the fight right but for it but at some times it's not for the best of his career like when he fought Maz it all in Denver's home time the hometown after the Mike Brown fight we like did he suffered a lot of damage like dude fighting hometown whatever four weeks later he's like yeah right you know I'm saying like that usually your work because you're like dude to be honest with you to get to the title that doesn't make a lot of sense I'm positive that Dana's actually told them that too it's um at certain points I was not blaming Dana I think that he wanted fights where Dana was like look just slow down I'm sure I'm in but I just smiled nice a while dude but it's paid usually it doesn't pay off it's paid off he got his golden news goose well he's in an interesting stage where he's doing a lot of fights so he's really comfortable fighting right he's fighting very regularly and he also you know at that age where his brain and his knowledge of fighting and his fight IQ is at its highest while his body's still hanging in there hanging in there though but there's a fine line where it's let's say you got knocked up by Katie right so let's say Conor knocks up then it's like I what are we doing exactly because you're in he's like 36 now 637 so this is you know this is the area right from 36 to 40 is where you see you know some guys burn Hopkins it and they just fucking eat nothing but grilled chicken with perfectly cooked vegetables that's the exactly the most except he's the the the most odd exception cuz Bernard Hopkins was elite as a boxer with no drugs no nothing yeah mmm a really can't get away also could control the pace where he could dictate like how fast you guys fought so nobody could just put a pace on him mmm not like no it's a different animal it's a completely different animal and the only guys have really made it successfully deeper than their 40s were not on the match no and you know the early days of fighting man you got to realize like the early days everything has to have an asterik everything every kind of is the Wild West was like everyone did it you know yeah because it was kind of a level playing field speaking of what you see Vitor getting ready for one Fc it's throwing fast combinations looking juicy juicy ah I love that big again what weight is he fighting at was he fighting at 205 205 right does it say the boys in a good way how many more years do you think he can have under those looser guidelines I think does it for three more you they won't even let you saw it in the country to watch you can't get out now okay but if we don't even do it out I'll keep it we don't have anything to do it out out Singapore out that's right he's won championship huh yeah dude I mean of course he is come on son just has that damn wife they're helping them oh yeah why wouldn't ya don't piss take my piss you take mine this stuff's perfect I'm eating whole foods going to yoga class yeah they're killing it sage is gonna fight again - he's gonna drop down to 55 so here he is get ready oh yeah dude I mean he's thick and he doesn't have to cut weight so that's where it gets interesting because you know you got to realize that Vitor has been fighting in the UFC at 185 pounds for you know all the big fights right to fight with Anderson that he lost and then the Anderson fight you know he was a little smooth in that fight it didn't look like the Vitor that fought Rockhold or the Vitor that fought Michael Bisping or Henderson that was the thick Vitor so we're dealing with a different animal what poor souls gonna fight feet tall in the juice hey man I mean isn't enough at this age you know is it enough you know I mean they've got some straight-up murderers over in one Fc they do they do that fucking guy who knocked out Eddie Alvarez what's his name sorry You c'n sorry you kin how about the guy who beat Brandon Vera man like they have said his name Oh nasty you kin that's his name I think it's Timothy nasty you can this fucking Russian Savage there's a mouse been to walk over there yeah but also UFC you know not throw been asking on the bus but yes he went one championship that's your best come on over yeah but I think I think they did at the I I think it paid off for the UFC cuz you wouldn't have Mazal dolls superstardom without what happens Ben Askren yeah I think Ben you know it worked for both one gym ship in UFC it worked out if yeah for sure it worked for Ben too because he made a lot of money one percent one Fc but I think if Ben had left Bellator and concentrate to the UFC things that have been very interesting very hard the paint for Ben hmm starched against arts is a tough start standing strangled hey it's a tough world out there and you know we found out also that he needs a fucking hip replacement yeah he does I'm connecting him with doctor Riordan oh good I love Panama I love Ben but also you know people dog you know stuff like T what about what about the guy who was retired had everything going for him where he's living as the wrestling camp was like yeah all right I'll fight the best the best in UFC like dude right away just for him to do that you have tipped your hat to the guy it's fucking insane and super nice guy very smart guy too really well all the shit talk that's all an act it's Ben's a great dude smart smart guy wasn't the best idea to do that to Mon spit although what'd you say talking shit to Maz of it all when I well heat but that's that's his game that's cuz you're not gonna tune into just a pure wrestler ya do but there's some guys oh my so I was like what dude how about Maz Badal I'm sorry how about been askin verse Demian Maia the strike and I was like what the fuck is happening right now ya know to the ground you to right now yet what is this I'd rather watch Logan Paul ksi why is this happening well you got to remember Demian Maia beat monster at all that one of the last fights that moms were all lost was but decision Maya know he I thought he'd be like no don't beat Damon mind I don't think Amon had his back remember and they restarted and I think Demian Maia won that decision I'm pretty sure Jamie lost a wonderboy Thompson and I think he lost a deli meat Demian Maia did he you're right think yes no no no no Moz Badal no no Marc yeah Mazal doll Demian Maia try to beat him remember I thought my wife my wanted decision yeah he gave me my one yeah shut up to your brain and I remember he lost a really close one to wonder boy close but what's interesting about the the Mosel all Demian Maia fight is Ram I had his back and couldn't submit him true which is insane well you know where mine got fucked more than any other time in his entire career is when he had Camaro loose montz bars ridiculous oh so ugly this day to that this day I'll be driving to my fucking car Hori Maz would also day me my loss burns like a fucking STD sometimes I'll be driving no bullshit I'll be driving down the road and I think it Demian Maia having Camaro loose months back and the referee stepping in I go like this fuck just drive instead of knowing if someone saw me driving they would think that I have some personal thing I'm dealing with your money or some person I'm just driving on the road thinking about that ref Bowen Demian Maia off Austin's back and I just go fuck that was insane it was so Dom insane it's like yeah he got to the spot that's the spot next thing you know who knows what happened always at the spot but it's his spot it's his he's the best in the world on your back the best and it's early we're in the first round he's not even slippery yet you called the the Demian Maia ask him fight to a tee I knew that was text before like no no damn man's gonna strangle Jamie and Maya's world class on the ground and Ben eventually wants to go to the ground what do you want to do I have a kickboxing fight there's gonna be moments where he wants to go to the ground okay now if you look at what and this is obviously different cuz it's just MMA I mean it's just grappling not MMA but he rolled with marcelo garcia and if you watch marcelo garcia strangle Ben Askren over and over and over again you realize there's levels to everything if they were just in a wrestling match yeah been asked and probably beat him but this is not a wrestling match this is MMA with strangles and Damien mines gonna get his back that's what I was thinking I was like he's gonna get his back but also it is pretty similar to straight jiu-jitsu because Ben or Damien aren't really not in ours there's literally vying for position to grapple so Ben's gonna entertain the grappling with Damien miles he's gonna slip up he's gonna slip up and that's what I felt like he wasn't gonna be able to as Hickson Gracie would say couldn't keep the rhythm dude hop the transitions we're here are you the foaming at the my could not get nothing when they were stay on my YouTube fucking drop-down right now yeah stop it god damn it the only thing that made sense to me is maybe Damon Meyer thought that Ben aspirins chin would be soft because he was so brutally kod just four months ago maybe because that has happened to go yeah right you remember when Travis looter cleared he fucking knock out cold with one punch that same due to Vitor Belfort cut a giant hole above his head he was a super jacked really powerful black dude god damn it I can't remember his name pull up Travis looter naughty Sven Marvin Eastman exactly Marvin Eastman fought Travis Lutter and Travis looter caught Marvin Eastman with a punch at the very end of the punch it was one of the weirder knockouts that you'll ever see go back right here right here right watch this oh very end of the punch very end of the punch it was strange but Marvin Eastman had been kayoed the word was you got killed twice in camp with Tito oh you got hit with an e during like takedown defense got K out and get hit with something else that was the word I don't know if that's true if it's wrong forgive me but it's not the Travis looter couldn't punch he certainly could but that one didn't make sense no not like he touched him and he just went out so sometimes guys who've been Kayode recently you know it is they just can't it just doesn't work anymore you know and I would maybe I think Damien ma maybe thought that Ben Askren took couldn't take a shot that's scary that happened in the training camp because they're like fuck any other fights like two or three weeks away you know you're not gonna be healed so you go into the fight knowing you're vulnerable what happened before I fought Rothwell he end up knocking me out but before that two week a week before my last sparring session Shane Carwin knocked mean literally cold it's like a we're a week away and then you coach like Gabby all right man you shake it off but in hindsight like why would you guys let me fight dude why would you let me fight that well also why Shane Carwin trying to knock you out so hard that dude hit so hard he's a guy who didn't get his day in the Sun either you know he had that loss to Lesnar we came out fuck Lesnar up in that first round but then he just gassed out he just lost all his juice he was so so he put up so much energy trying to stop Lesnar so much much so much he just fucking coulda stopped that fight too easily gonna stop that fight and not to hurt Dean and they were both champions he was the interim champion Frank yeah yeah you crushed Frank Mir with a ruthless series of uppercuts remember he held him with one arm and Spartan with the others corner fuck dude fuck dude that was terrifying that was what Shane Carwin was he was at his peak he was starching Peter in there before that he starched gay broken zone one punch after he had a broken nose Gonzaga broke his nose fucked his nose up yep Shane pop down with Shane hit it was four six inch right hand cool story like this bike show your lights out and then how about Gonzaga and Bigfoot Silva fought bare knuckle that's how they're doing sir they found a bare knuckle and Gonzaga piece big Silva you know it's hard to watch big Bigfoot Silva was a guy that when they made him get off the test remember that that was the rudest thing ever because they also don't fight if you have to have that stuff the money he needed the money no I'm saying like if you like you remember him on trt your he was such a nightmare he was crushed fatal a huge dude crushed phaidor remember that fatal went for ankle economy just isn't and faders like hugging on his big toe and he's going like this yeah I'm like you fucked up fader I fucked up you let a guy get on anything you literally fight a giant yeah also the nicest guy in the world super nice guy but how about I was training with him and I had a real reason to take test when you take him off of it he had an operation on his pituitary gland he had a tumor yeah hit a tumor that was stopped mean he was literally producing too much growth hormone that's that's why you become a giant like that so then he has this tumor removed and now his body's not producing anything right so he has to take stuff but they say he can't take stuff so he's just sick all the merits fight against Mark Hunt when he was on TRT and they just went back info that's like the girls heavyweight fight of all time afterwards that's a nice shot yeah he doesn't dude how about a train with big foot to get ready for Big Nog and I didn't know they were like best friends and I'm training with him this guy's great next day I'm like where the fuck is Bigfoot I see a picture of him on Instagram with Big Nog oh boy so he went to test you out I just think he came in and was like he was the same guy no he was training there and I don't think it was any like bad intention I think he was like alright yeah if you want to train go ahead do it top of phaidor when he mounted fader i was like holy fuck that picture of jude a giant on top of this kind of fat russian dude he was a he was a building he was like a building planted on his chest like you're not shaking that off DC 300 pounds vert and DC fought him and I go dude you fucked him up because how can you miss how can you miss he goes that's easiest fight in the world how do you miss I still have one shoot they both land his head with this smile and when you catch a guy to like where you catch him in his career and all in like what kind of testing are we talking about that's the reality of like a meme MMA pre you sada is all when you catch them in what kind of testing yeah what speaking of testing how about your boy over in fight Saturday don't dump don't fight another fucking rose and strike is it's troit or stroke strike strike yeah he's a banshee yeah he's a beast he Kayode under life I'm sure laughs key with the left hook fade away left hook and his last fight one punch serious power really nice guy - is he nice real nice I can't weasel in DC but a cool name jar Zeno Jardine Rosen stroke God look at him I would have to go - John - John annek to see if I'm saying it right but I'm pretty sure it's roses droid Rukh Rosen strike six for 240 very nice he's one of those guys will you look at the other doing a leg reach thing now he's one of those guys when you get a guy who's you know I think he's nine I know that what it says now you know yeah I mean you don't know yes - we don't know but this is a good tail ratio 88% and he's a legit 260 plus you know he's a legit giant you're fucking crazy if you don't think Rosen stroke and Francis are gonna face off who what I want to see honestly I want to see Francis fight in boxing I really do how dare you I really do I really do against a guy like Wilder well not right away I don't think that would be smart no I think you should have a few boxing fights but I think Francis could put people on the moon that's a fact you get some dude is not gonna take him down they're just gonna stand in front of him it's people 280 plus pounds right now yeah Fred's been lifting muscle dude he's such a specimen he's such a freak and I mean he's got a story that is literally right out of a movie he was a child working in the fucking sand mines digging sand that is score that is shoulders that is legs that is back that kind of strength training as a young person doing that every day that farmer strength shit that's for real man for real you go against a farmer you know it's up this exam shows guys but sand shoveling strength my top farmer strength because farmers aren't always doing that sand all day long like diamonds and a guy can take it to men I love take shots here's what they threw out francis ii is obviously got his loss right lost a steep bay and then the derrick louis whatever that fight was whatever i want to race yeah but so he loses the steep a he gets catapulted into the limelight he's pretty cocky thinks he's gonna start steep bay but then he learns from his losses and you look where he's at now like oh shit this guy's gonna be champion yeah similar thing happened air until man I went to see I saw the Junior dos Santos fight in a pool hall I was with some guys and we were we were playing pool when we stopped and I said this one won't last oh yeah listen this is not gonna last Junior is a great fighter but he's just his style is the wrong style to stand in front of that fucking guy he also has some Brazilian miles on them yeah there's a he's a shell of what he used to be in the spirit so in the Francis is just on this tier right now but it's up there sometimes you know there's losses that happen for guys were you like oh man like they needed those huge bumps and they're in their career where it's gonna make them it's gonna pay off in the end I think it's happening with Francis has happened with Darren till now as well I don't know if Francis can immediately beat top level boxers but I know that if they put him against some guy who's like journeyman who's gonna stand up he'll start to March guys and he'll start a bunch of those guys once those guys people will get super excited be talking about it I agree if they want to do that but you're talking about a different animal if you were to go in there like the wild or a fury which is almost ridiculous to say but that's where rat cos Connor Dickens Floyd but you know or even Mozgov all talking about oh I want to fight Canelo and the F canal can I go with the fucking wait time oh but so but yeah I think with Francis it if you put them in there with a guy like Wilder or fury they've seen big punchers but he's not gonna touch him there's just a different level but I you might be if he's also older so I don't know Fury is a perfect example of a guy that's extremely hard to hit he's so light on his feet he pops that jab he's so well schooled one of the things that I saw when I watched the fight again was like um how well he was slipping punch masterclass in box good by far the most skilled heavyweight we've seen on how long and 6:9 insane so tall it just pops that jazzy slices he worked with till yes yes till was like fuck dude like and he's like I want a real workout give me what you guys would do until said he was holding mitts and like holy fuck of course man and now imagine him with four ounce gloves lighting your chin up he's just too fast but it's whether or not he would ever be able to stop like steep a takedown or dc's takedown or any real heavyweight wrestler dancers no no it was smash I don't know why everyone wants to cross-pollinate you stay there I think the guy who can have the most success is Francis cuz I really think that Francis before he gets to the Elite levels he's gonna starch a lot of people I don't know if he could punch as hard as Wilder I don't know cuz Wilders punch is crazy insane but so is Francis if Francis hits anyone with that left hook I don't give a fuck if he's wearing one of those cartoon gloves that you get they weigh five pounds you know those ones you got exactly Tommy but here's the thing you know who ate his punches steeping he did but steep ain't moved away and use his wrestling he still see big I fucking rock you go by so much that by ah fuckin steep a do this it he were act all them amazing but what how much different with that fight be if it was just a boxing match that's trouble if there was no takedowns at all and he could settle in you didn't hug him out nope maybe who knows maybe steepy with a far different fight what do you think steep ADC the rematch is that definitely gonna happen they confirmed that I think steep a my fucking crazy deep buddy's got an injury that he's dealing with that uh I think a Mike fucking crazies that had confirm about their children I don't know let's go I don't think it's confirmed I think they're both agreed to it but it hasn't been confirmed it hasn't been signed dude wait till John goes hold my fucking beer and coming up the heavy way I've seen what that man does the heavy weights in training well you know the Johnnie Walker thing was what was really interesting right it was really interesting to see if Johnny Walker could make a big splash but then people forgot oh goddamn good Corey Anderson is they forgot that MMA guys don't talk about your hype financing into the cage you knock a lot of guys out they don't give a fuck how good are you right now and do you have a solution to what Corey Anderson brings to the table beats me he's a beast he's a beast he's got an incredible work ethic he doesn't get fucking tired and he gets better with every fight and people forget if you're getting gets better but you got to watch the Olear Latifi fight yep shut that guy down stops Johnny Walker he's beating top level guys man how about with TV's heavyweight now I know and that crazy steep a Miocic wants Tyson Fury super fight more than Daniel Cormier trilogy of course he does it's like huge paid fucking billion dollars it also made that mad a little bit because DC main wait for his rematch so I'll make him wait too then oh wow he's probably talking shitty time both you fight to your nuts hanging on here is just fucking that make it happen I don't know if that fight happens again I don't know we'll talk I'll tell you what I know yeah please do yeah it's just a matter of time before John goes I I'm ready to go and just fucks everybody up well DC John heavyweight dear God make it happen oh my god what do you think about John versus Francis though every fight start standing up man yeah that's terrifying can John get in there fast enough dude he's cutting weight to make 265 understand that oh I'm he said weight cutting weight he's putting people on another dimension my only thing is just gonna power punch it a hundred percent however he ain't seen nothing like that guy know nothing when that guy kicks his leg that guy comes storming in like a bat out of hell throwing punches that each one of them has concussion written all over it each one of them anything lands on anybody and you're a 2:05 er I mean the best 2:05 of all time no doubt but if we saw John get left hooked like the way we saw Gregor Gillespie get head kicked and just flatlined Thompson sent shout-out to me I know and I was thinking that was a really tough fight for Kevin ball for I was like well Kevin do this Kevin look phenomenal well listen man the training with Frost hobby and making that move getting a real camp real sparring partner gameplan and a real real maestro to use like a master or you have to have it today you have to have it today if you can compete against the best and for us is just one of the best ever I told them that I've I'm like that's the guy who trained the guy who you fight like the most go there be that guy yeah be there do that yeah move your ass - Cole last Montrell yeah no black people do that speak French speak French they rap in French have you ever heard French rapping oh yeah that's all adorable GSP plays it in his car well this is terrible could you please switch the station GSP still training still training still in tip-top Magoo who's looking for a big fight yeah he said look I'm here boys what do you want to do he wants the khabib 1.65 bro him and khabib at 165 would be gang busters insane and he can make 165 he thinks he can make 55 aw Jesus Christ when teach you know like I don't know what TJ was doing before he was doing this cuz yeah busted yeah because you know they don't test for appeal every fight they don't no they don't yeah why Cody Cody gar Brandt said that he was he'd been on it before he Cody and him we're friends I don't know if that's true but I do know that when you look at the way he looked when he was training for that hundred 25 pound fighter he looked like he was a dead man walking I couldn't imagine that he had any any energy train I can't imagine it I almost understand why he would take something I almost understand exactly I said don't accept if Cody's telling the truth if Cody's done it before started before the - well you know Team Alpha has their issues with TJ and they've assumed he was on it before I don't know who to believe is that the case though or was he friends with Cody and Cody new I don't know I don't know I don't know either way again props to you sada cuz they're catching people doing shit like that look he should have never gone to 125 yeah I mean that guy that he's training him that guy who's that master strength conditioning coach to put together this diet drop down 125 pounds that's all good on paper okay that's all good on paper and I know he's trained a bunch of like really top level yeah 100% that's a ridiculous idea that's too much weight it's too much weight there's that also Joe's a a Lowe's team who's like no he gonna make 135 and like he looks like he's lost a lot of weight dying at 45 but he looks like he lost a lot of weight have you seen the recent pictures of him nope don't need to because here's the thing they're like oh you were you know yet kind of pieced up at 45 and you're older dude let's kind of shit-ton and wait and see how that goes but here's the thing why not 55 I hear what you're saying but I don't think he's actually cutting weight I think what he's done is lose weight lose weight like trying to do it going slowly because he's way out from a fight right he's already fighting uh December 15 Marlin mirai's is that what it is yeah that's fairly soon dude that's a good fight who's the only I'm presenting crime nothing brother dude before I got a hold of him he living a world beater like he was gonna beat the world who the broke bro come bro hood that fucking will on him son put that will on him so here's the question is Marlon mirai's in a similar situation where he just can't maintain a pace after cutting that much weight cuz my rise cuts a fuckload of weight there it is germane demand to me Peter Yan urea Amanda Nunez and render me is uh that's a fight that people are not talking about enough their enemy is good she's gonna super technical heroine she refused to fight cyber yeah us give up the belt nice nice now you can kiss this ass this is Dutch ass interested dude Volken off skeevers max always a good fucking fight you ever see Vulcan oski when he's 240 past fantastic rugby player is five flexes in 240 he's from Izzy same can't yes he's an animal yep and Max look away max how a consensus greatest featherweight of all time yeah of all time he's the best beat the shit out of Aldo twice life beat the shit out of ortega well that's not the main event no keep going one more John job Oh tomorrow Oman and Kobe Covington no John Jones is uh the what is that which one is he Jerry is that the other Vegas one hopes just right it's February that's right Houston oh come on Monaco be coming to give me that again let me see that again let's go back to Greece Monaco be covered in good luck calling that was there I don't know both both their styles are very similar the only difference on that you can really see neither guys ever been taken down in a fight ever but I would give the finishing power to kymaro's man I would as well he has some power here some power how about Colby with Robbie Lawler oh yeah just out struck um yeah yeah insane well not only that puts a pace on that you just can't handle you can't handle it but if anybody can handle it it's that guy cuz think about it when did Woodley yeah takedown defense a hundred percent Camaro loose man a hundred how the fuck is go be 78 who took him down no one took him down maybe his first fight didn't get submitted he had a broken rib took a fight early in his career injured I think to get into the UFC really and losses get submitted I want to say it was his first fight go to Colby Covington's first fight in the Octagon that's what they're gonna do Woodley Leon Edwards oh just hit me that's a tough fight tough fight fight guys good fight very good fight what doesn't get team who in first fight in the UFC no he was I made him eight in one who are you talking about in the UFC eight and one in the UFC how many fights in was it really who did it yeah really Albus that's right that was the fight that he got injured Worley Alvez was a beast yeah he's kind of fallen off but he was on he was a beast but did I'm assuming Colby shot and while Kobe went into that fight with a fucked-up rib I know that for a fact but did he shoot and get guillotine make sense I don't remember how the fuck do you think now he was expelled he was hurt I know for sure and then who did he fight after that because let me tell you the fight that made him put on this act shall Pub is his record it was quick enough in his first round Oh was yeah well he was fucked up I know for sure he was fucked up coming to that fight that was a fight didn't want to take coz him in jail are close and she was like you need come up with a stick dude do you think so hundred percent okay let me see make that a little bigger for my shitty eyes um I'll scroll up okay there it is it was I think it was when he was was it when he was fighting demon my they started talking shit where's that saw Paulo yep that's exactly that's exactly so he's fighting Damian Playa filthy animals yeah he called them filthy animals calling so apparently what was going on before then was he was not making enough noise there was no one gave a fuck about him and you know they're in the middle of contract negotiations and I think they were threatening to cut him so he says all kinds of crazy shit about Demian Maia and people pay attention they go okay okay how about this we'll give you another Brazilian so they give him hot failed dos Anjos he beats the fuck at a hospital sign just and they're like holy shit wait a minute here wait a minute so in doing that he wins the interim title and then there was a bunch of shenanigans they wanted him to fight in Madison Square Garden he said look I can't fight back to back that quickly these are a hard-ass camp so they stripped them a lot of shit going a lot of shit so then they bring back against Robbie Lawler big comeback fight Robbie Lawler is a murderer right yeah big fight on ESPN and he just runs him over man runs him over like Robbie never got air he never got air I hope we just stayed on him stayed on me look at his record right that last six all five lasts five all decisions so it's like if you're like any guy all this get you don't finish but what he's doing it guys like Damien Mayan dos Anjos and Robbie law was so fun to watch he's breaking dudes he's this is crazy October of 2017 so it's basically two years old this act and I can't rewrite old I can way for him to drop it I can't wait for him to drop it once it becomes a champ and tell all there's no need you know why he didn't keep it going cuz he has he wants to go to wo ye yeah it's this thing cuz smart not man I won't go w if he becomes a champ and then goes to WWE and they put them on all the steroids why not and then get them up to about 240 keep the Hat keep going WB make bank shake it yeah tell him I'm gonna show you you push these how to really find fantastis Lesnar's a heel dude you'll see that you'll see that Lesnar fight a little dude the other day well fucking crazy that's what he wants to do hey why not man can make money you know at a certain point time you gotta go you know he accomplished a lot he's accomplished a lot sent if he decides if he beats Usman he's a coming in a parlous and how am I gonna keep this guy cuz everybody knows fighting you know it's a finite window like he gonna do next and nobody knows what his body's like right now as far as injuries and how many guys do you know that are in camp that have one fucked-up knee or a weird shoulder or the neck keeps fucking one especially for his skill set that motor and that grind like he's a grinder so you gotta have it all man I would like to watch his strength and conditioning workout cuz it must be fucking insane it must be insane cuz even Jorge Maz and all off record on stalking him I go what do you think about Kobe as we've trained together he goes I've never seen a motor like that ever in my life he's a mother he can go man he can go he can go he put it on Robbie Lara like I never seen anybody put it on crazy to pace the pace was just it's insane he just never gave him any air just kept on I'm bang bang bang and I go I go what do you use I go you go on 50 60 % he goes yeah oh yeah just volume just never never thrown full blast to staying on you very Nate Nick deals this guy started that long it started it Nick started if you go back to watch his fight with Frank Shamrock he just never gave Frank Shamrock any breaks he's exploding by staying volume until he gets you hurt then he starts ripping to the body taking to the body and he starts letting you know I'm not even a little tired bitch and you're exhausted he starts putting it on you oh it's on in to the Nate Diaz thing I think you know Connor goes I want to fight three times in 2020 I think he goes if I ever got a crystal ball and the scrooge mcduck of the UFC I think he goes cowboy Maz with all and ends it with ideas money money money money money money why not write to that because I think Tony and Kabir Bergen tie up 1:55 for a while I think those boys can be it's back and forth just sit I think it's gonna be a great trilogy for the divisions week I'm so excited about that fight that's that's my way that's my number one fight of the year number one fight don't get fuck about anything else about a lot of else I give my knee but everything else but I need that fight support but it's in April it's in Brooklyn there might not even happen just rap you just I'm I'm saying that because there's no way I could predict that this fight would get cancelled so I'm saying that - to me it's the fifth actually I know see you know it'd be great if the UFC just doesn't tell us and then the week before they go Ferguson could be this Saturday like oh fuck yeah I'm using reverse psychology to move sometimes we jinx fights dude I'm serious about Francis and Ghana though I think he could be a real heavyweight contender in boxing I agree that's the one thing I'm not fucking around about I want anybody to get it twisted I really think that guy he's how fucking hard and he's so good at fighting now and he's so good at fighting high level you know he's been fighting in the UFC against high-level guys for a while I know it's different but I don't think there's that much of an adjustment when you think about his primary skill set and the division he's talking about you don't think he could start some of those like top 15 guys hey kid fuck some of those dudes up I don't know your goddamn mind if you think you hang with Wilder Fury I'm not saying right away I'm not saying right away I think those an experience under your belt you got to see some fireworks how many pro boxing fights is even have not many company think about having wild or have any I don't even know I don't think so Connor had zero and you fought the best ever how'd that go that great dinner although he did plan some functions like an uppercut told you beautiful left uppercut francis lands that on wild or fury it's game over it's interesting maybe not you know maybe the power take it maybe they can maybe he can you know hurt them maybe they can roll with it a little bit better Wilder takes it dude that's the thing about Wilder he takes it he's got a tremendous change so does Josh actually it's a 2-man Joshua will get hit he's been wobbled before the Dillion white fight he's been he's been wobbled man welcome clock by Klitschko so that's why I think against Wilder man he because there's no Wilder Lance it's game set match it's over what do you what did you think about Canelo fighting Sergey Kovalev how crazy was that he flatlines Sergey Kovalev at 175 pounds oh goodness Canelo he's a meze pound for pound number one whose resume everyone goes ooh Budd who I love but Crawford shot the bud bud and Earl Spence everyone goes that's pound and water dude look at who Canelo's has beat men in different divisions your time out fucking marquise guys and he stopping them in the triple G fights obviously there's some countries there but he fights real country for the first ones very controversial second one not so much what's up I delayed his fight yes they did he's mad at that he said no more because apparently people were tired man especially like East Coast did you watch it I was out yeah I watched it it was insane yeah they delayed if you ever four hours turned that they show him in the back sitting there like what the waiting for the end of the UFC fight into zone there's just like how about the zone there that how about the zone play do you have seen in the arena look at this laughs lay off who wrote that who wrote that tweet Oh impersonator Ryan was a say let me shot him out it says assume defense Imperator Ryan the to defend Twitter it says L LM a Okinawan kovalev are napping because they got a weight on the UFC it's ridiculous like show a little pride to zone Dana loved it loved it he was so happy as a UFC guy was also like he was so yeah bitch like what this is who's King you got can you imagine you imagine Dana bowing down to the going listen Floyds fighting we're not gonna we're gonna wait for the main up the USC doesn't give a fuck what you got going on how was Nate Diaz versus Maz would always a special fight to and the thing about making it for the bad motherfucker belt almost like everybody was like yes everyone why not you know and now um isn't you'll wanna jung-jae check gonna fight Jean wheeling isn't she fighting her for the belt oh dude they didn't give her that fight you want to say she wants to fight for the female bet BMF bout no damn mushishi fight Jessica and Raj and a rematch just for 2:48 official Dan's a fucking card so that's the one they think might be out of sonya and Yoel Romero so Dan said he didn't want that fight though Thurmond location Dana said yeah Dana said he didn't want that fight because yo L lost is Alaska I thought he said he did want it no Dana said he personally Dana didn't think that was a good fight for Yoel but think about what else is that what's a great fight for you i think it's i mean for Sonya I think it's a fight for the division but who else you gonna do you look at the division there's no one else well one of the things that moms Badal who's friends with yo L said I respect the fuck out of Otto Sonya cuz he asked for that beast he said the ass for him and that was my point with Andrew Schultz and like no you don't understand to build the legend of Izzy him asking for yo L everybody in the game respects that you want to fight that fuck in the monster even dare until Darren till said anybody but you well yes joking around a fight yeah I think they're gonna do dare until Whitaker men hmm that's a great fucking place well they talked about doing that on the undercard of Adesanya you all Romero yes was that no no no no it was the undercard of that was the undercard of another fight um fuck What did he say he reached out to some O'Connor and cowboy that's who it was he wanted to be on the undercard of Colorado too soon not happening I don't know I don't think Witter could be ready to go by then after again I what is it what's the date on that January January warren december dude right but it's six weeks danto breaks out his red panties invites robert whittaker to UFC 246 co-main event yeah so that's six weeks the only thing is robert whittaker got starch yeah just a couple of months so you get a 120 days suspension Ryan well I don't know if you actually can make that medically no that's why I'm saying it's it's not gonna happen it's too soon also I think a fight like that where you know a guy like a lasagna just sort of starches you like that that requires a reset take your time dude yeah I love what I do too but maybe not I mean maybe he knows better than us I don't know nope nope how do you think so I don't think so I'm outside looking in I don't dude take your time I don't think he does take your time but I would like to see that fight too so maybe they can make that happen on you know that March card yeah or maybe yeah maybe sometime in the future me there was a great April card as well right April the UFC in Brooklyn with Tony and khabib maybe could be on the undercard of that'll be great that's great fight like yeah that's great fine it's a good time to be a fight fan man it's a good time in hell yeah yeah I get home my son did ya teef at kake.com when we got next to me boy see Friday and
