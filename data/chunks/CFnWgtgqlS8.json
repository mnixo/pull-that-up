the gyro can experience either way the the important thing is that like seeing those those images on those shows they're repeating over and over and over again they have all these like graphic images of bodies and pulling things out of bodies and it's like it's pretty intense that you're taking that stuff into your psyche you're taking that stuff into your your bank of experiences I don't like sexual stuff on television airily you believe that it you mean like his girls making out early no I let's say I'm watching die answering that like a condom commercials my mind a condom commercial will bother you oh it's these little kids on really destroyed tampon commercial I want to choke myself and my wife is in the room I like your aunt's in the room with some older woman since I was a kid they're gonna coach axe commercial I would sit down and look for it straight ahead dog I never get so embarrassed in my life I don't want them to ask me if I know and I don't want to fucking know your blood comes out your snatch away and what you pull up there that's got nothing to do with me I'm just a little stray that don't even bring it up you know there's some women that's cute yeah like they think it's cute like cuz I gotta go we got a tampon listen I don't want to know yeah I want love you bleed you ruined everything for me yeah I don't want to know that's not really bother him I that bothers me the sight of blood I come no no no he decided talking about that you're fucking pussies bleeding around me that's what I fucking ate well even when they have in that purse I get sick to my fucking stomach others I don't want to see a fucking tampon around I don't want to fucking see a tampon at all all right when I'm watching TV and a tampon commercial comes out even when I'm by myself I feel creepy that's so weird and can't condom commercials that new commercial with the chicks head popping out or the fucking thing with that you put on your finger have you seen that fucking commercial to check with the creepy finger you should try this is great to relieve stress you know what men I don't want to know about that shit playa after what the fuck is that oh my god zombie oh my god is that was our money pussy to put that away oh my god that's broken that one's broken that is just that okay let me don't even get that one fixed so this day anything bad raise anything vaginal and television like ten o'clock drives me up a fucking wall now I'm in the reason I noticed and I want to do a shameless plug my buddy Ben Wallace has this great book the billionaire's vinegar and it's about the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold but like what is good wine do we know good wine when we taste yes it's fascinating well if you get really old shit the most likely it's not good well the problem is as his book explains is the problem is no one this is a bottle the most immense bottle I never sold want to be in fraudulent but it was purported to be owned by Thomas Jefferson ok so for like steve forbes on it for a while and all these different guys on this bottle wine one of the koch brothers i wanted for a while and in the end there's no one around who can go I've had a lot of wine from that year right and that's right on the money isn't it crazy though that these different rich guys had the wine and sold it to each other like they passed it off you know you know warryn's did Forbes stored it in a they put it in a in their corporate headquarters they had in a box like a glass lit boxes decoration but they hadn't standing upright with a heat lamp in there or elounda tried that cork out and the court felt in the bottle so later when people are trying to analyze what was in it there can never rule out the intrusion of foreign substances which will not allow them to find out what it was the guy they eventually like is why the the guy who created the hoax would take really good wine and do weird stuff to it like he'd put a little bit of vanilla extract and air or he'd put some dirt from his gutter in there just weird things he could do to kind of throw people and then guys are like big swinging dicks about wine we're tasted like oh yeah so great I got it right it's a brilliant book now okay here's a serious question is there a guy that has ever existed that has a full suit of armor in his house that is a douche bag no well I mean comic book collector guys aren't really douche bags you know they'd like that shit you know like they have like what would they have like a real suit of armor than their house I've almost bought an armored helmet the other day saw helmets yeah how much too kind of dope yeah I almost bought one of those I could see it I would say yes case I would say the same could be said about those dime store Indians cigar story yeah or the black jockeys that you put on your lawn oh that's rude fuck how about people who have like little gremlins shit on there like Hummel elves you know what are the camels my stepmama has a case on her front porch today if it starts to rain she puts a raincoat on it and then if it's like Halloween she dresses up in a little costumes like this just big ceramic geese and then I was always make fun of it and then somebody who came broke it recently and she was so sad about it so now she has all these stupid geese outfits and she can't find another one of them so sick are you kidding me Oh ceramic geese what happened today it was the worst day in my life someone cracked my ceramic bird I had that one that I leave it makes me so happy I come home I see my ceramic duck I got him at the toronto world ferry 62 it's acts and they don't make him order that much anymore he's beautiful he defined my god i swear he used to look at me he was my friend i know that

night because I feel like I failed I mean he's gonna kill me in my sleep I should have protected I should have gotten a coat of armor it was my little Charlie I had a name for him Charlie the duck and now he's dead I had illustrated books i made about him over the years he's gonna come back and kill those punks that broke him that's fucking bugs imagine a Stephen King movie about a fucking evil
