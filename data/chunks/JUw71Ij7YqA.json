the girag an experience every fucking show I do people will yell out do you up to every Idol you not every show but fucking if people are yelling shit out that's of and that was I never even really did I I've talked about it on stage a few times but uh yeah I heard the audio you talked about the time were you and I did it where I thought you were gonna die but every fucking show like it was like my closing bit for here it was uh there was one of the weirdest psychedelic situations for the folks at home Doug and I were doing the man show and it was like in the death throes right well right yeah we were here we had to spend all night writing trying to save the fucking thing we knew it was a disaster we got fucked I mean look we we both appreciate the fact that everybody was disappointed by how that show came out but no one was more disappointed and we were the whole thing was a mess and we don't need to get into details but if you want you want to no no no it's yeah so it was terrible show but there was some great shit in it I I defy anybody to watch the my midget sketch you notice it another man's midget yeah is your beer sketch I defy anybody to watch that tell me that's not hilarious were you trying to steal the old midget from the man show and bring them over to the new head show with us I mean it was it was the wrong thing at the time because our show is not a the learning experience was priceless because that was my first real yes television and just knowing how they fuck it up we could have we could have done something on the Internet we could have done something like internet style where there was no input whatsoever and we could had a great fucking time right and when when they came to me with the idea the idea was we're gonna have nudity will blur it out immediately I'm thinking Joey Diaz gonna be naked the beginning of it's just it's just telling someone about that yeah and then then I said on what about swears and they said you could bleep it out bleep out talk about whatever you want they go it's a good thing if we get sued this is what stones telling you guys told me if we get sued it's a good thing yeah like we are gonna fuck shit up I'm like I just can't wait for abortion monologues and chaos and when we got in there was a totally different story as soon as we got in and the audience wouldn't have liked it any better no they would have still hated it but we wouldn't have had to fuck we would have had two bags their heads we had a rebuild and make a new audience you know there was one point in time when Jon Stewart didn't used to host the Daily Show right you know people forgot there was that other guy and really we shouldn't have called Adam and show we should have said we are really into the idea of taking over that time slot or that idea that doing this new told us to pounce and probably fuck ourselves we might you know yeah they were they were convinced that that name was gonna sell everything and I was going to be the big push and there's name brand I'm like it's it but it's not the same shoulder not the same guys and idea anymore none of the writers here with the fuck you talk you mean you were doing fear fear factor 14 hours a day that was a I got so greedy I was like I am guy who shows the same time and I just think it is stacking up that money I could never work again never working again I'm never working again if that was a dumb idea terrible idea should never do more than one television if you if you didn't have to work would you stop no not stop doing stand-up and maybe you know I like doing the UFC to man it said nothing I do right now is really work down between stand-up I mean I can I can regulate how many times a year I go out and the UFC I look forward to it's fun it's like that what am I going to do this weekend I could stay at home and I can go to the movies or I fight Indianapolis I watch some dudes beat the fuck out of each other from five feet away and I get paid for it I get to call it does never feels like right right Google might be Skynet yep whatever you know it's it's it's inevitable I mean everybody wants you again make me hard ladies and gentlemen sign that keeps falling for the folks that are on iTunes that don't get to see this when Doug when I were on the man show I know we complained but this is this is pure evidence yeah that was that was the best story made me hard we we had a game show that we created called make me hard and it was it was one of the best things we did when it actually turned out and the reason why I was one of the best things we ever did is uh because there's tranny cock and tranny cock yeah but we the the show was called make me hard and then when we actually made the show and when we we know talked to the Comedy Central people in everything they didn't like hard hard was too dangerous they wanted to be make me stiff and we're like what the fuck is the difference the most this was right it's an argument right before we're about to tape to the art department has to rush uh they allowed fucking full open tranny cock open tranny cock because we're gonna blur it out uh simulated fellatio on a banana by a midget this is what happened all the language this is this was the gig there was a kid they would strap him to a chair and they would put this harness actually I should back up because a lot of people probably don't remember make me laugh was a game show where people tried not to laugh while comics try to meet other guys would get in their face and say silly things so make me hard we set them up where they have this box on their package and we would decide when it lit up indicating they had an erection yeah so we had so they had to try to not get a boner during these sexual yeah so of course would go off midgets woody bananas it would go off and we had this really hot tranny she was so hot that Eddie Bravo and I were at the comedy store one night and we were coming down we had a park at the Hyatt the comedy store parking lot was full and we're coming down the ramp but she was coming up and he's going gosh damn that bitch is hot look this chick coming up right now well she's so pretty girl that's a dude I've seen his dick that's a lot yeah I'm like her name is vanity and she's totally believable if you ever think that you can't get tricked by a tranny there's no way I would know I wouldn't know you know you wouldn't care she she blew a dude we know and yeah just did it because Weiss yeah yeah once on the set and then once that and then she called him after she was at her hotel and he was back next day or something he's so hot we're calling a murder her name was vanity and you can find her like I think it's vanity TSE google i found it a show to people ago who would blame him so anyway the the guy is you know strapped to this table and she climbs all over him and he licked her tits right didn't I tell you I can't remember poor fucking guy we tortured this guy's memory forever so he's like everyone's going yeah here are your people cheering and then she pulls out this tranny dick that looks like like a poison monkey dick it look like it looks sick like it had been hit on so many female hormones it was like an old man in a wheelchair that's ridiculous and she pulled it out it was black it was black as a function always just just snow no it's done it's all done I mean it's just hanging over me it probably feels good when you suck it still you know even a soft dick feels good to be sucking right but I don't think nothing is unless she pops viagra maybe she'll hop Fagor and I'm still have a hard dick you're a fucking human being
