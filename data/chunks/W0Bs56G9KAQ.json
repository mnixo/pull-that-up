four three two one mr. Page how are you I never had a bad day of my life ever L I've had plenty of bad moments my moments but you recovered yeah you know to me it's all your state of mind period and I don't stay there if I go down I get back up if you're gonna chew that pump we're gonna go fucking crazy yeah listen man first of all I love what you're doing I really do I think it's fantastic and I'm a big fan of yoga and what you've done for not just what you've done is made yoga available to people that thought that yoga was for chicks right and I don't know if it's really funny you say that because how it started it was yoga for regular it was regular people you know regular guy yeah and for guy people think of yoga's being something that like you have to be into you know you got to be all namaste you here at Dallas time I paint what the fuck thank you how you know you're this giant pro-wrestler guy like you're into yoga and you're really really into it I mean you've got your own system of yoga I mean this is for for something that I think is like very important for body maintenance and for keeping your your spine healthy and mobility which is one of the things that a lot of us ignore especially big guys who like to lift weights or do a lot of crazy poison meathead gosh Dan John I'm the guy who wouldn't be caught dead doing yoga the first 42 years of my life but I didn't start wrestling I was 35 really really and my career take off thought was Ford how old you know 62 dude if you folks saw what he just did with no warm-up no warm-up bent over grab your ankles fully fully flattened your body out pressed your body up against your thighs with no warm-up then he picks his his ankle up and fully extends his leg over his head I mean that it that is incredibly impressive for a 20 year old person well it's all about staying ahead of it you know it's all about owning it going back to you know just my career I mean my career took off in 96 which was I was 40 years old 97 to 98 and I was on top of the world wrestling 270 days a year every year and then I did The Tonight Show Hollywood Squares a movie called the first daughter was my first movie I did so I mean I was probably working 320 days a year and the wear and tear on your body after a while like boom I took a power slam from Laura power bomb from Kevin Nash Kevin's legit 610 long way down and it wasn't that bump that blew my back out it was all of it and being almost 43 years old and when I ruptured my l4 and l5 we have this amazing vertebra that is what allows us to do all this crazy shit that we do but really allows us those shock absorbers those discs in between the vertebrae well think of a jelly doughnut and slap that jelly doughnut and now there's nothing there so I have no discs in between my l4 or l5 I was told by three different spine specialists you're never gonna wrestle again I just signed a multi-million dollar three-year deal so the guy wouldn't be caught dead doing yoga would do anything to get back in a ring and I was married at a time and she kind of bullied me into it and once I started doing it Joe just like you know I started feel different and I thought it's thinking wow now did you talk to any doctors that wanted to replace your discs or fuse your discs to one of the few someone didn't and his thigh was just $19.99 so there wasn't any of those spacers that they have now having attained ium discs didn't have any of that and his whole thing was if we do fuse you and you go back you will be crippled because you won't recover from that so again going to do yoga and I started doing Bryan Kest you're taking my Bryan class classes or no like no he's amazing we're gonna yoga's a Power Yoga he's the guy who some kind of put Power Yoga on the map and he made me feel like okay that dude's cool like and then today he's a buddy of mine you know but at a time I was just doing his VHS tapes but for what I wanted it wasn't giving me everything so what I did I've rehab both shoulder surgeries both knee surgeries and I'm kind of like God giving gifts of figuring out how to heal myself I'm the first guy in professional wrestling to ever Isis body by almost a decade eight years before they would start doing that you mean like ice baths like like ice your shoulders right your back inflammation take it down crap I just got that how'd you figure that out um you know just different reading on different you know people and how they healed themselves and what people were saying and what I found that a lot of people don't want to put the extra work in I can make it be the hardest workers ever but they won't go that extra mile just to go get a bag of ice put on your knees put an ace bandage around it you can go wherever you want well that's also like part of the culture of tough guys right they don't give a fuck race go get a beer and have some food you know there's a little bit of that right there's something about the same type of god that's so tough they could work 300 days a year it's also the same type of guy that's gonna go out fucking just deal with it and Steve means Austin when I broke in I was like 35 and a half he's 26 and Austin was always way ahead of the curve as far as talent but he wouldn't you know he wouldn't it was like what are you doing kid like cut those ice bags so back then we were drinking and beers not that it's right to do but back then we were and he would put the beers on like ice bags in between my my ace bandage just keep his beers cold true story story so you know the bottom line is I started to mix the rehabilitation techniques with the yoga positions then I threw an old school calisthenics like push-ups squats crunches and I did him with the slow burn movement because I had to and in the beginning I had to do them on my knees so when you say slow burn movement is what you were just showing me that's it before we started the podcast that time you do a lot of dynamic tension exercise exactly which is a lot of what Bruce Lee was into he's a key to a lot of that stuff go look at Bruce Lee did he ever have an ounce of fat on him that was shredded well that whole time under tension things something I call dynamic resistance I added that and like for the push-ups you know I would lower for three hold three inches off the ground for three and Sharonda come up for three lowered for three hold for three then I go into Cobra into down-dog and in the beginning I had to do him on my knees but then I built that strength to get off my knees and then three second push-ups became five I became ten ten became sets of ten if you go to my DDP yoga face book you'll see a video up there of me doing on my 62nd birthday well actually two days after ten ten-second push-ups at 62 so my core strength is at a different level I don't lift weights anymore I haven't really for 10 years because I really don't need it and I don't need to sighs I like being like 230 the bottom line is what today is called I'm branding at DDP why why because I want people to stop calling it just yoga cuz it's so different now you've done a lot of yoga yeah what do you do I just took you to in that minute and a half is that like anything you've ever done in a yoga studio no it's very different you're what you were saying your dynamic tension thing definitely adds another element to it and then I have fun with it man I got you I do shit like when you take you into a lunge and you throw your arms up I go superstar yeah you know I work when we're in a like a lunge that we're falling forward or to explode into touchdown mm-hm I'd say throw a little Ric Flair on the end of that is there you know just having people having fun I I did a big event it was this weekend it's called all in and it's Cody Rhodes who's the American Dream Dusty Rhodes son he's been in independent wrestling he was at the show WWE for ten years and bottom line is he went away they left there let's guaranteed money got to be like a half a million bucks left it and went to follow the dream because he knew he was a main event guy and him and his kids the young bucks they sold out this arena it was ten thousand four hundred twenty six people in 29 minutes and 36 seconds they counted the count the seconds well they did because it's a really big deal when you freely sell out when you're an independent group you're not WWE know that's insane it's insane how many different groups are there now there's NWA knows WWE right there's ROH there's the row as my buddy Booker T calls it down there in Houston and NWA's with Billy Collins Billy Corgan Owens right I'll tell you what the Smith that's that that's Cody was going for the NWA championship against Nick who was just one of the studs of our business and he had a hell of a match and Billy owns that title now think about this Vince McMahon just just I want to say he was paid 1.2 billion by Fox for the programming for a live show on Friday nights I'm not sure what the deal is at six years or eight years but 1.2 billion and then I heard there's another multi-billion dollar contract being out there Comcast or something so that's like NFL stuff so when that kind of attention comes to wrestling more people are gonna be like oh I want to get involved in that and Plus Vince really has taken it mainstream at a different level like back when we were killing it in the 90s I mean we had the highest rated show on cable television mother was WCW or WWF every week we were one two and three sometimes one two three and four top four shows but our dollars that we could get for the advertising was nothing like they're getting today because they made it kids friendly they changed that and it was brilliant buttons you know it really it changed format but today it's about to go through another boomin this whole independent thing that cody and these young bucks who were great kids did it really lit up that world and it's the same thing all over the country I mean I should say world Japan's really big right now and so is uh so is um UK and Mexico they're really really big one of the guys from the UFC Matthew riddle just got signed to the WWE he was yeah his story is kind it's kind of fucked up he got fired from the UFC for failing a pot test and the crazy thing it's so crazy left the guys mother oh it's even more crazy that you know now it's legal right now pots legal and now the numb the level that you can get tested for is so much lower than anything that he got but I think he enjoys it I don't think he's missing fighting you know fighting is uh I know that pro wrestling is probably harder on your body doing those 300 days a year I mean I don't think there's anything like it in all of entertainment I really don't I mean it's it's crazy to think that you're getting body slammed and thrown into the ropes and forearms slammed and all that shit's going on 300 days a year it's really really it's not fair it really should be a way well you could take some time off it doesn't make any sense when I was on Hollywood Squares one time someone said so what's your season when you walk you they knew nothing about wrestling I say it's hilarious when I'm hurt you know but you know the bottom line not hurt injured injured like blowing ligaments like yeah exactly you guys compete well you know you perform hurt on a regular base I mean it's sort of the guys in the NFL well so the guys in the UFC as well yeah absolutely I think with Matt riddle it's like he's got a great personality and you know it doesn't have to cut to wait anymore and now he's gigantic and he's a fun guy I think WWE's perfect for someone like him yeah I was down there I trained a lot of the guys down to neck it's called NXT next and that's uh these kids are unbelievable they're so talented but I bring my DD py program down to them and they're all on my ass are you starting that early with these guys so they then plus I'm like you know again I'm 62 they're 24 Brian 228 you know so they grew up watching me so it's much easier forgetting for me to get them to pay attention my all's I do is look at Chris Jericho who's one of the top stars in the world and he is not with WWE right now he you know he comes and goes and he was up that show all when he did a run in a surprise thing a blue the roof off he's gonna be 48 in November he wrestles like he's 28 he's been doing my program since he did the same thing I did when he blew his back out and three doctor said he was not gonna wrestle anymore five weeks later 85% pain-free three months later he headlined WrestleMania against Punk he talks about it all the time now how is your back today those those same discs if I don't do it it's kind of like brushing your teeth you know if you gotta brush your teeth and I don't have to do it every single day but he loves pretty much you know I thought when I wake up I like first ten minutes when I call it wake up man I feel I call it oil for the Tin Man and woman mm-hmm and the real proof of this for me cuz I'm the first transformation the bottom line is they said my career was over when I was 42 I started doing what now is called DDP why three months less than three months later Joey I was back in the ring at 42 they said my career's over 43 on the world champ and that's like getting our that's our Oscar you know what it means like you're the guy you deserve this when I give the most eyes on you you know I was I was in a match with Hogan flair and sting three arguably maybe he'll it in the top five biggest names ever and I walk out that world champion Ric Flair took the diamond cutter in the middle it was a Kogan - Hogan gave me such a hug afterwards like this is what this business is supposed to be there's someone like you who no one would believe would ever be anyone could work so hard that they would become the world champ when I got my Hall of Fame ring in 2017 inside I had inscribed in here work ethic equals dreams explanation point DDP and that's where this you know I don't tell you anything you understand putting the work in yeah putting the work in is everything know your back today did you ever get an MRI on it oh yeah I did all that well but now now you know I don't have any I don't like if I don't do it if I'm one too many planes trains and automobiles right you know then I'm gonna get released but I know what to do I can't say to my wife and I swear to God cuz every morning I do I roll out of bed some nights you feel like you're hit by a truck you know what I mean sleeping is the worst thing for me because I get in those positions that I'm in and when I wake up like oh yeah but as soon as I do within eight minutes I feel like a completely different person because it's a your disc though was completely gone no they're gone there was literally bone on bone it is it still like that yeah but I this is something I'm trying telling Joe which makes what I'm doing different than regular yoga not just that I would say most Yogi's are very namaste didi py way more TNA and I met today the beginning but what I mean today is tone and attitude because it's an attitude so you switched it up you kept the same letters yeah okay worked and it worked like that but uh you know it's just it it for me it's as you know this repetition is the mother of learning right where you do something the more you own it but on that clip I want to I want to show you something I brought with me because I've been waiting for your show to release this huh I've got a new book coming out and no one's seen this cover yet Oh is Tom here yeah premier Premier and I'm doing something I don't think anybody I've ever has I've really done this now this isn't the book itself this is just the cover oh yeah since the plastic tears last thing it's called yeah positively unstoppable the art of owning it oh I like it what is it it's whatever the fuck you want the paycheck that Diamond Dallas Page bitches Mick Foley wrote the the funniest most entertaining fool I want to get that guy on that guy's hilarious if that happened he's friends with my friend Tony Hinchcliffe who's a giant pro wrestling fan and it's given me so much grief because Tony's such a fan I've made fun of wrestling because Tony's a fan Tony is such a dork for it they do this podcast at the Comedy Store right they do what do they call it the for know-how what is it that's a four horsemen no no no they have a wrestling podcast that I was just on two weeks ago store horsemen the store horsemen the so these comics from the Comedy Store right rygg antic pro wrestling fans right and they do like simulcasts likes oh wow like if WrestleMania is going on oh right they'll do like they'll do a few like we do a thing for the UFC sometimes called a fight companion sure while the fights are going on we'll get a bunch of guys in here drink beers and they do that while wrestlemania is going on right right so it's uh you know don't that note cake to snake Roberts is gonna he just he's working a deal right now with Hooters and in in Vegas and they're talking about giving him a room and he will do like might be Monday Night Raw somebody contacted me about him as well someone from his organization contact me and you helped him yes and I saw something some sort of a program on television was detailing you helping him get clean and you getting him involved in yoga what you're doing is really fucking awesome because you're you're exposing something that I think should be it just just should be something that everybody does I just really think that all athletes all people I think Yoga is a life staple I really did know I do dude admit when I got through this I got through it wrestling I could have easily stepped into that yoga community and what the whole namaste route but that's not who I am right and I know that the yoga people like they get it they don't need me the people who need me is all those people that literally that have nobody run they don't have any direction did you see the disabled veteran that I helped no I did not I'm just amazed that you could do what you do with no discs everybody know that has had no discs is that like serious muscle atrophy and because they didn't stay didn't figure it out like I had to figure it what did you figure out though what did you do differently I love that shirt by the way oh no kills talent Yeah right the fucking great shirt look at that that's my buddy Josh you brought me in he's got a line called Beverly Hills that's a great shirt there's such a that's such a good point does it really like the point I mean I wore it because I knew you would love it and I love the shirt I wear all the time he's got a couple of them that are really cherished wouldn't someone get that if they wanted by the I think it's Beverly kills calm pretty sure so this is Arthur Borman this is disabled veteran this is what DDP yoga is or DDP y0o Jesus is there a link for this where Jamie could get a hold of it oh he could put it on the YouTube absolutely if you had a DDP yoga calm at the bottom of DDP yoga calm is the video of Arthur so let me show you this now show Jamie the image of him so he could look for it on your website if you go all the way to the bottom of DDP yoga comm it'll be sitting at the bottom and what was wrong with Arthur okay let me let me just take the back story this is crazy anyone who got my program all the live in years ago it was just workouts period it was three different levels and this this one first one was called fifty-plus it's kind of like what I'm doing today with I'm where I'm helping people who are really disabled and it's right there you want to watch it sure Hays let's watch it okay can we play this on youtube yeah start started from players start from the beginning this is awesome doctor told me never walk unassisted again it says so for the people just listening it says for 15 years doctors told me I would never walk unassisted again and we're seeing this gentleman with those crutches those cane things on his forearms I accepted this as fact I was a 47 year old disabled veteran and I had basically given up I was injured as a paratrooper in the Gulf War too many jumps took its toll I'm on his back oh man watch nice land and and my knees it says I gained weight we would just watched an image of it all this stuff is available online at DDP yoga comm right is that what is this video yes this has got Mazzilli ins and bazillions of use that's a good number says he couldn't walk or run exercise seemed impossible most yoga instructors turned me away this musics killing me all the one motherfucker says he didn't know me but he believed in me when no one else did how long is this video I feel like more minutes payoff is worth it I'll get him doing in here so you should a chance yeah that's rolled onto for balance well to get up get down bike says I fell many times yeah but I got back up it's all about getting back up yeah this is very impressive just watching him do what he's doing here this guy's got heart you know it's the attitude to do something even though it's difficult and in pain is so damn important it is so important people have to force themselves to do something in this guy is one of the best examples of that you're ever gonna see I mean who who had a better excuse to give up than this guy Wow look at all this weight he's lost this is crazy he's a teacher in Baltimore he's lost a shitload away it looks like he's lost like eight inches off of his belly at least says I started believed that it could happen so in this this progress thing you're seeing him trying to walk without his canes and falling down flat on his face yeah starting to build his core strength this is crazy he's just ready to do handstands now oh my god crap china cabinet I love it it's gonna kill the cat get out of there cat you just said just cuz I can't do today doesn't mean I won't be able to do it someday yeah look at him here man full push-ups Wow walk in with one cane now that's incredible what a difference in his posture and everything look how much weight he's lost and how often was he doing it every day every day every times twice a day so remember the pictures I showed you right check this I couldn't stand on two legs now he's standing on one and holding his foot up in the air that is insane look how slim holy shit he lost a hundred pounds in his six months and he's holding that cat that cats gonna die I told that cat get out holy shit he's running that is insane he's not just walking he's running sprinting holy shit that is incredible that really is incredible Wow look how fucking slim he is that is really amazing man what is the name of this has never give up what are name of this video so people can finally never give up if you go to DDP yoga com it's right at the bottom look at the difference in him he looks like he's 10 years younger well it's lost a hundred and forty pounds in 10 months hold wait wait wait wait wait wait wow that's crazy Danny on his head that is crazy so that is crazy that's so amazing man I'm gonna show you a picture that no one's seen this I'm saving this for a TED talk that I'm gonna do and I've been asked me a couple times to do it and I just wasn't ready but now I am I'm just wait I'm waiting eventually they're gonna get hold of me again and I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna base it around it I'm crying man a dud choked you up right I told you it was a payoff I mean like strong and my my my business partner Steve you put that together and I literally did it with his son originally and it was pretty good but Steve just took it like he's the same guy who directed the resurrection of jake the snake' so let me finish with him in with six months and ten months he lost the 140 pounds but fuck the weight cuz this is not about weight loss it's just an awesome side effect and think about that with my shit you could lose weight but you know you can't out train a bad diet so you got to do everything you got it more than anything change your mindset which is what positive the unstoppable is all about change your mind step in owning that inner voice the story you tell yourself so Arthur lost 140 pounds more importantly lots of knee braces back bracing James last the never no more neither aces no more knee braces how did he do that let me finish my vision good idea knee braces and canes not just to walk but run but this is what the program is really about at one year he's five six took a picture of a six foot two son that's insane standing on his back why he's doing a push-up in one year one year that's correct Matt if you didn't see him for a year hey miles go have lunch haven't seen you in a long time and and that's really like it was crazy because again anybody who got my program 11 years ago I personally there was no one else but me I would send a me an email saying hey man I'm not trying to sell you anything you already bought the program and I want to say thank you and I got a couple questions if you would answer my depreciated his answers were so good that I wrote him back and I'd never written anybody like directly that I didn't know at this time and I wrote him back and I said sounds like you need some help bro I said what's your story CliffsNotes disabled veteran morbidly obese relegated to think himself as a piece of furniture so I say send me some pictures so I can see what I was working with and those are the pictures those first two with the canes I was like fuck man I don't know how I can help him because it's not so much two knee braces hell I wore knee braces my whole career I didn't realize it was strapped to a back brace and his wife 20 minutes every morning got to put on the sleeve put on the brace cuz he can't even bend over enough to do it and so she puts them all together 20 minutes later he's going to the bathroom with his canes so I sent him this food plan which is like my face three eating plan is for health but I got it from a guy named dr. Fred bishi at a time fred was 78 could still run 20 miles on the beach in the in the deep sand with my brother like that's his mentor he helped people would cancer and all sorts of shit this guy's like he's just a different level of whip walking the talk so you have a food plan as well as an exercise plan and what what kind of food you had a meeting well this is what I like to do let's go back to God created shit that's not genetically modified all right shit that's not sprayed with chemicals so let's call it organic or like your great-grandparents used to call it fucking food like does everything go to Italy go to France they all just say can I have the organic vegetables they go no what like everything is fucking organic you're bozo yeah you know like that's the way it's supposed to be I mean you look at just the the obesity heart disease cancer diabetes autism like how is it through the roof how are their 400-pound guys everywhere 25 years ago that didn't happen right you know and then they changed everything and as far as I'm concerned there's three reasons why it could have happened because I don't know I'm not a scientist some fucking wrestler but I know when I get people to eat what God created and stuff that's not genetically modified I've found that they get out of pain and that's what I did with Jake and Scott you know Razor Ramon also moved into my house and then when you get a chance to watch before you have Jake come on definitely watch a resurrection Jake the snake cuz I can set you up with that too but Jake I got him eating real food and Scott all aka Razor Ramon eating real food and within two weeks they're already gonna start getting out of pain that's why I'm I eat the way I eat because I don't want to feel like I'm 82 I want to feel like I'm 42 at 62 now when you talk about your food plan like are you giving them specific portions and what to eat like how do you set it up on the app which right now oh you like app doll dude I've got that I think I have the most extensive app on the planet and it like you just go to the workouts and I'll come back to the food Android and iPhone everything yes and right now you can get it about Windows Phone I think it works on my friend fucking whatever does we've set it up for everything that you can use after your iPad your computer and I didn't realize at the time that I set it up for the iPhone the Droid the iPad the tablet and the computer like going back in time I just would've done the phone because in in the computer because you can have your phone go right to the TV TV go but it cost me a lot more money to do it but all five units the bottom line is I created this thing like from Arthur stuff I call it DDP why rebuild you can't get out of bed you can't do the workout bullshit I got three workouts in bed right that have nothing to do with fucking it's just forget working out for 10 minutes 12 minutes we'll get you up and I called those beds Lex then I put you in chair force where you're sitting in a chair I got eight workouts in that fucking chair which gets you strong enough to hold the chair so I call those stand strong like Arthur was doing help you get up help you get down help you balance help to keep you from falling then you're ready for beginner and once you get to all the modifications that I teach you with stand strong I got a guy was 84 years old his name is Ted Evans he's been working with me since he was 68 the motherfucker can do every work that I do every workout now is modified times yes but he can do every fucking workout I do and it goes all the way to extreme psycho shit like I did a workout today where I took my foot and held out in front of me and held it for 30 seconds then pulled it out held it for 30 seconds this is all core stuff it's gotta be the stuff skips my mind right now the fighter the Frog UFC fighter Rob for the French kid who was amazing horse in Pierre yes I mean nobody can ever take him down you know they hook his leg and boom you're not taking him down he's gonna hop around cuz his core strength he had to be doing some of this type of stuff a lot of gymnastics well again those guys are super freaks any and you know as wrestlers or UFC eyes have been there that's a whole different level and George said Pierre I would never want him man nobody's taking him down I don't care how they hook is like so he really gets all of that inner strength and that's what I'm doing at a level that you can start in bed right so there's no more fucking excuse no more fucking excuses and that's so damn important because people can feel sorry for themselves they can say they can't do it they don't have the energy there to beat up that's bullshit there's always something you can do that's always something if you but if you give yourself that fucking excuse that's the problem what I love about that video is if anybody had an excuse it's that guy absolutely that guy I mean - canes giant belly blown out knees blown out back veteran paratrooper okay I mean jumping out of fucking airplanes over and over again blows his body apart and you fixed it that and he fixed it he fix I just literally like they're so much better so when I sent him the food plan right from from from Fred bushy his food plan because food sir just regular food but like what do you have the meeting like put in say what so I vegetables you'll hear me say in my program over and over and over and over and over again make the DDP why your own bike and I explained to Arthur when I called him well here's what happened so he he's I sent him the food plan love you say and if he writes me back I think I can do it I'll give it a try you go crazy no I go hey awesome keep me posted but he said four words or he wrote four words I can do this I said give me your number right now and I called the motherfucker wrong if you say you can you say you can't you're right you know that you say you can or you say you can't you're right right do you have said that originally who Henry Ford right yeah and now we say but but what the fuck did he ever do what the fuck did he ever do but for when he said I can do it I said give me your number so I called them and I said you know we talked for about an hour two weeks later he calls me back the main thing I talked them in in in that conversation which is again what unsafely unstoppable is all about as important as the workout is as important as the eating plan is ten percent of the equation the 90 percent is right between your ears right here that six inch piece of real estate the story you tell yourself and I said if you can really just get past that story and start re telling yourself a different story an example would be when I had when I went up for my whole thing induction speech in front of 20,000 people and millions of people in USA and on the WWE Network which is only $9.99 by the way it's like a rib bottom line is is that I wasn't in the back going oh god I hope I don't fuck this up oh god what if I forget what's gonna say oh god this sucks what if I what if I fuck up what say now saying it's gonna be the best thing ever done I'm gonna blow people away I'll make him laugh gonna make him cry I'm gonna inspire him and that was my inner voice I'm out there did the best thing I've ever done like it's the best thing I've ever done but it's about that story that you tell yourself and you get all this shit and that's why people listen to you because they want they need to be reminded it over and over and over again you know the way you think about things is so important it's so important it's almost more important than the facts right right the way and the way this guy decided that he was going to change his life that that video is so important to people I mean if there's ever that's the best testimonial video you're ever gonna see ever I mean that guy's as broken as they get I mean he's basically it me either could've been in a wheelchair easily well he was in and out anytime he was going around you know like any kind of you know go too hot you to the airport what do they put you in a wheelchair yes it means it's too hard too too hard for him to walk around and again going back to eating so back to them so what do you get them eating well again I use again a mess make the GDP wider on you can do paleo if you wanna do paleo you can do this keto diet whatever you're doing with that I try to say if you're early on and you're young you know I encourage them to do calorie counting calories in calories out but a lot of people that doesn't work for anymore so what I get them to do is go gluten and dairy free and really I started with gluten free if you can go on people that are gluten free all's I know is the people I work with get out of pain I'm one of them so I don't give a fuck if you eat gluten or not I don't care fucking Nazis I'm fuckin like hey do what the fuck you want to do but this is what I do this is what him and her and him and her do and look at them and it just it helps drop weight it's it's about inflammation and your body go back to icing your body sugar it's we're all at its word I tried to get him to cut down as much as they can some people click completely which blows my mind which tells me they really have that substance my my friend Stacey Morris who lost 180 pounds in 18 months she's actually on the cover of Wednesday right now that big magazine for women's day of her transformation she wrote a book on it like something comfort feeling eating comfort or family comfort you can catch it up on my site it's up there but she wrote this book about I'm eating without sugar and that's like I'm not telling anybody do that because I can't do that oh you're right cuz I don't want to I want to still eat the sugar I just don't use but you're not you're just not being a glutton about and I'm eating good sugars right you know like that the honey that I'm putting in this gimmick is organic honey so the the food part for for the inflammation would be the sugar dairy and wheat and gluten get those out of your body I challenge you you have you ever gone gluten-free a'dreea no I have and how much better do you feel feel really good look I I'm basically gluten free all the time except for I take cheat days oh sure I'll take a cheat day and I'll have a bowl of pasta but for the most part I rarely eat bread and I rarely do anything pasta or anything with wheat well let me give you this two and a half weeks let me give you an alternative I love pasta I mean I'm an Irish German Dutch kid but all my best friends were Genta Cafaro sauce rossi IV all my buddies well goombazz no and so I love Italian food I fucking love it so there's a there's a company called think yatta that it's the best pasta I've ever had in some brown rice pasta so there's always a substitute when you get that out of your in two and a half three weeks it's a different level jus like you've already feel better you feel better but it's got to get out of your body and then have you put it back in you know here and there you're gonna roll it but it's gonna go away quick cuz it doesn't have all that shit stored in your body well it also reminds me how shitty I feel after I eat it when I do eat a pizza laying on the couch like a like a lead weight to my stomach but what I substituted it with is spaghetti squash I lost is awesome Ettie squash with some garlic and marinara sauce it's fantastic and the tilt free that's one of our recipes like the way our our app is set up or DDP yoga now app and like I said anybody wants to try it fuck it cost you nothing go try it for seven days you like it like it not get out of it I don't give a fuck I don't I mean only what people want put the work in they will say to me well how much do I have to do it I say you don't you don't have don't fucking do it I don't want you to do it I want you to own it and really do it or not and I'll try to inspire you because every every Monday I've got motivational Monday's on the app every Monday I'm doing another story about something I saw and I'm bringing to you could be three minutes it could be eight minutes but it's gonna do on the app yes it says it's one there's 150 of them up there cuz I've been doing it for two and a half years and then there's every week we have a new recipe come out and I'm not just gonna tell you what's in it and how to make it I'm gonna fucking show you how to make it cuz we got in our DDP yoga Performance Center which is in Smyrna Georgia which by the way every first time you come in there it's free maybe another fucking gym or something like that does that how far is that from Dallas Atlanta Atlanta well it's literally 20 it's 20 minutes from the heart of Atlanta I mean it's one minute Lana I'm doing a gig I'm gonna stop in dude no stay you're gonna stay I have I just bought a crib that literally one of my buddies Titus who's from the WWE is coming in on Tuesday to train with me I got a hyperbaric chamber now whoa yes 12 psi I got a cryo system in my I'm out float thanks I don't have that you ever fuck with one you know I haven't because I'm kind of decent right here but I'm gonna I'm really I'm kind of scared people you're screaming against no I do but being honest bro when I first got in the church in one try get you in one today you know what oh yes but you gotta you're gonna want to have one in your house I guarantee what's the most relaxing thing ever okay I can easily get out oh yes push the door open okay cool you know only because it's you because you inspired you inspire the fuck out of me like like I was this was so crazy Mitchell thank you thank you I appreciate that you know I yeah I knew we were gonna get long like incredibly but but here's what happened I I've been reaching out to different people like Eddie Bravo do you mind I just got a disk replaced did he really he had a lower bout his bad disk was so bad he could barely get out of bed and he had a titanium articulating disk put in his back he feels way better now yeah and he gained an inch he's five nine now which which is pretty sweet because of all the technology the video it's very incredible that can help those discs were all smashed from jiu-jitsu scores lower back you know I've always said like Eddie Bravo like he did what you know did your Jitsu community what I've done in there in the yoga community you know just take a totally different path right like I don't want to be in the yoga world I'm gonna be way the fuck over there I want to be the different guy then but we were just talking about what we're talking right before that oh yeah sometimes so no yeah but after that I I'd reached out to much different guys I like I've heard you talk about you know DDP why and what we're doing and you've talked about a lot of cool stuff you know and you segue to me into a couple Mike I gotta get on his show and they will get amazing you'll get along amazingly and then I saw on YouTube it was a somebody put together like a bunch of your clips from the show and I'm listen to it I'm like man this motherfucker sounds just like me I mean I gotta get on his show and I literally when I finished watching it I really looked up I went god it's out in the universe I want to get on Rogen show within the next year two days later you DM me two days later you DM me it's meaning to DM you forever is one of those things it's just unfortunately or fortunately there's just so many different requests for people to come on the broadcast I can't keep up no I get it it's just I can't it's impossible have you've been in the back of my head for a long time and I think that yoga like I said is so important I think what your you've done is make it accessible to people that wouldn't have considered it before all right you got to do me a favor okay what I got to do when you're talking about what the fuck I do DDP why DDP why say that and not yoga yes okay because it's different you know mainly because people put it in a box right now are you saying and you get it like you do workout with me yeah so we'd love to rob redid it my partner in on it yes and yes yes he loved it he said dude it's badass he said he's definitely doing something different his take was he's like he's got he's doing yoga he goes but he's got a whole nother edge to it yeah and then I keep again making it my own and I encourage everybody what's really cool about I've got some workouts that have me and like two people or four people behind me and they're like the introductory there's always someone modifying like when I first started doing yoga no one modified shit they never told you so I did like figure this shit out so anything I did I gave you a my how do you make this easier step in lower to a knee don't blow yourself out now the thing that you don't know and I gave you one a mark DDP yoga mats with a bag inside it is a Bluetooth heart monitor and what that's gonna do is connect right to the app so are you an iPhone guy or droid I have iPhone but I'm gonna switch over bullshit I don't I get that too but I'm sort of like a I'm an addict I'm not want to learn again but you know they get that mirroring thing so it pops right up on your TV up there we'll come where your heart rates at oh wow and then it tracks you at the end of it how long have you not been in your zone how long have you been in your zone and how long you've been over yourself think about this who did this app for you myself Steve you who's president my company and we hired these guys out of Turkey because they were all once they they all went to Georgia Tech and it's way cheaper but it's yo it's been a long I got popped coming up on three million dollars in it Jesus Crouch dude it's expensive its extensive you know and again there's a lot of interaction with it you know so the actual we make it like a video game at the end so when it gets to the end exactly what I wanted the next level right so when you're putting all this stuff together like this has got to be a long process of refining and honey just right I mean this is must have taken over your life oh absolutely absolutely but I go on the road all the time I do Comic Cons do you ever do comic-con no no I've never done I want to know do you have to you will fucking have a line forever I used to be a comic book dork man I had to sell them all when I was poor I used to I had all these comic books that I collected from the time I was a little kid and then when I became a stand-up comedian and I was starving in the early days I sold them all my comic books and just it's just a bummer man I'm scared to go look at comic books again no don't don't don't do that cause it was especially do you know adi shankara's no did you see there was a power ranger bootleg video that came out like maybe four years ago five years it was five years ago and it blew up on YouTube got like 5 million views which you know back then that was fucking you just because so the guy who owns owns the power just put a lawsuit on Artie and YouTube and they had to pull it off next thing you know he's on CNN and you know they're asking him about it he's like fuck him he was he doesn't I mean we're not trying to make money we're not monetizing this soon right thanks you know he pulled the thing off your lawsuit off and now it's got like 22 million and this is something that he did because he's produced a bunch of movies but they kept changing his shit like wouldn't let him do what he wanted to do and like wrasslin was Judge Dredd and five years ago or little before that he's telling me how he's gonna do this shit on YouTube but I'm like what the fuck you meteor do put like shorts on YouTube well he did that one it's got 22 million views right now me and that really became like this underground you know go that type person of the internet and he sent me a script about three years ago when we started and it's called gods and it's kind of like you know every all superheroes as you know they're all slightly different but the same and it's a very dark dark superhero series that's well when you get to the fighting part of it remind you of like fight you know from the night from the 80s friggin video right shit like that meets a really dark story that uh it's going to be a Netflix original so wow that's something something I think you I think you'll dig it I love The Watchmen it's kind of a little bit like that but not I was hoping they were gonna do a sequel and I had heard that they weren't they planning on that Jaime is that that's something they're working on it was so good I was like how is it how'd they not follow up on this I don't know you know but we're gonna we have like I say words in the process right now putting together are these the brains behind it but it's something else being you're into comics or series I've heard that uh all but different people huh oh interesting all right well I'm down for that yeah I'll check it out HBO man they pick up the slack Netflix coming in strong they are feels like fuck man gather up the troops war going on fuckin Ozarks back baby whoa love that show whoa two episodes in did you see the first sinner sinner oh no I haven't seen that show I heard that's very good that's just good you all dude you are moking but they later look confusing Peter thank you around are you like I don't know what my opinions are I'm gonna change them you tell me what your opinions are I'll take those Gigi look she comes off as really like girl next story yeah but that's that friggin show right there my wife and Brenda and my my daughter Lexi she was there we watched all eight episodes like one after another on a Sunday afternoon we were like pulled in sheep my wife had seen uh printed scene they were playing in on the plane and she when she came back she's like we have I couldn't finish watching it you've got to get this I'll watch it from the beginning get it's not good it's this shows now it's a really interesting time to be a consumer oh absolutely man yeah I'm big on the Netflix and a sneaky pete university view that no hurt that's great tool that's an Amazon right yeah everyone's just that Goliath is supposed to be fantastic on Amazon - that's that Billy Bob Thornton I love the first season I haven't got through the second one yet but it's a crazy time if you thought about doing something like that make like maybe on Netflix or something along those lines like having like sort of like inspirational clips mixed in with your workouts with these people showing transformations you know I good friend of mine had a great idea do you know Tim Tim say be honest I know the name yeah he was Howard Stern's yeah and he just came up to me he was at that show I was telling about all in this weekend and he was like dude twitch is the future you we've got to do something with this and I don't I've heard a twitch but it was like video game and you know people watching video game stuff he said yeah but it's going to go to a whole new level and sabians a really smart guy and I'm actually helping him and get back on track with his health so he's gonna come to Atlanta and see me he's gonna talk to me and Steve and figure out what we do okay I'm all over wheel this company would never be successful without the internet okay without people sharing that Arthur video everywhere you know and there's so many other videos that we've had go viral one of my favorites and I'll get this to you my buddy named Marc Mero he's a performer wrestler marvelous Marc Mero back when we wrestled together was Johnny be bad and he made his name from John into mark well his real name was mark he was actually actually Marc Mero is a four-time New York Empire State Games boxing champion ah yeah from back in the day when he's a kid but he is becoming this inspirational speaker to kids I've never seen anybody move kids the way he does so he was in Atlanta one day and I sent my crew down there because I got a whole production studio like resurrection we filmed that we ended it we did everything and I sent my crew down there to just go down and film them and Steve took this one part where he talks about his mom now no bullshit Joe I can show you how this one four-minute clip that Steve produced has over a half a billion views on Facebook like half a billion and now it will it mark went from having trouble getting booked at high schools to being in such demand that he had does he had 3,000 requests the month that that video went crazy and people keep taking and putting out there but he connects with kids it starts out with I want to be rich I want to be famous and then he shows you as you know what can come with that if you're not friggin mentally prepared to handle that and I don't know how any fucking kid can be 18 19 20 years old I don't think they can yeah well I've never seen anybody succeed LeBron but you know what I think one of the reasons why a guy like him has succeeded because his success comes along with athletic performance right like it's not just like being Justin Bieber or you know being some sort of a musical superstar I think the struggle of the athletic pursuit is one of the things that keeps you humble because there's no way to get around the work no and the work keeps you humble there's nothing the kind of work that you have to put in to be LeBron James I don't care how genetically gifted he is clearly he's a fucking freak athlete but he's also got a powerful mind when you hear that guy there was some sort of a roundtable thing he was doing off you saw this with Jon Stewart and a few other people that HBO is that his show yeah when that guy talks what is it called was it the barbershop okay I love the bra when he talks you go okay there's a fucking nuclear furnace burning inside that guy that's why he's so successful it's not just him being a free Kathleen it's the mind his mind but that hard work and that dedication in his mind is the reason why he's still so good and keeps it together at you know what is he 35 now 33 just been around forever been around for a long time but been super fuckin successful for a long time and never fucked up never drove his car into a tree never punched a cop never got crazy I mean he's he's kept it together in a rare way that very few superstars do because it said you know it I mean um sure you went from when you first started into pro wrestling to becoming super famous it's it it's an intoxicating drug absolutely and it's a confusing drug it confuses the shit out of a lot of people fortunately for you you were already a man right and that was the big difference I should say starting at 35 was the worst thing physically because building one of my matches or any of these kids there it's like four or five car accidents one match yeah you know every mentally every night yeah and I said as you know as hard as it was starting at 35 the really positive side was that's 35 right so I was much smarter and disciplined more mature way more and you know that I was telling you about when you come to Atlanta you're gonna stay at my place man my wife is amazing we have the best bed and breakfast there's like five rooms that are all king-sized beds because again I'm getting ready to work with top athletes you look at LeBron you look at Brady how do they perform essential especially Brady at being 40 years old now pretty amazing it's but it's the way he eats which is pretty much the way I eat isn't he a vegan though he's really he doesn't eat legumes it's it's very strict again way I eat I still want the beef I still want but I don't eat it all the time now where are you Steve that shit'll time I used to eat 12 eggs in the morning now I eat eight you know five yolks and three whites but keeping the protein in but but he's eating for health let's just call it that and he's not beating up his body outside no of what he's doing when he's gets hit he beats up his body but before that all he's doing is strengthen his body and that's what DDP Weis is strengthening you like I just was real reading something I love that that girlie didn't Todd didn't play in any preseason stuff this year you don't need that he's gonna be out there he's gonna be in the best shape it's not gonna have put his body already through abuse you know so it's just like wherever you can everything that you do would you just sue MMA UFC NFL getting to the show is nothing and when you get to the show you have two jobs one be the best player you can be the best performer to don't get hurt you know what's crazy about Tom Brady he looks like someone's dead like you see him on the beach he don't look like you know like you see Herschel Walker without a shirt off you go jesus fucking christ what lab was that guy Tom Brady like oh there's Mike's dad he's totally normal-looking I mean he doesn't look bad he looks like he's in good shape there he is look at that what the fuck greatest quarterback of all time that's Mike's dad work ethic but it's obviously his mind - I mean that's fucking insane and that guy ain't sucking in his gut for anybody you could suck his dinner how about that it's a couple of inches over his fucking shorts let him let him relax he's got that gorgeous wife with him he's come to life her Jessica Biel together created some sort of a nuclear explosion - hot yeah it's crazy but it's good it's about healing your body and especially when you're in that spot and that's what I can do for these guys and you'll see as we as we work out you'll get it and you know well is everything I want to go back to your see this is what I don't understand when the the conventional wisdom is when it's bone-on-bone like your fuck there's too much inflammation there there's too much grinding right and you're just it's just gonna be too painful to do anything and you're gonna have to do some sort of a surgery how how does the yoga stays it because one of the muscles lengthen the DDP why are we go sorry how does the DDP wise do that is just the strengthening all the core muscles around your spine stabilizes everything is moving the only thing I can give member joke I'm a fucking wrestler I'm not an icon nightclub owner friggin I've been working the bar business my whole life that's what I did before this but I for some reason I'm just gifted with figuring shit out like on my app there's a guy named Jerry Cameron disabled that in wheelchair for two and a half years there's no weight to lose i 665 to 40 looks great but he's got the walker that he kept after two and a half years of being in the chair got himself out now all this is all my a poor like in my but we can rebuild you I'm doing my own little show we can rebuild you I had trademarked that name and you remember what that's from Six Million Dollar Man we can rebuild you so that's our thing so Jerry we have him in we over the seven week period now he's got a long way to go still but you will be so amazed every show that comes up how he gains just a little bit more little incremental stuff exactly input the confidence and like we reached out to our community in Smyrna Georgia and we said we're looking for people that want our help cost them nothing if you'll be part of our group and we can track you you can come go do our stuff you know and we gave we gave them the app we set them up and out of the twelve or thirteen and started we still have like seven and this is like eight weeks later and to see their stories like we follow them every couple of weeks will pop up and show where they're at and what they're doing but Jerry I got special spot in my just like you do for military guys you know I I've been Iraq three times Afghanistan once you've done those two 13 days ago these should they would freak the fuck out over you they would love you but I started in 2004 with that shit and over that period with Ryan Williams what he was getting shot down oh no no I just you know I didn't the bottom line is I have a fond spot for those guys and I have something as I do as well yeah I know and theirs is something I'm about to do off of my app that's gonna be life-changing for a lot of those guys I just don't have it all put together yet but it's a it's one of the things that I'm working on right now cuz I want to be able to give back to help them I do stuff with their organizations their y'all they people start them like I just did one with ma deuce deuce in uh in New Jersey where I'm from like I've lived in Point Pleasant brick towns the next town over and I went over there and I did one for the guys there and it would you know I had like 75 guys there and guys and their families and every one of those disabled that size given the Apple you know because I just want you to do it cuz if you do it you're gonna feel better I don't know how much better how much work you gonna put in and you know it all comes down to the work ethic like where you are how much work you put in where can you get right and where I my program meets you where you are and that's the whole thing with Jerry to watch where he is on the last episode I want to tell you it happened because I know eventually you'll get around to it and you're gonna be like wow this fucking shit's crazy and for to answer your question on the back all's I can think of is I'm constantly lengthening and strengthening and like I stretched my whole wrestling my whole athletic career right up though I was 42 and 3/4 when I blew my back out I stretch so stretching is great but it's not the end-all be-all I'm stretching and strengthening the muscles ligaments and tendons when you use the resistance and a dynamic time under tension when you do that it elevates your heart rate think about this you're at the laying down your heart rate so Lois ever right sit up what happens your heart rate goes up stand walk jog sprint boom boom boom boom boom that's what I'm doing when I had you flex your quads flex your glutes grab the ball open those fingers wide move with resistance I'll guarantee your heart rate if you start at 80 it went to 105 115 120 I take my heart rate from 90 to 140 135 like that and I mean two minutes standing still and that's not yoga that's DDP why and I've been wearing a heart monitor doing this for over 18 years so it's it's more physically intensive it can be more strain it can be like I said I did 10 10 second push-ups on my 6 second burger just so you but you still haven't gotten an MRI done you just figure fuck it feels like I perhaps doesn't like to see what it is because I know that there it is possible to gain some space oh I believe it has to be there well they've done it with decompression they've done it with you know various exercises and things that people do would that do lengthen the spine and stretch you out and there's a have a bunch of things out back I'll show you some of the things that they the people have created to decompress the spine you know do you ever use one of those teeter things when you're hanging out Michaels yes a lot I literally get out of my library let's talk about that for yeah please what do you know but I've never done it but I've heard amazing things from UFC guys sort of the fought had pretty significant injuries hand breaks muscle damage and got in there and had some pretty pretty rapid recovery because of it my doctor who she's Mike endocrinologist when I told her I was doing and she goes little dolls like I I can tell you I I know it can only help you she goes the only story I have about excitement know enough about it she said I had a woman who had radiation therapy so she had an open wound from her breast cancer and it wouldn't close for over two years put sent her down to Emory finally put her a Nightbird chamber three months later 100% healed same things happens with people with diabetes so I had heard like LeBron had it you know I don't I never saw an article on him but I just heard speaking about it you know in different areas that he had one Kobe had one damn in their house that's what I heard I don't know if they do it they don't I just heard it so it got me thinking you know my house and I was just I just left it's called the accountability crib and I'm about to put this out there everywhere it's when I moved Jake into my home in Atlanta I just bought it and it was all about being accountability one of my friends Christina Ann sent me a list of names I want to call this something I put it out there on the internet and she said been like twenty-two names and one of them is the accountability crib so that's what I call it DDPs accountability crib and you got to be accountable for everything and the thing I I love that home but it was 22 steps you know forget my bedroom and my knees are bone-on-bone so going down was a drag so I figured fuck it I'm gonna buy a new home master on main and I'm gonna build this yo I have this place that I can bring in top-end athletes that want to be healed you know so going back to the crib I'm making that like an Airbnb now and I'll have like to take just a crabber suite the the bridge of Ramon suite the DDP suite yeah so that'll be pretty cool that's gonna happen next week this is a bound get into his hyperbaric all okay great why doesn't LeBron shave his head what's going on with that somebody explain that there's some so much fuckery going on with his hair Wow okay that looks a lot but mine I would venture to say that he is not at 12 psi on that thing and what that means is pounds per square inch if you're like 10 to say 10 feet below sea level that's about 4 pounds per square inch you get you know it just goes up Tony would be like 800 pound for squares at 12 pounds per square inch the pressure is there and takes like 10 minutes to get up there like you blowing your No you know like just getting the air getting your you fix your ears and all that shit but what happens when you get to 12 psi now it breaks the brain barrier and the oxygen will go to your brain so this is I didn't know any of this shit till I sit next to a guy named Brad Campbell who was like an angel this cat and we just start talking on a plane and at some point I said man how old are you anyway sounds like you do a lot of shit and he says I'm thinking he looks at the max 45 maybe 40 he was on 57 I go you're 57 I said how the fuck do you look like that he said I've been living in a hyperbaric chamber for the last 14 years away from me all right I said how did that happen he said I was diagnosed with MS 22 years ago oh so he's using that to keep the MS in check he told me that when he gets a 12 psi and it goes to your brain and this would be layman's terms okay right like when you get em s kind of like crystallizes on your brain all right and when the crystals fill up where do they go next down your spine hence the cane the walker the chair so what somebody I don't know who the person was who figured out 20 days in a chamber and it's all about consistency you do it once or twice you're gonna feel better little bit good you do it like consistent like 20 days like they do their take all five days you do that four times you do your MRI on your brain before you start and after there's a kid named Daniel Bryan who is one of the biggest stars in professional wrestling again a couple years ago he had to retire at the height of his career and he was the hottest guy on the planet at the time and he wasn't a big guy but he was the number one guy in the business and he had a retired because of concussions well he's back and I haven't talked to him directly about this but I did hear that he was using a hyperbaric chamber he was brain now again while he's telling me this story I'm not thinking about that mass but I'm thinking I've been hitting a head a lot yeah you know I've been knocked out a shitload of times I knocked out a shitload of guys by accident but you know they weren't trying to knock me out either but it's not checkers out their breath so I've been hitting a head with chairs and all that shit how do you guys do that how do you hit someone he's supposed to go with it you know I got work here's the deal if I walk up to you and we're about to go out there and I'm gonna slap the shit don't do it anymore but in the old days if I want to hit you in a chair you gotta hit it like even right right I'd say hey dude I'm gonna say I'm sorry right now and you would say back to me and we'll come with it motherfucker don't make it look weak I mean that's what you would say we're gonna shoot an angle on it let's go with it but don't you think that back when you were 35 they didn't understand traumatic brain did not that's why they let us do it they don't let it fail you don't see that anymore but you were when Dennis Rodman wrestled yes well that was what I got Carl Malone involved and it was me and Carl Malone against Rodman and Hogan it was fucking huge I took my name to a different level but Rodman was supposed to be a practice that day in Detroit we were in Detroit that night with with Dodd Nitro and him him and Hogan I'm about to do this announcement and him and Hogan come from the back and whack me with chairs now there's a Dennis Rodman all right now he's not one of the boys he doesn't know you've got to lay it flat right if you inner Enders it there was some big like public a mat you know from a wrestling like I you know about the collegiate wrestlers wrestle on so this big roll of rubber was there I was probably about three feet off the ground and I said I know you've never swung a chair before so let me show you something and I picked my hands up it with a chair and then I'd lower him down just right on top of it then I'd pick him up and I'd lower him flat I said you see how flat it is right and I took it up and I hit it as hard as I could boom I said if you hit me like that we're good and then I just turned with my left hand moved down a little more so now the railing of the chair hit and to put a big dent in it I said if you hit me like that you break my ribs I said so please let me see you do it hit a fight he was great you know and they came out it was on ESPN that night he was supposed to be at practice and here hits fuckin around with us on shooting the angle Nitro so it was pretty cool but it's all about laying it flat and then you see how it's not checkers you know it's not fucking checkers one of the most disturbing things I ever saw was Brock Lesnar doing that flip off the top rope and landing on his head oh my god it's not a lot of human beings that would even survive that and then he goes on to complete the pin he how the fuck did he not get knocked unconscious from that and how the fuck did he'd not have permanent spinal injury from that and he is 300 pounds at the time I tell everybody you know think what you fuckin want about frescia wrestling you can't fake gravity what's flipping in the air I mean he's he's a badass motherfucker alive as long as I'm alive the hundred pounds flying through the air landing on the top of his neck I mean you watched it why watch this here watch this shared here desert for years oh fuck that is so fucked up look at him grabbing his head oh I mean he landed on his fucking head how is he alive I don't know he's not I missed that so bad his cyborg yeah I mean he's one of dads fuckers landed on his head and this was before and look at this and the other badass motherfuckers right there next to ya completely fucked up from wrestling among his arms both of his arms have completely atrophied because he's had so many spinal surgeries and spinal injuries his neck is completely fused up I'm not begged him and a little gold medalist a legit Olympic gold medalist in wrestling broke his neck yes four and still won still won again one of the baddest motherfucker again this this job which is you you know I mean it's obviously it's a work everyone's its work it's entertainment right but physically demanding in terms of physically demanding crazy it might be more physically demanding in than any sport it's right up there the only thing I can think that might be as bad but they don't do it every day is bull riding know if that's a sport that's just crazy people that's pretty nutty I had a friend of mine who has done it and he had some eight or nine shoulder surgeries his shoulder was just shredded it was just her it was just all these cut marks all over his shoulders it just blown apart and I stitched it back together and blew it apart and stitch it back together again it's like you know how about stop riding fucking 2,000 pound animals but I don't want to fuck one of those things but they're just so crazy coming out of the gate you can't control that at all no you can't control that at all so the guys with those runs they're pretty banged up in the other guys like I've just started you know I'm talking to Bart Oates who is the president of the NFL alumni and we've been talking about doing something for the guys and again when I do shit like that I just give it to them just to help them and I've talked to a few of the players I got a few guys you know loving it and so it's just again helping them with because there's no those guys are all weightlifting running right we can't do either now cuz you're so beat up so it let you host funny when we watch tape you I know I'm sure you watch the Superbowl when they had the 50th anniversary a couple years back and all the MVPs that came out there just it was it was brutal to watch how beat up they are the only guy of course Jerry Rice looks like he could still play because that son of a bitch is the greatest he's just a frickin super athlete and somehow I don't know with all the crazy shots he's been hit with that he has survived but there's certain people I always say they can eat plastic like they can do anything yeah and you know you said Herschel Walker before that exist who wants to fight Ben you know he was fighting in Strikeforce when he's 48 years old I want you to feel like a fucking 20 year old freak of nature fully shredded and then you know I mean you really have to stop and think if that guy did fight when he was in his 20s instead of in his 40s late 40s right he could have been a world champion and I'm not bullshitting he's that kind of a freak athlete yeah he he won might claim the famous wig hair was his last big run for Dallas he caught like the ball around 67 yards into the endzone this is like 1997 and he put the ball between his hands did the dynamic outside and did the bag but you didn't know because he put the ball in there if it was battery was doing something else and one of my friends who had a show a radio show and uh Craig and he had it in Arizona he called me up because D I'm having Walker on the show today he goes do you want to sit in the wings I asked him if he did the diamond cutter or not let's go dude I definitely want to hear that so he put me on the phone in the wings and I'm waiting there and he said so what happened that day what what was something you did with the ball he goes well you know I'm a big WCW fan and I'm I really like Diamond Dallas Page and I thought the bang and I just did it and did the bang and everything he was lily's on the air right now with you it's like get out of here we became buddies out of it I lost touch with him since then buddy great guy arias what I think you're doing and what I think that one of the best benefits of yoga and I'm sure the same with DDP why is that you're connecting everything together whereas like yoga and sprinting all this explosive exercise it's building up the muscles but what you're doing is you're tightening up all the joints right you're tightening up the core and the joints and this is the thing that people are missing that a lot of people are missing that are really into fitness and exercise they're doing all this explosive stuff but what's connecting everything together is what blows out the knees the ankles the shoulders the back and this this is something that's missing from a lot of people's work it's because it's not as glamorous no right it's not like you do biceps your buys get all pumped up you do chest you get all pumped up you look great it's a different thing what you're doing is for overall body maintenance and health and just connecting all these parts together in a way that makes the whole unit stronger and healthier and again that's what I was saying I'm stretching and strengthening just think about going over your head and reaching up what you know when I started class --iv like I just had a hundred and seventy-five people pay to be a part of a workshop that I do called inspiration meets perspiration and I guarantee him two things I'm so jacked up I'm so inspired they're gonna feel like they get run through the brick wall and - they're gonna sweat their ass off but I met let them meet it where they are on whatever level so the person who might be 400 pounds and the person who shredded over there can get a good workout at the same time because I'm showing him how to do that modification over there and you might even have a chair and this guy I'm gonna go deep no no go deep now let me show you this now grab the ball open it up and then pull but before I start one of those things because there's people there who come because they heard of Chioggia right right and I walk yeah I've got my mic on and I go I'm walking I go if you came here for the yoga where you reach your arms to the heavens so the universe smiles back at you and I drop my arms I go we won't be doing any of that shit today what kind of yoga did you start with how are you I was yes so they never did like Bikram sir no I've done everything I've done Delaney yeah I've done all of them at least once just to try like I respect yoga at a different level like as much as any like what's really funny he's like guys like Brian cats and Shiva Rea and there was a my buddy of mine Arthur Klein did he will be called why yoga and in it he gives me a camera and it was the second time I went to Iraq and I filmed all this shit and me with the guys and then you know interview and I was interviewing someone else interviewing him for me and we got this great great stuff but in the beginning I'm talking about how I literally was interviewed when I wrote the book yoga for regular guys yeah and it was smoking hot chicks and a regular guys cuz back then I met Tia net you when I said it and I never thought women would love the work out the way they do when I was this here that you put this together 2005 so I was interviewed by his guy from The Wall Street Journal and literally he quoted me saying when Kimberly had asked me if I would do the yoga I was like fuck that I wouldn't be caught dead doing yoga and he put in there F - - - that I wouldn't be caught dead doing yoga so that's in the beginning of the movie right so the note is like hate me but by the time it gets to the end where they see like I'm just putting a different spin on it and I'm not trying to do what you're doing but similar writing as far as I'm concerned more benefits now when you say Power Yoga for people who've never done yoga before differentiate like what does that mean when you say power yoga versus like something like Bikram yoga um Bikram is to me first of all I don't want to be that hot I don't want to be in a hot room I want to hate my body up in the cold hmm so I don't want to put myself in a position where it's so hot that I can go farther than I've ever gone before because then I'm gonna walk out into the real world and then I'm not gonna get that I want to be able to get what I get in the real world and there's like I must say I don't know how many positions are let's say there's 46 positions or whatever it is in Pegram veins 28 no whatever is right those 27 of 20 I can't but either way he trademarked that so that like in news oh yeah but I thought he won but on top of that I don't think it was his to begin with I think somebody else had put all those patterns together before him and then probably so because again it's frigging yoga it's been around for thousands of years but for me what I do like the one time Chris Jericho and I were he was he he came by my house in LA and when I was living here and we went out to the park and he's like so what do you do you do stand-up one day you know strength builder next I go Chris I do it different every I do the same open and do the same clothes but all the middle I go it's like a match man I'm making it up as I go along at times you know and I'm improv because I'm seeing what you can do and then I want to take a dipper if I see you can really go well I'm gonna push you to a different level that I go to if you can't then I'm gonna back way the fuck off cuz I don't want to burn you I want you to I did it with Tino Tito Ortiz one time he'd written something in Sports Illustrated interviewed along and I had met him at a strip joint in Vegas and he was the man in UFC at a time and he wanted to they weren't making any money you remember back in the beginning when they were seeking any money and he wanted to go to where we were right and I was like dude here's what I really feel this shit you're doing it's building crazy momentum I go or at the top of where we're gonna go right now and it's so cyclical at some point it's gonna fall out I said it's a whole different thing than what you're doing I know you appreciate it which I'm super excited about but bottom line is man stay where you are and he's saying this in the SI interview right so I still had his number and I called them up he answered the phone like I dunno okay did he pay like hey man I uh I saw what you said and you told the story exactly I talked him out of it like trying to go and told no stay where you are dude you're about to have the hell run and he put that over sight so I said man you remember exactly where well weight went he said yeah he goes of course that's one was fighting again I heard that fight next month I went down and worked out months in November yeah I worked out with him after he'd is back surgery he's had a bunch of back sir well the first one yeah the first one I'd worked with him and I'm figuring this is Tito Ortiz man I'm gonna freakin push him to show him how this was strengthen him then after that he wouldn't do it I finally pinned him down I go till why didn't you do it again because it was too fucking hard bro I'm like dude you say that you're one of the baddest fucks alive how could you and he's like you know I just thought it with you I said I can make it super easy and that's where I learned back the fuck off meaning me bring it where they meet it and let me show you how looking out like Cain Velasquez he was just down in um in the performance center down WWE and I'm training the guys down there and I go down for like a weekend I heard he's thinking about going into pro wrestling after his career is over well I'll tell you what man he's another guy's had a shitload of back surgery and shoulder surgeries knee surgeries and he you know I could draw huge money yeah he really comes such a natural that you can imagine a giant Mexican yeah right that doesn't really exist like that first-ever Mexican heavyweight champion tremendous sports I watch it man he's one of the greatest of all time if not the greatest he just his body couldn't keep up with his mind mine was so physically tough I mean his mind was so he was so mentally tough that his physical body would start falling apart his knees his back shoulders it's just when you watch that guy train I mean he trains like nobody him and Daniel Cormier would just go to war I'm so happy for DC I mean but oh yes we've never met but you know that's what we do and yeah fights in Dallas this weekend oh great yeah there's UFC welterweight Championships in Dallas this weekend awesome awesome I was gonna say before he said Cormier Ortiz it was too difficult for him you know that's when you learned to back the fuck off and that came velasca okay wow you're good you should do this you should have a show so when I when I was down there I did six workouts in five days and six workout two double sessions and well over a single session every day Kane made four of them and then you know we changed numbers I sent him my program I said Matt's heart monitor and I don't know if he's doing I haven't checked back and helped him tremendously tremendously really would you know because that guy's whole issue has been really his back I mean there's other injuries the shoulders and the knees and stuff like that but they can fix those but right they can fix your back right the back is I know if he's doing it lose those discs you know and I told him like I told you I said if you can get out to Atlanta like I'll personally work with you it costs you this I just want you to have the results because like Arthur the results will speak for themselves you know yeah no I mean I I'm a believer a hundred percent and I just I I just can't say enough how impressed I am that video with Arthur you know that is one of the most impressive transformation videos I think of seen online and that's saying a lot yeah that's the other kids abut I found it on the Internet there's few things that they really share like when Steve first did that video I looked at it and went man you don't have back then was still we were just branding at DDP yoga you don't have DDP yoga com1 it don't bro he goes I read a book and in the book remember this is 2011 and he said I read a book that talked about if you want something go viral it can't be in advertising at it has to be unless it's super funny then that's different he said but if you want to use two things we can do here we can make it an ad or we can inspire people he goes what do you want to do isolettes inspires people so then I watched it again right and then I'm watching it like a fucking but I'm a yogi in there so I called them up and I go bro I don't wanna be I mean I love yoga but I don't I want to go for the healing you're out there right and yours alright I just want you to think about this and this waste Steve Steve is like an Ivy Leaguer graduated from Cornell like super smart was literally on his way to being a top guy at IBM and thought fuck that I don't want to do that I want to inspire people so he is only guy that I know is self-taught a hundred percent how to edit how to produce how to do everything and resurrection dick snake when you see it you'll know that's his baby that video is his baby so he said just imagine this alright Yoga is gonna want to take credit for all of this even though it's our shit and it's different it's still you know a version of he said that'll end up on every yoga studio wall ever and that's what helped it go viral so remember he said that in the video that he'd been turned away right by cuz because he needed you needed the chair they didn't have any such thing they don't know how to incorporate that into their flow right I do so you just you figured out the chair is a balancing tool we have and we have some more people just sitting and we have like beginner beginner but by the time you come into my class like what I'll do I'll go do a class and I'll be back so let everybody know Tuesday of next week I will be doing a class at DDP yoga before but Center it'll be jam you won't be able to fit enough people in there but there'll be people with chairs and they'll be people without them and you know the energy will be insane because I've got you counting and you'll see like grab the ball now grab ahold and work your back and byes here and pull deep breath three two one I'm engaging everything now negative rep so you're engaging again again I want to get your heart rate up there and keep it there well it can't be too out for you were Pro Wrestling when you were 35 I was running nightclubs I was running night I was in a nightclub business since I was 17 they actually had me bounce they didn't know how old they know was an old love cuz I was six four and like 180 pounds but I was tall and they I started bouncing when I was 18 once I thought I was seventeen and get the hell out of here you're not old enough but I came back when I was 18 and then I was bar back in and bartending I was running I ran a small rock and roll joint at 22 and a half years old and then I went to Houston when I lived down there for a while and honky-tonk scene was insane then I came back for a wedding and I there was a place in Asbury Park New Jersey which is where I'm from the Jersey Shore it's really funny I always tell people this from the same Jersey Shore area me and bam bam bigelow who's a future whole family you know to me she'll already be in Danny DeVito Jack Nicholson Jon Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen I hope from that like save Jersey Shore area but I came back for a wedding and there was this club opening up and so I went in there I talked to the guy he's well I need a head bartender I said I'm gonna be a head bartender but I'll be a general manager and I'll get behind just take two days a week but this place was huge like you sound stick the book mehar get behind the bar and bartend going slower than that you get behind the stay - dick our place was it was huge it was a big weird rock and roll and disco first time Bruce Springsteen ever sang dancing in the dark was kind of with a band called bystander and sang with that because you know Bruce's them two blocks away one block away was a Stone Pony where I watched him probably 18 Sundays in a row played with a band called cats on a smooth surface you just jump up and start playing you know and know how did you go to pro wrestling so I was running a club I tried it when I was 22 that was right before I started to actually you know get a chance at running a club I had three matches I sucked I tore I talked my knee and when I was 12 years old I mean I was like I loved football and hockey like in my mind I'm gonna play defensive end for the New York Giants I mean that's my mind at the time but then I walked out got hit by a car my face bounced up the hood nets with 42 people appointed ambassadors Christ no such thing as rehab in 1968 so they wouldn't let me play football or bet art for hockey but they were there here's a two-sport you just decided you were broken they're like you're young you can't get a doctor to sign for you and they weren't gonna sign for me so they gave me two choices baseball and basketball I suck at both and baseball you're gonna have somebody basketball you don't and I didn't even make the team in seventh grade and I don't give a fuck so I didn't really like it when you say you gotta have somebody what do you mean you have to have someone to throw the ball back and forth well yeah you're gonna have nine guys you know it you only seven you know yep they play with another seven or whatever and I just what you want of course but whatever you can do to make it work for basketball you just need one you need a ball in a hoop that's it and eighth grade I sat on the bench and I'd never sat on the bench ever so I thought that's never happened to me again and it taught me the greatest lesson it taught me that summer I played every day all day long five hours a day minimum you don't forget you can you're by yourself you know layups hooks foul shots whatever you know and then games break up in the beginning you know I didn't get picked that you don't till the end maybe and then as time went on over that summer kept getting better and better and I'm better my freshman year I started and we went undefeated by sloppily I was playing varsity so I realized that work ethic equals results so that was the huge lesson I learned from that so now I'm 23 years old and I've you know I hurt my knee and I'm gonna take some time off away from the dream of being a wrestler and I get caught in the boozy parts in the party because it's all the ones and I was lucky that I had way of parenting myself like getting into that whole party scene which I did but slowly I kind of backed myself out a little bit each year and I've got this club in Fort Myers Florida time and this one I actually own a little piece of it with my buddy Tony Cafaro and a couple other guys and one night I'm in the man office and we had a camera at the back door and camera at the front door this place would hold legally probably about six other people we got a thousand in there and I'm looking the cameras that person walks and looks just like Jake the snake Roberts I'm a huge fan of Jake Roberts so I friggin help outside the building come around I don't want to walk through people and I go to this girl Judy at the front so I go did a guy just walk in here looks like Jake Roberts she was yeah she goes I think it's him so I go right we go running in there like a huge mark and when I see him I slow down one over bad boy so he's up at the bar I'm like hey you dick snake Roberts who wants to know I said the guy who runs this place he goes yeah I go what are we drinking and that's how we started so it's really crazy that in resurrection I help him not drink guy is amazing I mean this had that happened and then of course I paid for his drinks and actually of Ted DiBiase is there bushwhackers are there all I called the guys from the 80s if you wrestled in Tampa then you had to go to Miami well Fort Myers was the perfect location so they had seen all these different these boys coming through that right so I did all my own radio commercials back then so back then I might be like Thursday Thursday Hart legs and then I might throw in oh yeah dig it miss hot legs yeah thinking thinking thinking and people didn't know if it was Randy or Hulk or Jesse or whoever and I never told anybody right so they do this interview on uh uh the voice cuz this is Fort Myers this little it's called the party news network my buddy Kevin yeah we're gonna do a spot on you on the news network okay so they told me in my 62 pink Cadillac they film me at the studio at 62

sergeant saw and he says to me he says you know you got to do something with his diamond dollz page then you're a natural I go so many do blood I don't know what the fuck to do I mean it's just something in my head and he says I got this friend of mine named Rob Rosen who was a boxing promoter who now it's working for the AWA up in Minnesota I'll give you his address send him a tape or something so I think about it and I write those story lines for those guys and then I make that tape and I send it to the AWA no bullshit Joe two weeks later I get a phone call hey this Diamond Dallas Page and I'm like yeah this is Rob Russell from the AWA we've seen your tape we want to bring you and your boys in for a tryout because but we've got one question you know we've shown them tape around and everybody kind of likes your stick you know it's fresh god energy said but no one's ever heard of you where you guys working well Rob we got one problem um none of those guys can wrestle he's like what he goes why would you send us a tape I go it's like a secret society like no one can figure out how to fucking get in so you know why they're training I could you'll manage oh my god don't call us we'll call you and two weeks later God just aligned this for me at some for some reason just to be where I am today but Paul Heyman is one of the biggest stars is you know a character on WWE television was called Pauly dangerously at a time he left the AWS went to the n.w.a which was gonna get bought by Ted Turner left a huge spot open for a young guy that could talk they brought me in all those clothes you saw me in I was wearing that shit in Fort Myers Florida and I said to my buddy Kurt Church who was my head bouncer at a time out of the floor I and when this is starting to happen like oh dude can you imagine if I ever have a reason to dress like this anything I got way more tapered down you know I wasn't living the gimmick but uh you know this is beginning everything and then dusty roads and coming to Florida for Florida Championship Wrestling dusty took me under his wing man and he gave me every break that ever meant anything to my career early on that's why it was so important for me to be there for Cody because I bag get choked up just thinking about it Dusty Rhodes there is no Diamond Dallas Page he gave me every break I ever had and for me to watch his son do what they did last weekend do you remember your first match my first be out my first match was a tag match so I'm managing now okay three and a half years and then I finally get the call cuz dusty who went to WWE and he did just polka-dotted gimmick with him he came back to run the WCW and you know he's nwa world champion he's like the one of the smartest guys ever in our business and I developed a relationship that was super tight with him when we were in Florida but it was his wife Michele who really kept it going when he wasn't because when I call up just to check to a dusty once in a while she'd say don't worry Dallas dusty will call you back and knowing how bad he is at calling somebody back I know that that's why I thank Michelle of my whole famous speech because I know without her I don't know if it ever would have kept going the way it did but dusty you know he brought me in and I managed the Freebirds Michael PS age and jimmy-jam Garvin which was of such an education such a good time Michael's still one of my best friends today and I help Scott Hall who was big Scott Hall come in changed his entire look from blond hair and a big wallace mustache adam dye his hair jet-black and give him this brush cut beard that like nobody had the 5 o'clock shadow and no one knew the fuck he was and i brought him in and what has happened and as you see all the crazy clothes I wore well five months in Magnum TA get Dusty's right-hand man comes up to me and he's like listen Dee we're gonna keep you at the color commentators box I'm also doing color commentating with Eric Bischoff who would later run the company and he said he said we can't let you manage any more I'm like what what'd I do wrong he goes it's not it's not anything you're doing wrong bro he goes it's just you just with the hair and the rap and the dolls and those crazy clothes he goes you're taking too much attention away from the boys and third ones you draw the money and I was like so fuck are you telling me Magnum that I'm too over the fucking top for wrestling and he goes as a manager kinda he said but you know what we should've done pushing a pair of tights and boots and see if you could do this shit eight seven months left on my contract bro I said fuck this I never got in this business to be a manager I wanted to live the dream well I'm gonna do it and I went down there and they beat the fuck out of me now did they teach you how to do it first no they what they do is they blow you up this is what was not done Denix T's is is different down there Performance Center but the original power plant my one of my another mentors a guy named Jodi Hamilton who was the assassin and he really taught me a lot and so did this guy Sarge but in the beginning they want to run you off so they want to see if you'll quit oh absolutely get you to quit it's a different letter like SEAL training like you're gonna do 5050 Hindu squats where you're asked to you know bucketing up again yeah and then you knew ten push-ups and then you're gonna do 50 and then 10 and 50 and 10 and by the time you get to that third fifty your life you're not in shape you're screwed because we're going to 500 yeah fit Hindu squats are a big thing amongst wrestlers right yeah it's a great way to get in shape but it's really wears on your knees a boom boom but it's really good for your knees and no no no not free or not if you've got bad you know dad's you got great knees it's it's like anything there's only so many bumps you're allowed in life the MS was on Fear Factor back in the day yeah to this day I say he's the fittest guy that was ever on the show that fucking kid is a stud he is a stud he did this this stunt in cold water where you had a dive into this cold water hold your breath and and complete this stunt and he was in it for more than two minutes holding his breath in cold water now if you know anything about cold water that is unbelievably impressive plus very grueling physical activities not that he was just in cold water holding his breath for two minutes which is impressive enough as it is but he was swimming around and pulling off while he blew everybody out of the water and he told me he did a shitload of those he was doing 500 a day Oh 500 Hindu squad kids no kid and yes that's why I was in that guy shape let me give you a little super nice guy - tremendous I love the MS I think he's gonna be a huge superstar he's already huge superstar wrestling but I think he's gonna be a huge superstar yeah yeah so let me tell you the first time I meet him I'm here in LA I'm living in Playa Vista before that all that shit blew up there right I'm living there tonight yeah I wanna say it's 2004 cuz I'm gonna I wrestled until I was 46 then I took off two and a half years came here did the whole acting thing and put my dues and put the work in now I want to go back and I want to show people what I can do with my DDP y program at 49 so I call up a buddy my name Rick Bassman and he's got the UPW at the time and he's got the own area kind of like like the power plant was and the kids are training there whenever I said do me a favor send me over one of your boys and let him come by and get me and you know I'll do what I want to do and then I'll help work with him a little bit and so he sends me Mike the MS and just a sweetest kid and we we have a great talk on the way over there and you know I get I get done doing all my shit you know and then I say okay what do you want learn he's like you're gonna work with me I'm like hell yeah I'm gonna work but you've got great attitude of course I'm gonna work with you and we worked and now he's taking me home and he tells me about how he's was a real world he's like the original real worlds guy yeah so he's like I said man you've got that peace like people already know you that's that's that's really worth something it'll really come back to help you later as you're going through this so we get all the way back to my place and I'm like you want to come in for a beer he's like oh absolutely so he comes in and who's on the porch but Stone Cold Steve Austin who I lived with at a time and Kevin Nash are there so he's like in whoa what the fuck and I was just at WrestleMania well two years ago and it was about when I was inducted the Hall of Fame and Miz was back to doing one of his things now he's got the reality show with his wife which is super funny and there's times where I'm like this is really real because you know reality show there's no such thing as real life rod and reality show shit but there's a lot of their stuff you could tell that they're like shooting on because they want like the real the real deal but he told that story like he was backstage but it's one of his suits on his wife there he goes Holly come here Dini Bay come here but let's talk about the story when we first met and I just knew that that kid like he's hit a couple of roadblocks along the way that he could have quit he could have walked away from he could have not but he had such a belief in himself I always tell people never underestimate the power you give yourself by believing in you and that's who the Miz is and I think he's gonna be a huge you know I love the fact we get a whole different slant now because of the man the rock the biggest star in the world is one of us and did you see blockers but Cena no oh dude watch it it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and I was flying home I'm telling my wife you gotta watch this movie it's hysterical she's sitting next to me and I'm not even what I can't hear it cuz I've already seen it she's laughing so hard but I'm laughing because I'm watching it and I know what they're saying or an idea of it but when you got visual comedy which you know when you don't hear the words and you're watching like Buster Keaton and you're laughing that's really good shit and it's super funny and scenic killed it so you know he's he's super a less actor now he just did that Ferdinand moving him I'm he's on fire aye-aye-aye last time I saw him at the show I just pulled him over for a second I just cuz I don't really know him that well but I wanted to know I wanted him to know that I was so proud of him not for what he's done as an actor even though I'm super proud of him on that level but how he carried the company on his back for over a decade and still did so much work for charity man it was mind-boggling like no one has done more along that whole make-a-wish thing than Cena has but when I saw did you see him when he hosted the ESPYs no dude you're a comedian you know how hard that shit is he is not extend up comedian but he was friggin amazing what he's been acting for so long now he's so loose and you know this thing about being behind the mic on the WWE as well just being able to do that in front all those people have a swarm absolutely it's a that's its own level of like sometime 20 minute promos are doing the ROC confuses me in like how much energy yes I don't know how the fuck he can do all the things he does yeah he's always doing something like I go to his Instagram page all the time I feel like a lazy fuck he flies into China it's 4:00 in the morning he's lifting weights like what the fuck man the hardest-working cat I have never seen always doing something yeah I mean he's just sandwiches everything together I don't know how the fuck he does it yeah I'll tell you Jericho is I put like guys like who are the most insane workouts like right now rock is way past everybody he's past anyone I've ever seen that meet oh and and I'll just a tional II put it you know just a tweet out just says hey dude keep up the great he's one of those guys where I go how long did him human how long can the human body I don't like this cuz you know he's only sleeping for hours at night he's gotta yeah I think he's kind of like my buddy Steve you they don't need to sleep they just keep going Jericho's the same way Jericho when he's not wrestling he's singing when he's not doing that he's doing his podcast so he's not doing that he's doing this for he's doing that or he's doing this or doing that and like he flew in they freakin private jetted him into the all-in deal and didn't even know I don't like to know I want to be surprised and they shot this angle with Kenny Omega who's one of the like premier superstars in our business right now and they did him in Jericho at 47 sold-out the Tokyo didn't own 47,000 people in January his match these wrestled for the entrances everything were 48 minutes they wrestled for 37 minutes he's 47 well he jumped on a plane while he's touring they flew him in he put a mask on you thought it was one guy he pulls the mask off after he drops Omega and bought a boom it's Jericho the place goes batshit crazy and gets out grabs his deal hops on a plane and flies where he supposed to play at 12 o'clock that night that's Jericho no and the other guys Batista so Batista yo between galaxies rap I mean there's four guys that are like red hot as actors and they're all the boys he's fantastic and guardians of the galaxy so good at being like self-deprecating dorky I mean he plays like a goof so well and he's such a cool dude man Tony and stuff was here right now he would be jizz news now what's what's interesting is that this group I mean Hulk Hogan was probably one of the first big guys to transcend in the movie yes right yes but he got turned off by Hollywood yeah apparently he got a couple of dick grabbers I don't know the real story of all the guys that I know like I I'm super supportive of Hulk because he was super supportive of me it's a great guy oh man you know and and he right now you know he's doing he finally got back and they finally brought him back in and WWE which I was super excited about because to me going in the whole thing without Hulk being in there it's kind of like a video of me interviewing Hulk Hogan for Spike TV I got a chance to interview him for Spike TV back in the day when he was spy TV went into the wrestling business sure little bit sure sure I was before I help that I helped them do that cuz I was one of the names at but yeah it's Russell so for me as a kid I mean I was a giant fan of Jimmy Superfly Snuka and Bob Backlund when I was in high school right early 80s and Hulk Hogan's so for me to get a chance to interview Hulk Hogan it was sports and entertainment huge personality the one and only these guys are going to war out here it's unbelievable now you finish something I made fights before are you a you a UFC Fan oh I'm a huge fan brother Cheryl now I understand that you have recently announced a partnership with TNA Wrestling and its president Dixie Carter and you're gonna be moving to Spike TV we're gonna see some Hulkamania on Spike TV tell us more about that well you know brother tonight I got a ton of energy and our partners with Spike I'm part of Dixie Carter I'm partners with TNA and we just got the Green right brother On January 4th take the impact we're going wide open we're going ahead on head we're going to battle WWE Monday Night which a new era for Hall coated in TNA we're coming after everybody we're coming out for everybody now I understand that you have you recently released a book you've done a wrestling tour in Australia when are we gonna see Hulk Hogan wrestle in TNA I'm going January 4 fuck I said Monday night we're going to war TNA impact but you never know I'm going over there to take over the maniacs are coming all the TNA stars gonna be there and you never know when the old man with the yellow boots might just step in that ring brother Hulk Hogan is coming back ladies and gentlemen TNA Wrestling live on Spike TV hugs here for the fights gonna do brother in the UFC runs wild on you what are you gonna do that's a good question you had a jidoka would spot brother Luke in there I was so happy you ever met Jean Oakland now oh yeah what a nice guys on the planet but the Hulk I mean when I got to do my stuff with him because we not only did the Malone stuff y'all would mean Rock mean mean Malone against Rodman and Hogan but the next month they come in and because we shot that angle on The Tonight Show and the next month they go in Hogan and Bischoff and they run Jay off the set I come in from the wings that Hulk on his ass and it's me and Jay Leno oh that is so funny Jay Leno was holding the Hulk down this is so ridiculous oh god it was but you know it was so much fun good I tell you you know what oh yeah another guy I mean he came and worked out with us and he didn't didn't spend as much time like Malone day because Malone's like a super athlete but Jay works out at all no turns wrenches well gotta learn yeah gotta learn how to move around a little bit and yeah we just work trying in and Hulk was never that guy to lay stuff out like today a lot of this stuff is laid out you know back then it was like you called as you go and write and so I was a guy who actually did that I could lay everything out and that's how I like to know where we're going and I'm still going talking the whole time you know but you know bottom line is uh you know Jake just working him through it and it was a lot of fun well when Hulk Hogan was in Rocky 3 I mean that was you that was fucking fantastic and then you you also got to see how goddamn big he is when he picks sly up by his neck right like holy shit and then you know when they go through the whole thing went after it you know Hulk is like smiling and laugh with them and so ok you know all right like oh you little rough out there what it is brother one of the greatest moments I were young that was great moment in films awesome I mean it was that was a big moment in film 2 for a lot of people that thought like pro wrestling is fake right it's like well ain't nothing fake about that I mean it's entertainment but if you don't think that's fuckin difficult to do like look at the size dance she's looking like a million bucks there look fantastic he was like it was just super good to me and when he picks him up over his head is there a video of this see if he could find video of it because when paulie's going crazy and he's having a heart attack I love that oh my god that was a great fucking scene you know I love about slide he's a perfect example everybody counting him out and he's fucking stronger than ever again you know he's a good we're gonna move around a little bit come on I'll hit you a little bit a little bit of this oka mania music there that was snug well Salop Stallone was so slim and trim back right it's kind of hilarious that he was playing a heavyweight champion because he's not a big guy no he really is more like a middleweight but Hogan was I mean he wouldn't even be able to end back in these days wouldn't be able to make the UFC's weight limit the UFC has a 265 pound cut off for whatever reason really yeah there's there's no super heavyweight division in mmm oh yeah there was a super heavyweight division it's possible but the UFC's never implemented it so it's been sanctioned there's a 265 and above but the UFC's heavyweight division has a cut-off right and a bunch of guys a vet whay Brock's a big exam surely Brock had a cut weight to make 265 Francis and gah no Tim Sylvia a few guys have had to actually cut wait mark hunt caught wait to make 265 work marks about walking around as if we're drunk and tank absolutely no but I love about sly like you know you go back to a lot of people don't know that story I'm sure you do you know how he wrote that script a rocky would not sell it and you get off on it like Ryan O'Neal to play rock here's someone called Paul Newman I forget who it was I feel like it was Ryan O'Neal they wanted Ryan O'Neal to play rocky and he held out he's like no I fucking wrote this this is me your vehicle and yeah that's it that's the greatest example of being positively unstoppable and owning it like so that's just alone you know get written this book or has a hundred thousand times and when you know like he's he's one of my mentors without me knowing him you know because I've just watched how he lived his life and he he's you know recreated himself so many times and that's what I'm constantly trying to do crazies of the guys doing the Expendables as a fucking action star he's in his 7 d crazy the fuck in their 70s is believable in an actual role this is guys've like beat people up in movies like suspension of disbelief I'll let it slide right right but when you see him doing it you like I kind of believe it I believe it's still jacked at 70 72 I think 73 years old whatever the fuck he is I mean is he now 72 years old that's fucking insane let me give you a behind the scenes from Stone Cold Steve Austin he was like he's a brother to me like a real one Mike Murphy we lived together we rode together one of my best friends and he's doing the first Expendables and he's doing you know he's we talked about I guess he's on the set for about you know a couple of weeks by this time and he says I'll tell you what day and you remember every top alpha dog is in that first movie because he grabbed the you know the heavies of the heavy the guys were the biggest names and Austin said in a world of alpha dogs there is one number one guy and his name is Sylvester Stallone and he said when he were doing the Hollywood fight in the back Stallone was like come on bring it like meant it he broke his fucking right have you seen his neck but no they did an x-ray of his neck he's got these fucking screws keeping his spine together in his neck he showed it out it was the dinar Blanco or Letterman but he was on and they showed an x-ray of his neck he broke his fucking neck doing that movie because he is 68 at the time 69 and he's getting thrown into a wall right and telling Austin I was a tough son of a bitch I ain't just wring it ya want it to be real I mean he is mean look he got knocked out by Antonio Carver Antonio Tarver in one of those Rocky movies right right I mean I think he was deep into his 60s and he got fucking knocked out there doing the boxing scenes were they going over things and Tarver cracked him I would kill to do a workout with him and show him cuz he oh no one works out harder than his neck so fucking fused together that weights the bionic man look at that that's fucking crazy so he's getting three discs fused together he might be the toughest guy pound-for-pound age for a July this is him for months oh my god who was the other guy they take your sunglass off probably look out jack Diaz 72 I love the guy man I mean you know I want to feel good just sit down and watch a rocky movie he's a super nice guy and like real like self-deprecating loose laugh doesn't take himself seriously at all no ego just joking around easy like somebody heckled out he's like he's a you mom real real nice guy too yeah but listen man I don't know what else we could talk about but I think what you're doing is fucking awesome I'm super pumped that we finally got together I would love to do a workout with you for sure absolutely and what about what about tomorrow what tomorrow I'm here I'm leaving on I'm leaving on Thursday afternoon so I have let's figure this out after the one thing I want to do about this let me
