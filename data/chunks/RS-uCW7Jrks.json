five four three two of what happened Jamie went three dozen how are you what's going on doing good how you doing good welcome thank you for having me thanks for coming on you you wrote an article and I tweet let me tell you about my practic tourney um I had a podcast that I did with my friend Steve Rinella a few weeks back and he has a brother that has a herniated disc real bad and he's got a atrophy in one of his arms he's got a push nerve and you know the whole thing bulging discs not good yeah and we got talking and I said look that guy's got to do something about it right away because the more time you spend with an atrophied arm the longer it takes to rehabilitate then it's a pretty common injury with martial artists yeah there's something get get yourself to a physical therapist yeah right away and get an MRI and then spinal decompression the whole deal absolutely so he goes what do you think about chiropractors and I go so I say I think chiropractors are bullshit and then he goes really I goes yeah I go I've just had bad experiences with it and then I've read some things about it being bullshit and then I got home after the podcast I smoked joint and a lot of times when I smoke I feel bad about some of the things that I've said I rarely do do you it's I I smoke more than the average scientist that my boyfriend is director of R&D at a pot lab oh yeah there's science there there is some pot kicking around on a regular basis well we get it free from a bunch of people I have to tell people it shows a no disrespect to people that offer to me I'm like please don't give me any pot I can't take your pot I have too much pot it's okay we have a similar problem yeah um so anyway I smoked the pot and then I go God maybe I'm a dick maybe I was rude Saint cuz I know people that are chiropractors and I know they're nice people and I know they mean well and I'm like maybe I'm a dick I think that's accurate I think I mean well some of them sure yeah I think they're wrong but they mean well so um I go maybe I was being a dick so then I google chiropractic and then I started reading and I spend hours and hours reading about the history of cut I'm gonna say this in air big air quotes chiropractic medicine holy fucking shit not only do I not feel bad now now I'm angry about at all it and this is to all you people and I've got a ton of messages from chiropractors that I'm sure nice folks and then I'm really upset because they like this podcast and they're like you know you're shitting on my business and you said you have to understand I it's I'm sure a lot of you would mean well I'm sure a lot of you do well I'm sure a lot of you try really hard to help your patients and I'm sure a lot of you incorporate a lot of other stuff like massage cold laser and real science into your therapies but the original the original guy who created chiropractic medicine was a complete total bullshit artist fucking whack this guy right here this this character Daniel David Palmer so you started as a magnetic healer in Davenport Iowa I mean the whole thing is a hundred percent horseshit and I mean we this article that we wrote we sent this through I mean normally my articles I go through at least you know to editors give or take this one we put through I believe three editors a fact-checker and our lawyer to make sure that we were bulletproof on it cuz we wanted to make sure that we you know that that we didn't say anything that could get a sued basically and a lot of the information from this came directly from his book from his own book so we weren't taking anything out of context one of the quotes on how chiropractic started came directly from the book and he after after cracking a half deaf person's or a deaf person Jamie just had holed up in that article you could see that he claimed that he cracked a deaf person's back and restored his healing or his hearing now a couple of things could have happened here either one there was no actual medical consent given because this person was deaf so I'm not sure how how that came about - he didn't actually restore the hearing because there are no nerves in the spine connected to your hearing or you know three this guy is just lying like there's there couple you know and we're not sure what happened but he liked their still and you know chiropractic could have done a few things with this they could have disavowed what happened and said you know we still have a system by which we can really try to relieve pain through spinal manipulation but no there are still articles out today from chiropractors today that try to claim that yes indeed he did restore hearing because I was like no could you guys just maybe back down on some of the none of your claims because there there is some some minor evidence that you can relieve back pain a lower back pain with spinal manipulation and there are there are Cairo's that are trying to be science-based with this but the history of it is so ridiculous and they try to back down on nothing and that's not how science works science works with the newest evidence and it tries to figure out what's real and what's not and they try to double down on all the craziest stuff and I think there are Cairo's that are trying to fix the field maybe and say you know spinal manipulation can help with back pain but that's not what this claims it claims that you can fix everything in the body through these vertebral subluxations that have never been shown what is a subluxation right so there are a couple there's there are two terms being used here and chiropractic uses it incorrectly and in medicine we use it correctly so a subluxation the the actual medical term means that a joint pops out halfway so that you have a dislocation which is a complete you know separation of a joint basically and a subluxation is a partial dislocation I know because they happen to my shoulder they're they're a fun party trick I'll spare you but a subluxation in the chiropractic sense they use this medical term kind of incorrectly they say that your spine can be somewhat out of joint basically and it causes all your health problems like your pancreas is malfunctioning because your spine is out of alignment and it's that's never been proven to happen and they claim that they can put you into a state of health by massaging your back and this is what's important about this this was created out of thin air by a guy who was a quack the origin is not based on years and years of medical research none of this all of this came from the 1800s from a guy who was completely full of shit yep and he was he was a magnetic healer now Natick healing like you can still see at the store these little like knee braces that have magnets and it guys save your money just get a regular old knee brace if you feel any any relief from one of those magnetic braces it's just from the brace it's not the fucking match yeah exactly placebo effects are I mean the placebo effect is a real thing you didn't get some relief from that but don't pop which may also account for some of the pain relief from chiropractic medicine absolutely I mean they're doing exactly like they're they're doing some massage along with what they're doing and some of it's a problem because massage actually helps yep and there there are studies that show people who go to a massage therapist or a massage practitioner tend to get more relief than people who go to to a chiropractor so please go to a massage therapist go to a to a physical therapist those are those are your science-based practitioners chiropractic it started out of bullshit and it stayed directly in bullshit here's a thing it's like there's no reason that anybody would have from this guy from this one original guy who created it this guy who's a magnetic healer who came up with this somehow or another it slipped through the cracks yeah that's what this is I mean when they're running around calling themselves doctors like this guy said to me one of these guys who got angry at me I've gotten late least does two dozen maybe angry messages well factors but one of them the guy said does the podiatrist go to medical school well the fuck you they go to podiatry school not only that they take they have a medical residency yeah they have to do for three years they did they actually go to a hospital yes it's a work in a hospital yeah and podiatry is like an actual science yes I'm studying foot and some of them are I could be wrong on this someone go ahead and please fact check me I believe some of them are podiatric surgeons like they have to know all the anatomy of the feet in order to treat actual foot conditions they are like these are part of the medical system chiropractic works kind of separately and on theories that that have never been proven to work they can't even do imaging like half I believe something like half of chiropractic clinics don't even have x-rays so how can they show you 100% for sure that what they're claiming is happening in your back isn't happening and I read I mean these are cities that I found straight from chiropractic websites from their organizations and I have this referenced in the article I just am blanking on which place had this one of the chiropractic boards that does large-scale surveys you know within chiropractic about half know there were a lot of places a lot of people I'm sure said to you but my chiropractor is good my chiropractor doesn't do the bullshit stuff and a lot of my friends said that too they said no they just cracked my back they don't try to sell me any bullshit supplements about half of chiropractors do the bullshit stuff they do the extra the extraneous wellness stuff so when if you have a 50 if you're playing Russian roulette and you have a 50% chance of getting a bullshit or getting a bullet are you gonna do that no like that's I don't want a 50% chance of having a bullshit doctor who's like well maybe your colds really a German you know maybe it's a bola I don't want the bullshit doctor I want the guy who knows what he's talking about and this is what you're getting with chiropractic you're getting a bullshit doctor and it's even if he's not a doctor yeah he's part of the problem is they call themselves doc have you seen oh yeah this year checking in on this they don't go to medical school it's they go to they go to chiropractic schools now one of the biggest chiropractic schools in the country is Palmer Chiropractic College and it's named for a de Paume or the guy who launched launched this bevy of bullshit on us and he ain't after that guy named after the guy who claimed to heal a deaf guy and it's one of one of my no this is crazy so at work there's gonna be a fun story by fun I mean horrifying one of the guys I went to undergrad with went to Palmer Chiropractic College now the acceptance rate a hundred percent tuition thirty four thousand dollars a year to learn how to crack baby spines now the guy I went to college well you say baby some people do some some do no it is a growing field in chiropractic this one guy said this hilarious he said you're saying they crack baby spines it's a gentle manipulation like why yeah exact here's the thing why why the fuck are you manipulating big there's no evidence whatsoever does that helps baby this is the babies aren't complaining about back pain ya know here's here are the two things I've heard one is is that it's so gentle it wouldn't even bruise a tomato's skin then why are you doing it why no the other thing they say is bullshit yeah it's because they can parents that's right the other thing they say is well from doing that you because and this is this hmm this infuriates me so much they say from manipulating the spine because the spine has you know in within those bones they have the spinal column and the nerves control everything in the body and so from from simulate stimulating the nerves you can give the infant all the immunity it needs to not need their vaccinations and that's when I get really oh yeah they claim this shit on their who's who's client you got to say be real specific he is claiming that by manipulating a baby they don't need vaccines it's the this is now this is I understand this is not all chiropractors but the American Chiropractic Association this is fairly well cited within the article the American Chiropractic Association they are generally anti-drug they want to use the least amount of enter into medical interventions possible and chiropractors are not in most states in this country they are not cleared to either prescribe or give vaccinations so if you can manage to get a family to come in to you for pretty much all of their medical needs that increases your bottom line and it stops you know and you're gonna say we can do everything for you of course a chiropractor isn't cleared for vaccination of course you know they don't give vaccinations and I mean one of there's one state in this country I believe it was Wisconsin where they were trying to get chiropractors to be able to give pre sports physicals and in in some cases the pre sports physical is the only time all year when a student will see a doctor so this is this is infuriating so like whatever a doctor and I mean this is like you can look at the ACS website there is a put a couple links to it in the article where they say you know they're they're not very probe acts and I mean their language on it is under the condition of met freedom of choice medical choice and it's like they don't say straight-out vaccines don't work they're bad for you but they're kind of they're wishy-washy on it and they're not they don't say vaccines work and you should get them but a couple of chiropractors will try to say we don't need vaccines we can increase your immune system we can increase your immunity by you know pressing our spine there's zero evidence zero evidence and I'm like do me a favor tell me which spine which part of the spine you press on to give a child immunity to measles and polio give me tell me the titers test that child's titers to show me that there are immune to polio now from you touching their goddamn spine maybe I it's like how about this how about I'll punch you in the but I'm not gonna punch a chiropractor how about I just you know not just give you a few little like mmm till a little pokes in the back and then you're gonna be immune to smallpox just just let me know how that works but I can't I can't get behind a system that has no evidence and tells me it's gonna make children immune to deadly diseases here's the real question how did it get this far like how how did this guy who's a magnetic healer who had no background in medicine come up with this system and then have it spread all over the world it's such a good story isn't it people love a story that says that you can heal them without without taking dangerous drugs and at the time well forget about medicines drugs wasn't even just just helping you with anything it's really it's partially because of when it came up because we only found out 50 years after this that that frontal lobotomies were a bad fucking idea and that thalidomide was gonna kill babies so we were we were really fuckin bad at medicine when this came up and we're I mean we're way better at it now but we still don't have the answers to everything and that's kind of I don't want to say a failure of the medical system but it's just a sign of where we are now so think about the number of people who have sent us anecdotes saying you know I was in miserable pain and my chiropractor was the only thing that worked and it's like maybe you needed to get a you know get to physical therapy for longer-term pain but these people that are still going to their Cairo's it means they're still in pain and they should go to a physical therapist for you know a couple months of therapy that will eventually strengthen their backs and take care of those issues and you know get a massage but they're going to their cairo because medical has not said you know we don't have a tricorder that can scan you show the exact thing and say here's the exact medicine drug and thing that will fix you it's kind of and I hate to use this term but it's out of the failures of the medical system that something like this has shown up so we're not perfect at medicine yet and that's why alternative medicine swoops in with bullshit well it's just a matter of innovation it's like there's a certain level that medical community is that right now it's pretty staggering what they're capable of but it's still growing and learning and we're in a constant state of progress but what's shocking to me is how far this medical heal or magnetic healers Kwak idea God yeah I just thought it was based on something I mean I really did I've been going to a chiropractor for years or different chiropractors for years it's and one of them was like this guy used to go to on Hollywood 140 bucks literally he would take care of you for like ten minutes he would rub your back a little bit and massage a little bit and then he would grab it and then go we got it we got it oh and I'd be like okay and I would think all right man maybe I'll start feeling better now I've got a foam roller for 20 bucks that I can lunge it'll crack your back really well so well yeah it's just it's just stunning to me that insurance companies pay for it and that it's been around so long that happen how our insurance companies paying there was some lobbying and I don't think I put this into the article but there was a lot of lobbying from chiropractors in I believe the 70s that pushed the American Medical Association and and the insurance companies as a whole to kind of accept them as being medically a part of the system and that that's part of why more and more insurance companies now it will cover them and accept them and even though like most doctors won't like a lot of doctors won't refer you they'll kind of be like well you can look into Cairo like there's there's still from a lot of doctors pushback but there's a little bit more coverage now just because of a lot of lobbying in the 70s now if chiropractors do have a center or a treatment center or whatever it is and they have a bunch of different methods that they employ this is not saying that those other methods might not give you some relief correct the actual cracking of the necks and the cracking of the back there's virtually no evidence that that heals anything or stops and he you know promotes your immune system functioning better or anything like that on all these things that that's based on it's precisely like the big thing is that I mean they're if they were just claiming we can reduce your back pain if that was the only thing they claimed I probably wouldn't have written the article you know but what they're claiming is that they can fix all of your health by realigning these vertebral subluxations which have never been proven to exist so like what are they doing when when your back pops what is actually happening it's like there's nitrogen being released or something I think it's just moving around air bubbles like I mean tiny little bits of bubbles and yeah they are like there I don't think realigning is the right word but you know they're they're doing they're moving around your back in a way that it kind of naturally moves because you can kind of move and twist and your back will pop but look they're doing some manipulation of things that kind of naturally happen to to a spine with you know with a tiny little bit I mean tiny bit of degeneration with age I think like I'm not exactly the right expert to explain this type of thing an osteopath would be a better person to explain this because there's there are people who are a little better at spinal manipulation than a chiropractor which is a do an osteopath so in this country we have MDS and dio's and they both can practice medicine do stone dr. Voss Doctor of Osteopathy I believe that's the correct term and my doctor is actually my primary care is an osteopath and he's given me a spinal manipulation once while my back was killing me and we had no idea what it was it turned out I had a broken rib which was not a good time to do a spinal manipulation got a rib broken right on your spine but it was like he the difference is an osteopath never claims that they're there cracking your back just right angry yeah exactly they're they're giving you they're giving you your vaccines they're doing you know they're going wow there's something wrong with your with your ovary we're gonna send you to a gynecologist like there they're doing all the things the doctors should do for your health and if your back is in pain they'll say do you want to try in a manipulation they're not pushing that that's a part of their care and they try to do science-based you know manipulations for the potential help of of back relief but they don't you know they don't want to do that long-term they do it minimally at least that's been my experience with it and it seems to be like it there still seems to be I'd say at best weekend stat it helps with with back pain well the problem is they usually do it with other things it also been shown to help with back pain yes like I said and also just any time yes rest ice anti-inflammatory looking at all these different factors and well I went to a chiropractor and he helped me did he sure yeah and I make I I think that it's I think it's funny the things that chiropractors add into it because like one of the things that I went into in this in this article because we we we really like diving deep on some of the things that we investigate and it's like I try like I'll admit I'm biased when I go in I cuz I go after a lot of kind of some of the naturally things and I'm not I'm not anti natural like I I'm not a hundred percent against homeopathic we can we can go into some of its real right like garlic really is good for infection there's some stuff that's a jitter I look good for your heart ginger I like when I have a stomach ache I'll go for ginger before I go first remedies at work it's there there are some herbal remedies that I'm like absolutely keeping your in your cabinet I'm not against them but I'm against people taking things without evidence and I think that's the thing like try try absolutely to look for the hard evidence before you waste your money and I think that's the thing that people have fallen into because they'll say oh it's natural it's better it's like is it cause polio is natural and I don't think it's very good for you like but I know I know that's a straw man fully aware of it but I also think that people should should ask for evidence and you never mind ask for it to manned it before you give somebody your money and that's what people haven't done with chiropractors and that is a very good point and it's you know I I think people deserve evidence and that's and I think that's something that hasn't been out in the public sphere like there was a an article I was trying to write a while ago I forget the exact topic but one of my editors you know was sending it back to me credit she's like I've read this she her comment back was well I've been reading this a lot online a lot of people have been saying this I'm like a lot of people have been saying is not evidence that's the exact opposite of it like I'm like here I put in the peer-reviewed data on this lazy editor I didn't work with her again but she was a lot of people been saying yes that that's not the enemy this is this is why I like the editors I'm working with now quite a bit the problem with this whole clinic thing though is that they don't have to have any sort of background in Kies kinesiology or in physical therapy or any of these things and so they incorporate all these other modalities all these other methods of healing you but they don't have to have a background in education in those things and they're calling themselves a doctor there is there is one thing I've heard of and this isn't this is why I'd say don't go to a chiropractor because we don't know you don't know what you're gonna walk into but I have heard a couple of cases of times this being the case where a chiropractor at first they go to school for physical therapy and then they find they can't open their own clinic even if they've got like an MBA and a physical therapy background they're like how do I open my own clinic and they realize if they just go to school for chiropractic they can do the physical therapy work they want to and offer a spinal manipulation on the side now how long does it take to get a degree in chiropractic doctor 3 4 years like it's I mean it's a lot of school but think about any learn I had a cracked spines everything that's created by a guy who's a quack what the fuck could they possibly be teaching you for 4 years I do they do learn some anatomy but it's like they also learned some you know bullshit along with it so I'm like I wonder and I mean this isn't I get it this isn't all chiropractors obviously but like I know the and it's hard to figure out which one you're gonna walk into that's gonna be a bullshit artist and not so like I I did want it like this isn't this wasn't the point I was going to bring up an article that was gonna have a specific point of view but like I know there are some out there that say I you know I want to give people physical therapy I want to strengthen up their spine I want to get them out of here in less pain so that if they injure themselves again they know they can come back to me and trust me with their spine and also give them some relief while we're fixing them so you know this is a thing that happens but I don't think it's all the time it's my mean it's clearly not all the time so you know you're gonna have some really moral people in every field and you're gonna have some really fucked up once in every field like we were one of the things we touched on in the article were these very social media savvy people and this is something that drives me fucking crazy you have to hunt and peck through their websites to find that they say that there are chiropractor they just say doctor everywhere doctor and they're giving their giving recipe ideas and they're giving and they're talking about the adrenal glands and the adrenal glands they're not anywhere near close to the spine and this is a thing that they're talking about I'm like the adrenal glands are their partner they talking about manipulating the spine to help the adrenaline they're talking about one of the things they talk about a lot is adrenal fatigue syndrome which has never been proven to be a thing it's not recognized as a as a disorder anywhere within the medical care system now you can have a couple different disorders of the adrenal gland you have Cushing's syndrome like there are a couple different things that can go wrong with your adrenal Vence their little glands that sit on top of the kidneys but this is I mean the specialty I believe a holistic and having a blonde moment on the words but like there's or on the subspecialty but the specialty for which you're gonna study the adrenal glands isn't even a specialty that chiropractic has so it's like if you want to know about your if you're having issues that like it's like the the things that chiropractors seem to harp on right now are a lot with immunology or a lot with it's sorry just having a complete bla moment on this but there are there are specialties that chiropractors seem to harp on a lot lately and it seems to be the type of things that are very nebulous and very hard to to nail down when someone's having an issue with it and these are these are things that chiropractors just don't have the training in so essentially someone's putting up a health website and they're claiming to be a doctor and they're offering all this advice on diet and all these things but when you get to what is their degree in they don't it's not a real doctor it's a chiropractor and it's and they're basically all they're the type of advice they're giving is take all these herbs eat you know even alkaline diet which is again bullshit it's there's one of my favorite things with the alkaline diet is they're always like drink lemon water I'm like that's acidic which I might know from my chemistry degree yeah what is the premise of this alkaline diet because I remember people were pushing that a while back they were saying that you could cure cancer and shit and just by having a diet that's alkaline instead of acidic I was like why which is I mean and that's the premise of it but it's they here's the thing your your body's pH is really tightly controlled like your blood is between I think seven point three five and seven point five five different organ systems have a fairly tightly controlled pH your urine can vary a little bit depending on what you've consumed but there's you know there's a tightly controlled pH within your body if you suddenly go you know if suddenly you have a pH of 10 which is you know fairly alkaline you're there your friends are your friends are gonna miss you at your funeral hopefully so that that's what I got on that but like so you have a high pH you dead yeah I mean if you're suddenly because you know that's a that's an alkaline pH if you're suddenly really really alkaline we're gonna miss you that's what would cause someone to be that alcohol how drinking a bunch of lye I don't know why don't do you I mean you're like there's something really wrong with your ability to filter things out of your body if you're suddenly a like that's just it's just not a thing that happens to a healthy human if you're all of a sudden really alkaline but this diet won't do it especially when the things that they're recommending are like lemons like and one of the things they say is oh well your body takes that acidic fruit and turns it alkaline I'm like go to one more where the government coming up with this stuff like this is just nonsense that someone's just repeating online and yeah and the things I say like a the the diet they've designed is a fairly low calorie diet like it'll make you lose weight but it's not gonna make you go alkaline and it's not gonna fucking fight cancer like it's anything the reduction and calories are probably good some body fat we have less inflammation and it's like yeah it's there are there have been shown to be you know links between lower lower body fat and lower incidences of cancer which is you know that's a good thing losing weight if you're if you're overweight and you're having medical problems from it overall good thing but there's no shown link between in between this specific diet and a lower incidence of cancer or any other disorders but it's just like it's a fad it's just one of I remember when people were wearing those Holograms attached to a rubber band around their wrists and do you member these stupid fucking things do you remember him Jamie you remember him right something when a focaccia was got in trouble for selling him on her right well oh no offense quick its but I might have I might have said some mean things about Ben a couple of things about her lately in her fucking nutty website she takes she's supposed to wear like a rock inside your vagina I call them pussy rocks yes pussy rocks are hilarious oh I guess it would like strengthen you its if you want to strengthen it just to kegels around a dick that's my that's that's my method rocks a good way to go Gweneth Paltrow wants to heal you with magic stickers Jesus Christ babies she knew she's getting paid though tell you that there's a lot of dummies out there they're sock nomming all the way she's ATM machine she is proof that bullshit sells way better than science I'm I do not have her her salary oh wait a minute I could rebalance the energy frequency I didn't know that hold on a second she's discovered something about stickers do you take these stickers and if they're made with the right material you just stick them on your body in the right places and they in quotes rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies yes a space suit material and NASA said it was a load of BS but hold on a second I don't think that NASA is right in a bunch of movies it says Gwyneth Paltrow's goop website a lifestyle business lifestyle which sells all things with advertised these stickers are using NASA spacesuit material which presumably was the source of their magic healing properties jesus fucking christ she's special the stickers are not made this is what NASA says they're not made of spacesuit material not that spacesuit material has healing properties in the first place it doesn't but the quote from the former NASA scientist mark Scholl shell hem shallow shell Homer Chalmer shomer sums it up heals Wow what a load of BS this is or that yeah okay shoes obviously GUP quickly updated its site now it doesn't claim anything about NASA spacesuits and stickers but it didn't dial back any of the magical healing claims here's what goop says now in an article called wearable stickers that promote healing in parentheses really you fuck human bodies operate an ideal energetic frequency but every day stress is an anxiety you give me stress you bitch you can throw off our internal balance depleting our energy reserves and weakening our immune system I'm fucking imagine thinking that you could put a sticker on you and it's gonna heal you body vibe stickers oh my god they're called body vibes come in pre-pro they come pre-programmed I'll fuck their programming to an ideal frequency allowing them to target imbalances you motherfucker you fucking crook don't you have enough money bitch right apparently the the residuals on the Iron Man movies just weren't enough for her god damn 60 bucks for a 10 pack holy shit 10 stickers for 60 bucks it's oh my god I am in the wrong industry apparently I need to start selling some fancy motherfuckin stickers no you don't okay look this is a very this is a very controversial subject right like anything that's not regulated by the FDA like I I'm a part of an interest of full disclosure a part of the company on it which is uh we sell supplements but the supplements that we sell we control everything that we sell so we make sure that we do testing on it the supplements that we sell like this shit alpha brain did do two double-blind placebo-controlled studies at Boston Center for memory this showed increase in verbal memory increase in there's a bunch of different things what was the other one there was a reaction time but this is a whole there's actual scientific studies on nootropics they've been around for a long time nice about them just because like I've I haven't looked into them enough and I'm I know they're kind of their new ish you know into the supplement market so like I kind of want to look into them and I don't know enough to comment there is essentially the building blocks for human neurotransmitters what your body uses the nutrients your body uses to make human transmittance there's nothing we will about it nothing crazy it's all backed by science but when we started putting him out there was a lot of people that were claiming bullshit you're selling snake oil so we had to control these studies and we had to you know pay for them at the Boston Center for memory and put we also had to make sure that we put a full 100% money-back guarantee on any supplements where you don't have to return them just say they didn't work for you we're trying to like make it as clean as possible this is stuff that I use I find benefit in it let's see you know like what people think about it and let's make sure that we have studies but when you sell things like scissors like there's no fucking Studies on stickers and what if al Thoreau said like when she was on Kimmel a few weeks ago and he was like so how does it work eventually just came out and said I don't know how any of this shit works it's like yeah because you're selling rocks for your policy does she have somebody else that doesn't maybe and they're just unscrupulous and no she's a part of she's she's a CEO and she's apparently in all the meetings but she's just busy reading it's reading scripts and shit look at this one look at this anti-anxiety unicorn skin at the beach beauty sleep wait a minute one of each vibe one of the vibes is at the beach chill July that's what the pre-programmed chilled for for self-love one of them is chilled for unicorn skin if it's a result love I demand an orgasm within three minutes I don't think it works that way I yeah I don't feel good about yourself doesn't Gaelic rock rocked out puts it but these things are like you know it's really weird it's like I'm not a big fan of the government stepping in and you know regulating everything because I know there's a lot of supplements that actually do work and for them to be to get passed by the FDA you have to go through these exhaustive testing hundreds of thousands of dollars it's a huge thing it takes a long time I mean here's thing I think that like the reason I'm a fan of at least some amount of government regulation on supplements is to stop unscary unscrupulous claims because especially with some of the supplement industry they there are claims that these are that there are certain things on or sorry in a package and after you know some independent testing you'll find that some of the some packages don't have what they claim in there like you know some it was something like a third of supplement package just didn't have any of the ingredients and there or they had less of it and then like that not that's not good for the consumer so I wish there was a way to regulate it a little bit better at least I just don't think it should be the government I think there should be like some sort of an independent company that works in a very scientific way where you know you can hire them to test your stuff and run these tests where you can show there's got to be some way to show that there's no collusion that there's no bribery that you know everything's aboveboard but I don't know what the fuck that would be I don't know how that would be I'm not sure how it would work with I mean it's like I know the FDA has issues I know that drug approval definitely has issues like there have been drugs that have been passed that have had issues but it was a sell fentanyl that's all you need to know they sell oxycontin and fentanyl and people are prescribing shit that takes forever for people to get off and has a massive addiction rates it's things like fentanyl have some some very limited purposes like I've been put on fentanyl for pre-surgery before just you sort of know well they put you on it just to put you out let's get this check hi I was I I remember about 30 seconds and I was told I threw up while I was under and I don't remember yeah I now I know that I can't have fentanyl but it's that was they just put you on to put you out but that's like that's one of very few ethical applications of fentanyl and I mean it depends on like and I did my master's thesis on prescription opiate abuse trends and toxicology so this is a sir this is a speaker that I know pretty well but this is that's kind of one of the things with painkillers is that there's there are ethical prescribing practice with it there are ethical ways to manage patient use of it and then there are really horribly unethical ways that it can be prescribed and managed over time and this is this is something that the FDA hasn't managed well this is something that a lot of doctors haven't managed well and it's like we I mean we started this when we were when they were like let's go on a marketing campaign for oxycontin and it just kept getting worse from there it was like there's there has to be a better way to manage what we're doing right now with it and it's not being done yet so yeah obviously this has nothing to do with Gwyneth Paltrow or coop but I just think that they're some sort of an independent company or some sort of an in I mean not e unless I keep saying business but there's so many problems with doing that and there's also problems with having the government do it I just don't think they've been adequate so far and the FDA stepping in and regulating all vitamins and and making you know they wanted to do that for a while they wanted to call them nutraceuticals they wanted to to have prescriptions for vitamins and things along those lines but the problem with that is I don't have to go to the doctor to get multivitamins but I do want to make sure that the multivitamins that I get are pure are safe yeah or no just safe but that what you're looking for you're looking for b12 I want to make sure I'm getting b12 the other question is how much of a vitamin do you need and I think that people you know buy vitamins indiscriminately because we really don't like the average person doesn't need to take a multivitamin in the day if they're eating you know a healthy diet because you get pretty much what you need on a daily basis if you're not somebody with an absorption issue if you're not somebody with any like any dietary issues you're generally getting what you need out of your diet I think people don't if your diet is really healthy it's but most people do not have a really healthy diet well most people are getting about what they need out of their diet like most people seriously in America yes I mean if you're we have this one the poorest diets where people are just eating processed bullshit well no it's even if you go to the doctor and get the average person I'm guessing you eat fairly healthy yeah it's but the average person that they go to the doctor to see if they're deficient on everything on anything they're not going to be deficient I've been deficient I've gone and gotten my blood work done several times deficiencies in niacin deficiencies and vitamin D no i-i've been before but that was right when I was diagnosed with celiac disease so I was i I was deficient on a few things but you know that's that's an issue with wheat and you have an issue absorbing food yeah so I mean now well now that I've been hits it was I was at the skinniest point in my life and then I stopped eating wheat and I gained weight so cuz suddenly your your I kind of you know they they heal and you're able to absorb calories you have a friend who's got a son who they was trying to figure out why he was so small just he couldn't eat and he was never hungry and he was eating everything is miserable and we he's got a wheat allergy he's got a corn allergy Jesus yeah everything was just making him miserable it's I mean I got quote-unquote lucky I only got symptoms when I was an adult and it was you know it's so you ain't wheat all throughout your childhood years no problem no problem and I mean I was even overweight as a kid so then when I was an adult suddenly the horrible symptoms showed up just how does that work do they have an idea see you can show up or the symptoms of it like you always have the underlying physiology or and just all of a sudden symptoms can just show up so it's like lying dormant and then all sudden he comes out I mean I kind of I had a bunch of health issues kind of show up in my 20s and I mean I started I'm like alright I got to start taking care of myself started going to the gym ran a few marathons lost a lot of weight and like even when I was suddenly at a healthy weight it was like I couldn't stop losing weight because my my intestines just weren't absorbing anything and that's not a that's not a thing you see coming or like I'm not a healthy why isn't this stopping and it was was not good but you know eventually it was funny because the gluten trend or the anti gluten trend had already shown up and a doctor suggested to me well have you tried going gluten-free and I'm like oh that's a silly fad three months later types of celiac disease I'm like if I hadn't been so skeptical of ever I don't think gluten fries of fad I don't think gluten is the best thing for your body I think that it's okay every now and then well but I think that essentially what you're getting when you're eating processed grains is you're getting something your body is it's kind of alien the body doesn't exactly know what to do with it well there doesn't seem here's the thing tests keep showing there doesn't seem to be a problem with gluten if you don't have celiac disease and it's what does that mean by a problem is it like for optimizing your health it's is it something that you should have in your diet all the time or is it something that mean it really does convert to sugar it's everything converts to sugar your body converts everything in some way shape or form into usable fuel on the usable fuel is you know eventually glucose or NADPH there's everything in your body gets converted to sugar but if you eat a piece of salmon or if you eat a bowl of pasta it's a very different reaction how your body absorbs these two things it's yes this is this is true because all calories aren't aren't the same right they don't both get absorbed to sugar but avoiding gluten and switching over to say you know all rice isn't you know that's not going to change far that all that much in your body in terms of what's in terms of the biochemical mischief unless you have a gluten allergy like that's sensitivities but there's there's also levels to that too right like there's some people where it's like mine Lee minorly irritating and there's some people that have extreme issues with it well here's at this point and this is why I always say at this point in our scientific knowledge because scientific knowledge can evolve and we can learn new things you know at one point the thing that started off the whole gluten trend was a kind of poorly poorly designed study where they had a small sample size of people and they designed it just to test you know gluten versus an on a diet without gluten and they came to the conclusion that about 20% of people just based on this very small study had a bad reaction to gluten now and well and these people came in saying they had stomach problems now these people it turned out they looked at it and said there's no there's no afterward as a scientist all sat back and said why we're only about 1% of people having celiac disease and then all of a sudden 20% of people are running around like glutens making their dick flies a fly off this is there's something up here so they made a better design study and they took out common cot they did you know kind of double blind did a better design study to say we're going to take out all these other causes of gastrointestinal distress and we're going to try to make this double-blind and they figured out it was the FODMAPs it was there were these short chain oligosaccharides that can pull water into the gut and cause some gastrointestinal distress and it was really closer to between like one at about five percent of people that were having any issues with gluten now the problem is that what was causing that though the the gastrointestinal stress and the in the one to five percent yeah so one percent is celiac disease for sure one percent yes what is across the board with people 1% it is that is fairly high now here's the thing that that higher percent of people that 2 to 5 here's the question now they're still trying to figure out why some people seem to have an issue with gluten now I could be wrong on this is just off the top of my head what I remember from a study but I've had to cite it a few times so I think my knowledge is accurate feel free to fact check me out at home but the thing with those extra percent they're trying to figure out why they might have an issue with gluten because they you know like wheat is you know you think of it as a carb heavy thing right and gluten is a protein so that other few percentage of people they're trying to figure out why the gluten does it because gluten is in a few other things it's in barley and rye so what they've figured out is that or this is the going theory right now gluten can cause a small reaction in the stomach where you produce this protein called zon Yulin that can cause an increase in inflammation this seems to be and this is what I this has only been one study that I've read on it it seems to be relatively new they're still looking into it so there's a chance that people might be in the 2 to 5 percent that can't handle it because of that it could be another component of the wheat barley rye that's causing it but gluten in and of itself it's not you know it's unless you are one of those people has an actual reaction to it perfectly fine go on to have you know go have a sandwich so but yeah if you want one but if you want one yeah I you know I cut back my carbs pretty heavily over the last couple of years and I've had really good results well it's I mean if you're someone who's trying to build muscle you know is that I just think that just just it eventually it becomes too much sugar it so much sugar in your body if you're eating a lot and Rebecca we need to have that food pyramid and the bottom of the food pyramid was all breads yes I mean you know I mean that's it's kind of interesting because that's like still in like dr. Seuss books that I read to my kids it's like wow they haven't figured this out yet you know you're supposed to eat that much bread and pasta it's not supposed to be the most thing it's and it's funny I think one of the funny parts of that is like is that back in the day when that was made I think slices of bread were much smaller we're not I think I I think that's part of it cuz I just think people didn't know as much back that's well I think that's part I think are a few things that are going on with it one is that we're really bad at counting calories and we we were chit-chatting a little bit before we showed up is that there are they now have a way of tracking how many calories people that take in a day through this drink that can I forget exactly how it works but you can take a drink and it will you know count the number of calories you've had in about the last 24 hours and they've found there's this drink I forget I forget exactly how it works this I'll find I'll shoot you the article after this but this was they it was god I need to find this article but it was they they could do this and they were tracking how registered dietitians versus you know the average Joe would you know could count because they were you know you know countdown how many calories you had in a day a registered dietitian who you know really well trained on Dietetic type stuff versus average person counting the calories the dietitian was off by about 200 calories average person was off by about 500 and about what they were guessing about what they were I mean they were talking about too bad 300 over you know several thousand which is what most people take in but think about if you're trying to lose weight and you're the average person and you're off by 500 calories and that's how and you're supposed to you know in the course of a week to lose one pound you're supposed to have a 500 calorie caloric deficit there's your deficit it's not there anymore so people are really bad at tracking their calories and they're really about it knowing what a portion size is so one of the best ways I've seen from like the personal trainers that I that I confer with is weighing out your food it's much harder to make a mistake that is a good way another way is there's a bunch of companies I don't have any affiliation with any of them but there's a bunch of companies that make prepackaged meals that are healthy and they they'll tell you exactly what the portion sizes are and exactly how many calories are in and what the nutrients are in and or in that package and that's a good way to do it too so there's no guesswork yeah it's I here's one of the other things like I don't think carbs as you know in and of themselves are evil I think you have to burn what you take in you have to balance your carbs your fats or proteins and you'll be okay and it really depends on what you're doing for exercise and a lot of people overestimate how much they move under under yeah overestimate how much they move underestimate how much they eat and like I'm friends with a lot of people in the fitness community a lot of weight lifters and depends on what they're doing if they're on a bulk their their calories will go up to 3,000 if they're on a cut they're like I'm on they're like I'm on poverty carbs right now so it's like 50 carbs over the course is talking about bodybuilding oh yeah it's there that's so unhealthy it's crazy that we think of that as a healthy thing it's funny because like during the like the year when they're not training for a competition it looks fine and then when they're like six weeks out from a competition it's like they're like I have a cup of water a day I'm like how are you this is not good for you well it's not good for them during the time where they're cutting and shredding that's what I'm talking about like when you see a bodybuilder on stage and they're shredded and they have zero body weight down to like probably like three or four percent of your diet water it's so unhealthy it's like they're literally on death's door but they look amazing yeah like they're shredded you can see every last sinew and fiber of their muscle but that's someone who's like in a really bad place kidneys are like that close to pass and going away it's not good it's definitely not good for your body when they're in that performance zone it's so weird that that's like what we really enjoy looking at the rest of the year though they eat and I mean it's my my trainer is a is a bodybuilder and it's like what he has me on for for weight loss isn't that crazy it's about 1,600 calories a day a fairly okay balance of proteins carbs and fats and it's like at first he had me at a much higher amount of carbs I'm like a body builder and he's not you want to die is he a dietician no but I've wait no but I have consulted with a dietician too because I have these you know these are the people I consult with for my writing and they're like yeah that looks all right you're not you're not on anything crazy and it's like because of my height and weight that I started with it first he had me at 1,800 I'm like I'm not quite losing here and he's like let's go down another couple hundred so it's you know and the way they started out with is always you know your weight times 10 and then they bust up the you know carbs proteins fats from there and you know if you need to adjust go from you know go from there and it's like I started with lifting because I you know because I've screwed up my joints so badly from the amount of running I've done that I'm like all right I will try weightlifting and it's been kind of fun I've enjoyed I've enjoyed learning how that's interesting like screw your joints from running but not from lifting weights lifting has been a little easier on my joints actually thing joints maybe yeah it so I mean I have its I have a kind of a bit of a joint condition so there the condition its they pop our way out of the socket and was that from it's a it's called I'm you're hearing all of my medical stuff I apologize it's called ehlers-danlos syndrome do you do you want to see it or no you can do it I can pop my shoulder halfway out okay see so most people when they stretch they stop like here right when keep going whoa yeah they've had like this one's had three seems like your shoulders flexible yeah but I mean it's you ever want to get dislocations if you can see it's popping a little bit right there but yeah it's like my hip pops part way out depending on I can't you can strengthen they keep it from me yeah like the more weight lifting I do the less popping it does it's been I mean this is way less bad than it was a few months ago before like you could visibly see the pop but you can still feel it but it's there's the problem with being hyper mobile like that is you're you leave yourself open to a lot of different injuries from you know from like basic movement can make something snap and it's I think this goes back to what we were talking about when it comes to people that have back issues and that one of the things that has been like super beneficial for me is exercising my back yoga and doing a bunch of different things stretching and making sure that my core and my spine are very strong and that's something that kind of gets ignored by a lot of people that have back issues it's like one of the reasons why you probably have a back issue whether it's a herniated disc or a bulging disc is that your back is not strong enough to sustain whatever load you're putting on it whatever exercise you're doing whatever movement you're doing that's causing it to pop out of place the issue is most likely that you are not strong enough and a lot of that comes from a sedentary lifestyle because we're sitting at a desk all comes from poor posture there's a variety of different factors that are not addressed by chiropractors or by other people and if they are addressed by a chiropractor well that's one good thing that they're telling you I mean it still doesn't take away from where this whole started four yeah I mean it's not it's not always the case the back injuries come from that like sometimes it's just you did like your your disc was kind of degenerate that was written into that was rented into your life but like your it's my boyfriend did nothing to to screw up his back and just just started degenerating and he was a he was a rock climber and there was no known injury just it happened and you know like I know but is it I mean how do you know that though when you're talking about someone having an issue in their disk is it from continual use is it because they're not stretching is it because they didn't have enough strength in the bag I mean those are all really valid questions and it's like there's you you never know what like it's you never know what's gonna be the cause of it beforehand that's why preventive medicine is hard but that's why I always say get to the gym and lift some weights it will at least if there if you're someone who is prone to having a back-end issue issue because you know there are some people who are prone to it get you know does that mean why would they be prone it's well in my case I have scoliosis as a part of the as a part of understand load I don't think that's right that's why I say prone to it because you don't a lot of times prone to disk degeneration it's why would someone be prone to that regenerative disk disease I don't know I don't know if that's actually I'm not sure that's a very disputed thing yeah I much I really don't know off the top of my head so I don't know if that's if that's something that that you're like if that's written into your DNA or if that's something that you injure and it just gets worse well I think that's a lot of it yeah that's what what I've been talking to people that work on people that have bulging discs and doctors that are I mean there's some new therapies that are doing for that now one of the things they're doing is they're injecting stem cells directly into the discs yeah it's very new and they're doing it on some fighters oh yes I'd love to see how that pans out yeah well they've got some really promising results apparently also they've just started it within the last six to eight months yeah I mean like the the biggest issue I have is that I have ace and I mean it's not about enough case of scoliosis where I need surgery or a back brace it's just enough to be inconvenient so it's like I'm my big thing I'm doing is all right if I can lift and keep my back strong it will stop me from having surgery eventually and back surgery is just almost never a good thing to hear because like when you fix something surgically they're just almost always complications especially with your back so I'm like if I can keep rod out of my back I'll be very happy well you know I've had some surgeries that were very effective I have needed reconstructions to both of my knees been reconstructed and they it turned out great yeah but I have had friends that have had some back issues especially fusions Oh that'd have been a big big nightmare yeah that's what I'd probably end up with because like middle of my back it just kind of goes from here and I'm like this is not something I like yoga I've been told you it's funny I love yoga and I've been told it's not good for people with ehlers-danlos so I'm like I've been told that by my my rheumatologist and it's like that's like there are still some yoga moves I do just be at the end of my workouts because they feel they feel great to stretch out my back and they feel like they strengthen my core quite a bit why do they say it's bad for you because of how like because of how hypermobile I am like it's all do downward dog and it doesn't even feel like it stretches me because I'm hyper because I'm so sexy to start with make sense but you're still strengthening all those muscles that support your spine why would that be bad I I got nothing I do can deadlift and you can't do yoga that seems ridiculous it doesn't make any sense at all welcome to a really weird disorder is that what it is or is a doctor's that don't really exactly know what the fuck they're talking about because there's a lot of doctors you get injured they're like we got to stop doing anything it's it's a thing where it's like Eller stainless is a weirdo disorder like you're basically your collagen is not able to heal itself or stay kind of in shape as it used to or it's okay to deadlift its dad left has been fine like I got in it it's partially you know you're it's partially that you're not stretching you're you're strengthening or you're I don't know how else to phrase it you're not you're not stretching your body into weird positions you're you're tensing everything there's a lot of yoga that's not stretching it's strengthening like when you're you know you're standing maybe there's a bunch of stretches but it's obviously there's a bunch of things that do stretch your body out but there's a bunch of things that are just strengthening actress now it's like using you have enough you have a really good point and I don't it's this is just what I've been told from a doc Durr who in in all honesty I don't know how well he knows ehlers-danlos because it's a rare disorder yeah I think doctors like to say don't do that yeah it's a big thing especially I think injured don't do that and it's weird because the things they've told me to do seem so much more intense than yoga like what it's I mean I've been told go ahead and bite go ahead and and deadlift go ahead and for fuck's sake they told me I can rock climb which is a thing like that's one of my other exercise II things but yoga they've said is off limits I mean this is the problem like when people say don't do yoga I always think they think if somebody's like bending over and touching their back of their head under their feet I think the reason is because they know how flexible I started at so they think I'm going to pull something out more because of how like how much I'll push the condition that's already there and I think that's the the concern so the problem with someone saying don't do yoga is like well yoga encompasses a tremendous amount of different move oh yeah and it's very it's I find it really strengthening like and I was surprised cuz like I used to I used to be kind of that runner chick who was like I don't have time for yoga it's boring and then I started trying it of all people my boyfriend try dragged me to a yoga class with him and I left and I'm like I am destroyed that was the hardest thing I've ever fucking like oh my god my arms were dead afterwards yeah it's very hard now what made you decide to write this chiropractic article and what's been the feedback from its oh god um so my like wait but my my editor and this is the editor I worked with at Gawker at Cosmo and now she's you know at the outline I love writing there and we talked about doing one on Kairos for ages and we got to the outline and it was like what are we what do we have on the table for next one she's like wanna do Kairos I'm like fuck yes I do what did what was your thoughts on it before you wrote the article before I wrote the article I knew that the guy who died I knew that a lot of Kairos did a lot of crazy things I knew they adjusted infants that they had claimed I knew about the vertebral subluxation theory and that that was bullshit and I knew that a lot of them on social media were crazy like one of the people I reported on was Billy Dumas and he he thinks chemtrails are real he's he's a whole cluster of fucks and he insemination oh my god like it's some of the like if you if he's a chemtrail guy huh if you're bored go if you're bored go for like go for 10 minutes and read up on Billy demas he's fun and it's just he's and it's funny because I was not I'll get into that in a minute but like we um I learned a lot doing this because I didn't realize that DD Palmer the guy who invented it he he got most of his information from doing seances with a dead doctor that blew my mind I'm like I had to I'm like I I know it's late and I'm a little high right now but I had to have hallucinating that like you know read it again the next morning I'm like nope that's for real like it was and nobody in chiropractic questions this the one dude when they go to active we were tell me this before the show and I stopped you said let's talk about this during the show when you said you've talked to chiropractors that were in the middle of chiropractic school and they read about this stuff and they were like what in the fuck it's sort of like that gerrae see going clear that Scientology documentary I was a good yeah but like certain stage of the scientology where they give him the written notes by l ron Hubbard he's like what in the fuck is that your $300,000 in and you can't leave so I got two emails from chiropractors and I just like I couldn't you know put their names out publicly but I got two emails from chiropractors and I checked in and I'm like these are indeed chiropractors I went to their websites they were absolutely on the level that said they went to chiropractic school and part way through they realized it was all shit one of them even said they wouldn't refer people to a chiropractor like it was nutty and one of the guys he sent me to a forum for like in which chiropractors bitch about the field of chiropractic what do they say it's they're like and they were like which part of this is bullshit do you guys believe in the vertebral subluxation theory and they're like no subluxation don't exist like you know if you want to do this ethically just crap you know take people in who have injuries try to do some physical therapy get them stronger and get them out and as few sessions as you can so they're essentially like unlicensed physical therapy and like it's funny because I'll occasionally pass by a chiropractic clinic where I see them saying back injury these work injuries you know sports physical therapy and I'm like okay if I ever wanted to go to a chiropractor because I'd lost my mind and couldn't find a physical therapist that's the type I would go to but you know if you ever see them advertising magic crystals and aura healing fucking run run like this is there are a few of them out there and I looked at one of the guys websites who emailed me and there was an FAQ it's like you have to keep coming back forever no we try to get you out in as few sessions as possible I'm like oh I have hope but like there's there's a woman who would still like the basis of it is bullshit it's like even if you're trying to get me out as few such as as possible you're still like but there was a it's funny there's a woman her name is Britt Murray her mace she was she went to school to be a naturopath and she graduated became a naturopath and she realized after a short period of time that it was all bullshit like naturopathic doctor and she's like we can't actually treat people we have to send people to real doctors the advice we're giving is all based on misdirection and complete shit and I I'm so in awe of the fact that she went through this she liked and these people one of the things I said was you know I was in all this debt I figured just you know I'm like Paul Haggis you know I'm already here may as well keep going Britt said you know it doesn't matter I realized I was in a profession based on bullshit I had to leave and you did have some people that you talked to that were chiropractors that were in the middle of and they realized it was bullshit and they had to stay and they stayed because like what the fuck do I do I have to get my money back from my student loans and I'm like you know what you could have gone like you weren't you can get like I mean I say this is someone who got one into a lot of debt for my real degree go and get another degree if you're smart enough to have gotten at least your undergrad before you went to Palmer chiropractic you'd have to have an underground before you go to Palmer chiropractic I believe so given that it's a doctorate program now one of the guys that I went to undergrad with now he was he was smart he had a biology degree and he was there on scholarship he was one of the smarter kids in the bio program like there was there was a real doctorate if he wanted he went to Palmer you know same school as some of the Cairo's in this article and it was funny like one of my I worked with on this piece asked me so the doctors that you're concentrating on on this piece are they the exception to the norm is this how regular chiropractors work I'm like let me go look at my friend from college Asst a little chiropractic page and I looked he adjusts infants he claims that he can stop bedwetting from adjusting a seven-year-old I'm like oh my god I'm like this is and like I I'm sitting here going my god like this this guy that I went to school with who seemed you know he was smart he was like this is I was I was kind of like and I wasn't it was hard to be mad I was just disappointed in this person that I just stuck in this system I mean is that what it is it's like a bunch of people that are also doing the same thing and they just kind of get caught up in the momentum of this idea I think they hear it from a bunch of people who they think are experts like their teachers and they're they're going no this is accepted so we're gonna take it it's like you know what if you like if I saw people in science like cuz I promote a lot of things that you know we might disagree on but you know I promote a lot of ideas in science that I've seen the evidence for and I've seen a lot of it like what we disagree on um you know some dietary things I would guess like kiss you know we can we can hash that like I what I don't know what are your thoughts on GMOs I think genetically modified foods is apparently almost everything that you buy the supermarket okay we agree on that then and it's like tomato you buy every orange if you look at a piece of corn oh it's organic that shit is genetically modified it's been modified for a hundred years I've talked you had Kevin full time you know I was so happy you had him on because he's never in California brah he went up for dinner that night he takes a lot of shit because Monsanto has funded some of the studies that they've done but the studies are real and the studies have mean that you you can see the results so they're not manipulated yeah Kevin it's well actually you know they funded his communication program so that he can come out and do things like this and they they never funded any of his research I misspoke and no no it's fine it's but you know what here's a and this is what where he got a lot of shit was was that he said I have nothing to do with Monsanto and like I think if he just said you know what they fund my communication program but they don't have anything to do with my research nobody would have I think people still would have been mad but I think people would have been far less mad and I feel so bad that he went through everything with that because there was anything with Monsanto it's tricky yeah I mean I just took a tour there and I got hate mail yeah like and it's I mean we were so careful because I was out there for other business and they were like oh you're gonna be atma in Missouri come have a tour like they didn't pay so the Death Star its yes and I had so much fun like it was there was they have a lot of really cool tech there and if you were ever in the area they gladly show you around so there they were nice to me I was funny one of the one of the rumors that I heard about that was they only have organic food in the cafeteria I'm like I'm taking I'm taking my camera around and taking pictures of everything the word organic is it's a weird one too it's like what's organic and what's not now it's like it's it's a very weird definition organic uses pesticides and that's something I think people see yeah absolutely and I mean I thought that was the whole point of organic it's you don't use pesticides no I'm sure there are some organic farmers that don't use anything that's let's Google this what defines organic food let's find out what is the accepted definitions of organic food you want to hear it from me and then from from Google to see if I matter what all right so organic food works by certain farming stand or agricultural standards and they can use certain pesticides in most cases these pesticides are derived from natural sources not always but most of the time and some of these pesticides include pesticides like rotenone and the pyrethrum and also if you're familiar with BT corn the Bt toxin is also used in organic farming for because it's a naturally occurring toxin it can be used and sprayed topically on organic produce so a lot of these the things that we think of as just conventional farming practices definitely used in organic farming it doesn't make it any better or worse it just in a lot of cases it's a little more expensive partially because of the certification process and partially because it uses older farming techniques that need you know a little more land that type of stuff it also uses till farming practices that you know digs up the ground a bit more and can release a little more co2 so in general I tend to oh here we go here we go simply stated or Ganic produce or other ingredients are grown without the use of pesticides Oh synthetic fertilizers excuse of long sewage sludge genetically modified organisms or ionizing radiation animals that produce meat poultry eggs and dairy products do not take antibiotics or growth hormones the u.s. hold on I'm sorry the USDA National Organic Program defines organic as follows organic food is produced by farmers who emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance environmental quality for future generations organic meat poultry and eggs and dairy products are made from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones organic food is produced without using most conventional pesticides here we go fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge bio engineering or ionizing radiation before a product can be labeled organic in quotes a government-approved certified inspects the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meet USDA Organic Standards now the one thing on there that I'll disagree with with their first paragraph as they say without the use of pesticides in the second paragraph it says organic food is produced without using most conventional pesticides you see that slight little sleight of hand because one of them is theirs and the other one is USDA exact little sleight of hand there it's I mean if you if I may ask would you would you like to Google well hold on a second let's Google what pesticides can be used and still make it organic exactly what I was gonna request it's organic pesticides approved for use in the US there we go now what are the fears of pesticides right people worry about toxins getting into their food getting in their body and cancer I mean I understand that fear partially because I went through it quite a bit like when I got sick a few years ago like my first symptom wasn't celiac disease it wasn't my joints popping out I got the worst headache of my life one day and it never went away like that that'll make you scared to death of everything around you like I went organic I went the again I went I'd cut everything out of my diet cuz I was scared that you know like you get you feel like you're getting stabbed in the eye constantly you're gonna cut everything out of your diet and this happened all at once one day were said and I was working and at the time I wasn't working in the pesticide lab yet I was working in a drug analysis lab I was well it was I was the thing that I was worried because I was at the time I was I was there was much more so I babe than there is here today I was there was much more of me and there is here today I was I'm five nine and I at the time weighed almost 250 pounds I I needed to lose a little of me but it was like alright I'm eating shitty food I should probably try eating healthier but I mean never mind just more salads I'm like I went organic I went I just cut everything out of my diet so there was a bunch issues it was a dietary as well I mean yeah like I cut a lot of things out started working out everything but you know what I still needed medication because it turned out there was just a it was just I had and we figured out the headache was linked into the ehlers-danlos syndrome and there some to clarify everything some people when they have one autoimmune they can tend to cluster so there's that's I I I was lucky caller 1 million but that was that was the thing with it but I tried you know I looked into this and I fell for all of it like so all the the pesticides are killing you it's the toxin so I mean I understand the fear of the people who were like I need to cut toxins out of my diet do is there any foundation in truth I mean no nothing pesticides are not bad for you well no pesticide there is a little bit of truth that sells the lie is what I will give this because I you know I used to work with bulk quantities of pesticides at my last lab and that was kind of what sealed the deal for me that these when they're in your food are not gonna hurt you because the amount of testing we had to go through and the amount of regulation I think regulation in this case is a good thing because it will stop a bad pesticide for making it to market and I want that regulation there because I eat the food too I don't want anyone's child to ever get hurt from something that that me or another like I don't work there anymore but you know that that I had any working getting on the market I don't want ever ever want that to be the case but once upon a time the pesticides we had in the market were much less targeted to hurting the weeds and could hurt people too like arson arsenicals sulfuric acid those were early pesticides Paris green totally toxic especially to to the farmers and to the even to the farm equipment the stuff we have now far less toxic and I mean people use a far less though is it toxic it's I mean I'm gonna qualify this answer and I mean I'm not I'm not qualifying it to back off from it but everything is toxic in some doses I said water but I mean so roundup is one that people are really scared of anise one that a lot of people know about there is a great graph on on this showing how less toxic it is then the then the pesticides it replaced because we weren't we didn't go from using no pesticide to using roundup and I know someone's gonna correct me saying it's an herbicide but on herbicide is pesticides the blanket term for all things that kill stuff in farming so before before roundup I believe the one we used was sigh Anna's eeen I could be wrong on this but the one we used before roundup was in terms of the ld50 the lethal dose for about 50% of the population it was 10 times higher than roundup and now we barely sell any of it so it is the issue just lethal dose or the issues tossing some sort of toxicity that effects your body cancer right it's and I understand that's a question that that people are you know keep coming back to and part of the reason that people are suspicious of it is because of its use with a GMO and these things go through hundreds of tests and years of testing and because of the suspicions with Roundup it's gone through continual testing like they've tested to see if it if it accumulates in breast milk it does not they tested to see it because cancer doesn't seem to and they've tried they've used it at higher doses they've done it with mice and rats they've they've tested in humans have been on the market for 30 years are you tested in humans but I mean like it's been in the population or it's been used now for I believe 25 years and there doesn't seem to be the only the only apparent increase in cancer is because we're living long now and when you have any population that lives longer you have increased incidences of cancer like we're not dying from polio anymore so we're dying from something like unfortunately we're not gonna live forever so you know right so um there's just but this toxicity issue when it comes to Roundup or when it comes to any sort of pesticide when you're talking about herbicides herbicides are what kills the plants right weeds besides kills bugs pests pesticides are it's the blanket term insecticide kills bug so pesticides the the whole blanket term yep yeah okay so what is what's the most controversial as it roundup roundup is controversial and I think the reason that it became controversial is because people heard all right you have to genetically modify the plant so that the roundup doesn't kill the plant and it's this whole thing just to make money for Monsanto and how dare you make money and that's I think that was why people got mad was because of the genetic modification link in with Roundup and it's you know it's a new technology or you know it's it's one of it's a newer technology and it kind of made people a little aware of farming for the first time and like I go to farming conferences a lot of times to talk about how to communicate agriculture and I'll sit down and ask farmers you know what do you plant why are you planting it what do you think of GMOs so you use roundup and do you buy from people other than do you buy from Monsanto and do you buy from people other than Monsanto and that handful of questions will tell me well I mean if I wish I had more videos of this but like there's there's a video at some point on my site with two farmers who buy from Monsanto and buy from other companies and one of the reasons I asked that is because there's a rumor on the internet that if you buy from Monsanto you can only buy from Monsanto just not true that you know every genetically modified crop is is is you know just is made to be Roundup Ready again not true that you know that people are you know are being that people are dying of cancer from just being around Roundup and recently they found that one of the reports that went through the IRC the cats the place that declares things cancerous you know on their you know group one - 2a 2b cancer classifications one of the reports was falsified that declared roundup cancerous now we also have two falsified bahu by the person who was I'm I have to hunt down this report but the person who was trying to say roundup as cancer they do them because of a little bit of suspicion around it because it's been people have kicked around that it's causing cancer or you know that your spleen to turn radioactive for you know forever and it's so is this like a chemtrails type thing a little bit comes one of the things that people talk about in terms of conspiracy theory urges and it gets put into the public sphere so much that people start to believe it and here's thing if I saw firm evidence that roundup had caused issues I would say right away just get rid of it take it off the market and I keep on not seeing firm evidence of it like one of the there was a study there's this group moms across our moms across America and it's I take I always get my scientific information for Mom groups on the internet but this group decided to do a breast milk study to see if roundup accumulated in breast milk and the way the study was done was they just had women indiscriminately send in containers of breast milk to to them and they declared like the amount of roundup to be ridiculously high in the breast milk and I'm like did they just tell women to spray like pump bottles like roundup into these containers and then test it but it turned out and this is just from knowing how analytical techniques work like I used to design the techniques by which we extracted you know target pesticides from a matrix and you know analyzed them on our on our big overpriced machinery but the a woman who is a breast milk researcher out of the University of Washington was like this doesn't seem right so she designed an experiment to test if roundup was accumulating in breast milk and she had it verified by an outside independent lab and they tested women specifically who worked in agriculture and she had their breast milk tested specifically on days where they were spraying roundup and there was nothing found yeah but that's someone who's not necessarily eating the food that someone was working with the food well working with roundup right it's and you would expect that if it was being sprayed well they think about it this way the issue though not interrupt you vote with the issue is people eating it it's well think about it this way but it's in the food supply wouldn't they be eating it as well I don't know I don't know what their diet is if you if you're getting it from people's breast milk and those people say there's roundup in my breast milk and I've been eating genetically modified crops it's well the other question is if these P are the people that are following moms across America and their whole thing is that roundup is the devil so you think they're falsifying evidence I think that it was not a well controlled experiment and it would be interesting to see to see how the experiment would come out if the person who runs moms across America and Hunnicutt would work would how it would look if xen were to look in on every step of the process with Shelly McGuire dr. Shelly McGuire to see that you know these people ate food that should have been sprayed with Roundup and worked in the field and then at the end to see if their breast milk came out with nothing in it so I think don't you don't you think that there'd be more likely to be some sort of conspiratorial collusion with people that actually work in farms that use roundup rather than someone who's just checking their breast milk it's like wouldn't you think that like someone's trying to prove that roundup isn't showing up in breast milk and you've got a bunch of people that they're living relies on using roundup well the farm workers themselves they'd want to be safe right Manny and I say that as someone who's worked at a pesticide company and when I worked there I mean I was I was just an analytical chemist I'm not someone who had any investment in keeping that company safe from being yelled at I wanted to be safe from the stuff I was working but I found it weird that you feel like there's some sort of conspiracy with these moms that are checking their breast milk but you don't think there might possibly be some shenanigans involved in the people that actually need roundup to make a living it's no I understand what you're saying for sure but part of the reason why I think that dr. McGuire would have conducted a better study was number one independently verified number two knows how to do collection evidence a specimen collection accurately and number three monitored and independently verified from an outside lab so it's like we don't have and when when moms across America was asked to show their data and how they collected the samples they didn't give they weren't willing to share their all of their data on how specimen collection was no excuse for not sharing that I I don't recall off the top of my head but they weren't like it's it seems suspicious to me that they weren't willing to disclose that I mean when you're when you do an experiment everything and I mean I used to work under GLP standards which basically you throw out a glove you have to write it down and that's that's part of the standards on how you get you know a chemical into into use and in agriculture is you really have to be careful and and forthcoming on how you do your work which was the amount of pesticides that they found in breast milk uniform it's I I believe they didn't find I don't I think they were only testing for Roundup and they found there to be they didn't find there to be even trace amounts which I was kind of surprised that I would have expected something I mean the moms across America stuff they found a lot yeah what was a uniform was everybody have like a similar amount no they found in the amounts varied and they were they were so high it was like it was just like somebody dripped some in there yeah it was suspicious and that's why I was like like that was why I didn't buy it the other thing is they used a technique an analytical technique that was used for water and that's why I'm like this is not like not all techniques used for all work for all chemical matrices so that's another reason why you know a different lab was probably better equipped to handle it one specifically that analyzes breast milk so it's I think like the other thing is you know that the other lab the other lab kind of had a bias going in because their whole thing is how roundup is bad so a lab that's like I just want to know if you know moms are being harmed if there's breast if there's something in the in the breast milk that seems like a lab that you know went in just wanting to know the other lab went in saying I hate roundup so if you know I would have if if roundup had been found in in the test that dr. McGuire slab had done I would have happily accepted those results because you know it almost wouldn't it would have surprised me not in the least if if it had been found but I was kind of I was kind of glad that there was nothing there because it means that you know babies aren't getting a concentrated dose of this just because you know you don't want you no extraneous chemicals going into the food so are the only testing people that worked in these farms is that was that the idea second test I think they did I don't remember off the top of my head but I know one of the people one of the groups they did tests were women on testing days but they come out of this way they're not just spraying it they're also you know possibly eating food that's been that's had it on there yeah but that's possibly I would be more interested in seeing it 100% sure that these people were eating food that they've been sprayed with Roundup and that doesn't make sense to me that they didn't do that it's I'm you know I I'd have to I want to have a look at the study again myself just to be just to be sure of what the I'm curious about both tests it's have I have a look we can have a quick peek after it for dr. Shelly McGuire breast milk roundup study you know the whole thing seems a little weird to me it's it's weird that one group tests high one group test not at all it's it is I'm gonna say it is easy to screw up a study using if you're not sure the parameters you're supposed to use in an analytical in a chemical analysis thing because you can have interfering species that come up with the same Peaks at the same time so I mean the other thing is like I said we the biggest thing is we don't know the collection parameters for the one that mom across America did they won't tell us yeah I mean it's the other thing is dr. McGuire was doing it through a university and she could have been in she could have been in a lot of trouble if she falsified or data or done or done a test that was purposefully misleading right so that's what are the pesticides did you google the best decides that are acceptable there's put them up there's a long list somewhere but the it's on the USA they're USDA dot-gov website it's just like the standards of what they used to put stuff on and off of it okay and there are organic standards that allow some substances but where they're mostly trying to get out synthetic substances however there are also some synthetic substances that are allowed to interesting and this is to label something organic right and then there's a board that votes on it from time to time if somebody wants to bring something up and disagree that it shouldn't be on that list it's not weird though I mean most people think you say organic most people think there's no pesticides most people think you're just growing plants yep and that's it's I mean they they sell that so well don't they yes it for instance fur moans pheromones pheromones of pheromones not pheromones pheromones have long been used as effective non-toxic ways to confuse insects hmm they might otherwise infest organic crops especially fruit so they put some certain smells just free bugs out likewise vaccines for animals are important disease prevention tools against many infectious diseases blah blah blah especially since antibiotic therapy is prohibited in livestock I'm picturing an anti-vaxxer staying away from organic produce because they vaccinated it against bees well you could always grow your own food folks you know and not put anything on it but I think large-scale domestic agriculture if you're talking about these gigantic fields nothing could be less natural it's not normal to have a thousand acres of corn it just doesn't exist in the wild and when you do that you're gonna run into a lot of problems I always go back to the argument of nothing we're doing is natural anyway it's we're sitting in an air-conditioned studio in California that we we'd probably be would be dead with a lot of the things that we we don't have that's that's you know how about food there's no food around here where you grown food no it was no one's growing food anywhere near us there's there's nothing that we enjoy that's that's natural anymore ice-creams not natural and it's goddamn delicious gotta get a freezer how do you get a freezer it's like like you want natural bear attacks asteroids well I think there's little sticker things that come out of trees those are all natural oh you're gonna say stickers like oops it's coops Jesus made those himself what's up put something on the company that made those stickers and we're just gonna bring this up a second ago oh I went to their website and it's a they have this thing called a digestive solution energy card oh jeez I'll love for either price Paltrow digestive solution energy card what in the fuck is this now look at this you can now in all caps bold letters boost your body energy signature alcohol bold by simply placing this digestive solution TM energy card under your food plate holy fuck and the beverage of your choice and receive energy from the card instantly you motherfuckers the energy card has a magnetic strip embedded in the back that holds digitally enhanced information that once your food or beverage comes in contact with it the energy is delivered immediately to the food and beverage thereby boosting the energy to your food to maximize the nutrition you consume you fucking criminals should be in jail hey you guys are monsters Gwyneth Paltrow just broke look at this shit the digestive energy card digestive solution energy card is an energetically enhanced prot what that's hold on a second let's look at that sentence the digestive energy the digestive solution energy card is an energetically enhanced products that's shit English our engineers have achieved the correct ratio response of frequency signatures through a technology that matches the same energy received from the nutrients you get from the food you eat and drink you know this guy's wearing toe shoes when you wrote this right we consume food it converts into chemical energy which provides the nutritional needs for energy and growth this connection is defined by the laws of thermodynamics that requires all humans to burn food for energy you guys are fucking cunts what is the name of this company this is alpha biocentric s' oh no concert warm lovely places these people are assholes chyna totally different thing suggested retail price $79 oh my god the card is guaranteed for two years it looks like a credit card mm-hmm god damn how the fuck does someone get away with this this is horrible hey you just imagine the idea that you could put a card under your food it makes your food better like I I'm trying to figure it cuz they're saying it energetically enhances it does this mean it adds calories to it or does I it's very they keep using these words I don't think they know what they mean yeah well there's a lot of people that like to use those sciency words right it's like chiropractors yeah subluxation something yeah they always say that I remember them saying that all the time to one doctor he adjusted me did five minutes right 140 bucks then he goes make sure you drink a lot of water I'm like why to watch the fucking taste out of my mouth you're the asshole you didn't do anything this is crazy wash the bullshit down yeah wash the bullshit goes what does the response been uh I mean you must have gotten a lot of a lot of swearing Oh got 20 Twitter was an anger plays I'm still getting angry tweets liking people that use it or from chiropractors themselves fewer chiropractor some chiropractors and a lot of people who love chiropractic and are mad at me because I think people think I'm calling them stupid for using chiropractor up I'm like no you got you you stupid they got me too and I mean it's like I would basically be calling half my fan base stupid if if that were the case and I'm not and I felt kind of bad because a good friend of mine like she like after she gave birth she had like a severe enough injury that she could barely walk and a chiropractor basically from massaging the area got her up and walking and she's like and the thing she said to me was I'm tired of being called a lemming Moron I'm like I never you number one I never insulted people who use chiropractic and number two I definitely didn't use those two words and I think people got the impression that I was calling everyone who used chiropractors dumb and it's like that's never the point of my writing like you're not the moron for falling for this bear the assholes for selling it don't even know of a lot of them are assholes because I don't know if a lot of them have even looked into this you know I've talked to some chiropractors about this stuff that's been going on over the last couple weeks since your article and since I did my podcast since we've talked about it several times I just don't think they understand the origins of this or that it's or that the set they're selling isn't considered scientifically valid if you're a kid and you're getting out of high school and you're going into college and you know you want to get involved in something therapeutic and chiropractic medicine seems like a good thing and you start going to chiropractic school like you might not even know and I I really do sympathize with a lot of chiropractors who are out there they that have emailed me like a man like what you're saying could potentially destroy my business I understand and I sympathize but you've got to understand that if I knew about this and I didn't talk about it that would be more horrible I have a responsibility if I find something out like this like the guy who invented is a fucking quack and a magnetic healer and you're not really going to medical school there's a responsibility that you have to say something about that yeah and I just think people are thinking about themselves they're thinking about you know hey I've got bills and hey I've got this and I've got a practice and I've got another job yeah I don't want to be the guy that tells you what to do but you can't get upset at someone saying something that's if I made up the fact that chiropractic medicine was founded by a magnetic healer and a quack Obama was killed by his own son do you know the story behind that is run over by his son his son ran him over with a fucking car and they think he might have done it on purpose the son apparently was a fucking huge fraud and the son went on to be the one who promoted chiropractic medicine it was really promoted by the son yeah it's in the Wikipedia pull up the Wikipedia because the practic controversies this that they there's a real theory that the son murdered the dad and the son murdered the dad to take over the business and then he's the one who pushed chiropractic medicine I think we had to cut it off at some point cuz the article was fourth no I'm sure right here we go what do you got here Jamie Wikipedia this is death it says there's a book about oh yeah homecoming parade that's that's hilarious injuries by his son yeah fuckin ran him over his son ran him over this attempted patricide yeah whoo that's uh that's fun there was speculation that it was an accident but instead Wow a case of attempted patch Assad hmm that's but that it was not an accident hmm no one knows so who knows I mean you're talking about some shit that went down the 1800s or actually 1913 I guess huh bull so 1913 BJ Palmer ran over his dad DD Palmer DD and yeah and that guy is filled with fucking problems too if you look into him the son apparently the son was a massive fraud so in a sense chiropractic medicine was founded by a quack and promoted by a fraud who might have murdered his dad well how the fuck does it get so far that's the most stunning thing about it it's it's a thing we're like it took root before like like I said before real medicine was starting and it just it kept going like while medicine was making attempts at other things and some of them failed and some of them stayed like think about around that time was when Bayer was like we have a numerical cure heroin like right there was a lot of shit going yeah so I mean like they were James and coca-cola yeah yeah like they were trying it real things and failing but at least they were they were trying like these guys were like hey we had a Sion check this motherfucker out and like that didn't work so well without the internet people would not have had this information like when I first started going to chiropractors was probably 20 years ago no one had this information it was it wasn't available no one knew you just thought oh he's a doctor it says doctor of chiropractic always a guy who studied chiropractic medicine and I loved it so many of them just say doctor and you have to dig through their website for where it eventually says chiropractor how can you fucking call yourself a doctor if you don't go to medical school isn't it shouldn't there be some sort of a national standard that's it it's funny cuz a lot of them like I and I don't know this should bug me or not because like you'll see doctor somewhere and the the MDS will say MD really carefully or pediatrician oh they'll be very careful to say what type of doctor they are if someone like now I'm very leery if I just see doctor because I'm like alright are they had like what breed of doctor are they do they have a PhD do they have are they a chiropractor like if I see doctor and then I see some bullshit on their page I'm like oh what type of doctor are they cuz like everyone wants you to think like or I think people just want you to think that they're a medical doctor and that's that wait that title has a lot of weight so people will take shit advice if they see dr period in front of the name bill cosby was a doctor for a while till they took it back apparently people were taking some drugs from him they just didn't know it they gave him an honorary doctor doctorates are also weird right because if you get a doctorate you can be called a doctor if you be doctor cosby but you don't have to have header also we need to know new word for that it's someone who's got a doctorate shouldn't be a fucking doctor and so i go back and forth on that one because I have friends who you know have their PhDs and like I won't you know you you're you kind of you call them doctor and then like when I think I feel like when they email people generally in the signature line it's you know it's you know Joe Schmoe PhD like they're there without make sense yeah it's like they sign things PhD in general just to not be a dick about it right but it's like it's I feel like putting dr. blank when you're a PhD it's like I feel like it can cause some confusion like dr. Laura will deal with doctor or see a doctor was it dr. Phil no dr. Phil's a doctor he's not a psychologist which one of you is not the top of my head I feel like there was a doctorate in there somewhere or a PhD or something but like there's so many of them that just don't have what they say it's funny because uh what's-his-face dr. oz really good cardiothoracic surgeon bullshit are on TV though oh he's so scary that guy selling miracle cures from weight loss he's got it's funny because since Congress told him cut the shit he's been Congress it's matching that he's still on TV he's been less full of shit but still a little full shit cuz how's your work how do you fill a 45-minute TV show with complete like you know just peer-reviewed science every day it's hard it's like so you start bullshitting yeah but weren't way more than that that's like Schilling yes your cell miracle cure which is so fucked and it's like the the disappointing thing is like he was I mean when I say good he was an amazingly good cardiothoracic surgeon and that's what's disappointing about this is he used that credibility of being such a good doctor to be such a big asshole it's like why why would you do that to people they they expect we we wanted better from you we just don't do that Ben Carson the guy who's like a serious neurosurgeon right yes didn't you think the Earth's ten thousand years old he thinks there's grain in the fucking pyramids grain grain he was like there's grain in the pyramids he's right shocking me that someone would leave some grain behind I mean no it's like filled with grains I think he thought they were silos they were ancient like it's not that he doesn't mean that there's like an occasional Vaz full of grain he means like they were silos and that's not not accurate there was a young earth er it's I that might be I don't haven't looked but I mean it would nothing would surprise me with him of these people there are a lot of people who are extremely smart but they close off just giant sections of the reason understand it it's hard to find people that are a hundred percent you know are very skeptical and very you know or critical thinkers and want to be critical thinkers in every field of your life like look I have this but I'll be really good and really critical thinking about this but motherfucker I have this belief and you can't touch it and like that seems to be the case with a lot of people I'm like I just want evidence about things show me evidence and the big thing is show me where the balance of evidence is like if you give me two articles that say this and then 10,000 that say this I'm like I'm over here I'm going there and I think that's I think that's kind of a solid way to evaluate evidence like if you've got a lot of them to say this and they're and they seem solid and backed by backed by people who know what they're talking about it just seems to be the good way to evaluate what you're you know how you're going to choose your opinions on something yeah I mean it seems like you just really have to do a lot of research before you form any opinion on anything and is well that's one of the reasons why I don't blame people when they don't get it right right away because do and this is something I'll do it someone my talk so I'll say you know take it your phones and Google a term that you're not sure about in health or nutrition Google GMOs Google sugar Google you know whatever and you know tell me what the top 10 search results say and you know sometime like especially with GMOs for a long time the top like eight out of ten search results were like wow this is go make your dick fall off and it's like now like it's changed a little bit because there's been a huge effort by science writers to get out the word this isn't gonna kill you but like for a while like how you know it's so many of the top search results said they were horrible how hard should you know just a soccer mom in Iowa have to hunt to figure out if this is gonna kill her kids like and I that's why I really don't blame people when they get it wrong at first because this is there's so much bad information out there that it's easy to get the impression that like I said the ten thousand articles say it's bad when it's really just you know screaming assholes repeating you know the one article that say it's bad well if you just Google chiropractic medicine you're not gonna get a lot of fraud articles if you Google chiropractic it's bullshit you get your article and then you go down a rabbit hole and you know if you google chiropractic fraud you'll find plenty of stuff on it and then the history of chiropractic medicine is where it really unravels yeah and it's it's hard to it's like when someone just wants to know what's gonna fix my back like that's not where they start right well and that's a problem I mean back problems are fucking horrible I mean that's that is a part of the problem is like people get desperate they do not know what to do just like when you were saying you were getting those horrible headaches and you're like I'll fucking try anything yeah I'm gonna go vegan I want to go gmo-free I'm gonna drink water only I'm good yeah I gave up my beloved Diet Coke dark times people get worried oh yeah you know you get worried and you start thinking about different ways you can and then if someone comes along and says look this is the solution just stick with it I need to see you twice a week my life this one guy that I was going to it was like you gotta come more often buddy that's really the way like oh I've got to get you to move my neck more often fuck are you doing really you know and I stopped going to him I was going to this one guy and he had a really good massage therapist and I was getting the massage therapy then I stopped getting the chiropractic adjustment and then he was like look you got it you got to get the chiropractic adjustment too I was like getting one thing is helping me the other thing I don't feel anything I just it sounds cool I like the sound pop that Crick feels it feels good like when you do this that feels good that's the same fucking the end that a chiropractor is doing to you but then they tell you're not supposed to do that to your fingers I'm like wow why well it can cause arthritis how the fuck do you know how many I've been doing it my whole life I don't have arthritis well the question is kind of like we're talking about with long-term pesticide exposure I don't know where that's gonna land me when I'm 70 I believe it of course causes arthritis person I'm 70 they're just gonna throw some new drug at me and it'll be fine my point was that you can't have it both ways if this causes arthritis how the fuck are you allowed to crack my neck all the time that's an excellent point it's one or the other it's funny I've had and one person it's funny for all the people who messaged me because you asked what the feedback was it wasn't just you know chiropractors who were really mad I had some people say my parents brought me for chiropractic when I was a kid and now my back is fucked up so I mean and I don't know how many stories there are like that from people saying you know we started chiropractic when I was a baby and this was not the way to go for me like but God some of the responses to the article be Jesus fuckin Christ well what does that woman who just died the Playboy model or saying I'm suing the chiropractor so there are like the sudden very you know kind of violent way that they crack a neck and chiropractic can leave you open to to severing an artery in your neck now it's not often that it happens but it happens and this is one of those things that I have a really big contention with chiropractic with is that they have all these morning's about how you know Western medicine and it's kind of funny that they call it Western medicine when chiropractic started in the middle of a cut of the US it's like you don't get to claim that you made this in China for fuck sakes but like they'll say that Western medicine is so horrible for you and has all these potential side effects and yeah it has potential side effects but they have potential side effects well they actually cure shit you have potential side effects well you're cracking someone's neck like right essential side-effects - you're talking about 320 million people that are going to the doctor you have a hundred thousand cases of potential side effects across the board from all causes yeah that's what they're harping on yeah you're harping on the the minority of things that happen and go wrong and then you know obviously there's some shit like the little mind and some stuff that people don't use anymore that are horrible and the side effects are but what am I never made it to the u.s. that's something a lot of people don't realize really it was used in other countries other countries now we had one regulator in the US who saw the drug was coming up for approval here and she said no we have to look into this more and then they saw the cases in Europe of all these infants that were being born with major side effects and she was like I told you so that was that was how they started and this was what this is actually what gave us one of the best acts for regulation for safety and efficacy in the US and basically I said that drugs before they make it to market now have to be proven beyond a certain amount to show that they are both safe and effective and it was basically thalidomide that launched that that act which is which is kind of like we're good at learning from our mistakes in in far I say we like I work for it but no it's like you know we're good at learning from our mistakes when we have a fuckup like that so I mean I don't know what and what worries me is that we're gonna have eventually another week we can very easily have another drug like that but it will be something that we haven't regulated out of the system yet so I don't know what the next thing will be but it'll be something that we haven't seen yet so that's the that that's the kind of scary thing it'll be it'll be like we already know to test for things in utero we already know that they test for things that you know that can cause cancer we already know certain types of testing like but the lid amide it was so crazy non-toxic they couldn't get it to kill a rat how nutty is that it was pretty crazy what did the babies yeah I mean it's it's crazy that something that was that safe what was the purpose of it it was it was used for a lot of different things and the thing that they gave it to mothers for was to stop morning sickness now it's still used in a few treatments just don't get it anywhere near a pregnant woman so that they gave it it was really really good for let me rephrase it it was really effective at stopping morning sickness but just nobody had a clue that it was what it was causing - you know in utero and it was you know causing like you know limbs to not be formed it was causing all these crazy things and tens of thousands of babies were born deformed before they went yikes pull the plug isn't there also an issue with approving drugs isn't there an also an issue with biodiversity and that like you have issues that I don't have and so there's there's gonna be things that affect you that are not gonna affect me and vice versa and this is why after and this is an interesting that happens so it's you you know as you'd happen with with your neuro nootropics okay start with my apologies so and so with so you know about phase three clinical trials and all that from from that so when you get to phase three generally you're testing between three and ten thousand people in the population and you've gotten through a few trials you know that this is effective for this you want to see if people have you're testing for allergic reactions and you're testing to see where people are going to have issues with the drug so that when you get to market you know that you know these people like this is the percentage of people to have these side effects as a percentage of with these if you have these side effects call your doctor right away discontinue that type of stuff but that's three to ten thousand people you don't know who you're going to give it to that's on X medication that has X disorder on top of the thing you're treating for that type of stuff or if it could cause someone to die these things can happen and like that's kind of what happened with Vioxx is that you know like they didn't they there were some people in that room who probably Vioxx which just explain cause of strokes and some folks yeah it was anti arthritis yeah and it was like I know a guy who got a stroke from that by oh wow yeah holy shit I mean there were there were people in that room who probably look at it and said alright so there's this risk factor that that causes you to increase your possible risk factor by X percent what if somebody has all of these risk factors combined and you know like well you shouldn't approve it because there's a chance if you put it on somebody on this who has all of these combined it's there's a chance that they're going to have you know their chances of getting a stroke or you know having an issue with their what does a heart attack from it is gonna be through the roof we shouldn't approve it and it got approved anyway and it's one of those drugs that shouldn't have been put through was it hard tacs in stirrups I thought it was heart attacks stroke from it oh it's a blood clot that must mean blood clots yeah but yeah it's like it's just significant issues with some folks yeah and it's like there is a chance when you put any drug through now they try to get to things to minimize this but because a phase 3 trial only tests in you know a certain amount of the population they try to get a diverse group when you get it out you don't know what the possible effects are going to be on someone else so you might see new side effects depending on the other drugs someone is on to because you know you're not prescribing these to healthy people you're prescribing this to a sick person so yeah that that definitely can happen so that's my first certain amount of time after drugs on the market they do post they basically it's kind of phase for clinical trials you're doing post market monitoring so that does go on for a certain amount of time and sometimes drugs are pulled based on the amount of side effects the other things and that doesn't happen often but it can happen based upon you know the amount of issues that you see after it hits market what are your thoughts about advertising drugs on television like ask your doctor about this ask your doctor it's I have I would say mixed feelings but most of my feelings are that it's a bad thing and it's the only good thing I see from it and I mean most of my feelings about it are still at it's a bad idea the only good thing I see about it is that if you have a patient that's you know got a shitty to see used to work with they get aware that there's a new medication out to treat it but you know where they should be getting that information their doctor exactly so host your doctor maybe maybe you know what your doctor is if you're asking them a drug dealer but the problem is when they show these people holding hands and spinning around in a field of wheat and having the greatest time in their life and butterflies are flying around and puppies are magnetically drawn to them I'm not only enough drugs for that well that's the problem is like they they they have beautiful music plan they're manipulating you yeah like I I don't I don't feel like that like no it's not a problem and it's like you know I live I lived in England for a year and when I was over there I realized I'm not like I'm like we're all the drug advertisements like there's this is not a thing out here it's any medicines free it's different it was it was there were some things that were kind of crazy about that I like I landed in the hospital overnight once when I was there and I was so like and I you already knew that I had no co-pays when I went to a doctor I'm like I'm in the hospital overnight fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck I'm gonna like this is gonna cost me 10 grand when I left they were like did you take a cab here I'm like no why they're like oh if you had we were gonna pay for it I'm like what who are you people just give us that even though is the treatment rate is the same you go over there because I I have friends in Canada and they have massive complaints about the medical system in terms of like if you get injured it takes a long time all my relatives are I have like five relatives in this country the rest all live in Nova Scotia and there are I'd say it's a mixed bag so if you need urgent care or regular care like you need to go to the doctor for a checkup you need your you know the annuals or you have a fucking heart attack you I would say you're better off living in Canada I had a little cousin that was born with basically no chambers in her heart which is horrifying you know it's like they saw it in utero it was like okay we're gonna have to give this child an operation like almost immediately when she was born and for the next two years out surgery almost every like open-heart surgery every year on the dot every year as the heart grows and like we ask you know why and yeah I was and I mean they couldn't do all the fixing because they needed to do it as a heart got bigger and what do they do it was and I mean I I wish I knew all the technicalities but you'd have to talk to a heart surgeon chamber so what the heart look like it was I'm not exactly sure I never saw the pictures of it but I mean it's a hunt down my her father my cousins blog that documented it if you want to have a peek but it was it's a fairly rare condition the heart was I believe when she was born like it was a little closer to the center of the chest like it's a it was a very like my mom said that you know when she held her when she was first born like the pulse sings even felt or sounded a little different than a normal infant heart like it was but I mean the first at first they did a surgery that kind of put a band around the heart to give it a little more structure and then they formed more chambers and then when she was three they put in like full chambers and now she the only thing she can't do is she can't play contact sports and they paid nothing she can't play contacts for us because of because possibility of causing I'm not sure exactly what it can do but it's you know there's it can cause a little bit too much trauma to a heart that's already been you know fair through a lot of trauma but that's the only thing that she's been told not to do but don't kickbox ya know kickbox dangers I checked in the chest no games on she can I believe she can run she can she's happy active little kid looks really healthy is about the same she's she's a twin and she's got about this she's about the same height as her brother like she's a she didn't they just take it to a chiropractor where they could have just suggest this Joe she'd be fine rob the backyard maybe she never know quite a pal throw stickers one of them things the credit card just put it under her feet what's your sleep some energy for her food um I went to this one motherfucker who was treating a bunch of fighters and he was a zone healer do you know what a zone he never heard of it but I'm excited now she seemed like such a nice guy he was a chiropractor to he seemed like and it probably is a nice guy but he would press the back of your head like little spots and he's like does this hurt here does this hurt here does this hurt here and then you press harder and I go well that one was kind of lower and he's like well there could be an issue with your hypothalamus or some shit like that I was like what and so you know I'm a pretty skeptical / I've been hoodwinked before but I'm pretty skeptical and when I know it seems we are good skeptical on a part of my head harder and they ask me that part and then claiming that they can tell from the fucking skin on the cover on your skull this is the skin on your skull like they can tell like that this is that this is all you've got an issue with your liver this is the liver area when I squeeze them so it's like no this is the liver right there so me and this guy get into it and so I go I mean I'm being respectful but I'm like what are you doing and he's like well it's called zone healing he's explaining this zone healing thing to me and I'm like what is he doing I'm like well it can cure all these different diseases he starts talking to me about all these different autoimmune diseases that it can cure and all these different things I go well how's it working it's like well it's just the way that I'm manipulating you in a certain way and with the frequencies I'm like what some like come on man how the fuck is this working I'm like that doesn't make any sense and so then we get to it and he's like you understand the placebo effect right and I go yeah well the placebo effect is you give someone a pill you tell them it's medicine and somehow another it magically heals some right he's like yeah and he's like well this is essentially what we're doing I go see you're bullshitting and you're letting these people's bodies heal themselves because I wouldn't put it that way of course you wouldn't put it that way because you're charging money for this so you're saying that what you're doing doesn't really do anything he goes what it does I go it does he goes if you believe in it it does have to believe in penicillin okay exactly but that's it was so disturbing to me because I knew a bunch of guys who had gone to them oh my god this guy's fixing my name I was like what he's fixing your knee by adjusting your neck he's fixing your knee he's not fixing your knee your knee is getting healed because you're taking time off I just I will heal you know the body knows how to heal I want a reflexologist mechanic for my car I want someone to start reflexologist every same thing where they they say that it's not just that they're messing with your feet they're they're giving you a reflexology massage where they tap on certain parts of your feet and they say it's healing your liver so give me a reflexologist mechanic so that they're tapping on my tires and it's like no no I'm working on your radiator I want to see that okay I'm not aware of reflexology I've seen those places where they show like a chart of the feet and it looks might as well be a fucking palm reader yeah you walk and buy and have a one of those neon signs and so they what do they do they say that by tapping on cert like this part the the arch is really your liver and your toes are really your arch is your liver I'm not sure like I'm just but like that's the same part of shit oh yeah but like I said give me give me like the chiropractic you know reflexologist of the mechanic's world I want them to start tapping on on my oil tank and say oh really I'm fixing your alternator like like none up nobody does this shit for cars because you know why your car won't run it's a real problem with people saying they know things that they don't really know and I think people get really upset by it I think it's one of the reasons why it's so important to be honest about what you actually know what you don't actually know you know I think that's that to me is like the most important currency like you should never give up how you honestly feel and what you honestly think and what you want to see know about something and soon as soon as you are a fucking astrologer or a card reader or a palm reader or a psychic you're a bullshit artist this is you you you you're the reason you exist is because we can't really read minds yeah cuz if I could know that you don't really know that if I could see a little turkey tester pop up in your head but I know you're full of shit like oh your fucking tester popped up homie oh it's like the way you I think if anyone out there because I'm guessing your audience doesn't have a lot of people who believe in psychics but if anyone's sure they do if anyone out there truly believes in a psychic walk into one and when they ask you your name just walk right the fuck back out because if they were a real psychic they would know you were coming and they would know your name yeah maybe they weren't paying attention otherwise check to see if you're lying see my name is Fred like okay mark just walk right in walk right in give them a false story and see if they check it I have a friend who went to a psychic and he's like dude this guy knew all about my grandma I'm like don't you know about your grandma she was she was an old lady and she was grandma like and she cooked things that you like see I know about your grandma too motherfucker well they give you missile they give you these leading questions and then you give them information they're really good at reading you know banachek is oh yeah it's a friends with the Penn & Teller I love those guys there it's it's funny because I learned a lot of my writing style kind of from that and there was it was funny there was a night a backstage after the show once where I was talking about like what I was doing with with the sigh babe writing with teller and one of the things he said was about getting the script back for the chiropractic episode and they have to be really careful with how they wrote the episodes of Oh bullshit just bullshit oh yeah I'm great and it was funny because like I I turned into a skeptic from watching that show and it's you've it was just great because like I you know obviously had never heard tell her talk before I got to you know know that group and it was like that was that was the first time cuz I chitchat up with tell her a little bit before cuz I got to know pen first and hearing teller describe like after I started you know doing the Sai bate thing chit-chatting with him about that I got a little insight into his brain he's like yeah we got the script back from legal and they said just call the chiropractor's motherfuckers I'm like I gotta keep my composition but my lord that was like hearing teller say motherfuckers oh that's the way that sounds like something Penn would say to these motherfuckers it's there's basically everything you hear in Penn's tone of voice you have to love that guy it's he's I've learned a lot about I've learned a lot about skeptical responsibly from him and one of the things I've always taken away is don't blame the victim and that just that's something I've kept with me and I'll always keep with me it's he's he's been a big influence on my work and it's been it's been helpful yeah I mean we've all been hoodwinked and at some stage of your life whether it's your parents telling you about Santa Claus or something way we've been tricked and it's not your fault that you got tricked with it's a problem in man sometimes it's not even the fault of the person is tricking if they're being sincere and they're just they're just misinformed and they don't understand that what they're doing is actually harmful yep and doesn't they fight for their cause like they have this thing that they do whether it's chiropractic or whether it's being an astrologer or whatever then they like they dig in and they defend their turf yep I apologize for interrupting or saying about banachek it's you know it's if you were about to go into when they fooled people with their fake psych put the fake psychic know how good he is at reading people we had him on I did a show called Joe Rogan questions everything and banachek was one of the episodes where he was explaining to me how they do cold read yeah yeah explain to me how they lead people into giving him enough information that he can form a reasonable assessment of who they are and then he would answer certain ask sir leading questions and he's like I've just done this so many times I know how to get be and people are shocked and they don't know what to do and they've never done this before so you know it's like you can ask them questions and they start giving you information and like your parents are divorced when you were young how do you know because it's it's so common first of all and you know you could read certain things from people and I mean he showed us a bunch of shit that he does like the spoon bending fan oh yeah a bunch of different things that people want and it's funny because there's a big crossover with the magician community and the skeptic community and it's because they know how easy it is to trick the fuck out of people and I kind of love that it's kind it's been interesting to see this group of entertainers that people think of as goofballs be this kind of a little bit of a bastion of intellectualism because I like that it's hard to get people to pay attention to anything on the Internet but if you make it funny and you add a dick joke suddenly people are like I got to learn about this that's why Penn & Teller I think are so important because they were the first magicians who were really adamant than what they're doing is bullshit yeah yes they're they're like nope we're tricking you and they used that word trick and I like that yeah it's really good and it's still gonna be awesome you're still gonna watch and have a great time it's and they were they were totally up front they're like no there's no magic we're motherfucking tricking you yeah there shows god damn those shows were hilarious some of those bullshit shows where they catch people and there's the the nonsense that they're promoting one of pushing one of my favorite ones just there was a there's an episode where they attacked organic food and they did and this is this thing where people double down on things they took a banana cut it in half and it was I believe a conventionally grown banana and on one plate they'd say it was an organic banana the other plate they'd say it was a organic the other plate conventionally grown and have people take a bite out of each one and people you know they'd sit there describing the organic banana this creamy and sweet and tastes like a banana should taste and the conventionally grown yeah it's really bland and it doesn't taste good and this one girl after we explained to quote Penn is the same fucking banana and this one girl after it she's like I don't know if it makes me question my my opinion of organic versus conventional it really makes me question the concept of the banana I'm like oh girl you're dumb girl voice you can pull that off Natasha Leggero got mad at me yesterday when I did the dumb girl whores hey but I just I it's it's a skill it's one of the skills I bring to the table you can get away with it oh I'd say I I think I thought I did an ok impression of 10 but now yeah knowing no it's just enough attempting to destroy my vocal chords will will produce a pen impression almost well I think it's a unique time for exposing bullshit and you know because there's enough articles and videos there's enough like you can kind of get a sense like oh I see a pattern here people a lot of people I think people are tired of not knowing what's real on the Internet and it's partially like this whole trend with fake news and like there there's kind of a breaking point I think in terms of what people are willing to accept for just shit being spewed on the internet and being accepted as real because there's so much content out there and people want to spend their time reading stuff that's for real and that they can trust and they don't want to trust shitty sources you know like they want to go alright here's a source I can trust I can keep going back to this website I can get good information and they want things explained that they know was researched well and I think that this is this is a valuable good to offer out to people saying you know here's something real and here's something and here's a dick joke to read while you're reading something real so I am for a good dick joke to research ratio that's important as well now when you did this article and you know you said it was 4,000 words it's a particularly long article what what did you have to omit I mean do you seem like I mean when you're dealing with 4,000 words I mean it was it just the comprehensive coverage and why chiropractic medicine is bullshit or is it just like like god damn I got to keep this thing as tight as I can but there's so much to talk about well it's I was gonna joke well I do get paid by the word no that's it that's true but it wasn't like I never go into it going let's make it as long as I can or make it as short as I can we like I'm a contributing writer at the outline now and this is and it's whenever we write a piece it's always let's make it cover the topic in as entertaining and and as as cohesive as of a story as possible and we'll go for let's go we kind of say what points do we want to cover in this piece and sometimes it's and it's basically to tell a good story and my goal whenever I write an article and something is let's write the best let's write a piece so that I never have to cover this topic again and with chiropractic like I like I could one thing I would have liked to have covered if somehow we could have made it like either you know if somehow we could have condensed it a little as so we could have fit something else in I would have maybe added in a piece on are there science-based chiropractors is that possible is it possible to be a science-based card reader yeah I mean that's the problem it's like I feel like like it was we tried to present one point of view while still giving a hat to like we included a link on some chiropractors that are showing you know that they're trying to be science-based so I think that adding in a whole section on it would have maybe diminished from the point of view of it so being making it good reading and you know a cohesive point of view is always important to the article let me stop me there yeah you say some chiropractor science-based if it was bullshit when it started if it was something that was created by a magnetic healer it was it was a nonsense thing that came from a seance how does that ever become science-based if the original the origin it's not based on medical research where they figured out that if you do this look here's all the studies that we've shown when you do this this is the immune system response that the body has to you and there's none of that right it doesn't exist well there is there is some and it's some but minor evidence subjective pain relief yeah and I don't want to diminish and this is something that I'm sure people are sitting there like with daggers still mad at us for saying you know for questioning their their subjective experiences I don't want to tell people that they did not feel relief from what they cause pain is it's really subjective and it's hard to manage sure so I think that there are chiropractors who aim specifically to relieve low back pain and I mean I think if you aim just to do that with your chiropractic practice while still telling people look I'm just doing this while you go to physical therapy you should still be going to a physical therapist this is an adjunctive thing solely to relieve pain and they try to see how it can just relieve pain I think it's possible that that can do that but I think that adding that into the article takes away from it a bit because that that's not part of the articles point of view and it's also not part of my point of view of how it's not a science-based practice so I think that and I mean I've seen some ethical chiropractors there's Sam hammam Allah I'm not sure how to pronounce his name I've never heard it said out loud before but that was one of the chiropractors who I cited in there who you know he's continued to practice while speaking out against the chiropractic very vocally speaking out against chiropractic as a whole because he's seen that it can you know and there is something still manipulating back he is but he's what it's going on there what does that do and that's one of those things where I feel like I'm in a gray area because I don't want to diminish the people who have said that it's helped them have pain relief but I also think these people should be going to you know to a you know to a physical therapist and to a massage therapist so like I'm not sure what the I'm not sure what the exact right answer is on that if someone says I've been to a physical therapist I've been to a massage therapist and this is the only thing that's ever made it feel better and I went in one session what do you say like and I I don't know where the exact right answer is to that owner but if it all started from bullshit it seems so hard if the foundation is bullshit yeah and I mean I mean I went to a guy that was really good at a bunch of other stuff like he would give you an EMS electrical muscular stimulation those pads on my laser he had really good massage therapists he provided physical therapy he had a little gym set up Oh at the end of the day still cracking backs well here's a question what if and and this is I got it this is completely a hypothetical what if it hadn't been by this nutjob magnetic healer and it was a doctor who said oh this can you know this can't help and if it was a just an osteopath who is trying to see if this could help relieve pain along with physical therapy so I encourage people if they're if they are looking for a way that manipulation can help maybe not go to a chiropractor but seek out in your medical practice an osteopath who can who knows much more about Anatomy and please keep going to a physical therapist and maybe a massage therapist because I just feel fucking great yeah they do it's just it's so hard to say that you know there's like science-based ones when it all started out with bullshit like you know it's gonna be it will be very hard for you to find a you know quote-unquote science-based chiropractor please if you're you know if the only thing that's relieving your back pain and I get it I have you know I have scoliosis back pain issues are very hard to manage you know an osteopath will understand your Anatomy much better they're not going to say you have to come back in three times a week they're gonna send you to a physical therapist and you know maybe recommend a massage but they'll they'll do it in a in an ethical fashion and not overstep their reach but that's you know there is some evidence that it helps with lower back pain but not more than physical therapy or massage and that's I think what people should take away from this I'm not saying it can't do anything I'm saying it's not the best thing and that's also a problem because most chiropractors also incorporate massage and it's so hard to decide like what what is helping you yeah I mean that's like I think it's and I get it like I'm I don't want to I think the hardest part is telling people of their subjective experience is wrong that's like you don't I don't want to be that asking who's like necessarily you're saying it's wrong but you're saying reevaluate what the root cause yeah and it's a like I yeah I mean it's like if you went to a chiropractor you're not stupid you're not wrong you're not a moron you're you know you're someone who's suffering and I both of both of us understand that it's just you know make sure you're not being that the person who's selling to you isn't selling a line and not telling you they can fix your immune system and cure your baby to the point where it please don't let someone do that to you because stomach measles is a you know measles is a real thing thank you chicken pox mumps it's AI and this is kind of a have did you uh it's have you ever gotten whooping cough because that one's I got it's horrible I got it as an adult because this is kind of this is kind of shitty they do need to make a new whooping cough vaccine that is not a reason not to get it please get it please remit but the whooping cough vaccine when they made it some strains of it wore off faster than was originally expected somebody came into my lab and we were I mean we were given you know along with our packages working to labs ago at a drug testing lab we were given health insurance and it was around the time of the first Obamacare debate you know when people are law like I don't need to buy health care and one of the guys in the lab who was all why should I get health care I'm healthy he showed up with whooping cough and for two weeks we didn't know he had it he was just sick and everyone's like Craig go to the doctor Craig go to the doctor Craig go to the doctor five of us got whooping cough from one guy from one guy let him hear the end of it um fucking Craig it's fucking Craig man fucking Craig I I was out of we all had to say I'd have worked for five days all of us who had it so and I'm like and within the course of a month and this was just bad luck within the course of a month I had had hip surgery to tour a tour ligament to my hip running an ultramarathon never don't don't run an ultra marathon it's a bad idea was hit in a car accident and got whooping cough wouldn't wait that was six weeks so I'm like I had no vacation time left to miss work and I was out because somebody coughed on me everybody mind runs ultra marathons all the time there are it's I didn't realize at the time that I had a joint disorder yeah well don't run them if you have a joint don't run if you don't build up to him right oh no you need to trend I mean I trained properly I just I didn't realize I'm like my hip is hurting and I went to my surgeon and this is this is something that I that chiropractic does yell about in the pain care system and in the medical system that they have a point about doctors to throw pills that you have hazard Lee my doctor and I'm I'm never gonna not be mad about this my doctor instead of saying we should do a scan with Khan trash to see what's going on because you're really complaining about this chucked me a bottle of vicodin and said go ahead and run yeah Wow doctors names I'm not going to say because you know it's there was some part of me that was really happy that I got to do my ultra but god damn it if you need vicodin to run a marathon don't do it doctor vicodin oh yeah it's I mean don't don't do that but I mean it was funny because after I ran it I'm like alright I don't need to you know take the medication anymore because I'm not running and suddenly I realized how fucked up my hip was and it was like oh my god I can barely walk like what was wrong with the heavy tore ligaments about tore my labrum and it was like it was that tightened up I just I don't know it's I mean there's all I have are like two little scars cuz like it was it was such an easy surgery that the day of surgery it felt less bad than it did the day before Wow and it was like it was funny was the week that I turned 29 I'm like it's turning 29 and already I'm getting hip surgery I'm like this was this was a yeah so that was my my all of my surgeries have been on I'm pretty sure my parents dropped me as a baby and just won't admit to it cuz my headache left side three surgeries on my left shoulder surgery on my left hip I'm right-handed it's I'm right-handed but I'm a because you're doing everything with your right sides and left sides atrophy ambidextrous I'm sure one of my friends is an archery instructor and I'm learning how to how to shoot bows and arrows you know just think just in case the revolution comes no not really but it's I'm off I shoot with my bow hand my strong hand is my left hand and I'm like my mom's dominant on my left eye which one gets you back on the yep pull back on the left and my right arm keeps getting bruised like crazy and I have to keep explaining to people that I'm not getting hit because you're slapping the skin yes slapping with yes keep going why don't you put one of those wrist things on or the wrong thing I have one and it's the worst this is the worst thing that happens because like all I have to do is go like this to get my arm out of the way and instead the couple of those lures is when the string catches right here and this giant right you use a compound bow or a traditional bow I think it's a long but I don't know if it's this cams in it like these big no it's it's a really it's a fairly simple starter bow it's my first my friend Anna she's she knows all the things we're doing it's like I'm I just kind of show up from like please let me not kill myself so it's work how it's it's a it's a thing where it's like it's a lot of fun and I'm I'm loving the crap out of it it's great great workout especially for your lats and and your upper shoulders but it's like dear God I'm I'm still clueless at what I'm doing it's funny because like she's like she's won a few tournaments she knows what she's doing I'd gone shooting with her a few times then we went out my boyfriend came with us and like he's hitting bull's eyes right away I'm like I'm like how the are you fucking kidding me he just naturally great at it I'm like what but I'm like I I saw on meditation oh yeah it's just you're just you're sitting there going who who do I want to pretend isn't a turkey but it's not what you do really no not at all I'm not I'm not angry it's it's funny I put all my all of my rage goes into my writing and like that's that's like all of the I'm like anger daddy issues all the time so I didn't like why didn't this work goddammit all the anger goes into the writing like the archery is just meditative like it's it's relaxing it's like you're out in an open field there's it's like it's a really nice little archery range up in Glendale yeah I feel like it's one of those things where when you're doing it it requires so much focus it kind of like drains you of distractions you're just you're funny whatever here's my nerdy moments whenever we walk from the car to the range I turn on superhero soundtracks and just walk out there I'm like I can feel every hero's entrance like it's the soundtrack to Deadpool I'm like I'm like I can I can feel slightly like a badass for five seconds okay
