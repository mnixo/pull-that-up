ladies and gentlemen Chris Kresser Joe good EVP wait buddy good to see ya we are here because of the film the game changers I watched it I watched it today I watched the whole thing from start to finish and I have to say before we even start I liked the guy who's in it very much James Wilkes very nice guy he's an excellent fighter he won the ultimate fighter and I don't think he's a bad person I've only had a little bit interaction with him just over the past couple days via email he seems like a really great guy yeah a very good guy genuine I I would we're gonna talk we're just gonna get into it so listen what what was your thoughts on the film and what did what stood out immediately okay so a little bit of context you know I think this film was the best of all the vegan documentaries that have been made I'll just say that up front I think it's pretty well done as a film yes you know it's got a big-budget pretty good storyline and Cameron Jackie Chan lots of celebrity you know it's good graphics like it's just a well-made film yeah and I think it's especially for someone who doesn't have the background to you know or science awareness to critique some of the claims it's going to be really persuasive and compelling and I've definitely you know whenever a film like this comes out my email inbox just blows up like I've seen this film what oh my god you know I'm eating meat I'm gonna kill myself and right it's just like famous cigarettes right and you know I was talking to Jamie about it before we started recording like I could set my watch to it every year there's something like this happens and I've got to do a response I consider it part of mine it's part of my public you think that they're making these films cuz they believe what they're saying or do you think they're making these films because they are trying to convert people to being vegan and they think that distorting reality and just bending things and cherry-picking data is acceptable because the long run the benefits of getting the world to shift over to a vegan diet it's worth not being completely objective or honest about the actual facts no I think they believe it I think people like I mean James for example I think he's genuinely trying to help people I think he's looked at the data and he just came to a different conclusion then somebody like me has and you know I mean this is there's something called confirmation bias and I'm sure many of your guests have talked about but it's a basic human tendency where we we tend to only look at the data that support our point of view and discount the rest of it right and it's you know even really really good scientists have a hard time overcoming not everybody is guilty of it to some degree including me but I think yeah so I think generally the people who are making these films really believe in it they they believe in the the power of vegan diet you know from a nutrition perspective and they also believe that it's going to help save the world the beginning of it I thought was so strange when James talked about being injured and doing all the research they did which seems like an extraordinary amount of really see it like a thousand hours of research and that the thing that stood out was that the Roman gladiators at least in this one particular location according to the analysis of their bones it appears that they had a vegetarian diet yeah there's a lot of grain that was strange too I mean first of all gladiators were basically prisoners of war criminals so the diet they're being fed isn't prison food yeah it's their slaves that are forced to fight to the death they had a life expectancy of about two years once they became a gladiator and it's interesting they featured Fabien Kahn's who is the scientist you remember who they talked to and definitely seemed to kind of buy into the plant-based diet idea or the idea that they were vegetarian you know by design or by choice and they didn't talk to his collaborator called Carl Gershman who's been quoted in the media saying you a quote and by the way all of the references full bibliography show notes everything are at crecer dot CEO slash game-changers because I want this to be totally evidence-based people can check what I'm saying right there so he said the vegetarian diet had nothing to do with poverty or animal rights gladiators it seems were fat consuming a lot of simple carbohydrates such as barley and legumes like beans was designed for survival in the arena packing in the carbs also packed on the pounds gladiators needed subcutaneous fat a fat cushion protects you from cut wounds and shields nerves and blood vessels in a fight so they were basically fattening them up so they could survive longer in in the arena it's not an ideal diet for you know fighting and muscle protein synthesis and nutrition it was basically to fatten them up so they could survive longer this seems so obvious that I couldn't believe it was actually in the film and it seemed it just seemed blatantly deceptive because everyone knows what their life was it's not like these were these elite athletes that were competing in the Olympic Games these were people that they were sending out to die for other people's enjoyment right and the name I'm my Latins terrible I bet I think it was a whore tre or something I mean it's like barley eater yes it was an epithet it was an insult it wasn't you know a compliment it was like haha you can you only can afford to eat barley yeah so yeah I was a bizarre way to start the film I thought there could have been better ways to do it and let me also just say like if this film if the purpose of this film was to say it's possible to thrive on a plant-based diet and look here's some athletes that have done that I wouldn't have had any qualms with it clearly there are examples of people who thrive on a plant-based diet yes if you follow the diet correctly can be done rich role we talked about last time Scott Jurek who's one of the athletes in the film seem to do well doggie Bausch who's one of the athletes in the film if you really plan it well and you understand what you're doing and you're on it it's totally possible I no dispute with that but where I take issue with it is it went a step further and said this is the optimal diet for athletes and everybody else which you know even though it was a film ostensibly about athletes it definitely crossed the line into this is the approach that everybody should do yeah I mean they made these claims like all the sudden people got stronger and faster and more endurance like there's no evidence to support that there's no evidence other than there are anecdotal statements of what they did there's no one has ever put anyone on a vegan diet and then run them through extreme endurance tests and found a significant increase in vo2 max or muscle strength or any of those things none of this has ever been done so if it's if it's true anecdotally for these people it would have been really interesting if there was some actual data to go with that where they showed studies right I mean we have James talking about his ability to do the battle ropes but all of a sudden he could do an hour and before he could only do ten minutes well I find that really hard to believe that you gained fifty minutes of your battle rope time just from ropes and if that was the only thing in the film that I've found hard to believe you know I'd have to let it go I mean the guy's an athlete he's an amazing athlete was a great fighter he's got fantastic endurance is excellent martial arts technique I would just buy it at face level or at face value but there's a lot of those there's a lot and then I mean we can go through it and talk about I mean there's that problem which is there's no peer-reviewed evidence to back that up but even the anecdotal evidence is a little shaky is when we start to talk about some of the athletes in the film and there are also examples of athletes outside of the film who you know switch to a vegan diet and we look and see what happened to them after they did that the problem here is something that I call the vegan honeymoon which is you know you take someone who's been on a standard American diet they're eating KFC McDonald's etc and they switched from that to a plant-based diet well of course they're gonna feel better they've gone from eating absolute crap to real foods yes and so for a period of time they're going to feel better for sure but then what happens over a longer period of time you know so I'm not getting enough protein just in terms of quantity and not getting the right quality of protein that starts have an impact micronutrient deficiencies you know vitamin A zinc calcium iron things like that take a while to develop so you're not going to see that decline in performance happen right away it might take three months it might take six months might take nine months it depends on all kinds of factors genetics health status going into it the type of exercise and activity that they're doing the way they're implementing the diet etc so you have to not just look at what happens a month after someone goes vegan you have to look at what happens six months a year after or two years after and we can look at specific examples of that so in the absence of the correct amount of amino acids a correct amount of specific nutrients you start to see a slow decline right so and this is something that they're not taking into account yeah one of the things they talked about was protein content and I immediately knew that this was not correct or that they're being deceptive they were talking about three ounces of steak versus what are they compared peanut butter sandwich and maybe some lentils is that what it was oh boy well the problem is the amino acid profile of that steak is far superior the amount of protein that your body absorbs is far superior it's said that you're talking about a completely different thing this is known science you can get as many amino acids from plant-based proteins but you Edin need to eat a higher quantity you know right that's that's what's important not the overall grams of protein it's the quality of the protein what's the amino acid of the profile of the protein and how does your body absorb it again this does not mean like I'm a giant fan of hemp protein I eat that stuff all the time it's great it's just you can't say that protein grams are equal to protein grams because they're not no but it's even worse than that Jamie pull-ups live for if you can there's I made some graphics here because it's sometimes easier to understand when you're looking at a picture so for the peanut butter sandwich thing it was like there's a there's the same amount of protein in a peanut butter sandwiches there is in three ounces of beef so I looked up the data of course so three ounces of 90 percent lean ground beef has 24 grams of protein you get two slices of wheat bread will give them the benefit of the that it's whole-wheat not white bread that's 5 grams 1 tablespoon of peanut butter is 4 grams so you'd have to have 5 tablespoons of peanut butter in that sandwich to equal 3 ounces of beef that's 1/3 of a cup of peanut butter it's a lot of fun you ever made a peanut butter sandwich with 1/3 cup of you've probably have but I'm a glutton and that's 600 calories yeah versus 200 calories from the ground beef for the just for the same amount same routine just quantity I'm not even getting into quality and I'm gonna get into that in fact we're just talking about quantity approach but I think they were saying peanut butter sandwich and a cup of lentils right wasn't the combined no I think they said 3 or or a cup of lentils or was more yeah so would plus a couple of yeah yeah then as you pointed out it's all about protein quality and this as you said this is an established science firmly established science they look at this especially like in third world countries where protein deficiency is common so to try to figure out how to address that what are the highest quality proteins that we can feed these people to bring them up to where they should be in terms of protein intake so the the most recent scale that's used is called Adeus digestible indispensable amino acid score so it ranks proteins according to two main categories one is the amino acid profile and as you mentioned when it comes to protein quality it's not just does the protein have every amino acid you know this is what's a little disingenuous about the film they said every plant protein has every amino acid well yeah nobody it disagrees with that but does it have enough of each of them that's the key question what's the quantity what's the profile so the DIA slicks an amino acid profile but then it also looks at bioavailability protein is not worth worth much if you can't actually digest and absorb it so it's a complex you know algorithm that combines all those things and that ranks the proteins on a scale so the Dia's for beef rare beef is 1.3 9 it's among the highest scores on the whole scale the Dia's for egg is 1.13 for peanut butter at 0.45 and for wheat at 0.2 those are among the lowest proteins there that have been measured on the scale so even if the quantity was the same the effect on your body particularly on things like muscle protein synthesis which is of concern you know for athletes is not even in the same ballpark and when they're talking about the u.s. RDA they're talking about like how much you know the United States recommended daily allowances that is isn't that just to be healthy like to be a lot unhealthy but to be alive there's being a lot more accurate it's the avoid it's the amount that's required to avoid malnutrition right and clean so thanks I know that yeah right so I'm you know why don't they know that I'm not doing any documentaries on food why don't they know that seems like so - use that as a reference point to use that as like look you can get this that's plenty that's crazy well that's a common argument in the vegan community and they you know I don't know whether it's because they they really don't understand the science behind it or because they do and they're just you know it's being kind of exaggerated to suit the their claim I can't know that you know this is what I think it is honestly there's a lot of vegan influencers and there's a lot of people that make youtube videos and people who produce things like this and then the other folks just parrot what they say right so instead of reading the actual studies and talking to objective researchers who have gone over the evidence and disputed the claims that are in these films like a debunking of one of these films will get way less views right then the actual film itself that's just how it goes nobody's gonna watch and so especially the people that already convinced for them it's like excellent I knew Jesus was real now I've got the proof you know I mean it's really like that it becomes the ideology becomes so strong it becomes like a religion and look I've been accused of it from doing it from a meat perspective I understand I understand that you would think that if you had an opposing vegan or vegetarian perspective like I totally understand but man you know we'd be sorry for that with a joke on discussion and you see it on almost every time someone who's actually informed has a conversation with one of these influencers like they're not being a hundred percent accurate objective or even honest in a lot of cases yeah I mean there's a great Leon Festinger quote I know if you've heard it a man with conviction is a hard man to change tell him you disagree and he turns away show him the facts and figures any questions your sources appeal to logic and he fails to see your point the best argument in my opinion is this factory farming is disgusting and that the cruelty of treating animals like like a commodity and serving them up for slaughter in these horrific conditions these factory farming conditions and these horrible pens that we've all seen that's the argument for veganism I agree when we're talking about performance and health this is where it just gets very frustrating for me it was like if you want to make an argument that you should probably follow a more complicated diet more complicated meaning that it's more difficult for you to acquire in some cities you have to be a little bit more careful about getting supplementation with vitamin b12 and an essential amino acid it's got to be a little bit more careful if you want to maintain a healthy robust life it's possible to do that but it's a little more complicated and if you want to say I want to live like that because the way I feel about eating animals makes me feel terrible I don't want to have any part of that and I found out that I can not have a part of that and I can live my life that's great but that's not what they're saying no and there's a lot of problems with that argument too I want to come back and spend some chew on that but I don't do it right now before we move on because it's a we just covered it all right can so I want to go back to the end I'm gonna push back because I'm super important yes yeah so where to start with that so first of all you know that the idea that plant-based agriculture doesn't kill animals it's just false I mean there have been studies that show that particularly mono cropping type of plant agriculture kills far more animals and are killed in you know from eating cows for example insects rodents you know mice birds fish all you know killed in the process of industrial agriculture and so that presents an an ethical dilemma really if you are saying I'm a vegan because I don't want my food choices to involve killing animals is killing you know a whole bunch of small non mammal animals better than killing mammals or what about killing more small animals than one cow right is is that the size matter does it you know where do you draw the line between an animal that is like sentient enough or cute enough maybe to not be killed versus let me clarify what you're saying - you're saying more animals per meal so you like if you want to have a meal out of wheat you're most likely more animals are going to die than if you want to say if you have a hundred meat wheels me wheat meals rather 100 meals with wheat in them you're probably killing more animals and if you have a hundred meals with cows in them because that's like a cow yeah I don't know the answer to that question I just I'm comparing kind of the whole process you know like eating animals versus eating plants and and I don't know if that per meal comparison has ever been done but I'm just saying that that's an interesting ethical question let me give you their argument for that they say that most of these mono crops are to feed animals yeah that is a problem I mean I where I agree with this film is that conventional livestock practices are harmful but what they're saying is that you're saying that eating a vegan diet and all these mono crops that these mono crops are killing all these small animals they're saying no these mono crops most of them actually exist to feed livestock that's that's not true I mean if you follow this through I mean especially when you start talking about like fake meat and some you know yeah they're all what what are those based on soils yeah yeah their industrial crops their not you know growin on the family farm these are industrial GMO mono crops massive mass on a massive scale there was a great study published in the journal penis in 2017 and that it was specifically addressing this claim of wood removing animal products from our diet have you know saved the world basically would it reduce greenhouse gases would it improve our nutrition basically they found that it would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2.6 percent but our intake of carbohydrates total calories would go way up and the incidence of nutrient deficiencies would go way up and they did the math and found that without animal products domestic supplies of calcium epa and DHA went through the long-chain omega-3 fats retinol and b12 work quote insufficient to meet the requirements of the u.s. population so translation everybody would have to be supplementing with those nutrients if everyone went on a vegan diet and they went on to say that basically the there's already a surplus of calories in the diet of a hundred and forty five percent if everyone went if we removed animal products entirely that would go up to two hundred and thirty percent so that because the volume of calories and food that would be required to meet basic nutrient and protein needs would be that much higher so you know there's a lot of downstream consequences that I don't think have been fully thought through even if a plant-based diet might work for one person does it will it scale you know if you if you take that to the full level like everyone eating a plant-based diet which is the argument that is being made does it really work from a nutritional perspective from an from an environmental perspective and even from an ethical perspective the environment the environmental perspective is legitimate they both cause environmental damage both animal agricultural and plant agriculture there's industrial industrial practices cause environmental damage and if you want to feed 320 million people you're not going to do it through organic farms you're gonna you're gonna have to I mean you can grow food in your neighborhood I mean if you live in a small town you guys can have a co-op you can have food in your backyard that you can grow but if you're living in a city like Los Angeles it's highly likely your food is not coming from that city itself so that that means it has to be grown and if you're gonna grow food for 20 million people you need a giant chunk of land if you need that giant chunk of land even if everybody's eating vegan that means wildlife is gonna be 2 plays displays the the area where you're growing crops it's going to be a mono crop culture you're not gonna have all these plants living together like they do in the wild that's just not how you grow food for 20 million people in a very specific area you just don't do that yeah I know you had Joel Salatin on the show back and and Allan savory talked a lot about this that you know one of the biggest issues right now is soil soil erosion soil is eroding you know that the FAO is said we only have about sixty harvests left if soil continues to degrade at the rate that it's going and so one of the arguments for regenerative holistically managed livestock is that that can actually help reject regenerate healthy soils and some like Joel Salatin or Alan Cirie would argue that that's the only way we're gonna be able to feed the world because only about six about 60% of available land is not suitable for cropping even if we decided hey let's just plant soy and corn and and you know plant plants everywhere we couldn't because it's too rocky or hilly or the soils not adequate to do that but it could be used for livestock there's a thing that they keep saying that you brought up slightly you touched on it a little bit earlier the thing is that greenhouse gases and they were talking about the greenhouse gases from meat and it's just a fake number I mean it's over the top it's over the top not true yeah the specific numbers nine percent for all agriculture all agriculture including growing crops the vast majority of all of our greenhouse gas issues are coming from transportation and from industry this is this is undisputable so this this is where I wonder too about like whether it's is this dissing gently is this that are they not aware of the what's happening here or is it disingenuous because so so here's the thing here's what they did Joe so that the number in this specific number in the film they say greenhouse gas emissions from Callao or 15 percent and that and they compared that to 14 percent for all of transportation but the problem with that is that they're using the full lifecycle analysis for cat for livestock so that means you know the carbon needed for feed for transport for processing the cattle not just emissions not just methane burps from the cattle whereas for transportation they're only looking at what it were called direct tailpipe emissions just the emissions that come out of the tailpipe they're not looking at the carbon needed to manufacture the vehicle the cars the buses the airplanes the inputs for making the fuel the fuel production and distribution the final use of the fuel that life cycle analysis for transportation hasn't been done just because it's enormous ly complex and it would be a phenomenally big number the EPA is estimated that something around 80 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions comes from industry basically fossil fuel so there it's not an apples to apples comparison they're right they're doing the full lifecycle for livestock versus just the direct emissions for transportation well if we look at just the direct for both it's 5% for livestock globally and 14% for transportation but in the u.s. it's only three point nine percent for livestock because we have more efficient practices here versus 14 percent for transportation so not even in the same ballpark and it's it just it's yeah I mean they can just say that in the film most people hear that nod their head because they've heard those numbers before but the devil is always in the details well what's going on is what what you see in a lot of these videos where only one person gets to talk right one person who has a specific agenda gets to cherry-pick the data and distort it and then put it on the filming and you can accuse us of doing that right now because both of us are clearly on the same page yeah and I would be happy to have James come in with you afterwards yeah just but we decided it with Joel yes and we did well James is way more reasonable than Joel and not slimy so I'd be happy to do that and I think that when when it's all said and done I I would just like people to be informed and your everyone is going to have their own ideological bias everyone's going to have their own preference everyone but to make poorly informed decisions or that's being kind to be more blunt deceptive information forming your decisions and and and having health consequences because of that to me pisses me off and freaks me out yeah because it's it's not the health aspects are not being represented accurately yeah it particularly bothers me when kids are involved oh it was another there was a case recently where I was gonna tweet it but I was like god damn I can't even tweet it so sad where a child had died from malnutrition yeah because the parents were feeding in a vegan diet and all the other kids look like they were starving to death too and then the you know social workers came in and thought it's a goddamn nightmare and you don't hear I mean if you hear about that from people that are starving their kids on a regular diet they're just either extremely poor or they're monsters and they're treating their kid terribly these people don't seem like they're bad people know that's recipe areas you believe in what they're doing they're trying to do the right thing that's the scariest part about it is like you're seeing that this does diet again you can do it correctly but it's fucking complicated it's hard yeah just one more thing on the greenhouse gas questioned all the numbers I just gave you were from conventional methods you know like basically CAFO beef when they have looked at regenerative holistically managed livestock they found that it can either be carbon neutral or even a carbon sink so there's a guy who's written some papers on this Richard Teague and in his 2018 paper which again you can find on my website the crusted CEO slash game-changers he found that these larger more complex holistically manage sites can sequester between 3 to four and even up to seven tons of carbon per hectare per year so these holistically managed beef operations are actually removing carbon from the outside an a chiral biogenic cycle and the difference and this is important to understand is the difference between transportation which is basically taking out fossil fuels that have not been part of that natural cycle for millions of years and then just emitting them into the atmosphere with the carbon the the biogenic carbon cycle you have methane you know cows are burping out methane methane goes up into the atmosphere and then via hydroxyl oxidation it's converted into co2 and water vapor then the plants take in co2 and by and then by a photosynthesis they convert it into food basically and then the cows eat the food and the whole cycle keeps going and this is this is a natural cycle this is not something you have to use equipment - the natural cycle so it just has to be a certain amount of plant life and in their area and so the way that I mean like Joel Salatin for example from Polyface farms and and savory Institute they basically educate farmers on how to rotate their livestock again this is not my area of expertise but rather than just having the cattle stay in the same place the whole time like in a feedlot they're moving the cattle around the cattle are pooping then they bring the chickens to where that was you know where the cattle were and they they move it around in a way again that I don't fully understand but the effect of this is that the amount of carbon that is sequestered from the atmosphere is greater than the amount of co2 that is emitted and this these life cycle analyses have been done and published in the literature it's true that right now that type of holistically managed livestock is not very common but that doesn't mean that it's what we should be doing and you know this is the thing like with the film I agree with the problem that they you know the premise which is that the feedlot beef production is a nightmare you know if it can be bad for the environment and we have to do something about it where we disagree is what the solution is yeah you know they go to a plant-based diet or fake meat or lab meat I go to regenerative holistically managed livestock okay so this animal product like the the regenerative livestock production doing it in this method is that sufficient to feed everyone the production I mean how much land do you need to do something like this so I and you're gonna ask that question and I talk to savory Institute about this and a few other people and basically one response is it's the only way we're gonna feed everybody because as I mentioned they're only 60 harvests left because of soil degradation so continually you know trying to scale up industrial plant agriculture with soy and corn and and all of these kinds of crops is going to further degrade the soil and at some point we're not gonna have any soil F Texas doctor right we should talk about this that you need compost and you need fertilizer and you need something that replenishes the soil and doing these large-scale monoculture crops when you have these enormous areas they're just depleting right they're just pulling and then they have to add you can't add something for nothing that's the thing we're not just we're not choosing between like you know to one really good alternative in one terrible alternative that's not a choice like never seen before if it show like that's not even a choice you just do you just obviously do the right thing we're choosing it's like on the one hand if we try to scale up plant agriculture in an environment where according to the FAO our soils are in only quote fair poor or very poor condition and we only have 60 harvests last left due to rapidly deteriorating soil due to erosion and nutrient depletion then we desperately need new methods of restoring healthy soil and if we can do that with regenerative holistically managed livestock which has been shown you know in the scientific literature to be possible then that may be the only way we can feed everybody so we would need to almost have a reversal if that was the case and have more animal agriculture than plant agriculture but not the way it's being done now right it would have a fee so they would have to be like Joel Salatin setup yeah so we're probably Facebook need three things to happen one would be we'd need to return all the crop lands that are being used to feed livestock and feed Lots right now to grassland and number two we need to put all unused land like the rocky hilly soil that are or land that can't be used for plant agriculture into production for with animals and number three farmer farmers and ranchers would need to adopt regenerative practices you know so I'm not saying this is an enormous undertaking you're not we're talking but so is feeding the world with plant based agriculture but whichever direction we go we're talking about saying you know really systemic change that needs to happen in a big way what percent that this would have you'd have to have all of the meat be grass-fed meat because they would be eating what they naturally eat now what is the percentage of grass-fed meat in this country currently I don't know for sure I think the number I read was something like two or three percent so very low very small yeah yeah that makes sense many many people prefer grain-fed meat they like it fatty and sloppy no I mean that's what it is right a lot of people like that remark well what's interesting and I didn't even know this until a few years ago even fact you know feedlot meat is mostly grass-fed it's just what happens in the last like five or ten percent of the process so it's like 90 percent grass-fed and then it's grain finished and that grain finishing gives it the marbling that what you're talking about what makes the I'm sick I mean that's really they're not supposed to eat that really that's what it is and we've gotten addicted to animals eating things they're not supposed to eat and the way their flesh comes out yeah I mean eighty a lot of that is that you're eating things like soy cakes you know they which is a byproduct of soybean oil production soybean oil consumption has grown like a thousandfold in the past hundred and twenty years it's now the the number one edible oil that we eat because if you go into the supermarket and you look at any food label it's not soybean oil soybean oil soybean oil so the oil is valuable and then they take the cakes that are left over from the oil production process and feed them to cows and so yeah they're eating stuff that they wouldn't normally have eaten in that scenario yeah so both scenarios as you said are almost insane feeding everyone and then also like what do we do with the animals if we're gonna stop eating meat like let's let's say if this entire country stops eating me what do we do with the animals we give them birth control make a die of old age do they go extinct if they don't go upstate who houses them who feeds them what do we do with them we never eat them how do we kill all the wild pigs I mean another question is what do we do with the feed the things that we're feeding the animals if that stuff you composes it releases carbon into the atmosphere as well but at least when you feed it to animals you're taking food that is inedible to humans like I'm not gonna eat soy cakes and I think you are grass fobs corn stalks leftover grains after which you make whiskey and other types of alcohol you feed those to cattle they upcycle that into highly nutrient dense and bioavailable protein what James said the number of times in the film was cattle or animals are just the middleman I'm like exactly they're really amazing middlemen they take food that is inedible to humans and turn it into super nutrient-dense food that we can that we can digest and absorb I mean thank you yeah this I mean it's just it's so confusing when a film like this gets made because so many people get up in arms and so many people get influenced by it and so many people think that this is the way to go my take on a lot of this is there's a lot of people that have kind of fashioned their careers out of this ideology whether they believe it or not you know the thing is like we can go down that road of said we could say okay so this film was made by James you know James Cameron was one of the filmmakers he also is the owner of verdiant foods which is a pea protein company and he said it he has the goal of becoming the biggest organic pea protein company and in the world he's invested 140 million dollars into it his wife Suzy Cameron is finding a chain of vegan schools and so you know from one perspective that's conflict of interest you know this it this is an agenda driven film it's not a dispassionate objective look you know scientific look at the vegan diet but you know I mean you can make that argument about just about anyone at this point like is it that surprising that a vegan film has a bunch of vegan medical experts in it is it surprising that those experts invest in what they believe in and that they write books about it I don't think so you know but but it's important to know that and to not confuse a film like that with a scientific work yes that's my problem with this is the what is it the american college of lifestyle medicine i have to look this up one of these organizations is offering CEUs to doctors who watch this film and complete a quiz that's absolutely ridiculous this has not been pure this is not peer-reviewed science this is not something that doctors should be getting CEUs for what does he you continuing education units so like basically doctors have to do any medical professional has to do a certain amount of continuing education you know generally you go to like an accredited seminar or class or whatever and and that's how you do it but they're actually offering those for people who doctors who watch this film and complete a short quiz and yeah that's freaky so I don't know if we talked about this on the contour and one of the previous one yeah I was American College of lifestyle medicine well they were founded by seventh-day adventists at Loma Linda University the seventh-day Adventist Church do you know about this or vegetarian yeah so it was one of the founders was Ellen White and she taught that meat was a toxic substance and that flesh should be avoided because it increases our carnal urges it was a moral religious thing and first and then one of the other an early Adventist church member Lenna Cooper she co-founded the American Dietetic Association which is still to this day one of our major Dietetics organizations and she wrote textbooks that were used in Dietetic and nursing programs all around the world for four thirty years so we have this weird meshing that goes back to like the early 20th century between religion and science - the seventh-day Adventists have better health overall in general they do they've like one of those bhaijaan people but the argument is often made that that's related to diet well it could be that it's it's related to you know part of their Creed is to eat healthy Whole Foods but they're also don't smoke they don't drink they're they're advised to exercise so it's kind of like the dean ornish studies where you know you put together all these interventions that one of which is low fat diet and then you say that the benefit was because of the low fat diet but you've what you're referring to is the study that showed that I mean this is what vegans like to say that vegan diet is the Enjoli loves to use this one a vegan diet is the only diet that's ever been shown in a study to remove disease yeah but what this study actually shows is these people had terrible diets they smoked and they drank and then they put him on a vegan diet no smoking no drinking and exercise and what do you know their health improved but it's not like we have a corresponding diet where they did the exact same thing and gave them an omnivorous diet with like grass fed bison meat no and then showed a similar set of tests and showed a decline or showed a better performance by the vegan diet you have all of these factors that are compiled together quitting drinking quitting smoking quit eating shit food eating a vegan diet and exercise Jannetty support all which we know have an impact on heart disease that is the study so when they say that a vegan diet is the only diet that's ever been shown to clinically reduce heart disease that's not really true disingenuous and the other thing about that study is that in the the baseline characteristics of the control group versus the experimental group were totally different the experimental group weighed 34 pounds more than the control group so they had more you know they were more overweight more they had more weight to lose I know and we're less healthy I mean that study would be thrown out today like you can't study what you study this was 1998 yeah well this was the problem when conversing with Joel about this and by the way the reason why I had him on I know people think I'm biased and I am eyed I'm biased this is this my perspective is that you're correct and that all these other you know Mark Sisson and Rob Wolfe and all these other folks I think they're correct an omnivorous die as a way to go but I had him on to try to pursue this path of objectivity to try to give him an opportunity to express what what's incorrect about what you're saying and it didn't work out for him in I mean by everybody's account that I saw that he lost that debate so you I mean you you brought up a point which I think is the crux of this whole thing which is context is everything and the problem with a lot of the research on plant-based diets and you know low-fat diets and all this is they make the implicit assumption that a diet that includes meat that is like where the context is KFC McDonald's you know cheese doodles coca-cola all the whole standard American diet is the same as a diet that includes meat that's completely whole foods based you know like the way you eat yeah way I know lots of vegetables fresh you know nuts seeds starchy tubers whatever obvious if you ask a hundred people on the street my guess is a hundred percent would say those are obviously different yes but the way that research treats them is there's a same-same factor the main factors meat yeah that's you only control for any of those other things ridiculous that's changing so there have been studies have been done over the past few years that are looking more at diet quality rather than just the quantity of specific food ingredients or foods like meat and what those diet those studies are universally saying is that quality is what makes a difference yes and so a great example we talked about this with Joel are the studies on looking at omnivorous versus vegetarian and vegan diets and life span but instead of just looking at the general population that eats meat they tried to find ways to like at least choose a slightly healthier omnivorous population so there was one the health food shoppers study where they they only looked at people who shopped at health food stores thinking ok these people are at least thinking about it a little bit you know it's it's still not controlling for all the factors but they're saying let's look at people who shop at a place like Whole Foods and then let's look at the like compare life span between vegetarians and vegans and omnivores well guess what they both both groups live a lot longer than the general population but there was no difference in lifespan between people who ate meat and vegetarians and vegans the the premises that meat is poison and so when you add meat to these these studies that people with meat are good while they're eating poison and the people without me look no poison I mean this is but what about all the other shit yeah this is what's so crazy about it like how can you have a study where you don't take into account how many people drink or smoke yeah and you just had the meat it's it's insanity it's that's the healthy user bias and yeah this is the the problem and what makes my job so difficult is like people have heard that mean is bad for 50 what 60 years you know so someone can say meat is bad that's three words and for me to unpack that I have to talk about healthy user bias I have to talk about problems with data collection and food frequency questionnaire ease I have to talk about relative versus absolute risk you know I mean people are just like well that's a problem with any of this data it's one of the beautiful things about being able to talk about it on a podcast with a moron like me is at least you're getting a conversation where people gonna ask questions like what the fuck is he saying so I get to ask you that and then people get to hear it it's you know this is a very strange time when it comes to information because so much of it is available but almost too much and then when you realize when you start trying to study nutrition there is so much to learn there's so many factors and there's so many biases like I listened to your interview with Matt Taibbi and you know the point I was thinking about it because you were talking about it politically how we're just living in echo chambers now yeah so you go on social media you're Republican you're only gonna see stuff about that that caters to your view and the algorithms are even optimized for that because they know that you'll click on that more and that will lead to more ad dollars yes so but it's similar with nutrition so you know if you're vegan you go on YouTube you're gonna see ton of vegan videos and vegan perspective same with your Facebook feed etc and to be fair it's the same for you know people who are into keto or low carb or carnivore or whatever they're into it's it's the same thing yeah you're just getting this reinforcing confirmation bias you know supporting access to information that is a weird thing about social media algorithms whether it's YouTube algorithms or Facebook or any of these things is that they're giving you what you want to see which you would say oh great well that's what I want to see yeah but the problem is like there's there's so there's so many counter arguments especially when you're talking about nutrition science there's so many discussions on both sides of the fence and it seems like both sides are preaching to the choir yeah well you know I mean we're biased as you said my story is a lot of people knows I was vegan and and somebody said videos use are the most vegan sounding non vegan ever well I mean yeah I was a vegan I was vegetarian I was raw food vegan I was macrobiotic vegan and I have a lot of friends who were vegan I patients that are vegan I have nothing against vegans and I totally get the reasons that people become vegan but I like many others and my patients in my community my health was harmed by that and and now I mean how was your health arm can you explain to people yeah I mean I I lost weight and as you can see I don't have a lot to lose to begin with my digestion got really screwed up I got depressed I'd never been depressed like I've never been in a person who gets depressed I felt anxious I you know it just was clearly not working for me and again I that's not to say it can't work for some people do you think the cause of depression had something to do with the diet because of the lack of cholesterol it's it's 12 hormones and yeah for sure but you know now like I mean it's funny to some I don't actually I make a point of not reading comments usually yeah but occasionally I come across them on Twitter this is something a comedian told me so so you know people are like oh he's such a you know he's gonna get it on there and just low carb low carb that's told like I don't I'm not a low carb guy and never have been I in fact I'm in trouble with the low carb community because you know I I push back I don't think it's right for everybody I don't think it's right for performance yeah I don't see any evidence that for it elite athletic performers that it's the way to go and I don't know anyone that's an elite athletic performer that follows those diets maybe endurance endurance Zack and Zack flies in the face of all this stuff and you know if you want to include someone like that guy that ran the Appalachian Trail and 48 days whatever he did yeah I mean which is no small feat for sure but I mean Zack bitter ran 24 he ran a 100-mile race in 11 hours and 40 minutes which is 40 something that which is fucking banana running and I think after that and he's a savage all he eats rib eyes yeah that's what that guy is so the main you need to talk about the main food in his diet is ribeye steaks he's mostly keto so yeah I mean anyways my point was just like I'm try try I'm not super dogmatic I'm just like I'm interested in what works for the most people essentially and you know as you mentioned Scott Jurek a Belgian dentist shattered his record by five days a couple years ago and that guy was eating my Snickers um tons of crap so I'm I'm not saying that the batteries record by five days yeah oh Jesus I'm not saying that I'm not saying that's what you should do but I'm saying there's more to athletic performance than food I guess that's not really deceptive because he did break the record when he broke it he did break it he broke it again and then like Michael Phelps you know guys pizza guy eats 12,000 calories of like sugar swiss french toast pizza same bolt in the beijing link olympics when he shattered those records he faint he ate a thousand over a thousand chicken nuggets I think somebody calculated so I know there's more there's more to it when you're at that level of performance you're burning off such an insane amount of calories you're working so hard you can kind of almost eat anything when you're when you're in that mode yes yeah when we do this is obviously not comparable when we did sober October last year we had this fitness challenge I was doing cardio no no joke it minimum five hours a day sometimes six and seven it was insane and I was eating everything boxes of cookies got bottles of soda I lost weight too yeah I did well not really because I lifted a lot of weights too yeah I kind of maintain maybe I lost a couple pounds but I was drinking like giant like cokes like I like I was drinking like a cream soda I never drink that shit yeah but it's like my body wanted sugar it's like give me some sugar you just did seven hours on a fucking elliptical machine right asshole it was so ridiculous but those guys are working out even harder than that so imagine like what felt if you need 12,000 calories you're not getting it with paleo and you're not getting it with vegan diet that's important though let's go let's rewind a little bit to protein the RDA that's super important yeah so 0.8 kilograms per grams per kilogram of protein per day is the RDA and again that's just the basic minimum that's not the amount that's needed for optimal health and performance that's just the absolute basics for a lot of for avoiding malnutrition however even that number now that's based on outdated nitrogen balance studies for determining the RDA and there's a newer method called the indicator amino acid oxidation technique or IAA oh and this suggests that the RDA should be 1.2 grams per kilogram and again just the basic minimum bare minimum not optimal so it's now gone up from zero point eight to one point two and if you use that number if you pull up slide eight Jamie that's only enough for an adult that weighs less than 130 pounds really so the sorry that you know how he said and James said in the study the average vegetarian gets 71 grams a day which is not only you know the RDA but 70 percent more that's using the zero point eight number but if you use one point two grams per kilogram per day then a lot of people are going to be protein deficient on a vegetarian diet and we're not again not talking about optimal amount for athletes we're just talking about the RDA basic bare minimum and when you say vegetarian you should say vegan crap because you're not talking about egg protein you can get no this study was vegetarian they weren't referring to vegans so you actually could get egg protein and dairy right protein eggs are a far superior in terms of their amino acids well than vegetables yeah so for vegans it would be different friend of mine I was saying this really recently why don't you try eggs and they look to me like I was talking them about poison yeah like people there's plenty of people that are vegan or vegetarian and you bring up eggs to them they look you like why would I eat an egg yeah so so that's you know one point two is the RDA with if you use this newer method but for athletes it James to his credit does acknowledge in the film that athletes need more protein than than regular non athlete people but he doesn't say how much more so again if you use these IAO method they've done the use this newer technique to look at athletes and they found that the range is somewhere between 1.4 to 2.7 grams per kilogram so we're now way higher than that 0.8 number and just for people who aren't familiar with kilograms let's say we take the median number they're 2.1 grams per kilogram per day well anyone who's ever been in the bodybuilding weightlifting community will recognize this that's one pound of protein per pound of body weight a day yes which has been the common recommendation in that community for one gram of probes re one gram one gram and in fact even Arnold in the movie says I weighed 250 pounds I used to eat 250 grams of protein you know like that's that's that it turns out that's actually based on science you know so a 200 pound athlete we need 200 grams of protein a day and Jamie if you pull up slide 10 this is what you'd have to eat on a vegan diet to get that amount of protein and again we're just talking about quantity we're not talking about down athlete that's me 3 3 cups of cooked lentils 3 cups of chickpeas 2 cups of quinoa 3 ounces of almonds 3 slices of silken tofu and 10 tablespoons of peanut butter that's the whole day that's the day I could fuck that up in a day yeah you could but the problem is the deer score for all of those like the bioavailability and the amino acid profile would be horrible compared to meat eggs dairy so what would I have to do cuz then I know they've done this studying there was a study that I'd read or had heard about I should say where they compared rice protein to whey protein and they found that at a certain level of grams like whatever it was they had an equal effect is it lutein leucine leucine the muscle protein synthesis yeah they had an equal effect I should give credit to the video that I was watching some gentleman I was watching this video today dr. Ryan Lowry and that they were saying that what that means is that correct me if I'm wrong what it is is when you get it once you hit a certain level of leucine it's a point of diminishing returns and there's no there's no added benefit to having more leucine in your diet so if you hit whatever it is I think it's 48 grams or something that if when you have 48 grams of this and 48 grams of that you put the two of them together it's essentially the same this the same effect well I'm not sure about that but I mean leucine is very important for anabolic signaling and muscle protein synthesis it's it's one of the essential it's the essential amino acid that's thought to be the most important for that and it's it's low in plant proteins and the other issue with plant proteins that you have is that they have limiting amino acids so these are amino acids that actually interfere with muscle protein synthesis so because the levels are so low in that food so lysine is a limiting amino acid and grains like wheat and rice maybe that's there was leucine and lysine discussion may be there may be and then methionine and cysteine are limiting in legumes like soy so Jaime at slide six I made a chart comparing the amino acid profile on beef to several different plant proteins like white beans soy beans peas and rice what you can see there is beef is higher in every single amino acid other than then every plant protein that's compared there with the exception of soybeans are slightly higher in tryptophan than beef look at leucine so beef it's two point two three versus zero point five eight for white beans one point three for soy soy is higher and leucine than any other plant protein which is why it's often used and then like zero point three four peas and 0.01 for rice if you get to a certain number or a certain level of all these so if you eat enough food that you would pass a certain marker would would it be possible to have the same effect by eating cooked peas or soybeans it is possible or sure so I an enormous amount of that as you can see because of the levels and this is why a lot of vegan bodybuilders and athletes end up using protein powders because you can get to the amounts easier by using the powders and you can also blend like a you know 70% P with 30% rice to get the right amino acid ratio easier with powders so like Patrick Babu Mian is a good example of that you know did you see the video that Bobby got Geist made no of his oh so there's actually videos that the one that you sent me yes I did see there's video that Patrick made himself of his own diet yes on you know what he eats on a daily basis and it turns out to be a boatload of protein powder and just shakes with all kinds of powders and supplements and things like that yeah so yeah we can go through it so he starts with a bunch of different supplements in the morning multivitamin nutritional yeast seeing glucosamine magnesium calcium b12 and iron then he has a protein shake with soy protein powder creatine and beta-alanine which probably is because he's aware of the research showing lower levels of muscle creatine and carnosine and in vegans beta alanine and creatine would address that then he has a post-workout smoothie with soy or P protein powder glutamine beta alanine creatine and dried greens and then his first solid meal of the day is fried falafel french fries soy sausage fried peppers and tomatoes and then he has some more protein shakes and smoothies throughout the day so I don't know that doesn't strike me as a super healthy way to eat what what do you what problem do you have that well first of all I think we should primarily get nutrients from food whenever we can I'm not against supplementation I think there's a role for it of course like you know especially with things like vitamin D that you might not be able to get enough of from food or therapeutic supplementation if you're dealing with a health problem but like getting them like eating a diet that is not sufficient in the amount of nutrients that you need and then using supplements to make up you know to to address that doesn't make a lot of sense to me well in his situation he's got a very unique situation that he's a he's a strength athlete that's all he's doing is trying to lift really really heavy things so he needs to maintain a certain amount of bulk yes I have an enormous amount of protein yeah a normal protein has to be he's very heavy you know and that that sport is also that's a steroid sport I mean it's just one of those sports where it's like bodybuilding much everybody steroid sport so you're eating massive amounts of quantities you're taking chemicals yeah it might not be the healthiest thing but it's also like just the sport itself might not be the healthiest thing I mean you've seen them carry people on the yo he was doing that in the gym yeah that's not good for your back but it works for what he's trying to do nicely it's working for what he's trying it does there's no dispute in that see what he's doing is almost like the intelligent way if you want to be vegan and do what he's trying to do right I don't know if he could eat just vegetables and pull that off you couldn't but that's kind of the point there are a lot of other strong men that do just like Robert Oberst you had on the show John's meat and rice right yeah its pounds of beef and rice simple you know accessible form of carbohydrate and a lot of protein and it's an unfair comparison and Oberst talked about him on the podcast before there much law he's much larger a lot of the strongmen not huge like the guy who played Gregor and Patrick is not these are not nearly that time five six or five seven things so the comparison between him and a guy like Oberst in those legit top of the food chain strongest man in the world competitions it's not it's not a completely different weight class he's you know Robert is enormous he's so much bigger but the problem is in the film they don't make that distinction and they try to pretend that this guy is one of the strongest men in the world he's not he's very strong no doubt and he definitely has broken some records in some competitions and you know and you have different weight classes and different but you're not talking about a guy who wins those you know Magnus von Magnus and fucking competitions where they're carrying trucks and shit well I mean my point to was like is it the best example of how an athlete can thrive on a plant-based Whole Foods diet I think it is though because for him for his size you know for it to be a guy who's five foot seven and is carrying that fucking enormous amount of weight he's obviously doing something that's very impressive and he's doing it while he's on this vegan diet and again I mean just discounting all the illegal supplementation because I don't think it is illegal in that sport it's kind you kind of have to do it would you want to get that big the but if you want to do it and do it as a vegan he is showing you that it's possible so in that sense I defend what he's doing because I think that he like that's the only way in that but this is a very sports specific area of performance he's just talking about lifting insanely heavy shit and he's doing that and thriving on a vegan diet yeah no doubt you know enormous Lee strong and he's succeeding I would argue that he might do even better if he was eating meat you know nutrient-dense nutrition a suit and he might need to take fewer supplements and drink less powder yeah but I think that's my bias I'm more like a Whole Foods person and you know that's where I'm coming from another problem that I had in the film especially in relations to sport is the Nate Diaz Conor McGregor comparison yeah first of all Nate Diaz is not a vegan Nate Diaz eats fish and he eats eggs yeah and he he does try to follow a whole food vegan diet I think during camp so I would have to talk to him about that I know he's done interviews talking about that but I've definitely seen him eat fish I watched him on the Anthony Bourdain's television show and he was eating fish I know he's eating eggs he doesn't eat land animals I think what he does is avoids red meat well fish and eggs take care of it yeah you know fish is actually higher often and than meat in terms of protein counts per ounce it's also very high in collagen which is super important for recovery and repair and explains lack of collagen probably explains why a lot of vegan athletes get injured which we can talk about more later and then eggs as you know are super you know they're really high on the Dia's score scale bio-available lots of other nutrients so here's another problem with that whole comparison first of all Nate Diaz is a fantastic fighter he's a long time mixed martial arts veteran he's outstanding in all areas he has a fantastic submission game his brother Nick Diaz one of the best in the world he's also outstanding and all and his brother Nick I believe is vegan he's probably a better example cuz you know I mean even though Nick hasn't beaten like some of the top-flight fighters in a few years back when he was in Strikeforce he was top of the food chain he's he's an elite fighter for sure I'm not sure if he was vegan back then I'd have to ask him but the point being that nate is a exceptional exceptionally skilled athlete and he was coming into that fight on extremely short notice so he was most likely following his off camp diet which is eggs and eatin fish and things along those lines partying in Mexico so who knows what the fuck he was doing it was like 11 days out they call him and they set up this fight I forget how many days out it was but it was a very very short amount of time Conor was preparing for a 155-pound fight against ha failed dos Anjos so he was reducing his caloric intake dropping his weight down to try to make this hundred fifty five pound weight class it's a big cut for him so when when you do that you you are in anticipation that the person you're fighting is also doing that so you both kind of agree that you're going to be in a certain weakened state when you actually weigh in at 155 pounds it was like two weight classes below his normal let me go make it keep going so he's this is that was the first and only time that well except that rematch with Nate was the only time that he's fought at 170 so they made a decision to fight at 170 instead of 155 because Nate did not have time to reduce his calories and cut the weight and it takes a long time it's a slow process of neza big fella he walks around probably over 200 pounds easy and he drops weight and he didn't want to drop that much weight he's a big guy man he's big and long and Conor was dropping his weight down to 155 so he's 10 days out and he just starts packing on food eating as much food as he can not only that but stylistically Nate's nightmare for him Nate has a fucking evil submission game he's tough as nails his endurance is always fantastic because offseason he's always doing triathlons and he's always doing like endurance sports I mean he's in phenomenal shape and his jujitsu is like many levels better than Connors I mean he's a legit top of the food chain mmm a black belt in jujitsu so they have this fight Connor gets tired Nate beats him up gets him on the ground submits them and they're saying this is a victory for veganism what they don't say is five months later they fought and Connor beat him they fought again they fought they this time they had a full training camp Connor prepared and it was a very close fight I should say you could have vote you could have scored it either way I mean it's it was a really close fight razor's thin but the fact remains Conor beat him in the rematch so I'm going to leave this out of the narrative like oh my god the vegans are dominating look vegan dominated but he's you know this is a last minute fight Connor goes up and wait Nate Diaz you know steps in and and takes care of business and wins the fight it speaks more to how good Nate Diaz is than a vegan diet right and it doesn't take into account that four months later or five months later whatever it was he loses and he's not vegan I mean there's there fuels it's sometimes there are a few other examples like that in the film there where you catch like a certain window of it but they don't show what happens afterwards we talked about the vegan honeymoon so Brian Jennings the boxer yes they talked about he went vegan in end of 30 2013 he was 17 I know before he was vegan and he's been so he's seven and four after that so you can't say that that's because he transitioned to a vegan diet but you can't also say nork nor can you say that veganism improved his performance right I mean it objectively he's gotten worse since then well the argument against that would be that he's moving up into the upper echelons of the heavyweight division and it's filled with killers like any combat sport and that as he got in many fighters don't make it to get in and he lost to wasn't one of the Klitschkos yes I think he lost to Vladimir I think he lost a Vladimir Klitschko and a decision and he handled himself very well it was a very good fight for him he look real good but yeah I mean that that upper alone you get to this Andy Ruiz Deontay Wilder I mean killers yeah it's like not most people that get up into that division they start losing HP here's a good example too of this principle of context being everything because he said in the film my early years growing up in Philly the only thing we knew was spinach and a can collard greens and Popeyes KFC everybody frying chicken I grew up not even knowing about half these other vegetables asparagus to me just came out like five years ago right so you know again early honeymoon yeah going from going from like a crappy standard American diet to a Whole Foods diet I don't doubt that someone's gonna feel better but what do you felt better like you said eating some grass fed bison and some along with all of those plans yeah that's the question yes that is the question and the this this is the real purpose my real purpose for getting involved in these fucking discussions over and over and over again people to understand that this there's nuance to this yeah there's and there's also biological variability there's some people that are they can get along on certain diets easier there's some people that have a horrible time with seafood there's some people that have a horrible time with certain grains I mean this is we are all different we come from an enormous planet where your ancestors developed and your genes developed in different parts of the world we're all different but but what we know about nutrition it is so important that we are honest about what we know this is what the problem I have with a lot of these documentaries they're not honest about what they know they're only giving you little snippets and cherry-picking data and doing things like the study that showed that the vegan diet can clinically reverse heart disease these are you're using all this deception pretending that the the gladiators chose to eat gruel like this is how we're gonna kick ass we're just gonna eat barley the fuck out of here this is nonsense and they know it's nonsense either they know it's nonsense or they just fucking slap some blinders on their head and just plow straight ahead and ignore anything that conflicts with any of these thoughts of Derrick's buttocks person I mean there's there's so many examples of this in the film one was this lettuce has more antioxidants than salmon are eggs well so what I mean we're not we're not saying don't eat lettuce right I mean I've I'm always I've always argued that the optimal diet includes both plants and food and there's reasons for that plants contain some nutrients that animal foods don't and animal foods can trans that plants don't an orange has more vitamin C than a beef steak right that's just how it goes so we could just as easily say a serving of salmon has 716 times more selenium there's lettuce and provides a hundred percent of the RDA of b12 where let us provide 0% but I'm not gonna say that because that's ridiculous I'm not trying to get people to eat lettuce No so you're not on Team well that and there's another thing that's going on right now these carnivore folks which I find fascinating because they are as ideologically driven as vegans we have the anti vegans it's like we have an Tifa and then we have the alright now we have the carnivores and we have the vegans and both of them dig their fucking heels in the sand and both of them are committed to thinking that their side is the only way to go and rhonda patrick has talked about this many many times when people start discussing negative aspects of eating food particularly plants because of stressors and she's like no there's actually an effect where your body's reacting to them that's beneficial much like when you get in a sauna your body reacts to the heat it's actually beneficial for your health hormesis yes and just like that's how exercise works yes you lift weight until you can't lift it anymore your muscle tissue breaks down and it rebuilds next time so these folks that are talking about don't eat vegetables because vegetables give you these things that are bad for your body like okay yeah are you sure I mean there's a lot of work to be done here folks there's a lot of fucking research to be read into and there's a lot of conversations you have to have with people far more educated than you and I think often as humans we have a hard time differentiating between like our own experience and what you know works for us and then yes larger bigger picture so take someone who has a severe autoimmune disease they go on carnivore their symptoms disappear yes that's pretty compelling you know it's really understandable why they would be like passionate about that and why they would want to continue that approach but again like I said before we're not always choosing between one great alternative and one terrible alternative it is interesting to me though that one thing that we have been lied to about is that you need vegetables because these you don't need it just much like you know with RDA you need a certain amount to not starve to death you don't necessarily need vegetables there's a whole community of people out there that's thriving and not eating a single piece of vegetable yeah it's really interesting the the problem is we just don't know what happens long term there so I got my eye on Shaun Baker I'm not saying and look I want to be clear it might be fine it seems like it is I don't know I'm just saying we don't know so you're you're introducing an element of uncertainty because whether you look at it from an if you look at it from an anthropological perspective every group of people we've ever studied in human history has eaten both plants and animals in different proportions what about the Comanches one of the things I was reading about the Comanches was I watching listening rather to this audio book summer moon empire of the summer moon it's amazing I recommended it too much I'm gonna shut the fuck up about it but one of the things they talk about is the Comanches ate very little berries or fruits or vegetables they mostly just ate Buffalo the Inuit also ate very little especially during the winter you know but they went to great lengths to trade for plant foods and in the summer the more plant food so that the proportions vary you know the Maasai for example yes milk meat blood and yeah some plant foods but then you have other groups to date more plant foods you know the there was a study ethnographic study of hunter-gatherer cultures done 230 roughly study cultures study and they found that on average the hunter-gatherers got about percent of their calories from animal foods and about 30% from plant foods so so--that's percent of calories that's not looking at a plate because animal foods are more calorie dense so it still might be two thirds of the plate as plants and one third is animal foods if they use plates but that's the rough percentage and it but it would vary you know from from place to place we don't know of any group that exclusively and by choice not from living in a marginal environment like the Arctic but by choice ate only animal foods for a long period of time and a lot of the research that we have the clinical research suggests that plants have some useful nutrients especially some fibers that can feed the beneficial gut bacteria there are studies showing that extremely low carb diets can have some maybe not great effects on the gut flora so again it could be fine but we just don't know and so there's you're adding an element of uncertainty there that's all I'm saying so there could be a carnivore honeymoon as it were just like you're talking about the vegan honeymoon yeah and that there could so your contention and this is my belief as well is that most human beings fare better on an omnivorous diet with both plants and animals yes and what proportion of plants and animal foods will depend on all the factors that you mentioned genes epigenetics health status geography rhino what whatever else is going on but you know and for some what some people that might just be a small amount available might be Nate Diaz you know have some fish and some eggs and then the rest you know plant-based diet for other people it might be a lot more animal foods that's where I think that in individual variation comes in right and I'm sure most of these athletes that are following a vegan diet like you were talking about earlier with Patrick they're taking protein powders so they're allowing themselves to get a large dose of protein fulfill their requirements simply and easily in a shake form rather than having to wolf down you know four or five bowls of some and if they're not they they're probably not doing that well so we have like all these stories of NFL and NBA athletes that went vegan and then stopped because they were not able to maintain their weight got injured and he unable to recover in the show notes for this I have like many many examples of pretty high level NBA and NFL just read I have Cam Newton is one Cam Newton is the most recent one so he went vegan in February he had the worst season of his career yeah - two yards on five carries in the first two games and he rushed for more than 30 yards 33 yards game only once in his last nine yes how Cam Newton's vegan diet may be hurting Panthers quarterback play in injury recovery what is this on the website is this his notes oh it's your notes but it's from a well it's from a website yeah there's a references it's and then he developed a Liz Frank injury in his foot that's a broken foot broken foot and really hard to recover from some people think you know certainly could be career-ending I mean if you lose 10 20 pounds that's a big deal for a high level athlete because the studies have shown that that can interfere with muscle protein synthesis it can also increase inflammation and make recovery more difficult so but the other thing is if they're not eating the protein powders are not taking collagen for example of a vegan source of collagen collagen is critical for muscle recovery and repair and it's hard to you know you can make some collagen but I think a lot of people on a plant-based diet if they're high level athletes and they're not really getting collagen coming in it's going to be difficult when Travis Barker was in a plane crash he was like severely burned and they were having a hard time getting him to heal and he started eating meat in order to heal because he's a vegan yeah I mean he owns some what's it called crossroads in a really amazing vegan restaurant in in LA yeah he's talked about on the podcast he was just wolfing down beef jerky just you know trying to eat meat to in order to get his body to heal that couldn't have gone over well with the vegan well I mean he was just being honest I mean Travis Travis is super super honest he's just saying like but he chooses to not eat meat other than that he just did it to recover and then once he recovered he went back to his normal vegan diet so you have Djokovic who's best tennis player time probably he when he first went dairy-free and gluten-free he he would you know was number one in the world he went vegan ranking dropped 22 which is the lowest he'd been since he was a teenager and then he started adding fish back into his diet and you know back back up to number one you have damian lillard from mba he went vegan for five months but then he added animal protein back that's slide 35 Jaime he said I did it but I started to lose a little bit too much weight with all the games and practices and all that I had to balance it out so now I've been mixing it up a little more having vegan meals and still mixing it up with other stuff so it sounds kind of similar to Nate you know mostly vegan but adding some animal foods back in there you had Tony Tony Gonzalez Hall of Fame tight end I went vegan and three weeks later he said there was an article about this said it's in the show notes the 100 pound dumbbells you used to easily throw around felt like lead weights the article says I was scared out of my mind Gonzalez said he had lost 10 pounds he ended up adding a small small amounts of animal protein back to his diet you got Gerald McCoy NFL he said quote the explosiveness wasn't sustainable because I didn't have that extra oomph that I needed because the lack of the type of protein I was taking in so I just added a little bit of animal protein back in my diet and it's given me that move back now again we're talking about elite athletes with very specific nutritional requirements because they're asking a tremendous amount of their baggage I mean these guys kids totally need like 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day to function well and of that you know if they weigh 250 or 275 they need 250 to 275 grams of protein and that should be high in leucine for muscle protein synthesis and it should be bioavailable you know all that I mean so in comparison to the average person the average person who followed their diet probably wouldn't see any detrimental effect for a long time because they're not requiring their body to do these incredible things I don't know it varies I mean I've had patients who went vegan and within two say we're in really dire straits and I've had and there are people who go vegan and they're fine for their whole life so hormones are a big one right and why is that everything you know micronutrients really run the show I mean of course the macronutrients protein fat carbohydrates are important and as I said before you know if you were 100 and if you're 200 pounds the average American weight is male is 200 pounds and so if they're in a vegetarian they're consuming the average number of grams of protein that's less than the updated RDA we looked at that on that slide so I would argue that even for the average person protein could be a problem both quantity and quality most people are getting planning of carbohydrates and enough fat so that's not an issue then it comes down to micronutrients so think b12 you know that's the thing that came up in the film a number of times so we should talk about that a little bit because there was some actually just you know factually inaccurate information about b12 and I want to correct so the claim this is slide 55 Jamie James said b12 is not made by animals it's made by bacteria that these animals consume in the soil and water before industrial farming farm animals and humans can get b12 by eating traces of dirt on plant foods or by drinking water from rivers or streams but now because it pesticides and antibiotics and chlorine killed bacteria this vitamin even yeah that produces a vitamin even farm animals have to be given b12 supplements that's just all false that's all just factually wrong so first of all b12 is made by bacteria but it's animals don't get it from consuming soil and water the the b12 is made by bacteria in their gut so in ruminants like cows the in the rumen which is a chamber in the stomach the bacteria convert cobalt that they get from grass that they eat into cobalamin which is b12 and then they are for gut fermenters so they can absorb the b12 they've the bacteria produce in their intestines and utilize that themselves so primates including humans also have bacteria that make b12 but we're hindgut fermenters so we cannot absorb the b12 that our own gut bacteria make well that's not exactly true chimps and gorillas can but that's only because they eat their own poo so that is one potential strategy for meeting your b12 you just put that out there you can because aphasic we will find ethical food eaters the whole community now I've read ethical Peters is now a new subreddit so so we cannot get b12 from our own gut bacteria right and that and if there is an e b12 in soil it's only from manure you know that's come from animals there's also zero evidence that b12 is fed to cattle and there's no evidence that humans have ever been able to meet their b12 needs from just eating soil and water if you pull up slide 56 Jamie Jack Norris who's a vegan diet ition you know we don't agree on a lot of things but I appreciate his rigor with the science he has a big article on b12 on this website and it said he says the suggestion that humans have ever relied on uncleaned organic produce for vitamin b12 doesn't have any reliable evidence at this time so the I just I don't know where to go with these that claim because it's just this demonstrably false even from the perspective of a vegan registered dietitian yes yeah I don't know why he said that either but I just think that that's something he probably heard and he's probably having a conversation with someone and they told him that and he just repeated it I mean it's one of those may be one of the doctors on the show yeah brought that up so people repeat a lot of these things and then they become Dogma so here's the other thing the the second part of that claim was up to 39% of people tested including meat eaters are low in b12 as a result best way for humans to get enough b12 whether they eat animal foods or not is simply to take a supplement he didn't provide a reference for that so I can't it's hard to check that but again this contradicts you know mounds of evidence on b12 deficiency so they're you know there's there's four stages of b12 deficiency I don't want to go too far in the weeds here but basically serum b12 which is the marker that's usually used only goes down in the fourth and final stage of b12 deficiency there are other markers that will go out of range earlier that are more sensitive and detect those earlier stages so the the the most sensitive markers holo Transco Battlement or whole OTC so in a study in 2013 this is a slide 58 Jamie they compared b12 deficiency depletion according to holo Transco Ballymun levels in vegetarians vegans and omnivores and you can see the results here only 11% of omnivores had b12 depletion 77% of vegetarians and 92% of vegans that's a pretty big difference it's a big difference it's a big difference b12 is responsible for energy that's where the reasons why when people were feeling sick they get a b12 shot well it's also required for the myelin sheath and our nerves b12 deficiency can cause serious and even irreversible neurological damage a lot of the harm that comes that happens with kids on the vegan diet comes from b12 deficiency can decrease fluid intelligence it can cause neurological damage that's not reversible even after they start eating meat again maybe that's what's going on with them in this information maybe they have legitimate neurological damage is that possible it's possible there's because I'm just passionate about this because it's super important slide 59 so homocysteine is a marker that is also more sensitive than serum b12 it's a sticky inflammatory protein that's associated with heart disease and dementia so 9 out of 10 comparisons that looked at b12 levels or homocysteine levels in vegetarians and omnivores found higher homocysteine levels in vegans and vegetarians higher means worse and it means more b12 deficient and in fact the studies they said the prevalence of hyper homocysteine amia which is high homocysteine levels reflecting low b12 among vegetarians may actually be higher than among non vegetarians already diagnosed with heart disease so this is kind of a big deal it's like the b12 issue is serious and and even folks like Jack Norris to their credit do acknowledge it and and strongly recommend that people who are on a vegan diet supplement so if people watch this film you know I'm glad to hear James saying that that you know vegetarians vegans should supplement I don't think omnivores need to usually but you can watch that film and get the idea that that b12 you know is maybe not that big of a deal right it's a big deal a lot of the film was reenactments as well you know like when James was sitting there with the knee braces on that was not after a surgery I thought he was vegan in like 2011 or I know or something when he he's in the film when they're filming him he's sitting there doing his research well I don't think they filmed him while it was happening but I mean this is like one of the things that I thought was well done about the film was that they took someone James yes on the kind of the journey of starting as an omnivore and then you know having this real these realizations and turning into a vegan but the problem was that journey happened long before the film was made exactly that was a little disingenuous so that's why I'm saying he's sitting there with those knee braces on and he's going over his research and just happen to have a camera crew there why he's learning how to heal himself I'm like hey man I know what you're doing I don't know I mean that's a narrative devised it's good filmmaking even the Rope thing even the Rope thing I mean I'm watching him do the Rope thing at the end like whew boy I'm done you didn't our Pro if you did an hour you'd be fucking drenched with sweat and you'd be exhausted you wouldn't did you they sprayed you or something like that but that's fine I believe he really did that I don't believe he's a liar but like yeah I mean he'd like you said he's clearly athlete yeah and ripped and you know super capable and this was a you know an agenda driven film it was yeah it's meant to persuade and convince people that's why it's weird because that's clearly acting there you're recreating these moments but it's billed as a it's right marketed as a documentary because he's talking about it having just happened right after he switched over to a vegan diet all of a sudden he could do an hour on the battle ropes and then they're filming him no Mike come on man there's no fucking camera crew with that happen you're redoing this yeah you think I mean I get it this is how you show the footage you put it out there and it makes it like a little bit better for people to swallow and get you know and I like the scenes of him doing the self-defense demonstrations because you get to see he truly is a fantastic martial artist he really doesn't know his stuff absolutely there's a lot of great aspects to that I like I said I like that guy a lot but there's a lot of fuckery in this movie man so I mean a couple of the most ridiculous things from the movie I'm get two boners we can get the boner slide 64 you probably remember this morning this was the guy who's like in Africa he was a former Special Forces yes and he says this whole fantasy we need to eat meat to get our protein it's actually bullshit I mean look at a grill a grill that will fuck you up in two seconds what does a gorilla eat I just do the same things these big great things out here that we're trying to protect elephant and rhino yeah well it's just it's a nonsensical argument you know what will fuck you up even faster than the gorilla a human who has a gun it eats McDonald's and KFC I'm serious what is a gun it's a tool how did we develop tools because we started eating meat and fish and we came down out of the trees and we weren't spending more than half of our waking hours eating leaves and low calorie fruits you know we don't like comparing our digestive like what we should eat with a gorilla is just asinine that's a problem because they bring that up all the time they say we have the same digestive gut tract as an herbivore that's just not true also just objectively false yeah now the the large for a gorilla the largest volume volume of their digestive tract is in their large intestine which is ideal for breaking down tough foods you know fiber seeds and those kinds of plant foods whereas in humans the largest volume of our digestive tract is in the small intestine which is better for absorbing nutrient dense bioavailable foods like meat and cook foods cook tubers and things like that you know gorillas in order to get the amount of protein that gets them strong and rich they eat forty to sixty pounds of food a day and they're eating for more than half of their waking hours so it's really you know that's just not comparable at all to compare us to we also have different genes is the same thing when they're talking about ox is like the strong as an ox there's a mile statin issue right yes there's the genes are programmed to carry more muscle so yeah that's Patrick booming you know people ask me how did you get strong as an ox without eating meat and have you ever seen an ox eating meat well I say have you ever seen a human with six different stomachs standing in a field eating you know grass for 14 hours a day right it's ridiculous it's not it's like to me those those damage the credibility of the movie because that's just sound bites it sound cute like people yeah you ever seen an ox eat that eat what a gorilla eat that's what I dunno I just write it just to me though that's like the quality of the argument being made it really does know when they're like you dispute it that's the problem we you know that's why I bring you aboard I mean and then there was the anthropologist woman you remember that scene in the end where she that that's where I really started rolling my eyes cuz she was making the arguments that humans have always followed a plant-based diet did you remember that part Italy okay so we were to start with that so I mean we've got isotope studies that show that humans have been eating meat for at least two and a half million years and if you go back even before we're really actually human there's a lot of evidence now that our chimp ancestors were also eating vertebrates and one of the biggest shocks for people has been the observation that chimps hunt and they kill other ant monkeys and other animals and eat them I mean it kind of blew apart like this whole idea of primates only being you know eating plants and if that happened if if an animal evolves complex behavior like hunting or tool use in order to eat sir food it means that food has a lot of value or else that that behavior wouldn't have evolved but then we have bone collagen studies let me see if I can find this slide Jamie so that's 47 and 48 so these are bone collagen isotope studies are much more accurate than some of the previous methods that were used and the the earliest hominids that were studied but these were Neanderthals so there's three studies that have been done in Neanderthal groups ranging from one hundred and thirty thousand to twenty thousand years ago and then it compared those isotope levels with contemporary species and they found that Neanderthals were similar to top-level carnivores so they all derived the vast majority of their protein from animal sources likely to be large herbivores and then on the next slide 48 why does it have hold on second backup why don't I have a pterodactyl fly in the background why they bullshitting us does those fucking things live 60 fucking million years before that's so stupid you know there's a limit to what stock photography can I know out you asshole why have a guy walking on two feet with a fucking piece of meat on this deck of me that's so stupid and he's obviously not in the under tall to double crazy so that's a homo sapien which is only 500,000 hours ago that stock photo so let's talk about homeless again so so there there were on the next slide there two two stable isotope bone collagen studies have been done with modern humans Homo sapiens sapiens and the first group was thirteen thousand years ago in southern England and the second group was 30 to 40,000 years ago unlocker vet which is in France and they also found that they were predominately large herbivores but the French group consumed the more diverse mix of protein including seafood so the fossil record clearly clearly indicates that humans were eating you know humans and Neanderthals APNs and Neanderthals all over our hominid ancestors were eating a lot of meat and she wasn't using any evidence to cite this either was she she was using lame anatomical argument that we have you know relatively flat molars like herbivores do and we don't have claws we don't have sharp canine teeth right but guess what we've got Forks we've got knives and we got fire we've got fire to cook our food and we have fire for a long fuck yeah these adaptations that make those anatomical characteristics that a lion or you know are carnivorous animal has unnecessary for us I mean that's that's just like anthropology 101 right I don't actually just found someone who's vegan who's also apologist and then they rewrite the whole history of you know animal food consumption among hominids yeah and the argument that human beings over two million years ago the doubling of the human brain size corresponds with the the learning how to hunt community of toolmarks on Boas correspondent directly with the doubling of brain volume the reduction in our gut volume which indicates and move to a more nutrient-dense diet the increase in the volume of our small intestine relative to our large intestine and then what's called the gray cell is a ssin of our jaw which means our teeth and jaw became less robust and that's thought to be an adaptation to more digestible nutrient-dense bioavailable food where we're not like chewing cud or yes you know chewing on leaves or low-calorie fruits like a gorilla is all there in this argument about nutrient density this is why this that that term is very important because people always want to use that for plant-based foods nutrient dense plant-based foods meat is far more nutrient dense per calorie per ounce poor amino acid profile the with essential nutrients yeah so it's essential meaning nutrients that we can't manufacture in our own and that we and then we absolutely need organ meats are actually at the top of the list in terms you know in terms of nutrient density organ meats and shellfish take the cake then you have herbs and spices are actually pretty high too and then you have other you know muscle meats eggs all those things foods like grains and legumes are tend to be towards the bottom of the list you know with vegetables and in right but that sounds good nutrient-dense plant-based foods sounds good it sounds like you're doing the right thing so this is like where this lingo is coming from I mean this is where I argue that plants do belong because plants do have certain nutrients phytonutrients fibers and things that that actually don't feed us but feed our gut flora that I do think are important even though they're not considered essential like vitamin b12 or vitamin A you know vitamin D or something like that I do think they're still important and they play a role what I'm talking about is the difference between cavemen altering its diet or the modern or ancient man altering their diet and this doubling of the human brain size corresponding with consuming more nutrient-dense foods what that means is meat yeah absolutely meat fish and fish first as we saw with some of the modern humans who were living in coastal regions yeah she's more about bioavailable nutrient dense foods definitely now what what are their silliness so this is the Anthropology argument that just doesn't seem to fit any of the state-of-the-art science doesn't fit yeah it completely contradicts oh so then there was a whole section that you probably remember about chicken and fish causing cancer dairy products causing cancer they started just it really kind of went from just like you can do well on a plant-based diet as an athlete to like animal products are horrible and I'm gonna kill you which was a you know a big leap so they had one study James Wilk says you know research funded by the National Cancer Institute found that vegetarians who had one or more servings per week of white meat like chicken and fish more than tripled their risk of colon cancer well that's scary you know I don't want to triple my risk of colon cancer but again if you look at the totality of the research slide 42 Jamie 2017 a meta-analysis of 16 prospective studies with with almost two and a half million participants found no increase in cancer risk from consuming fish or poultry and then you have a statement from the American Cancer Institute itself saying as for other animal products organizations that do comprehensive reviews to make dietary recommendations currently do not recommend against poultry like chicken turkey ground or fresh fish or dairy so where's that coming from then one study that looked at seventh-day Adventists who added some of those foods back into their diet this is a perfect example of healthy user bias because seventh-day Adventists are not supposed to eat meat so if you have a seventh-day Adventist who's bucking the trend and eating me then what else are they doing that is also not healthy and not following the dictates of that healthy lifestyle mmm that was that into consideration then asked him whether they're drinking or I was a six-year study in the seventh-day Adventist cohort from 1976 to 1982 and it was what I call them SDA rebels you know they're supposed to eat vegetarian but they on meat so what else are they doing that's kind of condensing and the reason why this is relevant is this is the only study that we know of that does show a correlation between there might be other individual studies that do but this is why we have these large reviews that look at you know this one looked at 16 studies with two and a half million participants and found no association and then that's why you have groups like the American Cancer Institute who say you know recommend well I mean people were up in arms at the most recent recommendation that can't do that we people have been told to avoid red meat oh yeah and then they said well actually there's no risk at all eating red meat we're taking that off of the list of foods to avoid and everybody went hey shit they just went apeshit let's talk about the lack of a better term yeah they did they freaked out yes so conflicts with the dogma absolutely and this was this was a five paper review so it wasn't just one paper it was five papers all in one review it was millions of participants you know they reviewed all of the available literature on red meat you know and in its relationship with any disease heart disease cancer type two diabetes it was dozens of studies following people for up to 35 years Millions again millions of participants they looked at randomized controlled trials they looked at observational cohort studies they looked at all kinds of outcomes on the total mortality cardiovascular cancer etc and they found quote only low or very low certainty evidence that red meat causes any kind of disease and in in the editorial in the annals which is what it was published annals of internal medicine the journal was published and they said quote this is slide nineteen Jamie over and over again they the author's stressed that even if the results were statistically significant their certainty was low and the absolute difference is seen were small and potentially confounded meaning could have been that they were smoking more or drinking more or right now not exercises or whatever the editorial also said this is sure to be controversial but it's based on the most comprehensive review of the evidence to date because that review is inclusive those who seek to dispute it will be hard-pressed to find appropriate evidence with which to build an argument unless you have a nice documentary yeah yeah the really frustrating thing for people is also recommend process it's unprocessed and processed so the the dog men always been well to stay away from processed meat and universe' some studies showed no difference with fresh but some difference with the process red meat you know I think you could make a stronger argument that process too much processed meat might be harmful because of things like and nitroso compounds that are formed etc but even then you have to consider context most people are eating hot dogs with buns and french fries and big gulps Wow right it might it's probably a different effect than having bacon a couple times a week with your Whole Foods diet or having some salami and nuts you know not the same as eating you know fake processed meat all the time and one of the things that's weird about this whole conversation is it's it's there's a battleground so like a volley gets thrown out there like this like boom it's okay to eat red meat and you see the other side scrambling to refute the evidence and and then fire back with all these epidemiology studies that show that red meat can kill eeeh and red meats causing you to age quicker red meat kills your boners and red meat does this and does that and it's like it's it's with there's a religious war going on it's the same weird thing we were talking about earlier now when you have some kind of political event or some event that happens it gets spun you know if you go watch CNN it's gonna get spun one way if you go watch Fox it's gonna get spun the other way it's the same event but you have these totally different interpretations yeah what else was Obama well you want to talk about the boners I found that to be entirely hilarious ruthlessly unscientific yeah and like the whole thing with the guy saying you know I'm gonna eat what a gorilla eats I mean they're showing this guy who's protecting rhinos who are being slaughtered for their for their horns like what does that have anything to do with eating meat yeah they're they're morally equated that with eating exactly murder well dude what they're doing is pretty obvious what they were doing yes even though they didn't say that what they were doing they're attaching themselves to an indisputable cause yeah you know I mean everybody wants people to stop shooting rhinos for their horns everyone does if you don't you're an asshole don't eat meat what yes not that in there what the fuck did you do yeah yes so the for those who haven't seen the film that the the erection that the boner experiment if we're gonna call it that if they it was Aaron Spitz who the urologist and he puts penis rings on a bunch of NFL players and then he looks at measures the effects of different meals on their erections both the the circumference I guess the size of the erection the duration intensity of the erections so he feeds the players burritos with meat in them and then he feeds them the same burrito with like a plant protein I'm not sure what it was tempeh or something like that and then he claims beans was the beans okay yeah maybe and any claims at that fleets who ate the pureplant burritos had 500% more frequent erections and also increased strength of erections so hmm what can we conclude from this experiment absolutely nothing because it was just an experiment that was made up and done in a film it was not peer reviewed there was no it's not scientific at all you know that's the whole scientific well he could have been scientific right if they did it in different orders so they put the the the penis band on the dudes one night they had him eat whatever the fuck they had I mean you know a thing with steak burritos and then the next night they put the penis bands on them again and they have a meat beans and so they say you got more erections did you guys jerk off in between them did you guys have sex did you get used to having the penis band on when you slept with it the first time did it bother you did it interrupt your sleep the second time were you more comfortable with it did you guys try to reverse it one day the first day on a different group of people give them the band and make them eat a vegetarian diet then the next day give them the band on the second day and make them eat steak did you did you switch that up you can ask any number of questions and that's the whole point it's obsession that's why we have science that's why we have a process of peer review that's why we have reproducibility meaning even if one group comes up with one finding it's not really worth much until somebody else reproduces that something like 90 90 percent or more of findings scientific findings are not reproduced well that's that means that we can't trust them so I would like to know if they were asked to not engage in sexual intercourse or masturbation during that time period because that would that would make sense that they were getting more erections and more fuller erections the next day especially the young guys that are you know savages well I went to them playing football I went to look at research like is there any peer-reviewed research that shows that plant-based diets are better for erectile function and lower the risk of erectile dysfunction couldn't find anything I did find studies one study of a Mediterranean diet which includes animal some animal products reduced erectile disfunction relative to a low-fat diet which maybe might have fewer animal products that kind of contradicts it perhaps there were studies that showed that like diet quality is more is important so Western diet and high in processed foods led to erectile dysfunction diet rich in flavonoids containing foods which be fed fruits and vegetables reduced erectile dysfunction but none of that says it has anything to do with meat just says like don't eat a junk food diet we don't want erectile dysfunction yeah it's just deceptive oh there was another but you know it does show that those guys did get more hard-ons under that circumstance but as you said what does that mean what does it mean and and can we even dressed it I mean frankly given some of the other stuff in the film right can you trust it can you trust right I mean who's to say right now there was another thing that was deceptive or at least it confused people that's when they made them eat a bean burrito and they checked their blood and blood okay that's that was I was just sitting there shaking my head going what in the fuck are you doing this has nothing to do with health so again not a peer-reviewed experiment something that was controlled studying anyway just something that they did in the film so they fed the burritos you know with me without me and they measured their blood afterwards big surprise if the people who ate meat which has more fat and more saturated fat had cloudier blood well that's normal that's just naturally what you would expect from the process of eating feet you must temporarily have more fat in your blood it's nothing to do with health so what is the big question might accident better why you might be better for you and so then I went and I thought okay well what does the peer-reviewed research show about animal protein and endothelial function because their claim was that eating the animal protein reduces your endothelial function and it increases inflammation so this I there there was one study that a lot of the there are a couple studies that show a low carb diet impairs endothelial function but they tend to be short term like four weeks I looked for longer-term studies there was a 2009 study that followed subjects for 12 weeks and they found the low-carb diet actually improved endothelial function whereas a low-fat diet decreased it and then there was a 2007 study that followed subjects for a year and there was no change in a no thelia function on a low-carb diet we actually there's strong evidence that high blood sugar and insulin resistance impaired endothelial function so you know low carb diet that would lower your blood sugar and improve insulin resistance would be expected to improve it from that perspective so again when you look at the actual science the actual peer-reviewed research you don't see that relationship that they're talking about they didn't even I mean when they're showing it to you it's just scare tactics they're not they're not talking about what that means wasted people see it oh my god the blood is cloud even the football players who are in the experiment they were like oh wow I'm not gonna eat my KFC or Popeyes anymore and I'm like well you probably shouldn't but it's not for that reason right well saturated fat is the demon right that keeps getting addressed explain why saturated fat is not only healthy but probably necessary well I don't know that it's necessary but I would I would say that you know why I should say cholesterol is nicer well cholesterol is necessary and our body makes it to actually most of the cholesterol that we have in our body we manufacture it doesn't come from the diet about 30 percent comes from the diet about 70 percent we we make it the exact ratio varies depending on the person and you know some people are hyper responders of dietary cholesterol so they'll absorb more from food but it's you know it plays a vital role in the body there's a genetic disease called Smith Laemmle Opitz syndrome which results in severe cholesterol deficiency and it's it's fatal so you die with not enough cholesterol I'm not however one of these people on the other end of the spectrum that thinks hey if your cholesterol is 450 don't worry no problem there's you know like you know just write it off I think the truth is somewhere in the middle and by logical bearable it's variable yeah you can get I and I see this you know I've been working with patients for over 10 years I test every single person that comes through the door with a full lipid panel and I have people who are doing keto super low carb diets who have totally optimal normal cholesterol and then I have people who go from eating you know a moderate fat diet to like a high fat keto or low carb diet and their LDL P goes up to 2,500 or 3,000 and their LDL cholesterol goes up to 300 so yeah I mean what I can I think what stepping back a little bit as we talked about this with Joel but cholesterol for decades was like it was the boogeyman you know it was like that led to like egg white omelets and boneless skinless chicken breasts and you know bagels with nothing on them okay when I was growing up and now even the margarine margarine oh my god I believe it's not butter yeah I thought it was better than butter which like rats won't even eat if you leave it out in the garage really yeah yeah so batteries they won't eat margarine that's what I've heard I've never done this experiment experiment to do it otherwise we're pushing out disinformation as well propaganda good so yeah you know the US quietly actually removed the limitation of dietary cholesterol they used to limit it to 300 milligrams now that they don't have that anymore because the evidence didn't justify having that in the Dietary Guidelines we were the last industrialized country to do that every other company country had done that years ago right but because you know the how entrenched that was in our country and I think you know that they don't want to lose credibility it's like they've been saying not to do something for so long then to turn around say actually right there's no evidence to support that it's it's it's you lose face and when people talk about saturated fat and they talk about it as being only a meat or animal diet issue one thing that I always like to bring up is avocados yeah there's a certain amount of unsaturated fat and saturated fat every food has all three fat's in some proportion so you have saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and dairy products are actually the only category of foods that consistently have more saturated fat than any other type of fat pork for example often has more monounsaturated fat than saturated and even sometimes yeah lean beef and what's really interesting about that is that studies consistently show that full fat dairy which would be like the highest saturated fat class of foods is is associated with reduced risk of heart disease reduce risk of diabetes reduce weight and all kinds of other improvements full fat dairy is focus's dairy like raw milk they don't different you know they're not differentiating like that in the study full fat dairy why do you think so many people are lactose intolerant then because it seemed that that's an issue and I think I seem to have it a little bit and my nine-year-old daughter definitely has well so it wasn't until 11 you know before 11 thousand years 12,000 years ago we didn't raise animals for dairy so there was no need that we only had to digest lactose while we were breastfeeding No so I'm like in a hundred gather culture as soon as you stop breastfeeding you no longer had the need to digest lactose and so where our bodies are efficient we stopped producing lactase which is the enzyme to break down lactose and for the rest of our adult life but then about 12,000 years ago we we started you know if somebody figured out hey let's drink some milk from that ruminant animal over there and milk dairy products help people avoid starvation and there was a good source of hydration and nutrients and so that mutation started to spread and now it's about one third of the world has lactase persistence which means they can digest lactose all the way into adulthood and two-thirds don't and it depends a lot on your ancestry so 2/3 people are lactose intolerant worlds that wow that's interesting so the people who tend to be lactose tolerant are people of your peon particularly Northern European descent like lactase lactose tolerance or lactase persistence approaches like 97% in Scandinavia so Denmark Norway Sweden they can almost all digest milk and in East Africans so you have like the Masai you know people who've been raising cattle for a long time tend to have those that capability whereas like in Asia other parts of Africa in other parts of the world not as much what difference if any does it make when it's not a modulized and pasteurized in terms of your digestion because for me I don't have a problem with raw milk yeah milk seems to be easy for me yeah I think there is a difference I mean it contains enzymes in it that help you break down the lactose so that can make a difference but I mean just I would love to see research that further differentiates the health benefits of dairy according to whether it's organic or whether it's modernized or not and all that but even just talking about dairy as a whole category when you had dr. Walter Willett in there saying there's evidence of hiking high consumption of proteins from Dario's related to higher risk of prostate cancer the chain of cancer causation seems pretty clear but if you bring up slide 44 Jamie this there was a 2019 study largest review of dairy ever been done before it was a hundred and fifty three meta-analysis that they reviewed so not just individual studies they reviewed 153 studies that were also reviewing other studies and 84 percent of the meta analyses on dairy showed either no association or an inverse association between dairy and cancer meaning when it's inverse it means people who ate more dairy had lower rates of cancer whoa so I just it's frustrating you know to see someone make a claim like that and then you go and you look at the full totality of the research and you see a just exhaustive study like this with a hundred and fifty three men analyses and 84 percent are showing no relationship or a beneficial effect of dairy on cancer why wasn't that mentioned in the film well it's consistent with the way the message is being destroyed through the entire film it's it's a propaganda movie I mean that's essentially what it is yeah yeah so it's like reefer madness for me it really is yeah yeah so it's kind of crazy it is crazy I mean there's this there's the the thing that's hard I mean and this was true with with Joel's like that was three and a half hour plus debate I don't know how long we've been going now and we've even barely scratched the surface of like what we could say about the movie yeah and it's fresh it's frustrating because the the movie these kinds of movies leverage this rhetorical effect called the illusory truth effect which is basically if you repeat something enough times it starts to sound true yes and politicians are great at this Trump is actually a master at this so you know meat is bad meat is bad meat is bad meat is bad we've heard that so many times that someone can get on make a film and just include one little tidbit of information and say meat is bad and it seems like oh that's true but then to break that down we're here for two and a half hours and we're just getting started yeah that's the trouble yeah that is the trouble and it's not nearly as visually enticing just you and me so now you're talking well where's the pretty girls running track and yeah buddy laughing and having a good time eating falafels where the you know there's how many vegan documentaries that have been made like a lot what a health cowspiracy this one how many you know Pro regenerative agriculture holistically managed healthy nutrient-dense meat movies can you think of I can't think of any yeah so there's one coming originally it's called sacred cow it's coming out next year Rob wolf is involved in that I was interviewed by it it's made Diana Rodgers who's a registered dietitian is making it she's also regenerate regenerative farmer so it's a very interesting perspective having someone who knows the nutrition side and who's also actually using those kind of regenerative holistically managed practices on our own farm you know but it's not James one's not behind it right not gonna have Arnold in it you know Arnold's eating a steak right now that motherfucker he's full of shit he just wanted to do it James cameras like look we're doing the Terminator I really want you to be a part is I'll do it I mean only vegetables from now on the steak was just bullshit that shouldn't have eaten it I want to catch that motherfucker fuck with the child with that little chip on green just hacking it look I mean the steak is well so big the thing is he didn't become mr. universe by eating drinking soy protein shakes well I mean he again he's eating steroids that's what he's eating that's what he was but he was eating also 250 pounds of beef proteins a day 50 grams you know he wasn't he wasn't eating you know five cups of lentils no do that no so it was that's the other thing too you have to recognize with this movie like a lot of the people who were amazing athletes who they didn't start out vegan they weren't born you know to vegan parents and then we're vegan growing up and then you know had made all these amazing records and performance they built their strength or their agility or their speed or whatever on a diet with animal products and then at some point they became vegan and you know maybe their performance continued and they continued to do well like Scott Jurek or doggie pouch or maybe they had the vegan honeymoon where they did well for a while and then they declined or maybe they just declined like some of the NBA and NFL athletes we talked about but this is a critical point because there are key developmental periods when we're kids and also in utero that like if you're not getting the nutrition you need then it's gonna carry through to your whole life yes and so it's like what did your parents see what did what did that your mom eat when she was breastfeeding you what did you eat as a young kid so we follow that whole argument through if everyone becomes plant-based it's going to have a huge intergenerational impact on performance it's not like people who built their strength and performance eating meat and then they go vegan they do okay for a little while it's like what are the consequences of that happening to everyone consequences of growing up nutritionally deficient yeah of the mom starting that way and then you know getting pregnant and becoming deficient during pregnancy and then the baby being breastfed by a mom who's nutrient deficient and then the kid being fed a vegan diet and developing beet b12 deficiency which then becomes irreversible effects are there any top of the food chain world champion vegan athletes they like the best of the best well there is no there's no vegan UFC champions there's no world champion vegan boxer so there's Ilya iliyan do you know him he's the weight weightlifter that's I think in the same weight class as Kendrick Farris who was in the film mm-hmm and two-time Olympic champion where I don't I don't think Kendrick is one he's not won a gold medal but he was stripped of his titles because he tested positive for steroids so once again you know right what's happening it's hard to say what he was pulled from the film because that right yeah he was pulled from the or was he in the film I believe he was originalist right I don't know that you brought this yeah that's not a good narrative for them right right and then they had like Tim shieff if I'm pronouncing his name correctly he was he's like the free runner parkourers gonna be in the film and then he had this very public I'm not vegan anymore because it was destroying my health video on YouTube he ate a piece of salmon and had a wet dream for the first time a decade okay I mean it was like poor bastard yeah I was starving he was doing everything pot he did a 30-day water fast yeah he like he tried everything to stay on the vegan diet yeah it wasn't like oh it's hard I'm gonna eat salmon I should also tell you he thinks the Earth's flat Oh does he yes oh yeah yeah a bit that could be the vegan diet all those years rottenness fucking brain yeah well one of the main guys you know the the anthropological argument that humans are herbivores because we don't have claws and sharp teeth that all comes from Milton Mills in 1987 paper from him he's an emergency room physician he has no training and medical anthropology or comparative anatomy or anything like this he is a creationist so he thinks that we were just built less way and with these jumped in the way by God yeah that that hole why don't we this if we are carnivorous species why don't we this how come we don't have the teeth to that you know how come you can't just grab a squirrel and eat it I've actually heard a guy say that well hey fuckface how come you can't eat lentils you got to boil them yeah like what are you talking about man try eating cassava without cooking it you'll die sign yeah poisoning yeah it's like that argument is so stupid there's a lot of plant-based foods that are only consumed after lengthly cooking yeah I mean going back to your question I'm sure there are high-level vegan athletes but the thing is a lot of the people who are commonly referred to like the vena the the Williams sisters Serena and Venus they're not vegan yeah why do they we have there in the film they showed them in the film and I was like wait a minute they're not vegan because they're often people often call them vegan they occasionally will have periods of veganism I guess I said they're not vegan they eat meat they eat animal products look like Tom Brady is another example another one who looks like a meat-eater who you know really does eat a lot of you know you know predominantly plant-based I guess but eats meat especially in the winter the Williams sisters are so powerful I mean it would be a great like catch for that team right if they were vegan because like look at the athleticism that these girls have yeah but nope but it was weird they didn't say they were vegan they just showed them and so you're like oh they're the best they don't need to say it yeah that's it Arnold he's talking great about veganism I guaran-fucking-tee right now diving into a nice juicy area bye come on show me a picture where is he doing oh that fuck epicMealTime he did a video at them like five years ago you know eighty thousand calorie steak and egg sandwich Jesus Christ Arnie when does this ostrich eggs ago oh that's five years ago bro that's a long time I could be all vegan now I guess but I doubt it they did he was doing this while they were doing the new Terminator movie you know as a James Cameron movie he's not stupid college boy and even if he is now he didn't you know you didn't he wasn't then when I accomplished all of his athletic yeah of course yeah but that's where it's weird right it's like he did everything spectacular with meat and now he's saying you don't need it yeah yeah it's pretty later he's part time vegan he's saying in this article now now like two years after that Epic Meal Time thing Oh concept like how are you part vegan you know I'm sure vegans would take issue with that all right guy you know arguing with someone about this once I talked about this he said I'm 90% vegetarian and this was his argument like that like vegetarians way to go I'm 90% vegetarian like bitch that's zero [Laughter] it's even more ridiculous with vegans because before all it takes sometimes a little because like organ meats and shellfish and fish and eggs are so nutrient dense you don't have to eat a lot of them to get to get the meat your nutrition I had this conversation with vegans - about mollusks and I was like you know I've heard it argued and Sam Harris was talk to me about this that you could actually make an ethical argument that mollusks are more primitive than plants and that plants actually exchange more information through mycelium to the root structure and they actually communicate much other evidence of intelligence yeah their mouths are an older creature and they're they're just dumb hunks of meat you could scoop out of a container I mean they have no idea you're there they have just basic movement with a clamp shut that's it I mean they're not going stop no they're not trying to get away like a fish mollusks just fucking lay there and happened to be like I said among the most nutrient-dense food on the planet like one serving of oysters I think will meet your need for saying for the entire week yes that's pretty mean that's we're talking about yes and that's always been associated with male virility yeah so many different functions it's also owners who should have done that test right eat a bunch of oysters imagine that ready eight times more than the guys who were eating plants with the ring around their penis yeah what else is going on with this film that drives crazy well I mean going back to the whole environmental argument I mean yes that's another big one we didn't get a chance to talk about that as much with Joel because it would have been nine hours instead of four hours he would have yeah communicating is just so frustrating it's so it's so awkward and car salesmen E so one of the most common claims is like you know calorie ting all of the human food so like we you know corn and things that we could feed the world with yes well the reality is 86% of what cattle eat is is not edible by humans we talked about that before they're eating soy cakes and grass and fobs and things that we can't digest and absorb but I think the argument would be that if you just grew the same like use that same area to grow human food you could do that because we're using that area to grow cow food well so you replace the the feedlot beef with grasslands and then you have naturally you know holistically managed cattle there and then you take the land that we can't as I said before sixty percent of land you can't grow crops on so it's not it's you can't say that you can't say we can just take everywhere that we could have livestock and plant nominated saying that anywhere we have mono crops where we're growing food just for eat feeding cows you could grow say tomatoes and that's one option but the other option is to reuse that land for grasslands which could create make it a carbon sink rather than having still emissions coming from Mauna industrial agriculture I understand what you're saying but I mean if I was on the other side I would argue all that wouldn't it be easier to just grow human edible corn in that place instead of alone no no because corn is ridiculously low and nutrient value or something else or soy or whatever yeah if you look again this idea that animals are the middleman yes that's not a bad thing that's a good thing if you look at the conversion ratio of feed like corn which is super nutrient poor you know corn is as low in protein it doesn't have many nutrients at all two point six to two point eight kilograms of corn get converted into one kilogram of beef so even of in that 14 percent of human edible food that the cattle the livestock are eating they're converting it to highly nutrient-dense bioavailable protein that humans can eat and if you do the conversion with just protein instead of like by weight of food they take 0.6 kilograms of corn or other low value protein and convert that into one kilogram of very high-value nutrient-dense protein so you know it's always more nuanced then the argument makes it seem really is another example is gonna be so you know 2,400 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef is the typical claim that you hear what you don't hear is that vast majority of water even from feedlot beef ninety four percent is green water which means it just it's rainfall and six only six percent comes from greta's ground water like from irrigation for pasture raised beef it's even more significant ninety seven percent of the water for pasture raised beef comes just from rainfall and three percent from irrigation and beef really only if you only think about blue water like irrigation it requires two hundred and eighty gallons of blue water per pound of beef that might sound like a lot but it's actually less than you need to produce a pound of avocados almonds walnuts rice or sugar well you don't hear that no and in the film or in these arguments at all and again speaks to what you're saying this is these are nuanced issues these are nuanced issues and the devil is in the details hmm and so we're talking about with cow again we have to stress that only somewhere in the neighborhood of two three percent of all cows are grass fed grass so the ones that are eating grain are consuming more water but even then it's still less water than they're saying exactly and less than some other commonly yes vegan foods especially almonds almonds are particularly their very resource heavy right absolutely yeah but sugar I mean yeah that's crazy huh yeah yeah um what else about the film you want to talk about fake meat sure yeah but yeah let's not cover it as much in the film but it's good it's important for something like you that really understands it to talk about it so people get its this could be a standalone clip so just for people who know who aren't aware there are companies like impossible burger and beyond me that are promoting this idea of fake meat that tastes like meat and but it's made typically from soy so impossible burgers main ingredients are GMO soy coconut oil sunflower oil natural flavors beyond meat is P protein isolate canola oil refined coconut oil so impossible Burger has publicly criticized holistic land management and a regenerative agriculture and saying it doesn't it's not really that different in fact sometimes the emissions can be even more than feedlot beef but there was a third-party lifecycle analysis full lifecycle so they looked at the whole process not just methane emissions from cows burping but the whole process at white oak pastures which is a beef operation that's a it's a savory Institute hub so they're following this the regenerative savory Institute practices and they found that their beef operation was a net carbon sink so again it actually sequestered carbon from the atmosphere was not emitting carbon it was you know carbon not not neutral it was taking carbon out this is something I forgot to bring up earlier one thing that solves the methane issue with cows is just to add a certain amount of seaweed to their diet when you add a certain amount of seaweed to your through there apparently mitigates the methane the methane issue I don't know about that yeah I think you'd find that Jamie that's um something that was offered up as a response to and I don't think it's a large amount of seaweed I think it's a fairly small amount of seaweed and percentage to the overall diet I think the amazing thing about the regenerative agriculture and it can be I can restore the soil and improve the soil so you're not only producing this amazing nutrient-dense bioavailable food source you're actually improving the soil and helping to reverse this really dramatic threatening problem that we're facing of soil erosion seaweed could help make cows burp less methane and cut their carbon footprint LOL diet supplemented with red algae could lessen the huge amounts of greenhouse gases emitted by cows and sheep if we can just figure out how to grow enough so i guess that's you have to wonder where those how you know what's what kind of energy is being used so so back to this so this this life cycle analysis at white oak pastures showed that this holistically managed beef actually removes carbon from the atmosphere now this was the same company that performed a lifecycle analysis for impossible' burger and on their fake meat and what they found in that analysis was that the fake meat was less you know of a greenhouse gas emitter than feedlot beef but it was still actually an emitter whereas the holistically managed beef was taking carbon out of the atmosphere it was the same company so you know if we're gonna give them credit for the analysis they did for impossible' burger we have to give them credit for the analysis that they did for white oak pastures the other thing with impossible burgers so the primary ingredient is called soy leg hemoglobin or slh so this is a bio engineered protein additive that adds meat like taste and color it does not meet the basic FDA generally recognized as safe' the grass designation because it's not a food or even a food ingredient and there's a document that you can get I think it came with the Freedom of Information Act it's online I have the friends in my show notes and in the discussion in this document with the FDA impossible foods admitted that up to a quarter of a team ingredient was composed of forty-six unexpected additional proteins some of which are unidentified and none of which were assessed for safety in a dossier impossible Berger put the product on the market despite admitting to the FDA privately that they haven't done adequate safety testing and according to these documents quote FDA believes that the arguments present an individually and collectively do not establish the safety of slh soil egg hemoglobin for consumption nor do they point to a general recognition of safety so they don't know what the fuck it does what's in it but doesn't mean that doesn't mean it's bad just haven't done adequate safety testing to in the opinion of the FDA to release this as a food product the company that did the tests on this impossible burger versus the regenerative B what does that company again Qantas international and so it's the one they're the ones who release the information for both studies both the same company that did it for impossible burger and they turned around and and did it for white oak pastures and they found impossible burger is still emitting carbon whereas white oak pastures is taking it out yeah I think that's that's a very critical point yeah in this kind of change and there's a great there isn't an out an article criticizing fake meat by this woman dana pearls who's just you know part of an environmental organization called friends of the earth and she says quote instead of investing in risky new food technologies that are potential problems masquerading as solutions shouldn't we be investing in proven beneficial regenerative agriculture and transparent organic food that consumers are actually demanding the only issue that they would have with this is yes but now you're talking about killing animals and we're absolutely morally and ethically opposed to killing animals yeah i mean we go back now to this this two thousand eighteen paper that I mentioned earlier that examined the impact of plant agriculture on animal deaths and found 35 to 250 mouths deaths per acre mouth death Mouse deaths deaths of mice and up to 7.3 billion animals killed every year from plant agriculture if you count Birds killed by pesticides fish deaths from fertilizer runoff plus reptiles and amphibians poisonings from eating toxic insects from the pesticide what's in them 7.3 billion animals a year in terms of life there's far more life taken by plant agriculture then there is life taken by animal agriculture even factory farming oh yeah we're not killing 7.3 billion cows right so the question is do we value the larger animals more are they you know are fish and insects less significant life forms and mammals are small mammals like rodents less valuable than larger ones like cows is it better to kill many small animals for foods like grains and legumes which aren't very nutrient dense and don't meet our nutritional needs then fewer large animals that are super nutrient dense I mean I'm not claiming to answer these questions but I think they're questions that haven't been adequately raised and addressed in this ethical argument they haven't even been breached and that this is one that people dismiss offhandedly this is these are lies by meat-eaters to justify their consumption but what you're saying is you know you could make an ethical argument that killing an animal explicitly to eat it is ethically different than animals being killed as a sort of side effect of plant agriculture I'm not saying that that's valid argument but I've heard that argument I don't think it's a valid argument because once you're aware of it you're doing it the same it's like the argument that I've had with people when they say that I don't kill animals but I eat meat therefore it's better than what you do because I hunt and I say well no you're killing the animal with your credit backwards you're killing an animal you just get hiring someone to do it for you you're still going to jail for murder if you hire someone to shoot somebody right it's your more disconnected from the whole process that's it's even more bizarre it's the whole thing is very very strange I think that's very important though that you listed those those numbers that data because that's irrefutable and it's one of those arguments it comes up that they just want to their head in the sand about if you're buying agricultural s you have unless you have your own organic farm where you are a hundred percent aware of every single aspect from seed to plucking and cooking if you're not if you're buying from large-scale agriculture you're a part of the deaf machine right that's right and you're also part of the environmental destruction machine because these huge industrial scale mono cropping operations are incredibly harmful for the environment and if you know if you again like you think of like pea protein you know that's an incredibly processed food like the amount of you know first of all just growing peas at the scale you're gonna need to have the world's largest pea protein company and then all of the processing that needs to happen from taking a pea to isolated protein powder which involves fossil fuels and all kinds of industrial processes that is not an environment environmentally friendly process so you know is that better for the planet than having cows that are you know being raised on in on land that couldn't be used for growing plants or other crop production and rotating the the animals in a way that restores grasslands and improves the health of the soil that actually sequester's and removes carbon from the atmosphere that again like dana pearls was saying makes a lot more sense it's a proven system then like scaling up industry to make more powders mmm yeah scaling up industry to make peep out and killing untold numbers of rodents in the process you know and birds and destroying natural habitats because clear a field for peas it's not doesn't have the normal natural features you don't have the habitat for those animals anymore I think it's so significant that you're talking about these regenerative farms because that really is the only way you ever get the nutrients back into the soil one of the I mean there was a book that I read many years ago called dead doctors don't lie or dr. Joel Wallach talked about the mineral depletion of our soil and that this is something that they've known forever that's like a slow degrading the the nutrient density in the soil I mean if that's one of the things that keeps me up at night seriously like soil and water if we don't have soil there's no we don't know of any way to restore soil once it's gone so we have 60 years of soil sixty harvests left is that years I don't I don't know I harvest is probably more than once a year I would guess really I don't know I'm not a far I'm not a farmer either yeah even if it is what I think it's once a year but I mean even if it is once you're yeah basically it's still 60 years is fucking terrifying terrifying I'm not a streams coming yeah I got an eight-year-old daughter yeah that's right there'd be no food cannibals running through the streets um we'll have fake meat I don't even know if we whoa buddy won't because you have to grow soy yeah what will we have and it will have no more fish left either yeah what else let's see god there's so much I just don't know how anyone's gonna refute this like I said I really like James a lot but we if he decides to come back and come and sit with you after hearing this I'm watching this I don't know what he could say well you know you can it's like you said when a new study comes out with the meat then you get the whole group of people pointing to all that epidemiology again saying look this study says meet higher risk of cancer then we have to do the whole thing again help the user biased you know food frequency questionnaire context is everything you know that's why I say yeah I think we've hit most of the main points here anything else stand out in your mind from the no watch it just this morning oh okay so I'd be remiss if we don't at least touch on these so you know you said before like the argument against red meat has always been like cholesterol and saturated fat yeah that's and it was interesting in this movie didn't really talk about that very much they didn't talk about cholesterol a lot they probably forgot they didn't forget pretty sure I think what they're they are actually acknowledging that those aren't super defensible positions at this point yeah and so they switched over now to the new kids on the block which are TMAO neu5gc and heme iron so there was a guy who said let's see dr. Scott Stoll that's slighty teen Jamie so he says in animal products you're getting protein packaged with inflammatory molecules like neu5gc endotoxins and heme iron when we consume animal products it also changes the microbiome and bacteria that live in our gut and the bacterial species has have been shown to promote inflammation over grow and begin to produce inflammatory meteors like TMAO so I'll briefly address each of those but before I do that I want to just say a word about mechanisms versus outcomes so okay nutrition research can focus on outcomes which is like number of heart attacks or number of deaths that happen in a population over a given period of time or it can focus on mechanisms what caused those outcomes right so use the example of red meat early you know they saw in these big observational studies that people who ate more red meat died more or had more heart attacks or whatever we know that that was because of healthy user bias it wasn't you know accurate finding whatever but so then they start going trying to figure out what are the mechanisms and so initially the mechanism was saturated cholesterol then it was saturated fat now those are not as defensible so they're moving on to these new mechanisms well research on mechanisms is not very convincing if the outcome isn't there so you had that large paper that was just published the five papers in the annals that showed very basically no evidence that red meat is correlated with any disease so why are we even bothering looking for all these mechanisms that explain why red meat causes disease when we've got this exhaustive study that says that it doesn't yeah but let's humor them okay and talk about these mechanisms for a minute so neu5gc that sugar basically acts as a signaling molecule it helps distinguish self from not self most mammals produce it humans don't but like cows do so when we eat the cow meat you know beef or drink milk we get some new 5 GC and our tissues this is the theory and then our body's attack it in an autoimmune response so basically the idea is that neu5gc in meat causes an autoimmune response and that increases the risk of disease the problem is that hasn't been proven at all 2003 paper found that feeding people large quantities of neu5gc didn't actually increase their serum levels of neu5gc so that's a problem if you have studies showing that eating it doesn't actually increase in your blood then it doesn't really make much of a difference and then you have groups like the Masai you could not design a diet higher in five new neu5gc they they drink blood and milk from cow and they eat cow beef yeah and they have no you know extremely low rates of cardiovascular disease and they look great I mean have autoimmune disease and are dying that early so alright so that's new 5 GC then we have heme iron so this is the form of iron that's in beef and other animal products so it is true that heme iron forms these compounds called n nitro so compounds and toxic aldehydes that are implicated in in colon cancer but again context is everything so slide 22 Jaime studies have found that chlorophyll rich foods like plants basically if you eat them along with iron rich foods that cancels out any potential harmful effect of heme iron so this is that would be a great point to a diverse diet versus a carnivorous diet exactly this is what I was talking about before where there's a lot of clinical evidence that suggests that plants play an important role yes do I know for sure no I don't but I'm just saying this is adds an element of uncertainty so yeah green vegetables red meat and colon cancer chlorophyll prevents the cytotoxic and hyper proliferative effects of heme in Iraq there was another thing that they talked about earlier that I just remembered why you were talking they were talking about fuel and the difference between carbohydrates for fuel and protein that protein does not provide you with fuel fuel for muscles which is not true there's something that happens when your body eats protein that it can break it down to glycogen what is that called gluconeogenesis yes yeah so that process they just ignored in the film and the woman spoke about this well when they were who was it that spoke about it was it I don't remember who spoke about it oh I think was a man Douglas amendment dr. Lewis so when when he when they were so ever was it was speaking about it when they were speaking about it they were speaking about it like like well here you go like this is Lycidas to fat his clothes yeah kids clothes your body needs carbohydrates to convert to glycogen and that's not true everyone know everyone who knows like if you eat too much protein on a ketogenic diet it'll knock you out of ketosis because your body will convert it yeah if that's everyone knows that I mean yeah so that was a huge omission or oversimplification I mean I think you said this before and I agree with you from for people who are doing explosive types of activity like MMA or or you know CrossFit or basketball or something like that they're gonna typically do better with some with carbohydrate you know a substantial portion of carbohydrate in their diet whereas it definitely we're seeing a pattern now of endurance athletes or endurance activities a lot of those people can thrive on a very low carb diet Zac bitter one example but he's not just arriving I mean he's killing if he's murdering it yeah he's literally a world champion at running a hundred miles in under 12 hours which is just that's insane that's that even is bomb percent yeah again that guy's doing it on rib eyes and he does take he was talking about how he ups his glucose before these events yeah he's not I want to be clear I've heard him talk about this he's not full time keto all the time he knows what he's doing knows as he's approaching competition he needs more glucose replenish his glycogen stores extremely scientifically absolutely but it's it's not true to say that protein that you don't need protein for muscle I mean protein is all about muscle synthesis right can't do muscle protein synthesis with without protein so that was weird okay well also isn't it it hasn't been shown I think Lane Norton bio Lane was talking about this and his debunking of the game-changers it's actually been shown that glycogen absorption or you they get more recovery that's what it was from carbohydrates mixed with protein yeah then even carbohydrates alone or protein alone that's why I post workout nutrition often is suggested yeah both protein and carbohydrates yes so there's one more site I want to show on the heme iron thing which is 23 and 24 so this is the largest meta-analysis of heme iron studies and again for people not familiar with the term meta-analysis it's where you look at all you know a bunch of different studies that have been done and you analyze them together it's considered to be a very high-quality form of evidence so they looked at all significant studies through 2015 and they found a significant association between heme iron and disease only in the American cohorts in the Netherlands Canada France Italy Japan and Sweden there was no association found so what does that tell us go to the next slide please team well if you eat heme iron in the context of a super crappy standard American diet its associated with cancer and a problem but if you eat heme iron in a European diet which is less crappy yes then the US it's not this is a perfect example again of context also Europeans did they don't have grain fed steak yes different quality but I think it's probably more likely that they're not eating that is far less grain fed grain finished beef over there when you eat it it's it's really evident when you have a steak over there so TMAO and then gut microbiota and I think we're done after that okay no I think we did enough no so TMAO this is a molecule that's generated from choline pétain and carnitine in the gut by a microbial metabolism and some previous studies showed that taking carnitine supplements and taking choline supplements does increase your blood levels of TMAO big in omnivores they went up by like 37 micromoles per liter and in vegetarians 27 and that was you know art used to argue that vegetarianism was healthier because they didn't see as big of an increase in TMAO in response to this carnitine and choline challenge the problem is research has not shown that eating whole foods rather than taking supplements increases TMAO significantly especially eating meat and eggs there was a study in 2014 showed you need to eat four eggs in order to raise TMAO at all and the max rise was only 3 to 6 micro moles per liter compared to 27 or 37 which I said from supplements in ssam and 10 to 15 and others and then slide 25 Jamie this 1999 study tested the effect of 46 different foods on the urinary excretion of TMAO and six different subjects and eggs and red meat as you can see are barely even registering on the scale there whereas 19 of 21 types of seafood raised TMAO and halibut raised TMAO 53 times more than eggs did so the number look at the halibut graph was crazy and the cod so here you have this argument okay Kamio is bad we shouldn't eat red meat and eggs because of TMAO but halibut raises TMAO 53 times more than meat and eggs and if you look at the research on seafood consumption it's almost universally associated with positive outcomes you know lower risk of cardiovascular disease lower risk of death from early causes all of the rest of it so how how do we reconcile that here with this TMAO argument nobody has ever explained how to reconcile that so again interesting mechanism but the research is not really persuasive it seems like it's poorly understood in the chart yeah the other thing is that back in the original paper by dr. Stan Hazen that up about TMAO from 2013 this is slide 26 Jamie he said the high correlation between urine and plasma levels of TMAO argues for effective urinary clearance of TMAO so what that suggests is that even if we eat TMAO our body clears it out pretty quickly in the diet so if TMAO is high it's probably because of other factors and studies have found at least 3 one is insulin resistance increases TMAO levels by an enzyme in the liver well we know that about 1 in 3 Americans probably have some form of insulin resistance you know 70 percent or overweight 40 percent of are obese so it's possible that just being an insulin resistant overweight American increases your TMAO it's got nothing to do with me gut microbiota like disrupted gut microbiome and studies have also shown that SIBO bacterial overgrowth in the intestine can reduce can increase TMAO levels ton of people are dealing with that we know and then kidney disease which of course happens in people who have diabetes now 100 million Americans have either pre-diabetes or diabetes can also increase TMAO so you've got all of these factors that just have to do with again crappy lifestyle being overweight being insulin resistant nothing to do with me last point so there was a whole section in the movie about the meat ruining your gut microbiota and they think we're referencing to very very low carb diet studies that did show a decrease in key species of protective bacteria and also in butyrate productions so this is also one of my questions about Carnot carnivore you know super low carb diet for a long period of time but again context is everything that's not necessarily the effects of meat that's the effects of not eating plant foods and there was a good study slide 27 Jamie that it really established this so it was 2019 study in the in plus one so it's free full-text access you can go look it up got microbiome response to a modern Paleolithic diet and a western lifestyle context so they took I think they were Italians and they had one group that was on a they put a group of them on what's called modern paleo diet you know so obviously we can't recreate the Paleo diet but just what we all talk about when we say paleo and they found quote an unexpectedly high degree of biodiversity in modern Paleo diet subjects which well approximates that of traditional populations like the Inuit hodza Nazis in Peru so they found that eating a paleo diet made your gut microbiota it looked like a hunter-gatherer my paleo diet what we mean is meats and vegetables meat non starchy vegetables nuts and seeds fruits and starchy tubers like sweet potatoes so people who ate that diet had a microbiota that resembled hunter-gatherers which have the best microbiota like studies have shown that their microbiota is what we want to have so this study shows it's not about the meat it's about what you eat with me which is difference which one makes because we know what feeds our microbiota fiber is there anything in this movie that they got right till end on a positive note yeah I mean I think I agree with them on the problem like I think feedlot CAFO weight beef and livestock production is not the way to go right I think it can be environmentally destructive it's just we're from there where they went with the solution is not where I go they go to plant-based vegan diet I go to regenerative holistically managed livestock you know shifting the food production to a smaller scale or at least shifting them the method of you know plant production so it's less industrialized and doing things that actually can improve soil quality and sequester carbon from the atmosphere rather than scaling up more industry and more technology well I hope this acts as a guide for people that are confused used by this and I hope people recommend this because this is probably asked Thoreau a breakdown as anybody's ever done on that documentary and I just wish people would stop doing this I really wish they would just follow the actual science even if it's inconvenient to their dogma and it's a real problem when people don't it really is because it's it's confusing for folks and there's a lot of people who suffer health consequences because of that confusion well it's a shame too and then we talked about this with Joel like I think actually vegans and people who are recommending what we're talking about now have a lot in common you know we want better methods of food production we care about the environment we care about animals and animal welfare we just reach different conclusions about you know from looking at those problems and I we probably have more in common with the average American or person in the world who's just not even thinking about it at all is eating processed and refined crap and dozens more in common with the vegans yeah the difference is these people like the people that made this documentary and like Joel they want to ignore evidence it flies in the face of what they're trying to promote and they do it with really frustrating and deceptive methods and that's what I thought when I watched this film it was hard for me to watch the whole thing I'd watch little clips of it before and I kind of had gotten a review of it and knew it was all about but watching the whole thing like sitting there going what the fuck man come on I was on an airplane I told you yeah because I knew I had to be in an environment where I couldn't just run away and turn it off and but I was like laughing out loud in parts and kind of like a shout out motor part the boner part the peanut butter deli the peanut butter sandwich because I knew right off the bat you know there were just a lot of things that weren't were we're funny if but sad well Chris thank you for doing this and James will have you on if you won't really want to do this and he's game okay I mean well after this break down I wonder how game he's still gonna be yeah I wonder how game I'm gonna be like 7 and 1/2 combined hours on this I know listen you're doing the world a gigantic service and I truly truly appreciate it thank you tell people one more time the website kressler dot CEO slash game changers for all the references bibliography studies in the show notes Chris Kresser on Twitter and Instagram while I say Twitter that way twitter twitter and instagram as well say nothing or those places Thank You Chris really show thank you bye everybody [Music]
