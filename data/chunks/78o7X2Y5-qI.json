hello freak bitches like a bad outfit I mean I've worn costumes like that just something like sketches and shit okay buddy what is going on here in this picture this is so strange they're courting each other they're holding hands and staring juices eyes like you know what this is it's like you saw cartoons and you're a little kid and they just fucked your brain up you're like well this is what I'm looking forward to when I get out of this house then you get out of the house here car accidents gunshots rape but do they fuck each other while they're both wearing a costume or do they fuck people that aren't wearing a costume apparently and this is I'm sorry if you are a member the furry community and I misrepresent you but some of them have hatches where their asshole is sort of like those old school pajamas and those Wild West cartoons yeah member the Wild West pajamas where they had like like Popeye always had those Dukie flap you got two buttons that cover your shitter like the shit trap and you open up the trap door and drop a bomb in there and then button that fucker back up they didn't have probably had drawstrings they probably didn't even have like rubber waist bands back then right like those big buttons on either side how do they tighten down your underwear back down with buttons that makes sense they probably have buttons in the front and buttons in the shitter if he had buttons on everything back then so these kids they thought that was the future and then they went out there and they got punched in the face the moment they left their house and then probably somebody did terrible things to them and they went to school and they got picked on and then here they are just wishing they were a squirrel just like in the cartoon that was my favorite side when I was young and watch the squirrel cartoon oblique I want to be a squirrel I don't want to go to school I don't want to do this anymore it's one of you squirrel well the hotel we were at they had a request it was there filled up with furries except me and a few of the other UFC staff I'm not I'm not lying it's Bill amazing and they got a request and the request was the furries asked if they could put a litter box in the lobby no way yes they wanted to pay for a litter box to be brought into the lobby they liked this whole convention is all us so can we do that and like I was like what the fuck are you talking about they took my idea for cats they tried to get a litter box and put it in the front lobby of like the Westin in Pittsburgh to make smelly in apparently I mean it could have all just been just they could have been like come on man well they definitely were asking for food to be delivered in bowls on the ground whatever they ordered they wanted to put in a bowl like a dog food bowl and eat it on the ground right there's several different rooms that were requesting this that I can see though if you're gonna go that distance if you think you're not taking a shit in the fucking lobby all right you know I guess you don't know until you ask I think it's all us it's all us here it's just all us we're amongst friends well pay my bail well pay him let me just ask let's just ask like they're so crazy they just probably asked yeah I mean I guess like hebdo' just have a litter box in your room in the lobby yeah come on man I've been a lot of them had him in their room going up that fucking flight of stairs a duffel bag filled with litter it's there it's part of the sport when I came into bodybuilding it's not like I invented steroids they were already there you know my first mister and in periods in 1965 Larry Scott was the mr. Olympia in 1965 and he said he was using steroids and that was 1965 so when did they start being used I don't know but for sure in the early sixties 1965 did steroids when did they invent steroids I believe well you had testosterone I mean testosterone was used in the Second World War the Germans were using that with the SS soldiers so injectable testosterone was available then steroids which there are more refined version of testosterone I think late fifties how is it more refined in what way so you've got testosterone is a male hormone so it's basically 50% androgenic that's male like characteristics 50% anabolic repair build so they wanted to take this they wanted this part the anabolic and minimize the androgen because that's what gives you side effects prostate growth and all that stuff so they tried they refined it so that those effects were minimized and more of the anabolic effect that was the idea and as a guy called John Ziegler I think because they found out the Eastern Bloc they had their own had their own stuff called Serena ball so Sigler invented Dyna ball and I don't know don't quote me if I could be wrong but I think was about 58 or something like that he developed that her us weightlifting team 1958 I think was 58 yeah but before that you had testosterone so who knows what when people started using it but for sure from the early sixties it's been a part of bodybuilding and then other sports and they used to be a disclaimer inside the steroid thing saying anabolic steroids do not increase athletic performance that's hilarious right so they stated this and they also told guys if you take this you fucking balls are going to drop off you can wreck and die you're gonna get liver cancer so guys started using them and seeing that's all bullshit right so then they don't wanna listen to anything these medical guys got to say cuz you aligned to us then right so you're gonna be lying to us all the time not necessarily so yeah because you do have chances of side effects but it you could say it's been greatly exaggerated and so that's the problem with propaganda and deception right yeah tell the fucking truth and let them deal with it and that's what I do because I saw all this stuff on the internet about what I'm supposedly doing and I thought young guys are going to read this and maybe they're gonna do it so I did an article in a magazine muscular development I said here this is what I did this is what I did in office this is what I did for a contest and these are my opinions and you know my honest opinion is like I don't think it's worth it unless you you know competing and so on but ultimately it's up to you let me give you the information what you do is up to you and I don't know if 70% of the people like this a bullshit he didn't really you must have talked much more than this because I'm taking this actually I'm taking more than this and I don't look like him Oh tough shit man you know I always tell kids who want to be in this business to please wait like even when my kids - just wait wait till you like wait you gonna understand like I was able to be grown and and have some grown shit happened to me and just regular life should happen so that when this happened I still have a point of reference to get back to because you know like I know you've interviewed everybody this business affects you in such a way where you'll see one person one day I won't say the comedians name but I remember a comedian back in the day did like half of an HBO whatever and then the next week I saw him he had 12 bodyguards and they were pushing me back just got crazy got crazy crazy crazy and I've seen I won't say the names but they've been a couple of guys I never get this one to hit and I went up to try to say something to him and for some reason he had a white suit on white suit on and these big shades and I went to talk to him and he said not right now man I'm rich let me be rich and famous right now I don't want to hear your pitch pitch I mean you think you could get away and as he said it I had to sort of like okay but that's you know that's what happens but you gotta be careful that Todd goes in and it goes out and people come up and they remember they remember and they remember when you fucked with them and we've seen we've seen them we've seen them but but being a comedian we get we get a chance to sit in a different seat because we sort of are our jobs or observational you know and we still all have our own demons but it's it's just different you also get humbled a lot as a comedian yeah you got to get those jokes you're performing in front of a live audience it's all alive yeah that'll work and it doesn't work shit you gotta go back to trying boys and it got a set actors don't get a lot of that that's one of the reasons why they're kind of shaky yeah more shaky yeah right they don't get a lot of like that testing it live in front of people that humility only comes with them you don't in and it's and it's tough I was talking to actor another actor and it's tough go see I'm a comic who became an actor so I'm cheating yes I can do this and I know I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in st.
