now we're live 3 2 1 boom hello Annie very nice to meet you I'm excited to talk to you I'm super excited to talk to you about several subjects but this one thank you very much for this first edition copy of your area 51 an uncensored history of America's top secret military base book I'm super excited about this I heard through the grapevine you're a fan I'm a freak when it comes to this stuff do you what do you think is going on up there I mean same thing that's going on all over the place when it comes to military secrets which is stuff that you want to know about very few people know about and every now and then a journalist gets a hint mm-hmm yeah do you think there's any alien stuff up there I write in the book all about the yeah yeah well tell them last 12 pages you want me to well what do you think so area 51 was this secret test base where the CIA was running a spy plane programs right so interestingly my new book is about ground branch guys on the ground that's about air branch mm-hmm what we were doing in the air and it was this idea that we should spy on the enemy okay and but if you go back in time why area 51 really started you learn that it was a base hidden inside of a base nuclear weapons and it was all about beating Stalin at his black propaganda campaign since I write in the book hmm to hoax Americans in a war of the worlds' type scenario whereby little men who looked like aliens would get out of an aircraft and the government would go crazy about it and then Stalin would say look we have not only do we have technology but better than you but we have a better propaganda department than you rule that Joe you got to read the whole book this is like a this is a tough opening you got me losing stuff a lot but it's a good spot all right and it's good spy it so Stalin just hired short people what would he do all right I'm gonna make you save that I'm gonna make you earn yeah how's that I mean you want me to talk about that right now right off the bat why is it I'm sweaty gonna get to it we're gonna get to surprise kill vanish as well I want to just yeah why does it make you sweat oh my god it's such an incendiary topic I mean people people want to believe they're aliens right right okay I mean I've spent five books dealing with the mythology of area 51 which is phenomenal in its own way because it speaks so much to power to morality to information to you know people's desire to know what's going on and and the government's desire to keep things hidden so this topic is always coming up because a lot of people want to believe that there were aliens in that craft and my source who I write about in the book told me otherwise that they were genetically you know that they let me stop you right there because when you say that craft what you mean is the supposed UFO records had crashed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 that's what you mean right but that was never supposedly taken to area 51 was supposed to be taken to wright-patterson Air Force Base the legend has it that Truman flew there to meet them and right that's one legend yeah so in my book I interview a man who worked for the Atomic Energy Commission who tells a different story tells the story of receiving that craft at area 51 in 1951 which is why the base is called area 51 oh and that inside the craft were humans who had been altered surgically altered to look like aliens in a plan for Stalin to sort of twist Truman's arm because at that time we had the atomic bomb when Roswell happened we had the atomic bomb and the Soviets did not okay when you say humans that were surgically altered to look like aliens do you mean so this is 1951 so you're talking about four years after the supposed crash yes so what we have the monkeys they kept the body the capital body in what formaldehyde yes and also because the idea was and remember or I can't say remember because you haven't read the book yet right and I wrote this book eight years ago hmm but it did really impact a lot of my a lot of my thinking and working on on you know government secrecy projects because it makes you really consider what a hoax means and what it means to a population of people and how the government begins to work with disinformation versus cover stories and all of that but going back to answer your question that is what I was told by the source that but how reliable is this source this is a very incendiary idea to rely upon one individuals recollection of it which is why the book went through the roof in terms of people being upset about it I mean were there oh my god I interviewed 79 CIA guys Air Force guys spy pilots engineers I mean who's mad at you the conspiracy theorists were mad at me because they said this woman is bananas they were aliens well even if they weren't aliens right there's also there's accounts that it was some sort of a test vehicle and that there were actually just dummies inside their crash test dummies that they used there's been a bunch of different versions of it but the most compelling version of the area of 51 alien myth to me as Bob Lazar did you get into that yeah he plays a huge role in area 51 I mean before Bob Lazar went public no one even knew about area 51 people people knew people it was it was common folklore but there was no definitive proof that there was something going on over there other than some weird VHS footage of things flying around the desert that seemed to be behaving in a way that modern aircrafts are not totally capable of at least modern piloted aircrafts are not totally capable I mean which brings me to another book I wrote called the Pentagon's brain which you know sort of off this idea was like wait a minute what kind of technology is the government capable of anyway we have a whole department for that reason called DARPA which looks at weapon systems 25 years out so the idea that you and I don't know what the military is capable of in the air underwater wherever it may be is because we're not thinking 25 years out and they are and they're developing weapon systems the great weapon systems of the future that's what they call them right look how they developed the stealth bomber Lincoln that was all out in area 51 and groom Lake yes what do you think of bob lazar story because bob was our story what's it really there's some fascinating aspects to it but one of the most fascinating is some of the things that he's said that people said was horseshit it's told has been proven to be true like one of the things the the biometric reader that measured the the length of the bones in your hand and that they are unique as unique as a fingerprint and you feel like what are you talking about that this was something they really did have and they have photos of this thing now this is something he talked about and they claimed it was science fiction I mean it's fascinating when someone touches upon a subject that the government does not want known about for any reason mm-hmm and there is a campaign to discredit that person yeah there's no doubt that that happened to him I mean it was remarkable and I write about him in the book because if you follow the logic that my source told me that these were you know modified human beings as part of a hoax and the reason that I trust the source is because Joe he told me that he also worked on the program so he had like a burden to unload right and so if you follow that logic through then the bob was our story is that Bob when Bob Lazar said I saw an alien it looked like this it was small it had big eyes it's yes those were the jannat genetically I mean those were the surgically modified humans that the government was doing experiments on I think Bob lazarre's exact quote was he walked by a window and he looked in and he saw two agents that were it looked they were looking down at something that was very small and looked humanoid but he didn't know if it was a dummy or anything and he wasn't even supposed to be looking in there and it was a brief like one second look he is bounced around in his head back and forth has it ever occurred to you that maybe the guy who gave that information did work there but is also feeding you horseshit well the source was a major player in the Manhattan Project he went on and worked in the Atomic Energy Commission I mean there's a wing of a museum named after him his accolades his awards were so extraordinary it would please him I've never said his name although you know I will say this well you're giving her away give him away a lot of the stuff he recently died and he did give me permission to tell his full story after he died and I'm circling around that I'm circling around that but he was absolutely a you know with the queue clearance that's what you have when you have access to nuclear secrets so if someone has a queue clearance for decades and they're full of garbage you really have to ask my god should this guy have a queue clearance I mean that's reverse engineering his credibility but I think you should read the whole book because you know it's shocking what he says but it does make sense if you can get through four hundred pages of you know the CIA's idea about information disinformation why we need to cover things up why that's why I'm asking if you think that he's he might have been lying to you I don't believe it what's elaboration no I don't believe I don't believe so you think that the Stalin that the Russian government definitely did surgically alter people to make them look like aliens I believe were their images I believe what he told me did you see photos no but here's the rub ready okay when I was writing another book called phenomena which dealt with the CIA and the Pentagon's use of psychics okay mm-hmm over decades I mean this goes back everything I write about pretty much goes back to post-world War with no remote viewing stuff yes yes and it's all about government u.s. government takes pole position after World War two and we now need to always be ahead of the curve we must lead we can never get beaten by the Russians now it's China okay so the psychic program had a lot of people who really believe in aliens or you know other intel intelligence from other worlds and when I was writing the phenomena book I learned a whole bunch of new information about how upset they were with my story because they Baloo the source by the way they knew the source and they believed that he was fed misinformation so these are two sides of the coin which are super interesting I think if you can look at them with your own biased turned off and not have a desired outcome I want to believe this I don't want to believe this you know speaking of I want to believe you know I was working on a project with Chris Carter though who is the x-files creator and the one person I took the source that I wanted to meet the source was Chris Carter and I we went out there together and sat with him and met him and it was well because the source had never even heard of the x-files but it was like oh I know probably they talked about baseball you know really see I don't have a desired outcome I mean I would love it if aliens were real but when someone starts talking about disinformation and propaganda campaigns but they want you to believe them right but don't listen I'm here telling you the truth I mean you're telling you if you I'm not saying I'm telling you the truth at all that's why we're not you know let's wait for an hour three because it's too explosive people have such a horse in the race yeah already they with aliens you think well I mean maybe you are neutral I don't know I know I'm neutral yeah I will listen I'd absolutely want aliens to be real 100% it'd be interesting yes I'm not neutral but I am neutral in my perceptions and when I look at things I go hmm I don't know about that me too I want to see a picture like what are these what do these guys look like I mean what did they do to them did he describe what kind of surgical alterations I stayed with a source I mean after the book published I would go visit him we'd sit in a Chinese restaurant and eat and talk and I would try to get a droplet of information out of him oh my god he avoided I mean look here's another thing when the book came out his wife of 65 years knew it was him okay and I went out to Las Vegas and sat there in a room with the source and his wife and she said tell me this isn't true tell me you made this all up to her husband mm-hmm and he said it's the truth I mean that's a triangular version of getting at the truth but again to reiterate I believe he believes what he told me was the truth that was the truth he was told I think there's certain agents that think it's fun to fuck with reporters and journalists and make things up I really do and I think especially when they're talking about secret information that they were sworn to protect and then all of a sudden they want to talk to someone that they don't even know on the sneak tip let's meet at a diner I'm gonna tell you every that snot how we met well I mean yeah I mean whatever you met yeah well we met because I was interviewing nuclear weapons engineers who were setting off nuclear bombs in area 51 Marshall I mean in the Nevada Test Site area 12 area 23 and they all said to me you've got to talk to the top engineer of all this weaponry and they gave me his name and we talked for days and hours about nuclear weapons and then in one conversation he began to cry and told me this story that I was like what why is he crying he was crying because he participated in our version of the human experiments because what the Russians do we do look I've written five books about that we altered people to make them look like alien according to him we had a small program in 1951 where we wanted to see how the Russians did what they did how they made human beings look like this it's what they do take prisoners or something like what who they alter he said they were handicapped oh Jesus and he told me that he participated in this so again I mean unless you have someone that lost their mind at age 90 and was willing to tell their wife of sixty five years I lost my mind so he's saying that he participated in something that altered handicapped children when you say handicapping me like Down syndrome or something like that and they made them look like aliens and then killed them like what did how did they what did they do with this this is where we get into drops of information oh man but what I can say is he had a grandchild that was born that way and and the grandchild did not live long the grandchild died and it made him feel so guilty about what he had done hmm that he felt compelled to confess if you will and I remember saying to him why are you telling me this why don't you tell a priest and he said a priest would judge me and I can tell you won't why wouldn't you judge him I judge them well I guess that's why I'm a born journalist Joe because I really try not to judge people I mean my new book surprise kill vanish it's about assassins it's about people who work for the CIA who do what needs to be done on the ground in the name of national security I don't judge them this is why we you know what's really at issue here is morality right yeah I mean can I tell you how I got the idea for this book sure but let me before we go any further that's oh yeah was he saying that there have never been any encounters with alien spacecraft he was totally neutral about aliens he had nothing to do with aliens he could have cared less he didn't watch the x-files what was his take on Bob Lazar his take on Bob Lazar was that he probably saw something that the government had an extension of the program I mean he didn't know that was speculative we didn't talk about that I mean you know other than inference he was very limited in his and the information that he would get out but I mean I used 79 sources in that book that all went on the record in name and he was the one anonymous source because but like I said you know he told me after he died that I could tell the whole story are you going - I might you might come back write another book if you give me a break and back off the subject I might come back and tell you and your audience is your book I want to promote your book I know you want to promote your new book but I want to promote this book as well I mean I'm teasing you right but it's it's like it's an astonishing story and I think the best line of all is that people that read about that in the very end of what we did they go I wish they were aliens hmm so Stalin created some sort of a craft that mimicked you're gonna read it that's what you're gonna do the rest of the afternoon nope I'm gonna come back and we're talking I think we should probably get into this a little okay come on with a question okay I'm used to asking the question are you oh right it's a journalist yeah now Stalin and the Russians created something that mimicked a UFO something that looked like it would be from another planet is that what they did a mothership mm-hmm in those days drones were there was a mothership and a drone was attached to it and it was jettisoned off okay mm-hmm so in those days well in 1947-48 well they didn't I mean that was drone technology then okay right so there's a mother a mother craft like her aircraft and then the drone is like a small aircraft under it and it gets jettisoned off and that was what the craft was it was jettisoned off so that so stolen actually according to the source invaded our airspace which was the deep embarrassment to Truman so he invaded our airspace and then let this drone crash land on the ground with these things that turned out to be human they looked like aliens but they turned out to be humans that were manipulated surgically to look like yes as a way to and remember I mean not remember but where where this was was you know very close to a nuclear weapons base to our White Sands military base I mean this is like not a place you want the Russians to be able to get near you know I mean what was interesting is at area 51 we then went out and mimicked all of those one of our early drones was a mimicry of that it was the detour there was a m21 which was the mothership and a d21 which was the daughter ship so all of them was it wirelessly like we do now no no then it was like there was a pilot in the mother ship and they kind of let it go and it flew off I mean there's incredible stories of what the CIA was able to do out there at area 51 with their air branch you know the technology they're always ahead of Technology well what bob lazar did film that was really shocking was the film the filming of these drones flying around and performing these really crave you have seen those videos in the 80s it gets really crazy with what they're able to do and what they're but I mean why I like looking at history is because you can see the progression you know you see how science evolves you know bit by bit and then there's these great breakthroughs because what the government is always looking for is called a revolution in military affairs mm-hmm right and that's certainly what drone technology did later on as drones became developed after the Vietnam War so in the 1980s when Bob Lazar was filming all this stuff you think this was similar to the technology that we see publicly described today in terms of like what drones are capable of sure I mean that's what we had something like that back then there you know when when the f-117 was revealed during the first Gulf War that aircraft was being developed for 20-25 years out at area 51 actually at area 52 was where they had it set up to develop that stealth technology think about and what was amazing talk about keeping secrets they had something like 10,000 people working on that hmm no one knew about it that story was never broken by the press not by anyone it just suddenly appeared in the Gulf War and took out Saddam Hussein's you know facilities hmm that's a revolution in military affairs what becomes interesting is then it becomes obsolete because now everybody knows about it and everybody's gonna mimic that and now you have to have a new weapon system and that's the military-industrial complex so was this drone aircraft that was released from the mothership was this capable of autonomous flight or was it just they just threw it out there and let it crash the latter right and remember that information I am very limited to that's why it's wrong pages it's the source gave me these little bits of information which I felt I felt was important to include because it speaks to the big issue why is area 51 classified I mean now it's not President Obama was the first president to actually say area 51 publicly some people say because of my book all right meaning it was out the secret was out but before that I went through 10,000 pages of documents from the National Archives and every place you see the word area 51 was actually redacted right why would you keep that so secret I mean all the guys that I was interviewing say they could call it you know groom lake they could call it the test facility they could call it paradise ranch but they couldn't say area 51 why and the source said well because we did this horrible program out there and the government doesn't want anyone to know about that ever I mean their stories of like somebody asking Bill Clinton you know about area 51 him going white I mean human experiments who wants to be part of those horrible but the human experiments were were they limited to this mimicry of the Russian experiments where they were trying to get people to look like aliens or there's something else going on oh my goodness I mean you read now the declassified documents tell us how many different human experiments were going on around nuclear weapons okay horrible experiments where they were subjecting people to radiation because they wanted to know they felt well it's more important to know what happens to people than to not know and so they would take groups of people that say had cancer or something and test them so there's no doubt that the government has experimented on humans it's just is that something that is wise to make public and you know there's two sides of the coin on that I mean you you when you reveal these kind of things when you write about them I mean people get really upset and you know vilify the government partially with good reason and partially it's like bad for national security so I think that's the justification on the part of the Defense Department to keep things secret that make sense Wow it's uh it's an interesting take that I never thought of before but if I was stalling and I was trying to air quotes fuck with the Americans that's maybe where I would do it hey man you got a problems aliens they're coming and there was if people it's hard for people that live in 2019 especially if you're young to really imagine a world not only without the internet but with two television channels right and radio which was where people got all their information from I mean was there two channels how many channels were in 1947 maybe three maybe three I mean it was Radio in World War two right yeah mostly radio and newspapers and that's where people were getting their information and there was a mass hysteria where people were absolutely terrified that we were going to be invaded which is why when Orson Welles War of worlds which when they released it when they did it on the air they were very clear that this is going to be a reading of Orson Welles war of worlds book or that HD Welles excuse me war right was HG Wells book and Orson Welles read it yes and when they were talking about this on the radio a lot of people missed that part right and so as the radio went on as the broadcast went on people were tuning in later in the day it erupted in mass hysteria people were freaking out hundreds of thousands of people really did think that it was and it was also something that was recreated in other countries I don't know if you know that they did that in other countries in different languages when they thought saw how cute it worked in America and so you see yeah I can see the logic I mean at first it sounds absurd and it's ridiculous and that's why I was sweating because it's like I know Ryan right but when you think it through and I challenge you to read the whole book because you start piecing together these various ideas and disinformation becomes less vague and more specific and you go that's how it works and you begin to see how people's perception and how they're easily manipulated factors into national security just like you just described Stalin knew about that he was a master he was the master of propaganda he invented it I mean he didn't invent it but he invented it in a you know on the political stage to be used to mess with another country's perception of things think of what he did with brainwashing right okay so like in the 50s and this is journalist you know said so there was a journalist who was putting out stories about brainwashing and there is this idea which is well taken that totalitarian governments brainwash people and this became a big code word it was introduced into the American lexicon in 1950 well then were in the Korean War our pilots start getting shot down they're put on TV by the communists saying terrible things about America the American pilots and suddenly I was like they've been brainwashed it was very convenient to have that story so these things work part and parcel and you've got all kinds of smart people behind the scenes knowing this looking at it examining it and using it to their advantage to stay where in the pole position that's the goal of the US government so the propaganda that we did that sort of copied Stalin's that we're kind of playing catch-up in that sense I mean we're playing catch-up then we're ahead behind it's always a it's a game it's I mean you're a competitor you know this that's a crazy thing to do to make a fake spaceship and just let it slam into the ground with a bunch of people that you cut up to look like aliens did he say specifically what kind of modification they made to people that made them look like aliens I got trips treated in those twelve come on with this twelve pages I'm telling you that because you're asking me these questions that as if I spent I mean look I did spend literally hundreds of hours with a source we sat there and talked about everything and I would try to squeeze out just like you're trying to squeeze out of me and that's what I'm saying read it because I literally tell you everything that there is I think what's most interesting about the sort and why I might come back and talk to you about it and tell you who he is on your show is because because of his backstory hmm right why he did what he did how he wound up in the Manhattan Project it sounds like he was probably Jewish from Germany no morality talk to me about morality I want to talk about why we can't talk about certain things well while we're what you were saying before about being a competitor the United States is competitive obviously and when you're playing the ultimate game which is war you have to be very careful about what you reveal and what you don't reveal and this is where the conversation about surprise kill vanish comes in because the CIA using these covert operations to assassinate people and whether or not that should be allowed or not allowed whether it's good or bad whether it's necessary whether it's like if you want people to be safe over here there's certain people you got to take out and sometimes you just can't follow the rules and why why are we not supposed to know about that should we know about that the way the story started for me I'm at my house in 2009 a source is you know calls me up he says I'm on my way back from the Middle East gonna pop by the house and say hi he brings me a challenge coin that says Kabul Afghanistan State Department I'm thinking okay he is not a diplomat I mean he's weapons trained at the time my boys were young there are lots of GI Joes in the garden and they had little weapons right and the source is showing them about the weapons and they're like so into it cuz they know he's military trained and then he says if it's okay with your mom and dad I'll show you some weapons the boys are like please so he sets up this sniper rifle in the living room and I live up in the hills and you can look across the canyon through this scope he set up and I can see the veins on a leaf across the canyon and I thought okay so now I know what he was doing in Kabul Afghanistan he's taking out al-qaeda with this mm-hmm there's another case on the ground that he never opens and when the boys go off I say to him what's in that and he said he opens it up and inside there's a knife and it's serrated and I said what's that for immediately realizing you know my naivete and he says to me sometimes a job requires quiet so why that became interesting to me was because of my own thoughts and perceptions about what he had told me in other words I could I could deal with him with a sniper rifle I could me like okay that's what he does but the knife gave me pause I was like is he slitting someone's throat is it in the ribs and I thought why is it that I am willing to accept sort of the clinical nature of a sniper rifle but I can't I'm uncomfortable with that close-up hand-to-hand killing and that led me to surprise kill vanish because that was the motto of the precursor agency of the CIA it was called the OSS the Office of Strategic Services their motto was surprise kill vanish because they would jump out of aircraft land work with their french partners and kill Nazis with a you know a knife to the throat and I thought okay that's considered okay because they were Nazis right but we can't we're not supposed to do that anymore in this world we live in why and I spent the whole this whole book researching and reporting is about that sort of conundrum if you will that moral puzzle you know why do we why do we differentiate you know and who are they willing to do that to where do they draw that line like I'm sure you're aware of the story of Jamal khashoggi the journalist who was assassinated by someone some group of people and that they entered into the Turkish embassy and they whacked him and chopped him up and carried him out in boxes and it's an international as well as a huge incident right supposedly was ordered by who was it supposed to lure by the head of Saudi Arabia yeah MBS Mohammed bin Salman I mean that's the idea is that their head of state wanted him killed because he was a threat because he was a reporter because he's writing some things yeah and that they this is how they did it yeah I mean and there's that's a great question because what you're saying is like okay so but we all think of that as reprehensible right right right why you know cuz because he's a journalist and on our side he's delivering information to people but the government of Saudi Arabia disagreed they liked that information is our information he's a threat by releasing it yes he's a threat to our livelihood yes yeah and who decides who is a threat I mean a lot of this book is about who's on the kill list I mean there is an actual kill if they're always husband and the euphemisms involved I mean I write history as I said so Eisenhower called his assassination program health alteration I mean literally in the declassified documents there is health all three she had a health alteration committee whoa Kennedy had an executive action committee that's also cleaner right guess what Reagan's was called super Wonder Boy power up close pre-emptive neutralization preemptive neutralization Wow why do they keep switching the names for it they're burying the information right and they keep switching around the they switch around who has authority to you know say yes let's go ahead and put this guy on the kill list I mean that was fascinating I mean I interviewed a guy named John Rizzo who was a decades-long CIA attorney I was stunned that he was willing to talk to me and he explained to me how a presidential finding also called a memorandum of notification works that gives the president the authority to put an individual on the kill list that job is then given to the CIA's paramilitary army an op or they're assassins because the CIA works under a code called title 50 of so it makes it legal whereas the Defense Department works under what's called title 10 so in other words and they can't their rules of engagement are totally different so the misnomer is like oh the SEALs killed bin Laden well they were seals trained but that was a CIA mission because Pakistan is a sovereign nation and the military can't kill people in countries were not at war with so those guys all became essentially CIA operators for the night whoa right and if you look at photographs as I have seen you'll notice that they have no markings on their outfits so that if the job went south it'd be like I don't know who these guys are and if you look back at Vietnam photos of the Mac V SOG teams which I also write about in surprise kill vanish because that's the precursor of that you see no markings right that way you can go into you can go behind enemy lines you can go into Laos you know in the Vietnam War you can go now you can go into Pakistan what I learned reporting this book is we're in 134 countries doing title 50 operations think about that government wants that to be kept secret so in all those countries they're doing things that don't fall under the normal letter of the law not yes not under the rules of engagement of the military but the CIA works at the president's behest that that was one thing that really blew my mind to report to research to understand I talked to forty two guys who have direct access to this who are in this world you know from the knuckle draggers on the ground as they call themselves to the lawyer at CIA senior intelligence staff that's the equivalent of a general at the CIA those guys explaining to me Annie this is how it works you know and again to your question well why why does someone get to know that why does the government want why do they allow that information out is super interesting and I believe that has to do with a certain climate we're in right now about military might right in other words what the CIA does is called tercio Optio it's the third option you've got the first option is diplomacy second option is war so if diplomacy is not working and war is unwise you go to the third option which is the CIA's paramilitary and they're in a hundred and how many country 134 do you well if you wonder why the military budgets so big that's what it is folks gotta feed those folks well work I mean what happened and you as a competitor would be fascinated by the kind of training they do and what they do I mean so many of these infiltration techniques are mind-boggling you know they've got halo jumping which you know about right where they high altitude low opening so they jump out they you know freefall down terminal velocity pull the ripcord really low so they're not detected by radar and then they meet up with a team on the ground and go do what they do and they also have hey-ho which is high altitude high opening and that way you can fly over airspace where we're allowed and float into let's say a country like Iran and land gather your team and do what you have to do hmm but like so much of what I report I get information like that and then I ask a million questions like you've asking me and it's like I can't talk about that that's classified hmm you don't you you're a journalist so you're trying not to judge mm-hmm but is it your belief that this is a good thing for America meaning President having a third option well I mean I write in the book that that's in the prologue after I tell that story about the source with a knife I say I wanted to know and that exact question like is this a good thing and my answer at the end after its complex not to be vague but it is really complex is also that well if you're gonna take that pole position you must accept rivalry right mm-hmm and also after talk do I think it's a good thing after talking to a lot of twenty-year-old soldiers who come back from the war theater missing a limb with intense PTSD and who essentially serve as cannon fodder I would say my opinion right for the Pentagon that's the second option war the 42 guys that I interviewed you know they're like send me they are a professional they are Tier one operators they're Green Berets they're seals their Delta they retire they join the CIA yeah so they're like professionals at what they do and they're saying I want someone has to do this job we've been doing this since the end of World War two I want to do it so do I think it's better I mean I think that that concept speaks to choice right because I'm not so sure that the 20 year olds know what they're in for and the 40 year olds know what they're in for and are willing to do it so that well also the difference between a specialized trained individual with a very specific task versus someone who is sort of following orders and at the front of the line yeah right I mean and also has a you know a lot of times I talk to these young kids who go to war and they tell me one of the fascinating detail is that they talk about movies that they see and whether it's Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down even right where the outcome is not necessarily great but they talk about the romanticization of war and of camaraderie and a brotherhood that comes from that and then they have their experience and some of that does give them that sense but not always whereas the operators are much more about you know getting the job done that's what I was fascinated by I mean these guys are really clear they're their competitors they're like top tier competitors they have a job they do it they get it done and they ask for the next job so is the oversight when it comes to choosing whether or not this operation takes place or not is it do they have moral guidelines do they have ethical or moral guidelines where they say like this is the president is requesting that this person get taken out the Chiefs of Staff whoever it is is that do they have to make a an ethical distinction you mean or they like kill him nicely like don't make it over this do they decide like does this make sense or like what if the president is like Rosie O'Donnell she's been talking shit take her out you know well I mean that's you know that's a big issue but what I try to write in what I try to report in surprise kill vanish is the idea that the people we take out maybe are bad guys right one one guy write about his che guevara okay because che is often portrayed in the press as you know this amazing hero and that he and we you know I don't know if you know but he was he was killed by the Bolivian Rangers but it was a CIA operation and I interview the man in charge of that operation in Surprise Cal vanished his name was Felix Rodriguez ok long-serving CIA paramilitary officer so but I also report why the President to your question wanted Che Guevara dead you know he was really advocating for nuclear war and I and I shared it revoir oh yes I mean he spoke publicly about you know if if we have to have an atomic war the Cuban paraphrasing the Cuban people will be happy to have sacrificed themselves that I mean che was also che killed anyone who betrayed him he killed he writes about it in his Diaries as I write in the book right so but on the morality question who decides I don't have that answer but I will tell you what I did I went with my main source Billy wha-hoo he's a 89 now and he was he's been with the CIA for 60 years okay I mean he went and he and I went to Cuba for him to do a halo jump with che guevara son so we were a guest of the man whose father was killed by the CIA okay and we had this really interesting discussion in the cigar club where che and Castro you know smoke cigars and plotted the downfall of the United States and that's what I try to give readers a sense of the long lens of history how time changes all things and maybe leave with them them with this idea which they can come to their own conclusions about what you asked me of is it right or is it wrong because really what you might ask is is it necessary mmm right I mean I could moralize right wrong but it would just be my opinion but when you see I went Billy wall and I also try out travel to Vietnam because he was supposed to kill he was tasked to kill the top commander of the North Vietnamese Army a guy named general shop and law didn't kill shop and we had this incredibly this terrible mission that went awry that I write about in the book in the Vietnam War so 50 years later law and I go to visit the son of general giap are sitting there in shops home talking about these same issues right and my conclusion of that again is not is it right or wrong but is it necessary I mean we have these wars we keep having these wars is it necessary yeah what do you think well I mean my opinion is that the Defense Department is far too concerned with vast weapons systems of the future which is its mission statement of its science department and so you create what some at the Pentagon call a self licking ice cream cone or the military-industrial complex hmm there's a lot built into there's a lot to be said about that and there's also probably some concern about other countries getting ahead of us so you have to do what you have to do if your if your job is to protect the American people and to keep the military strong you just have to operate with that premise that there's a bunch of other people out there that are doing the same thing for their country and trying to take down the United States and we got to stay ahead of the curve and make human eating robots that can shoot missiles absolutely I mean when I was reporting the Pentagon's brain which is about DARPA and I was sitting there with scientists who are working on limb regeneration right or oh right yeah what do they do oh my god they have these little salamanders I mean they're showing that salamanders can regenerate their limbs and so human their idea they're down at UC Irvine they have this incredible lab and they're funded by DARPA because that's where the money it comes from right and their idea is that humans should be able to regenerate their limbs and you know 50 years out we'll be doing that and they're working on the science for that well that's the same science that allows for cloning and so in our discussions cuz that's how I try to report is like really ask people what they think about future consequences and they said to me your exact question which is well Annie what if one day we wake up and we find out that China has cloned the first human or a dark horse like Saudi Arabia you know the American people are gonna freak out and go where the hell was DARPA why aren't we ahead of the curve so it's that there's a chicken and the egg problem with that of like well we have to stay ahead we're we're on top we want to be on top it's kind of terrifying I mean everything I write about is terrifying well you have to take ambien I'm more worried about now god no I'm I'm more worried about coming on your show and being asked tough questions when I am about no excusing you but then I am about I mean this stuff is informative you know it's informative and it's a longer conversation that's why I think what you do with your podcast is awesome because people can really get into the thinking about things right they can really and they can move away from their own preconceptions their own biases they're bringing into it and they're stopping for a minute and they're going what do I really think about that and to really think about something you need information yeah an information can be boring unless it's interestingly presented through conversation through you know uncomfortable conversation well also uncompromised conversation where you don't have a certain time period that you have to smush something into like a four-minute segment on CNN or something I mean that's impossible what's so difficult I see people have these conversations about books or something that are trying to accomplish very nuanced subject that they're trying to discuss and you know there's another person other sides like that's not true and they're shouting over each other and like boy that just the pressure the people have to understand that people do understand but you have to reiterate it and it has to be kind of drilled in your head you're when you're pressuring someone and and you're yelling back and forth you're not even going to get a good version of whatever this person's argument is like you should have the best version I want like if I'm gonna have a disagreement with someone I want the best version of their their point and I want them to get it out with no pressure I want to help them get it out I'd like to reiterate it with them I like to give them plenty of time I want to know how you think I know what you're thinking about I would love to talk to these guys I would love to loved it but the thing is like you they can't tell you a lot of this there's a Ramin for national security reasons there's a lot of reasons I'm sure if they want to keep their job and stay alive they have to they have to shut the fuck up they can't just talk about what they do and how they do it and how and decisions that maybe they made that were uncomfortable where they killed somebody they didn't think maybe needed to die yeah but but that's the reporters job or at least my job so in other words okay so I go to visit Billy wad his home and I knew I heard stories about he's this legendary operator right and he's also what's called a singleton so he works alone and when I was added to call them singleton right which is like he's got one guy giving him orders oh he's out there oh my god I mean Billy wah is right I mean back can we back up first I'm gonna give you this room ok so here's this guy he's in he's in Vietnam and he's part of what was called Mac V SOG right and they're doing cross border missions into Laos and it's so dangerous it's like it's a CIA program that SOG stands for studies and observations group I mean it's supposed to sound like a bunch of guys in Ivy League tower with bow ties right but the guys on the ground called it suicide on the ground that's how dangerous a hundred percent of the people had casualties right Billy wah has nine Purple Hearts from the work he did nine okay I mean they get shot they bandaged themselves up they're you know they're up in an aircraft because they're limping instead of on the ground you know viewing the missions the warrants everybody's furious with the government with the military there's no room for special operators I mean everything it's called the Time of Troubles by them Billy was working in the post office and he gets this knock you know and it's like he's back in the CIA now in 1977 so he was out for he was out it was over again I mean he was he was you know it was over that was it he was working in the post office right I mean a team needs you I mean but he said the most incredible thing to me because he said I and he doesn't ever talk about fear and he said there was only one time my whole life I've ever been afraid and that was in the post office whoa because he was getting back into it probably had like recycled his mind and put himself in a place I'm just a civilian now and he said I'm gonna wind up being one of those old guys drinking beer at the end of the bar talking about the war right and instead he gets called up by the CIA and they send him to Libya in 1977 and his cover is that he's training Qaddafi's paramilitary guys in paramilitary tactics I mean that's the beginning of his career and it goes on all the way until we were in Cuba I think was actually some kind of a mission because it was like what are we doing here in Cuba doing infiltration and exfiltration techniques allegedly with J Guevara son but in any event you know when I went to visit Billy well the first time he's got this you know he's got certificates and awards and medals all over the walls of his home but there's one framed item that I'm looking at and it's a knife and there was a seal from the CIA and it says in appreciation to the assassin mmm and I said Billy tell me about that and he said you know I can't talk about that so I you know stayed with him for two years now I mean stayed we conversed we traveled I interviewed him you know hundreds of hours and I kept asking him about that award and he kept saying you know I can't talk about that but as I write in the book he couldn't talk about it but others did so that's how a reporter works you get introduced to enough of his friends enough of the others who are involved you make sure they're a legitimate source and you begin to find out what he can't talk about and that's what I report in the book and that is very explosive because President Bush right after 9/11 created what was called a stalker team and ironically you know people have this idea that we've been you know sending a team of assassins around the world in NATO partner countries and that what I learned had never happened until right after 11:00 with his stalker team 12 men and actually one or two women the femme fatale and they would go after bad guys and they adopted the term from the Reagan era so it was called pre-emptive neutralization who was who were the women there's always one woman on the team that's what I was told by the guy who is in charge of the stalker team and bars are well I mean he gave me this great example I don't report in the book but I'll tell you right he said so women have a different presentation and this like he told me a story of a woman sitting on a bench you know in embracing a man right and no one thought anything of it and it allowed her to spy on someone in a manner that would a man would it would have drawn attention and then the stalker team could go so what their job would be to is to conduct surveillance of a target and they call it making book they have to make book on that individual so they know exactly where the guy is and they're waiting on the president's orders whether or not they should take action and you know that's where the that's where the information stops right I say well then what happens well that's all we can say Annie that must be so exciting like to live like that like all cloak-and-dagger gotta be so exciting like it's I would take that over a cubicle every day of the week I really would well you might get killed I might die in that damn cubicle too I think it's why so many of these operators stay in it long term right did you ever see the television show the Showtime show what the hell's are called with the fuck's that show called that the homeland yes yes well that's like the whole premise like she's completely addicted to being in that world adrenaline I mean that's what that is imagine jumping out of an aircraft landing in you know behind enemy lines and then your work begins and then you have to get out that's why surprise kill vanish I mean you got to surprise your way in kill them and then get out and if you're getting in they frame your knife and give you a plaque Jamie I'm gonna get you a knife it's an appreciation of the assassins you're a killer it's just such a crazy way to live your life but you know I'll take that over a boring life I would take that over a boring like every day of the week well it's like the Pink Floyd line you know living life of quiet desperation I mean that just terrifies that's the rose quote that most men live lives of quiet desperation it's one of my favorite quotes ever because it's true it's not Jim that guy you just you're just in this world where you just can't wait to just run away and how do people get stuck there how do you think they get stuck there bills bills like financial thing hmm yeah bills and commitment you have an apartment you have to pay for you have a car you least you have a wife that you have to feed you have a child do you have to raise you have to you have your mortgage you have your this you have your that and that's where it all comes from where do you think opportunity plays into that well the opportunity takes place usually when you're young and you don't have any responsibilities though that's when you have your options well your options are severely limited the more you gather responsibilities like if I had as a 51 year old father of three married man pays taxes has a house and a mortgage and a business and all that jazz if I had to quit everything now and struggle the way I struggled as a stand-up comedian it would never work but the only way I could be this person now is if I took that chance when I was 21 when I was dead broke and had my cars repossessed and all that stuff that's the only way you you ever get where you want to go you have to you have to take a path it's dangerous and most people want to take the safe path and the safe path leaves you stuck in quiet desperation almost every time it's hell it's hell you're selling insurance or some other shit they care zero about but can people just make that change I mean you can't believe it you have to plan it out the way you can change is you have to put aside enough money to give yourself a window and then you have to have a plan and you have to spend all your waking hours outside of whatever shit job you do planning your escape and you have to come to the realization very clearly that you fucked up and you got yourself stuck so whatever you're doing you have to do it like your life depends on it and whether it is you're trying to be an author and you're gonna you're gonna if you're gonna try to be an author and you're working eight hours a day plus commuting plus family responsibilities or whatever else you have whatever time that you have you have to attack like you're trying to save the world you're trying to save your life you don't want to drown that one-and-a-half hours a day that you have to write goddamn you better be caffeinated and motivated you got to go you got to get after it and you got to have discipline that's most people don't have those things most people don't understand what it's like to really go for something and to know that the consequences of not doing that are horrific then you're desperate yeah but I do think there is something to be said for fate and circumstance sure and I always write it I mean people in these military and environments that I write about and in these intelligence world environments fate and circumstance plays a big part because they too can even get complacent you know but when your life is on the line right a lot of times they have these experiences where they're like I must change and that's what I find really interesting yeah in people sure desperation yeah um I think fate and circumstance are giant the fortune is giant there's no question about it some children get shot in drive-bys you know that's just horrible horrible luck and unfortunate circumstance there's a lot of a lot of it is fortune and fate how about people getting lost right okay so the book that I told you I wrote on the psychics phenomenon wouldn't believe about that again I'm neutral right well mom you're not tell me I want to hear what you believe I think there's a lot of people are full shit absolutely God all people that are talking about being psychic or full shit but I do think that there is a strange connection that we have with each other that's intangible and I think that some people have better connections and others just like some people more intelligent like we were talking before the podcast about Elon Musk and it's painfully aware when you talk to him what a champ you are he's so fucking smart and his brain is it just it's built different just like some people have defective hearts some people have a heart like Lance Armstrong it's incredible huge of an anomaly some people have giant hands he's a big heart literally yes literally and they don't know whether or not that's from training or steroids and EPO and or whether or not it's something he was born with they really don't know but yeah as an unusually sized heart it's usually large but what was my point they circumstance getting lost no psychics psychics that's what is I don't I think that most of the people that can tell you the future a full shut most of the people that are taught I think people get feelings I think sometimes you think about someone they call you and I don't know what that is I don't know if that's just complete fortune like how many times you think it about a person when they don't call you that's the argument against it but how many times you thinking about that person they don't call you but they're thinking about you as well how many I mean how how often is that with star-crossed lovers they find each other years later and they tell each other they've been thinking about each other all the time they can't believe it that's that's and when you get that text from someone maybe that's just someone prone to action but maybe there is some sort of a connection some sort of quantum entanglement between you and someone you spent time with or shared energy with it's possible it's possible but the problem is you have these mediums and psychics and those people are just assholes and I have a friend his name's Banacek and he runs a Las Vegas Mentalist show where he shows you how he does these tricks but he'll tell you absolutely these are true he's been on the podcast a brilliant brilliant man but he'll tell you these are tricks I'm showing you how I do this this I mean I'm going to tell you that's a track I'm not going to give you the how I do it but I'm gonna tell you while I'm doing it this is a trick but he's pulling all this information out of people about their past their childhood he's guessing people's ages he's guessing where they grew up I mean and it's it's all a little sneaky shit you know it's the way they do it's it's a skill as much as anything and so when you see these people that are channelers or you know psychics there telling you about someone in your past trying to contact you they're con artists almost exclusively I mean then maybe there's like one lady in Tibet that has a broken gene and she could tune into the next dimension and and pull some extract some information from it but in my experience the vast majority of those people that I've talked to that claim to have psychic ability were also at least partially full shit they had weird ego problems that were glaring that they didn't notice you know like I could see it that this is a gross way to behave and they don't see it their interpersonal relationships the way they communicate with people was like an agent like a fake Hollywood person or something there's something bullshitty about them yeah and people who lie a lot I think if you lie a lot it's very difficult for you to tell what a lie is oh that's interesting yeah I think you lose your connection I think when you when you bullshit I think you also bullshit yourself and I think these psychics are a hundred percent honest even with themselves I don't think this is like I'm gonna fuck this lady over she think she got to talk to her husband a mo tell her some nonsense take her money I think some of them actually believes they're getting information you know my grandmother used to believe that my grandmother was she was a very eccentric lady and old Sicilian lady and she would tell you about the like old Italian ladies all like want to play the lottery they all have numbers there and she was playing the numbers wasn't even the lottery it was like the organized crime numbers racket and she would always I was gonna pick this number and I just add up the last minute I changed the number wouldn't you know it the first one came in and she was so mad there was always that that I had a dream of this and I had a vision of that and it was all visions and dreams and psychics but everything worked out horribly for her it always did like if like you were really psychic you would have better instincts like this is just this inclination that people have that there's something special about their perceptions and that they're psychic and it's always these really wacky people that believe their psychics in my my experience which I mean it's you're I think you're talking also about that what some scientists would call the self-fulfilling you know that if you believe this things happen manifest themselves and you can convince yourself that you believe this but for me I'm super interested in people who really believe in psychics right like that's what in the military for example and you know the most trusted danes you talk to those guys the remote-viewing guys i - a lot of the scientists who taught the remote viewing and i talked to a number of remote viewers and for the book but the most interesting of all was the astronaut ed Mitchell right and he was so so I'm interested in like the psychology behind what are you looking for in that and I saw that I was doing some research in an archive and I came across a photo of what turned out to be ed Mitchell on the moon reading a piece of paper okay it's this extraordinary image because you're like wait a minute he's on the moon and he's reading a document what is that document I found out the document was a map of the moon okay Mitchell got lost on the moon and literally pulled a map out of like okay god I'm he was trying to get to a certain crater and they had a very limited amount of time there it is right there right okay there he is Wow I mean think about that it's like the most advanced technology of the time why with the camera tell him where to go [Applause] hey bro this one left we do get let's just follow our footprints we're the only ones walking what are you stupid turn around look at the ground see those things that's where you walked let's go that way Jesus Christ I'd be so mad at him I'm like bro you pulling out a map who wrote that map no one's even been here come on man they had little maps folded up in their in their pockets in case they got lost they were on the way to this crater and in that crater they were gonna find allegedly rocks that were gonna solve the mystery of the moon's creation the origin story rights they like all this pressure they couldn't find it the heart rates up the guys at Houston are like you got to turn back your heart rates going crazy yeah and think about it Mitchell tells me I went to interview him at his house when I think it was his last interview before he died and he said there we had gotten 240,000 miles - only to get lost they missed the crater by like you know 900 feet or something really so he never got to the career never got to what he was devastated and on the way back from the moon he has this what he told me was a psychic change right he his his consciousness flipped and he became convinced that psychic powers were real and that is really the beginning of his foray I mean Mitchell became a huge proponent of psychic warfare of you know the the idea behind what you're talking about that we spoke of as being sort of charlatans ISM and he dedicated the rest of his life to it boy aliens as well and I think that we were definitely in contact with the aliens and and that comes from like he was so vilified by the scientists and by the astronauts and by the kind of military men because this was just he told me the story of when they were in quarantine after they came back from the moon right he and Shepard were sitting there you know eating breakfast waiting and Shepard the story's a story broke that Mitchell had done some ESP experiments on the way back from the moon and Shepard said to him like look at this nonsense the newspapers will do anything to sell make a buck and Mitchell said I I did that I actually did that what experiments he was doing ESP experiments on the way back from the moon he had a psychic in Chicago a Swedish psychic that he was sending messages to like she thought it was an old Swedish man all right my psychic can take my clothes off ya know I'll introduce you to Olaf okay okay I saw the movie frozen I didn't see that one Olaf's the little snowman you got younger kid yeah anyway sorry so ed Mitchell was talking to this hot chick in the hot old man in and and and the story broke because the the Swedish psychic could not resist telling you know leaking to the press that he had done these experiments what experiments will do well psychics train on these little cards called Zener cards right so like you have a different symbols on them and you know one one person that's how they decide whether or not they're being psychic like there would be a veil between us and I would say what are you seeing right and you would call it out so it's like a control system and Mitchell had these items with him on the way to the moon and did these experiments to try to see whether you could have a psychic connection with someone back on earth hmm I mean he that was you know did it work well no and he took notes I he showed me the notes it was so wild to be at his house in Florida and he pulls out this old spiral notebook with like water stains on it that actually went to the moon hmm I was like wow this is really something else I mean it was one of those moments in time where you're just like I don't know there was a feel there was a feeling of sadness around all of it mmm with Ed Mitchell sitting there in his um you know his chair and talking to me about what it was like to be an Apollo astronaut on the walls I'm not with a lot of these sources with like incredible amounts of awards on the walls but what does that mean after time passes so his experiments didn't work but he still believed in psychic powers yes I mean and that's and he okay's what we were saying he was ridiculed you know and he had such a tough time with it and so the people who propped him up and the people who gave him a lot of encouragement had sort of more radical ideas as he grew older and you know conspiracy theorists who really kind of used him because he was an Apollo astronaut so he was so much more famous than any of them would ever be and they really took advantage of him I think so you think they manipulated him with information and tried to get him more and more enthusiastic about their I mean it's speculation on my part but you kind of go where the love is right he was an older guy and I seen some interviews with him as he was getting older and older and he see to be having some difficulties like thinking about things clearly and people take advantage of that yeah he was really obsessed with extraterrestrial life who's really interesting because didn't he claimed that he had seen something while he was up in space I think people helped him make that claim that was my understanding of it of reporting I mean I stayed away from some of the crazier speculative things about him cuz I what I was really interested in when I was writing that book was how his authority and power allowed the program to get funding right because so much of this is it's like who's funding this stuff and why and it really does come down to Authority which is always a which is always a narrative that I find fascinating right how do people get the authority to say go on these programs or you know we should do that I mean the question you asked of like how does who's in charge right right and in all of this what I learned more than anything is that the office of the president has a lot more power than I think any of us are aware oh I'm sure what did you find anything about Ed Mitchell did he say anything about see if he said anything about seeing a UFO or seeing extraterrestrial life but the problem is if he believes that boy you know if he was talked into saying that he got a wonder about a lot of the other things that he said as well the other thing is as these guys get older that becomes their career the career becomes discussing their experiences and the more outrageous those experiences are the better the career is it's it's absolutely change their stories you know Michael Collins changed his story his story when he just got back from the moon excuse me when he just got back from the moon his story was that they couldn't see any stars but then as he got older he wrote in depth in his book and things in the 90s you know decades later how vivid the stars were and how incredible it was out there with no atmosphere but there's a press conference when he came back from the moon right after the Apollo 11 moon he was talking about he couldn't see any stars so everybody's like well what what is it did you know they there's they get lost right they're older it's been so many years since whatever they did when they were working with NASA and really it becomes that's their focal point of attention like what where they get their attention from and where they make their career is from their attention and so they start telling these inconsistent stories I mean one of the great perils of you know living on your laurels is exactly that and it's why I mean like a guy like Billy wah I was so intrigued by that he was constantly reinventing his own role within the CIA as he talked to me about at length because he never wanted to just become one of those husband's right so his cover later became just another old man which is like super interesting like he was in Sudan in the 90s and he actually took the first reconnaissance photographs of Osama bin Laden before bin Laden was on anybody's radar except for the CIA's and his I mean how do you run it he said to me how do you run around Sudan which is a country made up of like really tall black Dinka tribesmen if you're a 5 foot 8 old white guy in who's 72 you know supposed to get reconnaissance photographs of bin Laden right do it wear golf shirts you know I have a photograph um he wore like you know those socks like that go all the way up to your door yes and little shorts and a sweatband over his head and he said my cover was that I was an old man on a fitness craze and there he is running around Sudan I mean there's no sidewalks right and he's just jogging away and he said bin Laden's dogs used to come after him and so he would have to run with a lead pipe whoa whack the dogs on the nose and he said they'd stop coming after me Wow Jesus I can't find any evidence that he says that he saw aliens but there's evident reports that based off of his conversations with lots of different people he believes that aliens at some point visited earth and that it's being covered up don'tdon't on I mean that's an easy narrative Troy yeah sure yeah and I mean how much they tell ed Mitchell they say thanks for going tomorrow well look one of the most interesting things about reporting this is wit that you find out these people that you think have access to all the information right only know they're a piece of the pie how much do you think Trump knows do you think they keep stuff from him because I would say like he's kind of a loose cannon I wouldn't tell him about the everybody I I often wonder that like can the president be like I demand to know about that yeah and then can they say no sir or they say as I write in one of my other books it's like you don't want to know about that because you don't want to have to lie well that's nonsense I definitely one I would want to know it would be the only reason to become president you have to figure out why you have to lie like whether or not if you have to lie makes sense to you right like there's some things that you know that we're done like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment where you go what the fuck are you doing like no you can't do that but then there's some things you go oh I see why you had to do that yes you know so it would have to be like which one of those things is it is it one of those things where it makes sense where you had to go and assassinate someone who was plotting some sort of a nuclear attack on Chicago or is it some nefarious plot to turn down syndrome children into surgically constructed fake aliens and crash them into the earth and the curiosity factor would be outrageous I mean can you imagine being the president and saying I want to know about you know JFK noir like sir you don't want to know right then you would go well of course I want to know now I really want to know I mean that happens to me as a reporter all the time when I can't talk about that that just becomes the obsession it's like yeah that's the first thing I'd want to know I'd almost run for president to learn about aliens and like come on bro but then if I found out there were nothing I'd be like well fuck this job I quit I don't want I don't want to run the world I just want to find out about the alien and then there's all these things that you find out Jamie and I were talking about that before it's like man you know Jamie was obsessed well he's obsessed with Chicago all right oh hi oh rather Columbus and we were well we were talking about Nazis I mean I wrote a book about Operation Paperclip and oh my god talk about a rabbit's hole that's a rabbit hole let's explain to people that don't know what we're talking about Operation Paperclip was when after World War two the United States gathered up a ton of scientists from Nazi Germany brought them over to America and even Wernher von Braun they had Wernher von Braun run NASA he was a Nazi like a hundred percent Nazi good friends with Hitler type on say yes he was he ran a Berlin rocket factory where they hung the five slowest Jews they would hang them out front so everybody would know like this is what happens when you work slow well hang you I mean the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if Wernher von Braun was alive today they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity yes and that was the head announcer that was a head of NASA that was the guy who got us to the moon that was the big cheese guy yeah so we were willing to put a lot of really dark things aside and norther to gather out the best scientists of the Soviet Union couldn't get them all and they got a few of them as well but we got how many more than a thousand right allegedly 1,400 but I would not be surprised if you know the story changes and there were more right yeah but that goes back to our discussion earlier about being in pole position I mean that's why we grabbed those Nazis we were like if we don't get them the Russians I have it I get it and you know and I'm sure the Nazis could say I didn't want to do it they made me I'm a nice person I love Jews oh that was part of the mythology it was like we got the good Germans oh I didn't we got the we got the top Germans and who do you think the top Germans were yeah they were coveted by Hitler Himmler Goering you know yeah I mean these guys were right I mean there were guys that we grabbed out of the docks at nürnberg literally to come be part of our program you know one of these smart you're an asset right I mean that's what ginga's Khan used to do he'd take warlords from the other side and capture I'm gonna listen for me I'm mad I mean what you know ideology aside I'm super smart and I want that to be known that's good that's that's the competitor right I mean you can't you cannot be the best rocket designer in the world and not want those talents you know demonstrated that's Wernher von Braun story that's the story of all of them and that was was so shocking writing that book because it's a it's like wow you know huge amounts of talent but how far will the competitor go to see their baby come to fruition what are they willing to put aside yeah did you pay any attention to the other places where Nazis went when they escaped Germany like Argentina in particular you ever seen any of that stuff they have entire German towns down in Argentina right they do Oktoberfest down there they wear lederhosen they drink out of Stein's it's crazy they speak German and you're like what the fuck is this like my friend Tim Kennedy went down there and he said he was literally talking to people interviewing people and they had photos of SS soldiers on their wall and they would talk about how grandfather was a hero and like like you are you're the descendants of escaped Nazis and they put together a town down there I mean the way the Nazis were able to flee is I can't read enough of that I mean that's what Jamie now we're talking about it's they are oh my god and it's endless I mean they're so you know the ones that week there was a famous guy that we got he was the Surgeon General of the Third Reich I mean think about that okay dr. Walter Schreiber I mean he was such a bad dude he was in charge of the vaccine program I mean you just put those words together and your mind goes really dark right but we wanted him because he was an expert and we brought him to the United States he was the only Nazi I found of the ones the paperclip scientists who came here that that was actually outed right he was outed as a Nazi and that's because one of the investigators at the Nuremberg trials recognized him oh Jesus and we he's the only one we got out of here and guess where he went she lived out the rest of his life there the the show was called finding Hitler there they were trying to find evidence that Hitler somehow escaped there's really a bullshit promise to the show but what was interesting is that there were thousands and thousands of Nazis that made it to Argentina and set up shop throughout South America it's a lot of Germans down there it's kind of weird if you can imagine me on book tour of like the kind of questions I get because we're talking right having written books about area 51 Nazis assassin soul people I mean just last night I was at a book giving you the signing and people are like is Hitler really dead you know Karthi I mean that if he was alive he'd be the oldest man alive right imagine he was probably like how old was he during World War two he had to be in this 40n be hundreds you know I mean no no I mean but right or they say he cloned himself 160 years old 120 now Jamie knows that's an old man I mean there's been a hundred 20 year old people but it's fucking pretty rare yeah so Operation Paperclip was not even publicly acknowledged until what was it like the 90s like when did they when did it become public I think was through the Freedom of Information Act wasn't it was this very intrepid journalist named Linda hunt he'll shout out the window yeah I mean she but you know she broke the story that's what's amazing I mean as a journalist you're always writing on the shoulders of those before you right mm-hmm and she had it really hard because she did a Freedom of Information Act request got all these documents that no one had ever seen and then the government sent her a bill for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and she had to spend a lot of time this is what I understand I never interviewed her but for for xeroxing fees what yeah I just love that detail because it's like it's such a covert way of getting someone to stop it's like okay here's the information we had to give it to you but now here's your bill imagine if the government's coming down on you for 125 grand yeah see the company want to call a bunch of rich people and go hey let's all just donate $1,000 facility and it's a different world now you could do that you could do a GoFundMe campaign you know my god in the 80s and the 90s you were just like out on a limb yeah they would crush you financing we actually had this very same discussion yesterday with my friend Phil DeMars who's being sued by Marineland and because of he was a walrus trainer and trained orcas and he's showing how horrific it wasn't black fish that's SeaWorld but that's SeaWorld is actually the way he says it's a day in the park compared to Marineland Greenland's horrific place in Canada and anyway they have been trying to squash him with legal beats by dragging out his legal fees by dragging on his case but he set up GoFundMe and all his legal bills get paid for from people that want him to win the good fight and this is a this is an option today that wasn't available to Linda when she was exposing this that's $25,000 you assholes like she should sue them for misappropriation of funds like does it cost you really $125,000 to print those things out of it does you guys should be in jail like that's like with like those $10,000 hammers that they have and mm-hmm the Pentagon yeah yeah so she gets all this information and does the government immediately acknowledge that the important is Nazis that no I mean she wrote the first book and it was just stunning and and you know it was late 80s Early 90s okay and you know then more gets revealed because they gave her a certain amount I mean I filed a bunch of FOIA as there was releases I went to Germany FOIA meaning free to Freedom of Information Act yes then I went to Germany and looked in their archives with like a fellow a German PhD who had you know real access to stuff and was able to translate for me while we were there looking at this stuff I interviewed a lot of grandchildren of Nazis and children of Nazis and you know I mean this one extraordinary oh my god there's a guy I told you about Shriver right I'm on the narrative level humans acting I'm so interested in rivalry in competition right as a concept because this is what America does to be the best and also as humans right because more like that they're built like that so the Nazis had rivals amongst themselves and Schreiber's rival was dr. Bluhm who was in charge of the biological weapons program for Hitler okay and Blum had a son and Blum was prosecuted at Nuremberg you can see a picture of him with a big Dueling scar you know he was a bad dude he was a Dueling scar Dueling scar dual like a sword sword fighting it was like among the Nazis they would they would duel with one another when they were younger students and then they would pack the wound with horsehair to make it even more pronounced because it looked ferocious pull up Jamie pull up well you can pull up dr. Bluhm bol em II but also right and also you can pull if you pull up Kurt Debus who was the director of our JFK Center he was part he was NASA's Vaughan Browns number 2 he had a huge Dueling scar and yet when you knowing look at there he is right there knowing what we know now it's like come on you're trying to tell me that guy's not a hardcore Nazi so those guys had dueling scars on their face yeah you see him how often did they do well when they were in college of death no no no no no it was like on guard you know and then they would I'm saying venting fencing oh this guy had it too yeah how did they not get poked in the eyes oh I guess that was the gentlemen's rule how do you fuck listen you going for the cheek you hit the eye like that happens all the time I mean there must my balls out I haven't seen any photographs of missing eyeballs but there's a lot right on the cheek so maybe that was the whole point it was actually just a bit for show oh I am weird but but it was a revoir it was a badge of honor yeah and and but so they all had on their face it's on the same spot doing scars yeah Wow so imagine he wanted to have these scars that was a Jesus Christ oh they had goggles on oh there you go that's how they didn't take up academic fencing it says academic fencing so what they were essentially doing they were having fencing matches with real swords not with ones with tips Wow and cutting their faces up fuck man oh Jesus look at this guy's face yikes Wow doing cops cults that is crazy so when you consider like that people people did not know about that and then you've got these Germans walking around America as part of our space program in our science programs and oh these are the good Germans I mean now you really have to say to yourself come on we're all Nazis yeah it's cars in their face absolutely oh that's Dark Matter G Fight Club Yeah right off I super Oh G yeah god that's crazy Wow so I go to interview um doc sometimes you as a journalist you can get amazing information from these guys oh my god they're sliced up after European martial arts yeah well I mean that is a martial art means an art of war really a sword fighting is a martial art I mean many martial arts have weapons yes sorry you say you go to interviews people so to piece together the story right I can't tell you others can right sometimes in the to find out more about the Nazis I went to Germany and sought out some children of these top top Nazis to see if maybe they didn't have journals or anything they might share with me and one of them was dr. Bluhm his son I tracked down I found him and he said yes you may come visit me and it was such a remarkable journey it was like he lived in the Black Forest I had to take like a taxi through the mountains up over the hill down through the valley you know into a courtyard behind a church - dr. blooms house so he was in the junior - his father who was this horrific Nazi I mean a top Nazi had favor of the fear were what was called the golden party badge right Hitler gave out these little buttons Blum's was I believe number six so that's how favored he was and his son dr. Kurt Blome whereas the father was in charge of the biological weapons program so his plan was to you know murder people with biological weapons from nature right the son had been a medical doctor but had left the profession to cure people with flowers it's called Bach flower therapy so he was this very interesting individual who had never given an interview before and he agreed to let me come to him so I go on that journey I go to his house and he was remarkable I mean he was so interesting talk about the sins of the father you know I mean my god what he what he had what he had as a burden right and he and I asked him to tell me everything he could about his father and he did and then he asked me to tell me what I knew about his father I had information from the German archives about his father that he did not have like that his father had given something I just come from this archive and found these documents dr. Bluhm ordered that 6,000 tuberculin sonder be handling that's the german word what does that mean special treatment there's a euphemism for you that was kill those 6,000 tubercular Jews when you say tubercular is that people with tuberculosis they were suffering from tuberculosis and he dr. Bluhm worked closely with Himmler and they just decided to kill him and you know sitting there talking to this man telling him about his father at his request was remarkable and then he's telling me what he knows and then as I'm getting ready to leave he says to me I'd like you to have these and he takes down from his incredible bookshelf he himself had written eight books right and he takes down these books and he hands them to me and they're in these wrappers and I can see that they have Nuremberg nomenclature on them and what they are is they're his father's documents from his Nuremberg trial and he and I'm like I can't take these I thought he meant take them back to my hotel room look at them and then you know bring them back the next morning when we were doing the next interview and he said no no I want you to have them and I was like I can't have them and he said I don't want them and you should have them and it gave them to me so I had this stat so I was like on my trip home it was so perplexing because I threw out all of my clothes I was like screw the clothes I mean I just carry I've travel with a carry-on bag right so I in my carry-on bag all I have is this Nazi paraphernalia that is dr. Blum's Omar the deputy Surgeon General of the Third Reich's documents from Nuremberg covered with swastikas all more I mean he was acquitted at Nuremberg based on all these documents okay and that by the way based on human experiments and I'm at the airport and I realized suddenly oh my god swastikas like this is illegal if they go through my bag I'm going to be arrested I'm carrying I mean I'm carrying these incendiary you have any copies of your book on you oh no no no I was just like at least one Joe I was sweating almost as hard as I was sweating at the beginning of this interview all right I went because you know I was like wow I went through no problem got home I have them no luck you didn't go through Israel well you know what it's not the swastika is not out there but it is in Germany you may not have any Nazi paraphernalia whatsoever in fact my paperclip book which has a swastika on it had to be redesigned the car for the German publication and it just has like broken up images of the Nazis because you cannot reproduce that image in German it's I mean I'm not Pro swastika but it's so strange that we've given so much power to this design that you can't even see it it used to be there say there's a temple out here that I think is I believe it's a Hindu temple and it was a part of Hinduism that this swastika predates World War two it predates the Nazis predates their they're sort of reclaiming of it and the this building that was built out here in the nineteen I think was built in the 1920s has swastikas on there's a big plaque explaining why their swastika is on it I know they had a different angle mm-hmm but I mean talk about branding right I mean my god that was and the Nazis were you know kings of that I mean they were only that the mustache that guy killed that mustache there's not another thing like that but he didn't kill the dueling scar right that could come back do you think no no no not after your show what do you have four million viewers probably people don't think about it that way they don't think about the dueling scar as being a Nazi thing no no that's what I find a remarkable right they really don't but the Nazis did the Nazis did and then you look there's an amazing photograph of JFK Lyndon Johnson Kurt Davis sitting at you know for a launch a moon launch and there's Davis with his huge Dueling scar and I'm like and their position was oh he's one of the good Germans well that culture was a culture of ruthlessness I mean was a even the good ones there he is yes good job Jamie look at that can you believe star on his face they still give out an award by the way that's called the Kurt Debus award and I rang them up and said like why are you guys giving out this award he was a hardcore Nazi well they say they were like they've hemmed and hawed and I finally said well at least tell me what you say to people who asked that question you know they said well no one's ever asked us that question before Annie well they will now Jesus it's when you really stop and think about the horrific nature of what the Nazis did I mean how inhuman it was how how crazy it was like that had to permeate the entire culture there is no good Nazis there was not one even one of them that was looped into that had to be responsible for some awful awful shit I mean Einstein said it the best when he said you should you know you could have left like people who couldn't have left should have left right well do you know the story of Fritz Harbor right the guy yes I mean he wound up having to flee and he's the guy who created Zyklon gasps he's you know he created his icon a which had smell built into it so that would warn you when you were using this pesticide and then the Nazis turned it into zyklon-b or they removed that element that added the smell and just this odorless horrific poisonous gas that they used to gas the Jews and he was a Jew I mean I you know then when you think about he be king he was no longer useful to them because only figured out he really was a Jew yeah well once world war 2 came around see he was a part of World War 1 when they first started using gas and he was there's a great radio lab podcast about it I think it's called the bad show but anyway what essentially says that he was winning he was up for the Nobel Prize at the same time he was wanted for crimes against humanity because he was up for the Nobel Prize for creating the hobbit' method of extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere which was used for fertilizer which to this day they say 50% of the nitrogen in human bodies was created by the harbor method so what you get from food from vegetables like that nitrogen 50% of it at least is coming from this guy's method who was a scientist who was a Jew who was working in Germany before it became Nazi Germany and then was the guy who figured out how to use gas on people it's that dark his story listed our story I mean he died looking for medical treatment because he had a flee Germany and he's had a bad heart he died on the road trying to get to Switzerland that's the thing was what's wrong yeah yeah it's I mean Nazi Germany is like the pole position taken way too far and that's what's remarkable that the Pentagon was like okay but we can learn from this mm-hmm and there there are elements that are dark in that well it also comes out of the devastation of World War one right the economic devastation the defeat the Germans are in this terrible state overall in terms of their morale and then along comes this charismatic psychopath that is just really good at screaming to this day I don't speak German but to this day when you watch that guy scream and yell at all those people and see them respond it gives you chills like that kind of charisma that kind of influence that someone has where they can do that in front of thousands and thousands of people and everyone's goose-stepping and so to see we're very fortunate there's not something like that right now and our forefathers and our grandparents and whoever fought in world war ii if it wasn't for them who knows where this world would be right now because that was a literal evil empire straight out of Star Wars I mean that was like the Sith Lord they were they really were there were human beings who were doing some of the most evil shit that you could almost demonic if you really stopped and thought about it if there were demons pretended to be people they would do the same thing I mean it that's why I think it's a rabbit hole because it's so hard to comprehend that like a culture of educated individuals in that moment in time that you talked about between World War two World War one and World War two could could completely become Minette malevolent yeah that's one of the more disturbing things about the Nazis was that there were so many of these people that they did extract through Operation Paperclip brilliant engineers and scientists that were also evil like those two things are very uncomfortable for us we like to think of our scientists as being the people that are out there trying to solve mysteries of the universe and provide us with the technology to make our life better here on earth not the Nazis they were trying to figure out how to kill people better they were trying to figure out how to use rockets to shoot them at Europe and blow people up and it is a it's one of the more telling and horrific times in our history when you because it's it's one of the one of the more horrific ones that we have footage of because we don't have footage of Genghis Khan we don't have footage of Alexander the Great we don't we have stories and tales of Napoleon and some photographs and drawings of dictators past and prep but we have a lot of footage from Vietnam we have a lot of footage from World War two we have a lot of footage from modern wars and out of all of them the one that scares us the most and scares me the house is World War two do you think those scientists when they came here because this is a this is a I could not figure this out even after writing that whole book is it do you think they came here and actually thought about what they had done or they were able to convince themselves that they were the good Germans that they were part of it because I never saw a single bit of remorse ever like no one ever acknowledged what they had done so it made me wonder I guess results very right I mean I think there's probably two people that go through the same thing and one person has no problem with it and the other person literally can't sleep I don't know it's a good question it would be interesting to interview them the the ones who've been caught who've been prosecuted and have been chased down and they've got one fairly recently they caught a Nazi like just a few months ago it's one of the last ones using as 90s I believe the ones who survived they all tell different stories and some of them say they just wished following orders and you know some of them say that they didn't do it they're being framed they all have different stories it's it's one of them you know you write a book about that and or you think about it and you kind of have you go down the rabbit hole you have to you have to ask yourself what does this mean or you kind of it's too dark right and then so I asked that question to a schvitz survivor okay who I wrote about in the book his name was Gerhard Murkowski and he the reason he was he survived Auschwitz was because he was taken over to the labor camp which was called buna so it was a rubber factory and it was led by this truly evil man named otto Ambrose who became part of Operation Paperclip okay after being tried at Nuremberg and being convicted of mass murder and genocide right we got him out and he worked for us you got to read the story of I mean it's just it's just astonishing Otto Ambrose simply extract chemists oh right but he was so he so gerhard was at buna this factory this rubber factory and he lived and i did an interview with him because I was asking him you know the flipside of of all of that and his whole family was killed at Auschwitz and I said to him what does any of you know we went through all these questions to try to get some closure to this or some meaning and I said and then I'll we land and I said well you know we couldn't that we couldn't answer what does this mean right what does it mean for today couldn't answer we are so when I asked him what matters about all this he went like this he lifted up his sleeve and he showed me his tattoo and he said that matters and I have that image seared in my mind I had never seen a tattoo from Auschwitz before and I have not since and it also made me think as I thought he's gonna die soon and he has diet cents and then that tattoos gone so all you have is the exchange of information and people talking about it yeah the eyewitnesses died how did they get that guy out of Nuremberg how did they get them to release him well okay so he was convicted at Nuremberg then he went to prison he went to the prison where we had all the they didn't execute them no obviously they executed like the top Nazis and then a lot of these guys went to prison so there was a bunch of trials and so I went to the prison I saw his cell I mean in Germany was intense Landsberg prison and then we because we were sort of policing Nazi Germany after it was not you know after the war was over policing Germany and then Kate and a guy named McCoy was in charge he was kind of like the Governor General of Germany and the Germans wanted Germany back and they were like we're tired of you guys policing us the threat from the Russians was very real and so deals were made I mean I write about all this in paperclip you know based on the documents and one of the provisions was we want our guys out of prison we want them back in society and that was arranged and again you don't even know these things you know they're like but that was and then Otto amperes and they even gave him his money back that was astonishing and the family still has this villa in Switzerland I believe or maybe it's the Bavarian Alps that had been in the family which is money from you know from world from Nazi Germany and I called up the son to interview him he was not as forthright as dr. Bluhm son and you know he hung up on me and said if you if you ever contact me again all you know they have very serious privacy laws in Germany I thought about going and knocking on his front door my lawyer was like Annie do not do that they have very different laws in Germany for privacy yes even if issues like this son of a Nazi yes absolutely well I would imagine look if he didn't do anything he shouldn't be responsible for what his father did no but he has the villa that was the point I had all the money right and he got that money from his father who got that money from stealing it from people during World War two L's yeah like what happens there yes but if you go back to that like we should really find out who had the plantations in America and who benefited from that like go several generations from there I mean you could get weird with with war reparations deeds were people profited yeah I mean which is sometimes a reason why you I realized in looking at these in reporting these books which is why certain things are kept secret I mean they open up a whole can of worms about reparations sure you know yeah Wow was operating pip Operation Paperclip writing that book was that one of the most disturbing ones I mean that was so dark my husband is amazing he's Norwegian right and the nor the Norway was occupied by the Nazis for five years like people kind of forget that but he he grew up there and his mom you know was a grade schooler and was really impacted like didn't go to school for five years while the Nazis were there they were gonna breed with the Norwegians cuz they were such lovely Aryan people right so my husband having a Norwegian mom was like when I was writing paperclip it would be so dark sometimes I would be like down in my office like I can't you know honey I can't you know uh and he'd he'd be down there with a sandwich or coffee and say but are you throwing another Nazi under the bus and I would say yes he'd say keep typing right and then I realized well wait a minute the neutral journalist has to really make sure that she's not just throwing Nazis under the bus without really good reason and so when I was in Germany at the archives I went to Dachau the concentration camp and I asked the lead archivist if I could come and see the worst possible photographs that no one wants to see and he said absolutely and I didn't write about them in the book because I didn't want to subject people to that kind of horror but I looked at them and I watched I saw with my own eyes people moments before they were killed you know and then the bodies afterwards and these are inhuman experiments to you know to see whether or not pilots could survive height or you know they simulated different things in chambers out high altitude or speed and I saw I saw photographs of you know freezing people to death right because they were trying to develop programs where they would they wanted to see at what temperature humans actually died right and so they experimented on Jews these are these are some of the doctors that came on our programs and I looked at those that evidence and I was that blew me away and then I knew when I left there okay I can I can throw these Nazis under the bus it is it's such a crazy time in history well you really stop and think about all the different experiments that they did do it's almost like they just opened up the vault of evil and said listen we have an opportunity these people aren't people let's do whatever we want it's like they're fake people it's like like they were an invention I mean the perception really played into it so gross it's so scary to think about that humans just you know a generation or two away capable of doing that yes and so I think what it when it all comes around full circles all these government programs I write about is that idea of an evil enemy right mm-hmm I mean we talked about that earlier when you brought up khashoggi right I mean you know people often say to me and these are sources they're like Annie Saudi Arabia is the root of all evil I mean I hear that constantly and why are they our ally why are we protecting them you know oil right yes yeah so money and influence in the Middle East and to have an ally over there and that's it's why I think people the the benefit of you know people often say to me why do you write these 500 page books well because I mean hopefully they're interesting and I do know they're interesting because I got this great emailed row the other day from a reader and he said Annie I'm a truck driver and my whole life people have tried to tell me I'm stupid but I drive around in my truck and I listen to your books I read the audio on my books and he said now I know I'm really smart okay he's stupid that guy's ridiculous hey wouldn't your whole life everyone's telling you're stupid and then you read some books ago now I know I'm smart well he oh come on give him some space right anybody says they're smart doesn't get any space I think he was making a point that he has the ability to listen right maybe he's not the world's greatest reader that's how I took it yes are your books avail I'm just joking about this guy obviously but are your jokes of it uh looks available in audio form yeah I read all my books oh that's great I love that yeah I get bummed out when someone reads a book that's a but my friend Graham Hancock had a really good point he's like not my fiction books cuz he writes fiction books as well he's like my fact-based books I read myself but fiction I hire an actor I'm like that's a good move nice cuz then you got to do voices inflection and ya know it's amazing to read them I mean because you you really also feel like later on down the road you connect with with people sure you know and then people that are hearing you right now they have that same voice when they get your audiobook and because I write things that are so at the edge of conspiratorial thinking right right there's a certain sense of others a real human there right this is not government propaganda right and I can relate to this and I can hopefully I don't wanna say trust but I can recognize an authenticity right yes of working with sources when you are done with the paper clip book and you know you've published it and you have to live with all the information that you had to gather and and run through your mind did that book was that the book did that change you that book like was it the most altering of this different subjects that you covered I mean each book has a huge impact for different reasons but when I think of paper clip I think of this one saying that was over the gates at Buchenwald and it was it said Yatim das zina and what that means is everyone gets what they deserve and that was horrible and I still think about that because it's such a piece of Nazi propaganda it was like saying to the Jews you guys deserve this and so I know much of my reporting and my general just way of being as a humanist there's no such thing as what you deserve right there's what there's what happens and there's what you do there's what you're responsible for and there's what you can change hmm but there's that idea is reprehensible for some reason that really stuck with me as the was just the worst possible thing that I could think of because it's the psychology behind why they did what they yes the dehumanizing but the weird thing is that that was less than a hundred years ago that seems like that should have been something that took place if you hear about the Inquisition you go okay well that makes people didn't know any better back then but 1945 is not that long ago it's just not do I mean people people just read and read and read about World War two for good reason you know and everything I write starts it all goes back to the Nazis and every book I the the trail the paper trail at the National Archives or individual university libraries and people's papers where I go they all refer back to that because it was so remarkable that the Nazis led in weapons technology and they almost took over the world because of it right and that is the premise of all of this I mean in surprise kill vanish it's like these are the guys on the ground in the Pentagon's brain it's this is the technology in the sky but we must we the government's position whether its Pentagon CIA is always we have to stay ahead because the next Nazi Germany is right around the corner yeah and that's a that's really something to think about is that alarmist well to this history repeats itself I mean how if we went and stopped and looked at all the instances throughout history of people being evil dictators there's quite a few and there's you know we've we could look at North Korea right now and that guy assassinated his own uncle right with a what was that with a missile coming out of a helicopter I think put him in a field yeah yeah I mean that's straight up messaging yeah right which is another thing I think is interesting about the CIA's paramilitary program it's all meant to remain plausibly deniable it's supposed to be secret like we're not supposed to be giving out the message that we have these teams you know that go after high-value targets right they're just supposed to disappear that's the vanished part of the mmm-hmm so that and that as someone who is really interested in transparency and people being educated and having information that always puts me in conflict with you know the government in essence because I'm I'm like we should know but then you think about it well the whole thing is you were not supposed to know because it's supposed to be just the hidden hand the president's hidden hand they call it well it has to be this distinction that they have the ability to break the rules because it's how they protect us I mean that that's that's the rub right and the stories we hear are often the failures because those are the ones that get reported in the press there is a sense under girding this narrative which I really like and I'm interested in and intrigued by is that the the successful operations you don't hear about because they are plausibly denied right yeah there's got to be a ton of them that went through you don't hear nothing about and your kids will hear about Boeing maybe when you think about protecting us from something like another Nazi Germany that's when people are willing to give up some of the freedoms they're willing to give up surveillance they're willing to give up and this is this is where things get real slippery right I mean also when you think about Russia because all of this Cold War science technology operations all of that was to beat back the Russians okay then the Russians go away and now they're back you know the Russians are the master assassins and they do it through poisoning I mean look at scre Paul right no I write it in the book about a defector who came over in the 50s and said I was an assassin for the KGB gave us all kinds of information it's fascinating to look at those documents and realize like this is how it works this is how it worked you know 60 years ago and then you kind of see echoes of that of how it's working today and you can only imagine the defectors or those who come over from the other side who we learn from and they just disappear into Imman they disappear a sort of the CIA's version of witness protection mm-hmm Wow do you because of the subject matter that you choose to write about does this affect you as a human like are you suspicious of everything now do you look at everything in terms of like things that are happening in the news to try to look at the the hidden mechanisms behind the scenes and I think the opposite I believe that information gives you a certain understanding of like the longview right it does not make me paranoid at all in fact the opposite people often say like my god the world's about to end and I say well wow you should really read about what it was like in 1959 or 1962 when we were really almost at war with the Russians thermonuclear war right that is essentially at bay for now right so I don't know maybe it's my personality but I actually take comfort in the fact that what is happening now is sort of as you just said it's a it's a bit of a rebranding in the modern era of what has always been there which is rivals seeking supremacy over one another you know people trying to outfox the bad guys what I think has changed is that the desire to prevent war has shifted and that makes me that makes me upset because we used to sue for peace we used to want a peaceful world I mean war was outlawed in 1928 right and now we just the military-industrial complex is such that it's really a lot better for the Defense Department to be in a state of constant war because then you're in a state of constant weapons production and you can always be creating those vast weapon systems of the future for the next war that comes along and and that's troubling because those eighteen year old kids are the ones who get sent into the line of fire what if any research have you done on artificial intelligence and robotics and autonomous weapons and the the future of warfare which a lot of people think it's going to be like what we're seeing now in Yemen with drones that we're gonna be seeing that with robots on the ground and that this would be the future huge amount for the book that I wrote called the Pentagon's brain mmm-hmm really impactful moment was going to Los Alamos when I went there to meet a DARPA scientist who was working on an artificial brain for DARPA I mean this stuff is way unofficial brain trying to create a system you know a free-thinking system and what his name is Garrett Kenyon what he told me was just utterly fascinating because again that human thing I'm always after it's like what are you doing I mean leave the science you've had lots of guys on here I'll talk to you about the high-technology elements but I'm interested in who's doing that who's creating that science and why and he said to me this is like like where artificial intelligence is right now with scientists who are really looking into this it's like Magellan you know like who will discover the new world but on the on the idea of frightening artificial intelligence he told me an interesting story about his daughter and he said people seem to think like you know facial recognition software is like telling us that were one step away from AI true AI and he said if if he's he was he showed me on his iPhone this was a couple years ago and he how much trouble the iPhone had recognizing him like if he put a hat on or if he made a funny face and he said my daughter can recognize me from across a baseball field you know if I have a hat on just by the way I walk right and he said if she if she couldn't there would be something really wrong with her in other words her human recognition abilities are truly intelligent and that is a system of systems a biological system of systems that no scientists has you know the algorithm for which no one has ever able been able to figure out yet hmm and he believes that we're far away from that but the defense department on the other hand is moving us in that direction and absolutely wants autonomous weapons to be fighting wars look there was a program that said I quote this in the book it says the the battle place is no place for humans so drones are the way of the future right but there used to kill people which and which also means that the enemy is creating drones of course and pretty soon that's gonna be a big a big issue yeah that's the big fear the big fear is that they're gonna be the first ones to implement it I mean what scares you about AI everything DARPA thinks AI could help troops telepathically control machines of course they do and they probably can't I mean they've already got cursors that people can move around that are paraplegic they can move them around with their mind in their eyes yeah I think there's gonna be quite a few of those things what is already I made this thing this is called the synapse this is a look read this thing that's though DARPA funded program develop electronic neuromorphic machine technology that scales to biological levels more simply stated it is an attempt to build a new kind of computer with similar form and function to the mammalian brain such artificial brains would be used to build robots whose intelligence matches that of mice and cats Jesus Christ robot cats robot cats coming to get us well they created something called the the Robo rat that was the first bio-hybrid right so a bio hybrid is when you mix a animal and a machine and DARPA was doing that right before 9/11 and people freaked out they were like you cannot put brain chips and rats and make them move through a maze buy a you know remote control which was what they were doing and I interviewed the guys who were all working on this program before 9/11 and so the the the morality of the of the citizenry was like no then 9/11 happened and suddenly all this money got pumped into DARPA to do anything they wanted the morality is she went out the window and they started creating all kinds of bio hybrids as I write in the Pentagon's brain so they put they now have pigeons that are mixed you know animal and machine they created something called there's a moth so there's a man Dacus x2 moth that's what it's called a large moth and scienter PO scientists put brain chips into the larvae okay so that when it cocoon dand became a flying moth it had the the chip built into its system making it easier to integrate and they could fly the moth around the lab and that was a huge step and this is now four years ago that I was interviewing these scientists did you see any of this stuff I didn't see the moth but I I told you I saw that the the limb regeneration lab was a trip and this is also we're going on there well they were just cutting limbs off of salamanders and watching the limbs grow back right and examining that and saying well if the salamander can do this so can we one day and I said to them but wait that's impossible you know and they said well it's not actually because humans have they broke I love scientists who break it down into terms I can understand it's like what Elon Musk did you know yeah right cuz and they said to me you were once a single cell in your mother's womb and then you were too and then you were you know right mmm so you can regenerate and that's their premise I mean these are the tops on the world's top scientists in regeneration what is this Jamie the moth being stimulated by electro currents and its abdomen so the stimulation of the electric currents they can cause it to go left or right is that it yeah I just looking up these bio-hybrid moths what was the thing that you threw your hands on my head like you're freaking out Macaulay Culkin at home alone this is reading something wet yeah I typed it was I started typing bio-hybrid stuff and this is the first thing that popped up was this shrimp article yeah it says they're gonna test them through Olympic themed events oh my God look at this DARPA MTO seeks innovative proposals for the development of micro - milli insects scale robotic technology shrimp where develop will develop okay so shrimp is the an acronym they love and acronyms will develop and demonstrate through a series of Olympic themed events multifunctional mm 2cm scale robotic platforms so I guess that's millimeter or centimeter scale robotic platforms with a focus on untethered mobility maneuverability and dexterity to achieve this goal shrimp will also provide foundational research in the area of micro actual actuator materials and energy efficient power systems for extremely swap the capital letter S copy of level W lowercase a capital P constrained microbiotic systems expected such advances will be enabling for applications including search and rescue yeah right search and rescue disaster relief yeah we're gonna help people hazardous environment inspection or killing motherfuckers with a with an evil nuclear be always the ski that goes in your mouth and blows up fuck that's crazy I mean they do all kinds of planning for the future yeah the search and rescue thing is a it's a great sort of you know way in which to present DARPA that's doing all this great stuff I interviewed DARPA scientists who said look Annie we've got we're able to send robots into Fukushima to twist the cores you know right then and yes that is great but that's far from the only thing Chinese children yeah well yeah but here's a trip you want to hear I mean yeah it gets there our rabbit holes there because I sourced all these documents and also interviewed generals at the Pentagon who are like we don't like AI we want like we want this we want our guys on the ground you know we they believe in the human the warrior that concept and so that the generals were very opposed with the DARPA took a vote and it was like no AI we want humans in the mix and so what did DARPA start doing and they are the generals they said why don't you why can't we go more autonomous and the answer was we don't trust the machines okay so right around that same time what a DARPA start doing it started looking into and hiring scientists who were working with how trust works in the brain specifically with what is called the moral molecule and it's this molecule in the brain that mothers emit when they're breastfeeding okay oxytocin yes so think about that and I mean that's like the ultimate going way back biology like you have to have a mother a trusting mother to breastfeed in you know prehistory or otherwise you'd be eaten by you'd be like this is a bad idea I'm stopping to do this I'm gonna die right right so they examined that molecule the brains moral molecule and they began a program to work with that to be able to give that to soldiers so that their that they trusted AI machines and that's where I think you're getting into really spooky dark multi levels of manipulation about what humans want versus what the Pentagon wants Wow the worry about trusting the Machine scares the shit out of me because that's what everyone's worried about when it comes to AI like that's what Elon Musk keeps warning people about that these things are gonna have superhuman capabilities and they're gonna be sentient and it's a matter of when absent so III as the journalist said to myself we'll wait a minute if the generals at the Pentagon and I'm you know that's a that's a euphemism but the meaning that the actual opera you know the guys that are in charge here don't want that who does want this and where my research took me to was the group that wants that is what's called the defense Science Board and those are the individuals who are counseling the Pentagon in the manner in which they should proceed and now those individuals are all sitting on the boards of the defense contractors so you can really see how money drives the rubric the generals don't want it the humans don't want it but guess who does the people who stand to make the money creating the autonomous systems and that's exactly what Eisenhower warned us of hmm in his farewell speech you know the military-industrial complex and the other part of that speech which people don't don't know as well is that what he said his antidote Eisenhower said this the antidote to the military-industrial complex is an alert and knowledgeable citizenry it's why I write my books mm-hmm because an alert and knowledgeable citizenry has the ability to kind of push back and go but we don't want that I think what we're worried about is Pandora's box right with it when it comes to AI and we're worried that first of all if we're not the ones to open it what if they open it all right what if the Chinese open it now and obviously their technology is super super advanced I mean they're electronic technology particular their cell phones are cutting-edge mean Apple and all these other companies are struggling to try to keep up with Huawei and these 1fc are one what is the fuckin one st what is that one what is that big company that they just released some they've just hired Robert Downey jr. to they gave him millions of dollars to on one plus ya one plus seven they have this new phone that doesn't have a front facing camera you press a button it slides out of the top they figured out a way to make it the entire phone all screen and they're incredibly advanced in terms of their electronics we deeply are concerned that they're gonna be the ones that implement military autonomous sentient robotics before we do because then you can essentially you can launch them with no physical human cost on your side and I mean they they're literally weapons of mass destruction if you have robots I can go over there and just kill people and and what they need for that is the world's fastest supercomputer right and what's interesting is that we just we Americans overtook the Chinese in having again having the world's fastest supercomputer but they had it for a couple years and think about this okay cuz you were saying hard to believe the Nazis were only you know not even like just didn't just in our grandfather's age right so go back in time to then listen to this about this really freaked me out in terms of progress right after the war a guy called john von neumann got a grant from the Atomic Energy Commission to essentially build the world's first computer I mean they existed but he built the first computer that could actually do calculations okay before that calculations were done with like by calculators computers were humans but there's this amazing story of von Neumann in the basement of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study where he built this computer with government funds and he cuz he was a brilliant polymath he could add faster than anyone around him okay he's also the guy who calculated at what level the atomic bomb should explode over Hiroshima for the most blast okay because it didn't hit the ground it wouldn't kill as many people's brains so this is how his mind worked so he's faster than the computer he has a pen and paper in front of him and he can outperform the world's fastest computer with his own brain two and a half years into it in like 1949 the computer beats him and he made a statement then that said one day artificially intelligent machines will be the ruin of man I mean I'm paraphrasing that was his prediction but that was in 1949 in the 50s Marshall McLuhan said that we are the sex organs of the machine world I'm gonna have to really think about that that's a deep one that is very deep yeah we are the propagators we're the ones we're progenitors yeah that's it that's our baby we're gonna make that baby mmm and then we're gonna die most likely that's going to be the new living thing who said that marshall mcluhan yeah just that stop and think about that figuring that out in the 50s just looking around and going oh we're giving birth to these things but I have a question for you then on that morality issue right which is if man has always been a warring animal right why do we look so down upon the throat you know the knife to the throat and why do we as a society accept drone strikes because that's the whole question I asked in surprise kill vanish and I'm not sure I answered it to my own satisfaction because it's such a complicated question well one of them is very personal the other one is like a video game you know to stab someone to look them in the eye and and shove a knife through the ribs that's a takes a different kind of person and we don't think we want that person around us you think it's a proximity issue oh it's it's just different you know one of them is throwing a rock at someone that's nowhere near you the other one is beating a guy to death when he's right in front of you there one it's very personal when you see someone struggling and we don't like to think that someone can put that aside and still twist that blade we don't want that we don't want that on our side we don't want our people to be Noble and just and but meanwhile when it comes to civilian casualties drones are one of the worst invention ever in human history if we really want to examine ourselves in terms of efficacy and the moral moral high ground in terms of engagement like launching missiles at apartment buildings because you found metadata in there that indicates that most likely an al-qaida operative has a cell phone in that building like that that's some shit that people have done I mean that has been done and the casualty rate for civilians when it comes to drone strikes for in and civilians it's stunning I think it's in the high 80% I think that's we've done this before right haven't we I think it's some it's it's a disturbing I might be conservative by saying it's in the 80s it might be in the 90s it's a disturbingly high number of people who died who were not the intended target which would which would be an argument from all aid for the blade yeah the blade is you know who you're stabbing and that that warrior is going in there aware that he too might die what do you got Jamie what's that face 3% 3% what that's what this says that's worse shit now who released that maybe 3 percent accuracy no I know there was there's been some serious discussions amongst scholars about this that's not true whatever you reading that can't be right yeah so just one operation was 3% just to throw this out there because there is that big debate I mean CIA paramilitary army tiny Defense Department huge CIA using either ground operators or drones mm-hmm Defense Department I read the statistic the other day 7,200 and change bombs dropped on Afghanistan last year I mean people don't even realize we're still seven seven thousand they just practicing here goes president Donald Trump revoked a requirement that US intelligence officials publicly report the number of civilian kills in drone strikes other attacks on terrorist targets outside of war zones oh so we're gonna get shit information now but pull up 2017 you have to fight well you got to really look hard to get that statistic there's an inspector general who covers Afghanistan right for the government he looks at all the statistics and by the way this administration just canceled his job so we will no longer have that information but he's the one that is in charge of reporting that because it's called the reconstruction effort right but that number of bombs really makes you think long and hard or at least me about you know the big footprint versus the small operation and I again I think this is why most people don't want to talk about this because it's a dark rabbit hole to go down you know people prefer to believe that we're just safe and sound here and not not at risk and I mean that's that's the endless question of are these are these threats real and must they be dealt with well it's very hard for people to be a hundred percent aware of something they're not experiencing right and right now we're not experiencing a war currently in our in our neighborhoods but yet it is happening overseas and the United States technically is involved in these wars and I think that right now we're not experiencing sentient robots running through the streets murdering people but that could happen we're not experiencing Nazi Germany anymore we've got past that we'd like to assume that that's in the past but if you just looked at the vast amount of history that's dedicated to atrocities that are committed by armies against their enemies it seems like that's just what people do it seemed it's a part of what people do and if there is a real technological race in order to develop autonomous sentient robots that are capable of killing people we should be fucking horrified and who are you most afraid of China China 100% well you know they keep they keep outperforming us in that supercomputer they also have a total integration of the government and their industry you know that everything is connected it's not like us you know like the gut like deep like they'll play the long game they're strategic in their ability to plan for things and not have them be currently profitable they don't have to operate on a bottom line like someone who's beholden to stock owners and they don't have an informed public yes at all I mean they have Google censorship I mean they've convinced Google to go over there I was talking to an executive at Google and they were saying essentially we're willing to let them censor because we know we're gonna they're gonna just they're going to do what they want to do anyway they're going to copy all our information and just redo Google in like we think at least this way we will protect our interest by being over there my do you know how crazy that sounds you're gonna let the Chinese government help you're gonna help them censor people on an interesting note of that in the mirror all my books are published in China whoa like the darpa book they were right on that they had that translated into Chinese I have a copy of it it's spooky it's like you see the Pentagon all this Chinese writing I don't understand a word of it except for my own name but it's like wow they're reading they're reading us you know anything I mean there's anything that makes us look bad there is an interesting story about the Freedom of Information Act and Iran which came to mind with this new activity in Iran which is that they filed a FOIA to get all the information that that we had on Iran and the government it went to went very high up in the judicial system to say we're not going to release this information to them even though they had the right to have it because it would benefit them we brought the pull-up Jim I found a couple more better information I might have misread that it said that something I just found showed something like only 2% are the high target district are the targets that's what I mean the rest would be so the children civilians but other combatants too there might be other soldiers but um part of the reason I've got to get rid of that sorry part of the reason on why the strikes things has changed is because the Trump administration has carried out way more than the Obama administration ever did over eight years well I think the Trump basically told the military you know what you doing just go do it I mean you basically let them just run the military instead of having the same sort of oversight that other presidents insisted upon and the military people like them for that and people aren't focused are interested in drone strikes anymore they're more interested in the wall in watching the the battle and the yeah the conflict and the name-calling and the shouting it's like it's like throwing rocks without warfare you know China's making robots to kill us absolutely Oh Chinese people please be nice was to say okay US drone strikes fighting Isis in Iraq concealed at least 1257 civilians according to the Pentagon air wars estimate the number to be as great as 7,500 here only yeah just this year yeah they're they're doing a weird thing they are shooting people from a remote location with a robot that all came to be by the way right after 9/11 I mean whenever we get attacked it's like Pearl Harbor you know suddenly there is a massive swing of what civilians what the citizenry will tolerate you and first surprise kill vanish I interviewed I told you lawyer John Rizzo who wrote what was called the 17 September 17th memorandum of notification and it gave presidential powers to the degree which had not been seen since you know the worst part of the Cold War and Congress rode off on that in fact what Rizzo told me is the gang of eight that are in charge of you know the intelligence committees in Congress said is this enough and that's where the drones became such a big issue because the idea of pre-emptive neutralization the idea we're gonna take out bad guys you know we should have taken out bin Laden and we didn't yeah we're gonna now do that preemptively and it's set off it's set us on this entirely different course which continues to this day although it's fallen out of the news which is let's strike someone before they strike us and it's such an interesting chicken or the egg because you know yes you have civilians dying and yes you have more terrorists being created on the other hand you really want the Pentagon dropping seven thousand four hundred three hundred two hundred bombs on Afghanistan in any given year and it seems so detached whereas if you sent someone over there to assassinate these guys with a knife you would think of that I don't want that person in my neighborhood that person is willing to stab somebody and what are the intent unintended consequences of that and we never even know you I'll tell you an interesting story that's not in the book which is that Billy Walsh owed me a number of plans that he had presented because sometimes the operators are asked like what do you think we should do and it doesn't mean we do it it's just that those plans get sent up the chain of command and then it comes back so he said he showed me these drawings they were gonna go kill Chavez right this is when Bush was in power and you know he was like teaming up with Ahmadinejad and he was a really bad guy you know a threat to us and so the plan was to Halo in take the team down go kill Chavez and vanish and the plans got rejected they were like no way we are not doing this according to Billy wah well Billy wah said to me recently I mean thank God we didn't do that can you imagine if we had we would be blamed right now for everything that is going on in Venezuela it's a really interesting point I mean who has to make that decision I'm glad it's not me can you imagine no yes kill this guy but don't kill that guy that's a good idea yeah it's intense and it's the world we live in that we don't discuss and we don't think about because it doesn't affect our daily lives in terms of like it's not something year if it's unavoidable but I think it's super interesting because it also comes back to your own humaneness right what are you making judgments about what are you for or against and why are you really are you really do you do you want that opinion I mean I think that's so interesting and important and and and discuss it with your children you know and let people have my favorite expression is just as long as you don't make me do it you know I'm pretty tolerant of other people's opinions about this don't force me into it no but this stuff impacts all of us it really does it really does are the robots gonna be taken over your show Joe no no well they probably could to a certain extent I don't think robots are currently capable of spontaneous humor right that's the only thing saving a person like me no there's nothing fun drone no not yet but what is the difference true wetware and hardware in silicon based you know interactions like if there's a computer that can beat the greatest chess masters and they can't they have it and then the greatest go master now to which they thought was even more complex that people just get destroyed by these computers now like what what makes us think that creativity is so unique and special I think what separates us really is our biological instincts and that these are things that are programmed into our DNA over thousands of years of survival that this is these are the things you have to worry about this is the information we have and act on that that's our intuition trust you know should I trust should I not and you take that out of the equation really bad things could happen yeah I warrant I worry I worried that we're creating a thing that's going to surpass us but I think that that's inevitable I mean if I was a chimp and I was worried about becoming a person I suppose you know seems silly it's inevitable you want to hear the scariest AI story I know it's old right it's like a dim the lights in front and along but it's from like the early day and gather round children this is like early days of DARPA okay and this is when we were really seriously afraid that the Russians were gonna send you know a hundred thermonuclear warheads at Washington and take out the whole country okay so DARPA sets up this station at the top of the world to monitor the Soviet launch so that you know because it only takes 24 minutes for a ICBM to get from the launch pad in Russia to hit New York or Washington hmm okay so we set up the station up there and to monitor this so we would have some kind of a jump on this okay like we'd learn at about eight minutes my god the you know was a radar station that station called the B mu site or J site it's connected to the no rad station in Cheyenne Mountain you know the one from the movies right okay and it's like the first week of business and the guys that are sitting there in the station looking for the alert are sitting there and they've been trained like the alerts never go off and all of a sudden the alerts go from one two three four number five is endgame okay so the information that the technicians are getting is now one thousand Soviet thermonuclear missiles are on their way to Washington DC with 99.9 percent certainty actual story okay the guy panics but he trusts he says wait a minute you know cuz he's supposed to now give the launch code let's try and get the generals on the phone I can't get the Pentagon general in charge of no vrat they get a Canadian guy named general Sleeman and Sleeman you know my god we should be launched should we launch it's Lehman's like wait a minute human thought he remembered that the night before he thought he saw Khrushchev on TV at the UN you know that him he's famously banging issue and he says where's Khrushchev right now they check he's in New York City why would the Soviets send a thousand nuclear weapons our way while their own leaders in New York they said I don't know sir but the radar returns are reporting this and they're so someone had the idea at that beam oocyte to go outside and lo and behold what was there a big full moon the system was reading the moon moving and misinterpreted it as a thousand nuclear thermonuclear icbm is coming cranly didn't launch so we came that close to the end of the world I mean and it's an astonishing story the documents are now Declassified but is this an actual indication of why that element of human intervention why trust why other information like oh I think I saw Khrushchev on the TV last night is so important because the Machine said with 99.9% certainty this is happening Yuma we must launch in retaliation true story and he freaked me out thank you thank you for everything thank you for the books thank you for your talk here with us your new book which is surprise skill vanish area 51 which I will read I promise you I will read it and if people want to get a hold of you on social media what is your what is it as well on you know whatever okay all right Thank You Annie I really appreciate it thank you so much for having me was fun thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
