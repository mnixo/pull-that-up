I'll send you a link for here we go three dos uno yes and we're live ladies and then shot with the official Comedy Store Jersey on that's a real comedy store hoodie that's the real shit it's the real deal no doorman I look like a doorman yeah where those shits all the time I love them yeah me too I would do I'd work there I'd be a doormat the Comedy Store verse 4 they gave me spots no I had 100% - yeah you get those 1 a.m. spots you don't want them spots those spots are confidence crushers good if you dave chappelle they're good if you've been doing stand-up forever fuck yeah they're good if you're Dave Chappelle and then you can walk into anything well the thing about that is like it's also good for you to be in front of a tired small crowd like a tired small crowd is good to test out shit yeah yeah those are those are good I did a I did a spot an unannounced spot the other night at the Comedy Store in the Ori was like half pack at what time but no it was everybody was absolutely late it was fairly late but it was people were beaten down it's a different animal energy scale yeah yeah it's differently coming after dinner thankful different you know you can get fucking real used to like louis c.k we should say that like he likes to just show up and even though he was really famous and everything like that when he was doing this it still is right but when he would show up what he liked is that they weren't there to see him hmm so then he would get a more honest response to his material that fake shit like like when you go on like to go on are the actors that go on like Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy jr. yeah like anything they say they got that applause I'm ready to go you know what's really hilarious when you watch those guys tried to stand up when they get it in their head that they can't they you know like come on I can't fail everybody loves me yeah I was rushing smooth up at the store I'll tell you what man Michael Rapaport is getting pretty fucking sporty I saw him do a couple of minutes the other day and he seemed like a real comic and I know he's only been doing it for like a little bit he did it before and then he got into acting I think he tried it before but yeah he's he points down he's getting good he's good I saw him once and it was he was struggling a little bit but it could have just been the crowd but then I saw him recently I'm like damn he's a tall motherfucker - I never realized that mmm he's tall fuck he is tall pretty tall you know 200 feet Andre Fillion Myles jury that's a good fucking fuck great fight so here we are folks this is a fight companion this is a ESPN's first real card not on ESPN Plus this is on ESPN ESPN which is huge for the sport and Kane motherfucking Velasquez my vote for the best heavyweight in the UFC ever I think it's the most accomplished to steep a for sure I mean it's hard for breezy over doom what a fucking record guys we get argument revered is Hannah he's got it there's a good argument for Minotauro for a doom being one of the greatest of all time because or the greatest because he tapped Minotauro tap Kane tapped tap phaidor I mean who the fuck has tapped all those guys yeah I mean he's a motherfucker yeah but as far as what I've seen from like when he's in his prime well you know outside of all his injuries Kane at one point in time was just a storm and you know I talked it was really funny man we were backstage and I was talking to Bob cook and he's you know and I was like people want to try to ride that storm out and they were laughing Bob Coco's a storm never ends storm never ends no with his tenacity cardio was insanity it didn't even make sense remember when he beat a JDS when it was JD a second bite other aches off of them have been the same yeah he was on the first Fox card yes yeah lasted 26 seconds yeah yes but he wouldn't not wasn't good for business who should not have been fighting you know that JD I should enough no Kane had a really fucked-up knee in that fight okay first round Myles jury Andre feely and then of course Kane's fighting the scariest motherfucker in the history of sports in my opinion unless you're unless you're a cardio machine well after steep a you know steep it kind of exposed some holes in his game but you know the guys we've been fighting for a few easy big did explosive but Francis's credit I mean he fucking ate some big shot yet it's deep a and he took it and that's all five rounds so and he came back and had a terrible fight with Derrick Lewis but Derrick Lewis is a beast and he was very nervous it was a bad fight but then came back and stopped Curtis blades yeah encouraged criticism motherfucker he is my worst fight Derrick Lewis Francis which we thought there's gonna be fireworks or Paul Daley MVP last night knock you man Paul Daley wait you know what I'm a wrestler now do is crazy it was it wasn't good but it was better than Francis versus dirty sink I don't know it was there was moments of action yeah there was there was Paulie was able to take down oh yeah which is not gonna be P take him down yeah but it's not a shit show it's not good friendly peace imagine with tyron woodley would do to MVP imagine we don't have to worry well she doesn't have to worry about cause it's annoying McDonald though yeah yes we've been a big problem but a real rest bitch John Fitch but well John Fitch though he's got to be able to grab a hold of him the thing about Paul daily is he fucking threatens his shit out of you with that power he's got the scariest left hand in the sport best left hands but yeah a hundred percent he's here shit at you with that power you got a mind your P's and Q's but what I like about Paige is that I've always said that one day we're gonna see a guy who's a point fighter who learns how to do other shit because those guys are impossible to hit because their whole thing is plunging in and lunging out lunging wonderboy a little bit right wonderboy a little bit but he's more of a kick box yeah point fighter not so much nominal kickboxer you know but but what you see from MVP is like one of the best point fighters that's ever even attempted to fighting it doesn't get touch he's so good against Raymond Daniel's you should see the two of them fight Raymond Daniel's was another one who's a legit world-class point fighter and MVPs undefeated professional boxing - yes but that file is he fighting nobody's but still the rear the first real fight was last night against Daley and there was some holes there were some holes that were exposed it was way too easy for daily 13 and no that's true he's only 13 fights way too easy for daily to take him down not that daily doesn't his next fights gonna be tough what was quick yeah really tough but what's crazy as a daily was talking so much shit on John Fitch after John fish took him down to Daly's all he did talk shit right guys wrestling and he took in I was like I literally I was like what is happening right I was how you're frustrated guys was like what is happening right we're what's happening right here miles juries already busted up we're not even paying attention I'm W what you gotta talk about fuckin Paul Taylor it's unbelievable I didn't realize how big MVP was I didn't know he's 6-3 so tall for this for that division and also like uses it every bit his Reach is insane he does sneaky shit - he did this like this sneaky right-handed he hit him with he tried to hit him with a hook kick at one point in time he landed that front kick yeah he's a beast man if he gets his wrestling takedown defense on point I mean he's a phenomenal athlete but the thing is I get though and it is a big if but the thing that he but he goes to London shoot fighters great goddamn Jim the thing that he's missing you know I mean is is just the wrestling takedown defense just a takedown defense like if he could take a page out of style benders book yeah like you look at style been around I'm not too worried about him fighting a grappler right right he's hard to take down very tough takedown and but you you're coming in you're gonna pay yeah he's so goddamn technical he might be the most tactical striker in the sport I watched him in glory the other day I was working out watching some old glory fights with stomping when he fought Jason wellness his movements phenomenal he's world-class I mean willness is a world champion dude how about this a nelson and cro cop fought last night do cro grab look good decision right yeah one decision track did he take Roy Jones down or what's a correction what's a black guy Wesley did one of the greatest boxers of all time what yeah uh they both you know they both look like exactly how they like they it was like I bet Lauren Nelson hits harder than Roy Jones right now how did miles joy just tagged on to a feeling he just tagged him on the left hand yeah I think if you had him on that power meter I think I think Roy probably hits harder he also weights a hundred and fifty pounds more yeah close he's probably right Roy Jones change probably bout two hundred pounds these days well when Roy was fighting shape God he was fun well when he was at his heaviest he was about 200 right when he fought John Ruiz won the heavyweight title yeah that was a phenomenal fight when you watch that me that was just artistry speed and precision versus a you know a world champion John Ruiz who's a real good fighter yeah he's a real good heavyweight fighter but Roy Jones was at that time you know the the big fucker the big fuckup rather it was going from that fight dropping down to fight Tarver at 175 I'm back to losing 25 pounds and looking like shit looking like dude and harbors a monster he's a monster yeah yeah and also toffee and hammock Don to it drew a decision in one fight earlier and Tarver thought he won and you know Roy he liked he Roy apparently had something to say about you know why he didn't perform at his best so when they were faced off tonight and the referee goes any questions he goes got excuses tonight Roy and then he went and knocked him out Wataru so he was so you're so good you brought these guys forget about I'm still doing it six people know what you're talking about you don't know fight companion fans don't know get the fuck no look at this Roy Jones look at this a few a sharp jab boxing better than ever right now though because you got fury and then you got wilder rematch that coming up in May that's happened in Brooklyn Brooklyn are you working on them probably working that and my special comes out same way ready job I know um how did do in 12 new minutes go it went good last night nice scary right them new minutes their scarifier super skin also like when you're talking beginning of the show that wasn't my crowd they didn't market me beyond none of those people were my people you know what good man I was nice it was weird for me to drive back this is a fuckin good fight we're missing a good fire I know man I never I always have to watch fights when I get back home I record I know we talked so much I know there's just so we don't see each other so we got to catch up and shit is miles jury still with Alliance does anybody know I know he has his own gym and I think it's really in San Diego oh he branched off I think so he was dominant Cruz's stable mate right that you're trained together no feely with a nice right hand dude where did I thought uh the Francis was gonna go to a new camp I saw he's just training full-time in France and like the nice wrestling in France but we'll figure it out hmm he was hitting like the heavy I mean where would he go like you want him to go to two places in my opinion I'd want him to go to either a TT or aka right ATT they're a lot they've got enough heavyweights and they have a phenomenal coaching staff right but you want you want someone big to work with an aka they're not really gonna probably take them or go to Elevation fight team where you got curtis blades and Overeem who he's fought bold right right yeah great coaching at the altitude there yep that's a great striking Christian L know the thing about that altitude training is it's really interesting I was talking to TJ Dillashaw and you know he used to think that altitude training was where it's at until he started working with calivita and he thinks that you you get more work in I agree with him yeah working at sea level yeah cuz I my whole career was in Denver Philly with and then when you come to sea level like I can do work yeah I can put work yeah so like the what they're saying is like the amount of reps and the amount of work he do like what he's doing with calivita is fuckin phenomenal the podcast I did with him was one of the most informative podcasts I've ever done with a fighter in terms of like how technical his training routine is his diet is how everything is broken down to a science as far as like what to do when and when to do what their level than anyone else II realize unless no unless tones on it and they're not talking about but when TJ talks about yeah there's no one more in tune with their body than TJ that fucking Aaron Pico and he's gone on that same level cuz he trained with him blast as teach I'm like why isn't why did he just follow you around he's like dude he has all these people kind of pulling him every which way I'm like dude he should just do what you do well he looked phenomenal but he got wild that video ever see the video of us watching him loose yeah that's crazy we jumped up we're all filling with you that could have been one of the most viral videos on Instagram like in the in that week yeah number robably that was crazy that knockout was insane yeah that was the craziest reaction yeah that knock I was insane they challenged given the general overview that was a punch that was a punch no knuckle fighting okay such a silly goose this is a good fucking fight man these guys are so well well matched a really good fight I did sterling beat Jimmy Rivera he must oh he was laughing where's a motherfucker yeah what happened Jamie can you trade with sterling anyone training I guess in the trailer he's a freak super freak that's just surgery huh good malamar Isis correct he's the motherfucker I want to see fight for the title he - who he's so good man son Sal we finish the son Sal no no one finishes him 40 35 35 anthem I yeah no one finishes the Sun Sal you beat him with a close decision if you're lucky I asked TJ about he's like God fine him but they all they care about the pseudo-riemannian a mess decision wow that's impressive for story got caught Andre feel he's in a bit of trouble here oh so he's root for mouths jury do you I always do there's certain guys I always root do you know him not that well we did one show together then there's getting amounts Mamta you got damn feelings in a bit of trouble here interesting he's pushing him too cage yeah that is interesting let's not a good move because he could he could yeah push off off the cage with his feet and cause a scrambling feeling with a nice little hip escape there get to guard um what were we just saying just before that that happened sterling fight oh no more eyes yeah man he's he's so good he ko'd sterling I mean bad homerun yeah the hey Oh Jimmie Rivera in ten seconds yep yep and both with the left high kick I believe bullshit that's spinning backfist someone's spinning shit now ha miles Nick Diaz Hewitt II sad man he said I wanted to hurt nobody I want a party done really yeah for him man yes done yeah because I understood someone was talking about Anderson vs. Nick and Connor said I'll fight Nate on the same card and then Nick's yeah I'm not fighting anybody I won't hurt nobody because I just want to party that's cool man yeah it's done fucking amazing career you gotta remember Nick Diaz fought he was one of the youngest guys to ever fight in the UFC I believe he beat Robbie Lawler when he was 20 dude he's beats you look at his resume it's impressive yeah the guy said he's fought he's been known for a hot second he's deserved yeah turndown survives Jack you know I'm fuckin good he just hopefully financial he's good too what do you think of this Anthony Smith and John Jones what do you think of those what are you looking at uh I like empty Smith it's a tough go you like him as a human being I love you like them to worsen yeah I don't like him to win does anyone whether that but that's that's his story right biggest wins closed Amer yeah here's a big win John Jones would do does too man like this but it's it's this is an anti Smith thing that the folk science it's a John Jones thing I don't know anyone in light heavyweight or heavyweight that would be John Jones damn strong words name sellout heavyweight who'd beat them strong words you know I've said like name a tough matchup format heavyweight fetus if he goes you know I'm a fucking every week now right right like it was up to like 240 sure yeah God if he gets up to like jackknife I'd like he was when he was power left oh my god but the thing about that is though like you know I talked to Greg Jackson about greg was saying that he didn't like him when he was powerlifting like that mmm he knocked out Mauricio Shogun who uh he knocked out Rashad lost Thiago Santos I want to say that was that middleweight that was anyway yeah his first fight at light heavyweight was vicious man yeah got some good wins he's not a young kid he's been fighting for a hot second I mean he knocked out fact shot 70 yeah it's it's not 74 he's more of a shot where the Rashad should have been fighting you know I think Rashad's heart wasn't in the game anymore cuz every time nacho yes job Rito retired and now he's were commenting opens up tonight on the expand portion which is shots amazing great one of those guys is great guy one of the best have you had - good no I love time and I mean I would love to I love your shot she do it it's run a trainer podcasting train train I love that he's a sweet person I've had some conversations with him that guys he's a lot smarter than you might think guys guys he's very smart yeah he reaches out to me out of like when things are going bad or I'm having an issue they're like you it's out in the public and we reach out to me then always give me like words of wisdom I would believe always always he's that guy great great start over guy and you know you go back to his career I mean look when he knocked out rich chocolate dealt with one punch a blaster I doing the hard thing was like yeah I will never forget that cuz he knocked him out and then he beat Forrest Griffin you know he's doing what he's doing only does the hard thing do you know he's doing what he's about to have a harder time yeah Fred Sanford oh really oh yeah I know at your time at your but I remember a shot knocked up force and he was training with us and came back to the gym and at the time I was in the UFC and I was like dude got the belt watch it like I was freaking out and he's like I feel exactly the same Brandon nothing I thought it would be everything in more like the same dude he's like he's almost kind of like it's not all that it's meant to be like you think you get to top the mountain and it's everything but he's like I feel like I'm bad character remember when he coached against rampage I was on that season as my season was shot of my coach so close close dude and when they were in front of each other you a bitch you a bitch make me you a bitch make me a bitch it's back for I was like this this kid goes it was so intense that whole show was like fucking everyone's gonna pop off in any sexy it was the Division one chat Michigan State Champion not a lot of work no Nigel American polymeric and his roommate was gray Mannion gray Manor yeah hmm do you mean while I'm missing a really good fight they're still going is this five rounds no that's the third round bro I know it's done forever we should tell people it's at 135 134 133 132 131 of the third round in the first fight sorry it's good that we don't give people expectations what we're gonna do here when we do fight companions my family zero expectations yes it's my favorite podcast we ever do that best I like more more forward to this than yeah I mean I love doing podcasts with scientists and geniuses and show it's work though in a little bit no no it's a different food you gotta do some research - well I like doing that though yeah but it's a different feel this is this this is just party hangout man this is fun what do you smile that Eddie doesn't believe in sorry he's all your bullshit your science ah I believe in science think that I can um you could see who your own eyes yes I believe the science of this iPhone that's real it's real as fuck dude I was watching this I was thinking baby today cuz I don't have cable right now because I moved so we're in freak if so all I have is Netflix I was watching this earth planet Earth and Will Smith is the narrator on it it's all about Earthlings and they're like scanning up and it's astronauts time out what they saw from space the whole town's thinking God Eddie must watch this but this is some bullshit you know watch this bullshit that ain't real sure how many hours they had in space like 72 hours in space eight hours as I got Betty can fuck these six yes meanwhile we have no idea who won this fight miles Jerry do you think so nope I have no idea but that's what towns good for cuz he will you won't listen to us and he'll watch it in the Med miles jury two rounds to one right that motherfucker's light hmm yeah well he lets you beat him up he landed ladies in Burbank Elia I don't know he didn't say just said his flight landed late yeah man then MVP fight was bullshit I was so pissed and I love Scott Coker I was gonna tweet out so I'm like you know I'm just gonna unread everyone's probably piling on daily I don't want to be that guy I'm just gonna back out Mitrione fight to Bellator shows in a row yep Friday Saturday do that all the time they have one on paramount then they have one on the zone I watched it on the zone on my phone I got one of those days own accounts and you know I was in Vegas for this event my daughter was doing and so I I'm like I'll be right back good find it my job is done with her things that are under the top of the stairs and watch that shit some bullshit I told my wife when I was dude I flew from the comic strategy hangout Theo's gonna be there way we're supposed talked some business about the show and I'd literally I was like dude I have to go he's a cry like dude MVP and daily are fighting say Who am I I'll play later let's just talk I fucking flew home after my set Thea I get home and I'm waiting I'm like fuck his dad's do you have the zone or did you watch the Sam yeah they got a lot of good fights on that 13 I didn't know the fuck it was Daz it looks like daysand terrible name but it's a bad name it's what so it's um it's da Xia does not have cable to watch the fight no no watch on connection yeah is why I watched it on my phone um Chris paramount network you have to have like you have to have an account with DIRECTV or some shit but does only covers whatever paramount fight get rid of that because people don't have TV no more so they gotta just have it just through your goddamn apple oh yeah interesting is dishonest they they spent a shitload of money on Canelo Alvarez they signed him to some multiple hundred million dollar deal I think it's something like it's like 300 million dollars it's a high use the highest paid athlete in or 300 like 65 million yeah some insane amount of money over 10 fights at the end of this and it's gonna be also subscription based all on his own you got all the future subscription boards hey wha what's interesting is if it's no pay-per-view it's actually a really good deal right cuz I don't know what designs awesome month guy just did the double-click on my phone I didn't pay attention how much that shit cost but yeah but what does it cost I don't I don't know it's find out what it cost bucks a month $9.99 you got to think that if you're watching say if you're watching a pay-per-view like a big fight like wild or fury to how much is that gonna cost sixty sixty shit so worth it ten bucks a month and you can watch fights all the time it's like my take on fight pass like if you like fights man like in my gym I have I live off a fight pass you just watch old fights i watch fights all the time while I'm working out it's the best thing when I watch my Valachi bi I do I watched the whole Gordon Ryan series the other day mmm the whole little documentary they had I watched that walls working out combat you get to fight night this Friday oh shit no Monty is this Friday on you a UFC fight pass 7:00 p.m. Pacific still who did you get to fill in for a was it Barnett got hurt Barnett's out to Verdun governor perdue didn't get hurt it was supposed to be Gordon Ryan vs. Werdum Courtney yeah so we're gonna do it we're gonna do for a doomed Gordon Ryan later on this year but it's a four-man combat jujitsu absolute a bracket with URI Simoes who's arguably one of the one of the best Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners ever a DCC medalist gold medalist monster yeah monster yeah and then the the second seed is John Thor blank who won EBI 17 he won the great the first and only 16 man combat jujitsu tournament he wanted all in regulation all every fight within two minutes he said he subbed everybody so it's URI and John Thor blank are the the top two seeds and then if they win their first fights then they'll fight each other and then same night same night though Kevin Casey is fighting jón þór blank I love killing cases yeah he jumped in and Steven Martinez is a local black belt he's fighting URI Simoes so on paper it looks like it'll be URI and John blank on paper or anything could happen in the finals plus we got the best jujitsu girl that's ever lived only only girl ever to win Abu Dhabi IBJJF gear no gear black belt and EB ahsha Beatrice mesquita she's the baddest chick ever and really she's fighting combat Jiu Jitsu against Kayla Patterson she's laughing yeah yeah it's gonna be awesome I come like when someone gets hurt and they tagged me Brendan Schaub get in there like you're at your goddamn fuck you fucking crazy with G when when you go back and think about that cyborg fight would you ever think about doing that again now man tube is that what you know comedy so hard I'm so behind the eight-ball I ask you about this what do you think about this what do you think about Pettis fighting wonderful got it good for you Pettis I love they get great fire isn't their kind of crazy though it goes from 45 can't make it anymore all the way up to 70 25 think about it fucking this how much of a beast Pettis is fights Tony Ferguson amazing fight right Tony wins that he gets hurt then fucking he was like you know I got broke his hand had a stroke his hand that fight so but it was a tough fight for him either way but then he jumps up and I exciting one new boy yeah both he's me a dog in both fights he's in both fights yeah yeah that that Ferguson fight was fun hell yeah I show it shows you what a survivor Ferguson is he gets clipped and you know he got hurt in that fight and he just grabbed dude how about Matt Halloween Tony Ferguson talking shit each other that's the on the on the dark web that's the room I like that but I don't like that why don't you I said Ferguson versus could be I want to see that fight because he leaves out furred he won't fight in Vegas he has a suspension so he's out for a little bit Tony's ready to go he won't do the the he won't do that thing that Vegas is asking that commercial they're asking me to do a commercial is like you have prostitution you have gambling fuck you so why does the problem with Conor Tony what's gonna love that what's it's gonna be Conor and cowboy Conor and Cowboys a done deal as far as I know as far as doesn't Conor Tony make more sense though no cowboy is great and Conor Tony is great they're both great they're both great if I'm if I'm Dana I'm sitting on this Eddie you like I want to be careful Tony cuz you love him your friends I'm just saying why not cuz no need to honor that it works for like to you here it is Eddie Tony Conor Conor be a slight underdog I think in that fight Tony's a monster for anybody so I think Tony max the it and cocked his colonies get a win I'm not saying Conor's can be a huge favorite or a cowboy but he's more favorable in that fight than he needs a window or he comes back he needs a more favorable fight and I'm not saying that's a great mat Cowboys a motherfucker and but you know guys out fire Cowboys on fire right now he's just so lucid in the zone right now and cowboy it's a great fight that's a graphic to stylistically that's a better fight for cowboy and Connor yeah Tony's uh Plutonia is a great wrestling background he's a motherfucker cardio for days and he's crazy I like that fight a lot I really like that fight a lot max Holloway Tony's a motherfucking fight I love that fight Marvel Studios with these do superheroes are they they've run another superhero I'll get this shit on my face people I

fight our first restaurant second fight huh that's a terrible kick I've never been hit by one of those I don't know what it feels like I said worse than kicking the knee yeah you know the theme I'm taking the knee is hard to fuck your knee up like you can you can hyper extend the knee with a side kick you could fuck someone's knee up that way all right he's gotta put it in the triangle that's ok some B stands over right there nobody is gonna hook the leg that's over maybe not maybe weights he's probably checking to see was ok he gave me a thumbs up what if taking the frustration have fists oh

at last last time I was there I go I'm done I go I'm never coming and they were laughing like that I go you people are too stupid I go I can't come back here anymore they were laughing and you never came back never go back never does my last year I did a theater when I was at a great time just I'm not only bullshitting but they're they're a little crazy I was doing that's right before my special I was doing those cell phone bags so they're put on that's right so to use your phone you have to leave the theater yeah so you would think they would just sit down and watch the show everywhere else that's the case not in Miami Miami they kept leaving the party passes yeah my godness paintball back and forth and back and forth not to let me found not a flat has to be found in Miami and it's my maybe my favorite place in many ways that's where Tiffany Haddish just she just had a really bad new year set she just didn't prepare I guess she was wrong she's also doing movies there's a sneaky thing that happens man when you're doing movies and then you become a huge star so you're doing these big theaters as well but you're not really doing enough standing wrap do those big feet you kind of fucking do mad wraps to do big places if you want the same thing are you watching banging away at his head Brian Baum arena Oh big elbow by Luke a you don't see a lot of Mohawks these days when I do see one you know he means business irena just turned walk turning away and getting him back to the center taking a deep breath but when Lou Kay's throwing elbows like that from him close maybe he's really good at elbows or maybe hurt his little game mohawk no the other one okay can just sit there and kind of take those shots off his gloves he's not ooh elbow but not afraid to just sit there see well he's also probably really tired from the token test and then the Dara's attempt in the first round now the one these guys are worried about leg kicks are they oh nice front kick to the body mm-hmm I feel like front kicks of bodies one of the most underused weapons mm-hmm you know that was one of the things that I was so impressed with Barbosa in the hangman fight in the Dan hooker fight oh my god fucking fucking fight Paul Felder said I was staged okay so when Paul felt it was taking those kicks to the body from Barbosa oh my god yes and his skin was so red and I said I was like you seem like you didn't even notice he goes dude they hurt so they hurt so fights tonight yeah he felled hurt us yeah guys I killed Vic's I could that he's like one win from fuck and I feel like being that guy he's a monster my Vic yeah but gaging knocked him cold ossified won like ten before then oh yeah he's a beast dude he's a long tall dude - that's right gauging off the fuck oh not the first Adam I've never seen so many fucking balconies being thrown by you and Barbarina have the same chest there's no nose all day you're so rude what know that it's not a bad thing no cuz that is relative Barbarina my chest get the big chest gets right my son non-stop Brian Barbarina is a professional fighter but doesn't mean he has a good shot you think right you better bought it I'll take my stuff right now and put it up against I'll stand right next to him and you tell me if I don't have a better body do it bitch you got the same chest let me see throw some punches oh you look better you look very good Brian shredded but I look very good you're very slim around the forms and the wrists doesn't lead have a lot of pop your shots oh yeah you're not flexing it off yeah you like I could choke you with one hand very jacked your you know what's confusing to me is the hand the hand to wrist ratio I don't see a lot of power coming out of those hands like your forearms so they're so small they're so small like you could pick locks you could pick locks with your wrists you just have a better body though you do have a better buyer camera Vicente Luque zhe's name gentlemen please his body's better news Oh Luke a is better than yours Barbarina give you the skills they're playing Rock'em Sock'em robots here man there's standing right in front of each other you wouldn't you think that Luke 8 would want to take this fight to the ground I mean he almost fucking choked him out they did I get that he's tired I mean I really do get that but I mean I want to see attempts like how's that whiskey Eddy it sucks it's filled with RC series you know what comes from thirsty home from abortion fetuses oh Jesus brought it disappear home Oh looky with a big left hook oh Jesus these guys are just I rarely see a fight where guys just standing right in front of each other like that he pushed him down yep do they hate what's fighters pro professional fighters oh yeah you don't see a lot of guys of Swing in these days no pressive right counted gee did you watch MVP vs. Paul Daley I did not watch it and I only wonder how someone like MVP will do if he ever goes to the UFC I want to see him fight guys like never designed a welterweight tournament though that belt or term it's legit asfar he's a killer he's not Michael venom page no he did no no not after watching daily take him down you got to think what Tyron would do to him or what iseman would do to him or Kobe Covington and he was really the it wrestler but but the thing about tyrannous tyrants are legit wrestle with nuclear weapons it's not just he's gonna punch you he's gonna put your fucking jaw bone through the back your head and he's a phenomenal boxer like you out strike fucking Lander boy he rocked run away which is impossible to do what wonder boy how about he sat there until down with one shot correct one shot a fight imagine Darren television though Tyron is like the most Jack like it's like the the best body competition it's like first of all you got to give it all of the Kuban yeah yo over Mero wins best body competition P or she does rock holds right behind it's a different thing great he's got a beautiful body but when Yoel Romero we're talking streak with bikini briefs on you like I'm free what is that yeah that's fair what is that it's Kate and then transpose oh yeah whole like you come hold my deep ah and the vitro say nobody has better body than over him when he was ubering nobody nobody wants to be right you all know know Overeem was ridiculous but yo ljust is a perfect specimen my cute he's whenever he was 265 pounds shred red Porsche net jazz when he's standing on the scales and he's flexing I remember being behind him when he was weighted just blinking cold what in the fuck am I looking at yeah what is this even flat closers like what I always lost you see yeah I was so pumped for that fight because that was his UFC debut and his UFC debut against Brock Lesnar I was like I was so pumped for that fight and both don't want on that saucy sauce the sauce is like fuckin grizzly bear as well yo where's that wine for this his body for wine bro what does I want for you bro I'm doing that - I thought it was Ireland over there freely we're free to do whatever we want we're Americans we pay taxes can we have some more whiskey man no more no more with your good fighters wolf that's all five minutes five rounds done gentlemen what's what's more fun you can't hooking him up with more you're a bad person not a bad person Cheers my favorite my favorite we were talking about this before you got here my favorite it's the best hmm I love doing podcasts I love doing podcasts with everybody but man there's something special about these look at that upward elbow Anderson Silva style dude and us and we haven't talked to us and I still look good he look very good you look very good I stop in it and be like an old weathered and like that was a good go yeah I mean Anderson look a little I mean he looked a little overmatched in terms of like technique cuz style bender is a legitimate world-class world championship caliber kickboxer but Anderson was hanging in there with who's hanging in answer and also trouble goddaughters look at Haryana behind like good lore that is really good show behind going what in the fuck that's a scarce fire of all these guys how do you score this fight how would you ever score that an arm like it's Isis who's gonna win this fight a dis impasto so very good question they would suck to be a judge if you listen to move you back nobody punches there's two thing I watched some glory fights today where I was working out two things that glory does better than UFC one five judges not three brilliant to open scoring love it what do you mean open squirrelly you know who know what's going on you know what's going on after every round the judges have to put up their scores so if you see a fucking domination and then you see ten nine for the wrong garlic white the whole crowd can go what the fuck the pressure I love it love it change it it's the Commission's GFC yeah and by the way you know the best place to do that kind of changes right here Andy Foster is like one of the most proactive ahead of the curve intelligent guys in all and you know and bob Bennett over in Nevada is just as good he's excellent - they can do this but if no vote on it if Nevada does everybody's gonna do it everybody that's not entirely true because of the new rules the new rules are not modified yeah they're not adopted by everybody yeah adopted by Nevada I think the house in Nevada I say Nevada - its Nevada I just say Las Vegas a Las Vegas Nevada and I say no - Adam mm-hmm do you say - Martin - Martin tidak no I say Argentina and Chile do you say Ibiza I say he beat that and I say Uruguay and Paraguay I say what about Afghanistan Afghanistan of course I always have enough course when I say and I say and I say okay go god damn I say fight this fight this is insane these guys are wrong on this is not the way to fight but you want a long-term career if you want that $50,000 bonus in trauma play jeopardy when you're 4000 is a bad move how tough for these dudes you know you know what I saw the other day I saw Wolf Blitzer play jeopardy he look you ended up at the end of it with - for Kant amazing fight yeah how much time was lost at that that's it look like not there with because the clock is off so less than baby you can't you can't stand a bang like that they stopped it that's not good sometimes you can see this looked at this corner goes whoa is he Brazilian yeah did you see fucking uh how badass or Brazilians just overall just stop just stop and think about how many bad motherfuckers came out of Britain coming out of your way ain't coming out of Belize Bailey ain't coming out of Colombia few nor the majority or I'll come out a produce say how about the hoes in Brazil as well that's just the whole nation hoes are the girls need help with their rent it's it's real it's real get it straight real real nice is the difference because they're their church is the beach look at that so everyone got to look good in Rio boom there's a right hand there's another knee shift on the way down that stuff oh the mouthpiece went flying that's it stopped it look at this douche oh my god and this is they've been playing Rock'em Sock'em robots for three fucking rounds you can't for damn that's crazy that's it it's like they ain't good for ESPN - yeah the common fans watching goat yeah in the face bro I could do that do it for Georgia Nevada State Athletic Commission adopts new unified rules Oh excellent when does this was this labeled November 13th Oh so 2018 okay so they finally adopted so they're gonna do this optics do these grounded fighter rule Oh interesting do they they took the new rules but they don't accept the one point down raw glory does his whole five I don't like that bro that grounded final rule it's a game to gray it's too much of a gray area dude how about that says fucking Paul daily protests MVP loss says belt or rigged it to protect their investment ah Paul de Leeuw you're a monster when he's when he's on he's a monster there's no man on the planet who I mean think about what he did to lorenz larkin right lorenz larkin is a really tactical striker and Paul de Leeuw to him he lands that fucking left hand on you you you forget your child who's been fighting he's been disappointed he says mmm any politics in Bellator protecting their investment I failed one three rounds two to my opinion I beat that fool really close fight I can't see how he thinks you went three rounds though like if they you have to daily McGarrett fine we all lost the fans lost but now he says three oh my god that's fine I don't know it's it was a bullshit fight all the way it was it wasn't the best fight wasn't the best price is watching two blue belts grapple yeah Daly kept trying to get daily took him down then he lost position once an MVP got on top of him and beat his ass got his back I thought I was gonna choke him out me too that they had a rear-naked their first yeah I was amazed that Paul Daley was able to take him down though and we really made some big improvements in his wrestling I mean I guess maybe felt like after the John Fitch fight if you can't beat them join them what a great that this is a great fight man yeah Wow six seconds left what weight was this 70 oh yeah at 70 I'm sorry I suck at American Top Team yeah what's this and it just finished

bullshit cuz you know it's just sounded count I was sounding like from the lstart yeah it's some people were saying online that it was like like what happens when you let actors write a script right right Bridget breathing worse even worse getting an actor to try to get away with a crime there are cops Chicago cops because they haven't seen everything they don't because those guys don't study crime and you're out of the game and you come and you're gonna pull up with the wall over the Chicago police all those detective it's like me I started fighting though I saw some stuff on YouTube I'm gonna go and fight ten how about how about this boy show how about they brought his boys and they squealed real fast Chicago cops what's going on it I let those guys loose they're like you can announcer like we're gonna that's like the guy see he hired her sculpting to run a train I Hector Lombard you know they all it looked like fucking Francis look like two three times that means your navy hurt would you who's on top god I think the brothers just saw like a spit just like a Chinese finger duck did in plain sight you guys seen that on Netflix oh he's obsessing that I haven't seen yet don't tell me anything about it fuckin see abducted I will complain so you seen it Joe it's fucking incredible time conflicts you have to see just about spoiler alert and this should sell you on it the dad sucks off the dude who's molesting his daughter and having sex in life he doesn't suck him off he jerked him so he says the 70s yeah so why did he do that because he had pressure the main it's a long stream of really a long story but this guy abducts this girl drugs her and she wakes up strapped to a bed you know where she has she's 12 a knife or cheese knife yeah cheesy crazy talking more custom knives find them on Instagram without given to me by Vincent gave it to me that's a professional hunter yeah true work of taco more you gotta calm down yeah yeah they got a great Instagram page handmade knives why is this knife in my hand feels so at home cuz you're a natural knife man you know what I am I'm a knife's man Joe check this out this is 12 year old girl drugs her she wakes up she strapped up and she's got this speaker next to her and don't tell this guy this I wanna hear this she doesn't die okay dude so interesting dude you're gonna gonna if you watch the ones I've ever seen in my she she gets abducted and this guy this guy makes her think that she got abducted by aliens so then the aliens tell her he's got this on a tape record and she's tied up she says Mr B he has names mister the guy who abducted her and the aliens tell her that she must marry this man to save the world and if anybody finds regnant yeah well yeah yeah she must have she must get pregnant by this guy that guy that abducted her and sociopath yes she believes it and falls in love with the guy and she's in love with them for like four years cuz she thinks she has to save the world he got her to think she got abducted by aliens what do you think is happening when people say they get a doctor about aliens you think there's my er I think yeah I think it's it's some people high-level people doing experiments and getting them they're abducting them they're not being abducted by aliens they're being abducted by people who make them think they get it wouldn't it be more more interesting more obviously they were just dreaming cuz nothing happens to them physically you know the thing about alien abductions is you know no there's no evidence of you live you like people that have been alien abducted like there's no evidence they actually leave their house there's no like there's no oh no alarms go off what happens is believe that really happen hold on when people sleep when people sleep your brain produces all these chemicals that make you dream right so all of these alien abductions almost all of them this great cheese great Jesus alien these alien abductions all take place while people are sleeping it's real simple they're laying in bed at night they have this unbelievable realistic dream they also have what's called sleep paralysis sleep paralysis is something that afflicts people where they're a semi awake and they can't move their body because you're but your body's just like in a half state of dreaming and awake called REM sleep so during this time your brain is producing dimethyltryptamine you're producing DMT so you're tripping your balls off and you're having these weird fucking and you think you're aboard spaceships and shit that's a possibility but after watching this documentary another possibility is that they're they're drugging people and making them think they're getting today it could be anybody bro it could be anybody there is no they did everybody's cool Bruce Buffer chrome grill on Kron I'm more excited about this fight that I am the position coming this is a coma no one wake Oh Felder do you is like almost a

when he was on my podcast when we're discussing flatter he said that he doesn't know if if fighting is for him there's a lot of pressure the family pressure and he was basically saying that he likes living without any pressure and he doesn't know if he wants to keep fighting a throne but now you know and when you listen to the countdown show and all that he said no he said you know what I realized that just teaching is like every day is like Groundhog Day and I'm not at my best when I'm just teaching I'm at my best when I'm training for something so I always have to be trained for something so I realize I realize I need to be fine so when I heard that that's like some you know he's evolving and in figuring himself out so this this might be the beginning of some championship shit here for the UFC listen if he gets his striking together and he did tag caseros with a couple of everybody who goes to the ground with this kid is fuck what weight class was this one forty forty five yeah but guess what good luck with max Holloway holler at your boy yeah I would love to see kronborg this is to my why do we do this why you say fucking Brian or take Evers crowd oh you know when he was fighting when he was 12 years old he wasn't that into jiu-jitsu as a little he was he wasn't he was skateboarding he was skateboarding and jean-jacques we were outside at a tournament in John John we were walking and Kron Gracie at twelve came bias and skateboard and started doing some tricks and John I'll never forget that Jean Jacques goes that's the one right there that's the one that's gonna take over oh really hmm Jean Jacques knew it cuz he's really tight with Hickson and tom is a crumb been striking do we know well you know I mean he's five years he's been doing MMA fights he fought and rise and you know he fought a few fights the thing is like his striking is like his father striking it's just to understand it it's not really to do it in terms like he's never gonna be a large distance or get better he's never gonna stand in back yeah too close distance and then grab once you add to your truck even could be he's right more than chrome grown is just gonna get in a clinch up and like you said go from step one step two step three not go backward he's dangerous because fuck yes I wouldn't have been disappointed or shocked if Alex casseras escaped a couple times on the ground and maybe stood up again right maybe chrome got about a third round I wouldn't have been that surprised because Alex casseras he's been fighting for so long he's squirrelly on the go that's not an easy fight for you're not and you only have four or five seconds getting some good guys I mean remember when he beat Sergio Pettis look at that one Anthony Smith knocked out Shogun meanwhile how good did fuckin Shogun look in his last fight Shogun has made some sort of a crazy resurgence man seriously yeah man his last fight he was so savage he was so savage and so he was late pull up whoo Shogun fight he fought someone good I thought he got murked no no no no no his last fight he won by stoppage and he looked like a fucking animal he looked like the Shogun of old those are guys who keep doing it like what's that Tyson Pedro Tyson Pedro oh that's right it's a mother plays a mother he'd be Jude show in Australia is this you're not gonna fight John Jones that's what we're talking about this would be a highlight who is this gentleman be he's a beast man he is knocked out Shogun he's a beast man knocked out Shogun özdemir Rashad he's a beast he he's a very very good fighter and I think he's the type of guy that's gonna rise to the occasion I mean I like I don't know your head's at yeah I don't know if he's how tall is he I work for the organizing committee like John is not just the best light heavyweight of all time I think he's absolutely in the conversation for the best fighter of all time I agree there's three or four guys that are in that conversation Mighty Mouse who I think is the best representative of martial arts I've ever seen Cameron there's no no I mean Kane is the best heavyweight I've ever seen but the best fighters have ever seen I think phaidor is in the conversation and I think Anderson Silva when he was in his prime when he was in his prime but it was prime he was a savage man ever he was an assassin look at this Cain Velasquez showing up purple look at this has a weird-looking suite in that purple jacket whoa Luke and Luke Rockhold Daniel Cormier said when he was healthy he was the baddest man on the planet well DC said to me man he goes I can't beat that guy yeah he goes whoa oh if someone tells me I can't beat him if he goes I thought about that when I was when I was training with him because I can't beat him look at

smacking sometimes that's a custom you know about all the time boys if you want to mate have a better life stop commenting on any YouTube I don't know anyone who's done success who goes on YouTube do you think Michael Jordan's up on YouTube commenting no you know what these guys that that you know when you can comment and on a video give one and the whole world's gonna see it again some power well you know what it also is it's like it's like a message board that doesn't get censored it's a very rare form of message it's the only one that doesn't get censored right because like Instagram Twitter you do shit well people think it gets censored but what happens is people like say you're spamming and they mark you should have spam it enough people do it it gets voted down it's hard to see so you can find it ultimately but the point is basically everyone can post what cheering in the mic who's doing it that was Betty Jesus Christ bro my thing about a negative comments is that I've had read sometime the thing is I'm like oh I kind of agree with you you know I'm not my own biggest fan so fuck off you're not gonna say anything that I don't you know kind of like yeah I'm not a big fan of myself either right I was gonna say like whoa no what are you saying about my knees much I'm amazed I've gotten as far as I've gotten with how little I feel about my work I think you become I think I've known you for 25 years and I believe you become not only incredibly thoughtful and you probably have made the biggest transformation of any friend I've ever had and you've become somebody who listens in podcasts oh well I listen your podcast all the time thank you I do my best you know I made a mistake of listening to one of my early ones the other day oh eight years ago like heads and says don't go back listening to your now listen to how you like listen and don't take a position and just are so open about everything that that pot debate I'm is just unbelievable well you know what the pot debate was important to me because I legitimately think that there are people who should not smoke pot this is coming from someone who smokes a lot of pot you're a reasonable human being I I see it and I'm not a zealot I see it I see it in people I see there's people that shouldn't fucking do it and there's people that it does make them lazy there is everybody's brain reacts differently to caffeine to nicotine right to fucking all the drugs and there are some people that I legitimately feel like have a really hard time with THC whether especially in edible form I think edible form is I think it's legitimately one of the most potent psychedelic drugs that's freely available I called the poison control center after brownie I woke him up cuz Rd is a seasoned drug addict and back then I had eaten a brownie and I didn't know what was going on with me and I said dude III think I'm dying and it was your not time Kongo I can't feel myself breather my I can't hear my heart how old were you at this thing already thirty twelve I would understand I wouldn't like make a sign in wow that's pretty toys you know is legal like I don't think guns should be like I believe the cb9 in my education I believe in education and I think there's one of the things that I'm trying to do and it's one of things I was trying to do with that pot to bake podcast is let people know hey I've taken some pretty zealot like pull positions in the past where I was like everybody should smoke pot don't listen to me from three years ago right listen to me from right now right everybody should not smoke pot and if you're thinking about smoking pot smoke a little tiny bit but that's what this looks like alcohol don't finish thing that I go he said because I don't want a lot of people to smoke pot but the one thing Houdini always said for the for the last 20 years is I've always said this that I don't think you should start smoking weed till you're at least twenty eight it's a good I think that's great oh I never said 2115 I feel that fully develop know who you are we become who you are and then smoke weed that way you can tell the difference between what the pot is doing to you and what you are without the pot well not only that your frontal lobe your frontal lobe does not fully form until you're 25 that point they say shouldn't play football or fight or sparring shouldn't play

Christ here's my thing with this though in football 99% of people aren't like that though like that kid ride was gonna have problems with their the concussion are not down the road you know where you see the proof though is in the the retired NFL players that get into commentating Michael it was Dillon you would see you would hear it in their speech but like Troy Aikman for instance he's had like a hundred concussions but he's one of the best commentators out Tony Roma's had a tree tomato yes guys like jr. say Oh hold on you know Rhonda Patrick actually detailed this in length is actual

house when he got to Miami they said he fucked all through all the girls lined up to fuck Oh Jason come here you gotta quit it after I believe how creepy dark Chad Bundy they want to fuck murderers managers which is bangin big do you think that let's just talk about that what do you think that is it's a small percentage of girls yeah what is that what is that I think that it's probably primordial I think it goes back to the alpha male who kills and rules with ruthlessly and I think that there seems to be there's probably a feeling of safety if you can align with that with the biggest baddest male but yeah but he's killing women but they're powerlifters with him so I think that so I think that is also the idea that if I can tame him but there's a challenge to that there there's a I know 30 fuck you know I have been with many women who are drawn two badass so why do we use I don't know I know let things set like Tony Soprano was sexy as fuck even though idea belly and everything he was choking everybody with a wire watch a narco to Pablo Escobar even dudes are like rooting for him he's a fucking murderer like like Tony Montana for instance yeah you were rooting for

go have kids yeah to need Afghani people four foot eleven babies they're gonna be a circus circus by the time those kids get older are their self circuses yeah in fucking weird places okay like you know weird fucking middle though John and stuff no I'm talking about America it's done I'm lunch it's done because you can't have elephants anymore I'm out yeah I want to talk about tough people at like either by Jean we don't there are a lot of fighters there that are waiting to get visas just like with Dagestan there's all for MMA and wrestling and ice by John is there Nashville there's that one my buddy's there now he's working there and he said his son is in a wrestling club there's a wrestling club everywhere and he said they the all the kids from literally from 8 to 16 years old

need nuclear physicist so they can compete with us in the global world war yeah is the next country - the thing is that's that shit that's great if you want cage fighters yeah you know yes Oppenheimer flip the switch on all that you can't do a Mongol style anymore now you know this is a modular mass chaos fuck it yeah he did a great job man he painted for me and I looked at it in the first time when I saw it in the flash I was like that needs to be in the fucking studio it's good-looking over us he does a great look at her eyes that's a good artist right there yeah no Taylor's amazing he's painted its generation and her think it's really hard to have a Hendrix problem how many fucking Hendrix huh let the reason why this show is called the Joe Rogan experience is Hendrix Jimi has experience I listen to Hendrix more than I listen to any human being on the planet Earth you love them timmy is my number one dumb there astonish me he's saying from me but I think I've listened to Hendrix more you know it's just like he was so pure he was so free what did he die from seven drugs or death Wilson knows with him drugs there was there was a story story struck yeah the official story turns into conspiracy his manager that there was manager was a gangster and there was a guy who was one of the henchmen for his manager they said the manager killed him he was leaving him the one thing that supports that is that it was weird that he died like choking on his own vomit he didn't have heroin in his system like there's some weirdness to it but then the other part of it is that the girlfriend Hendricks girlfriend was allegedly committed suicide by jumping off a roof but the henchman says they threw her off a role she was like yeah white chick was she's on you but without the other thing that's disappointing about Hendricks if you hear that Hendricks used to beat his girlfriend but that might have been she was a smear campaign it's like Richard Pryor - we talked about how his wife did a lot of coke and fucked everyone Richard paresseux hate is like there's also rumors he sucked did not rumors no his wife his ex-wife confirmed it like he fucked Marlon Marlon Brando ya know it shut the fuck up you don't believe have you seen it be in the day man back in the day shit his wife came out with the whole thing in the 60s they want no no no no she was saying it was okay meanest day everybody but the story is that bastard Shannon I've never done coke but when you do coke and you're in the 60s and 70s apparently those guys are just fuckin whatever David Bowie did that yeah well she was saying priors rifle saying her exact quote I think was you fucker radiator if you get enough coke in front of you you guys are trying to deal you guys you guys want to do some coke know what maybe no no Marlin bro you know maybe David Bowie maybe makjang maybe David Bowie did they get their stomach pumped or something like that gear gerbil myth dude qith or this might be real but we didn't think you know anything about the Richard no no no but holds the think that the Richard Gere gerbil thing apparently came right after he left Scientology that's the real okay that's such a good smear campaign when I first yes sister Lakeland when I first met Eddie Eddie and I talked about this because he grew up in LA I grew up in Boston we both heard the Richard Gere story with no internet exactly his mother fucker spread across the country was a huge a huge they were good he just had a baby and he's eighty-five thousand years old yeah - Jamie breath young Richard Gere look at how sexy little with a shirt off hey how about officer and gentleman I loved that scene I was amazing dude I look good as Louis Gossett jr. damn he was good he won an Oscar for that or was it nominated he didn't cry ever watch that movie he didn't win the world cooking terrible Jeff do you ever watch when unfaithful and you watch with a share by cheating dude dude he was he was the shit when he was younger man yeah but he didn't have any kids until his locally fuckin like 300 right there he steals your girl all day long you all right what listen I beat that guy to death in front of his mom he's vulnerable he cries and your duty unclean isla beats then listen I was a handsome boy when I was young you were cute too but gear here's a picture you and I in the 90s I know going to fuckin dress like shit Wow I was just ridiculous no it was cool that he took the sweaters in we were both well we may as well that's irrelevant he's have here we go James Vic do can we watch good we're gonna watch this would definitely watch the main event fell there's such a competitor man well they're all competitors yeah well they're competing for a living Brian Jesus no he's just the top look how big Vic is he's so long but you gotta think he cuts the shit out of weight he is a giant much lazy cut he's likes truth is that Stefan Struve is this this is 55 right this is 95 this is 55 Oh fuckin one yes six three six six 355 yeah that's a big advantage also cut so much weight when you said it's fine get out there walk Felder and I were in the fucking locker room last time we were working together we're getting changed getting ready for UFC I go dude what the fuck do you weigh and it goes huh 190 I go bitch you 200 pounds and we're laughing they always lie about their way yeah yeah and he goes what about you and I go bitch I'm on TRT about all the juice I need to get on that stuff you should I've been telling you for about eight years Brian would join us so much energy good you look good my cock man I just injected in your little skinny net my dong could cut it I should shoot it right in the tip of your Hawk cat would blunt this claws on my friend who felt the disconnected with I'm still fighting hard issue the knee lost stuff no he's still fighting though I think he's still fine I don't think he's officially retires I'm the top 15 that's funny you might a retired I don't know why this Muses jab more that's true yeah oh good football and the nicest guy in the planet the size of an elephant I always feel so a problem when I interview him I feel so awkward I'm like well dad - what do we know - who do I get you dick out of my face it's just so cool do you remember when we I met him we were all hanging out cuz you guys had same animatics yeah and we were hanging out and I sudden he's sitting down he's as tall as I am standing and I and I said to Brendan I go I go dude what would you do if you had to fight him in Brendan was still fighting and you know him Brett you do don't do that to him because Brendan goes oh I'd knock him the fuck out that's what I you took a fight like twice me yeah you were look at this fight right here let's watch this fight yeah let's watch two fights tonight Paul Felder double jab double jab what do you ever think about doing actual commentary because I know you played me in a movie bro I you willing to do actual commentary after wait a minute you're open in the movie warrior I had an offer and I said I don't know enough about to do the fighting I think M one should pick you up or rise in BB and Ennis Miller dude hold on that was the issue when I started working for the UFC I was concerned I was legitimately concerned because this was before UFC thirty seven and a half when I started working for the UFC Dennis Miller it was doing Monday Night Football and I was like I don't want to fight this up so I decided like I made a conscious effort I'm not even gonna remotely try to be funny no I'm like really naturally shouldn't write well first of all it meant a lot to me like martial arts means we have martial artists that seller did never played football exist it couldn't relate to it maybe please put in Jonathan junior all America does it's just this is just like when George Washington was coming across the Delaware Bay Judy wasn't set up for success in that that's not a good place no yeah well he was trying to throw those jokes around like he had him written out like he was gonna like spite I think they probably brought him in to do that though think about swears jokes there too okay all of his shit so think rewrite that was a nightmare you really think so crazy seeing about the UFC is that they don't tell me what to do you've never said anything outraged what's the officer on here you've said some shit really ridiculously you're also the best at what you do but the fact that they have this billion-dollar multi-billion dollar organization and let me talk is fucking insane for MMA I'm any sense Joe Buck never played baseball he's one color yeah I played by player color different play-by-play guy doesn't have to he doesn't have to be a professional generally has to be what I'm saying it's Joe so goddamn good imma they said fuck it we don't care about that shit well the thing is I wasn't good when I first it's over tagsam fell there is his collection is a beast well Vic's trying to hold out he's so nasty he does I feel sick for so much cheese cheese I have my cholesterol just shot up to 3,000 I don't think it works like that nope no it doesn't no it doesn't have any effect your ice is skimming its entry yeah yeah dietary cholesterol is almost zero effect on blood lipids most it's genetic there's a lot of different various issues but people that have certain genes really shouldn't fuck with a lot of high cholesterol foods but for the most part dietary cholesterol has been scientifically proven have almost zero effect on well some people do I shouldn't eat well the thing is about what is it LDL or HDL and what if they're balanced out together the real thing is like checking for artery I can slack yeah like checking to see if you're okay can you die with a sonic no you need to go to a real doctor motherfucker no no no I'm saying can you do it I can't do it for you can you check my arterial branch I can check your aura check my was that seven saw doctor be beside you for your sir I can't well you had a finger in your butt about three fingers deep fingers or size of bratwurst yeah should I do that did he Grover done that when he gets all 315 when you're 50 you gotta get a courthouse when the doctor gets all three egos I'm so that's the female I gotta say that I'm so happy to the UFC is on ESPN I really I think it's so good for the sport it's so much better fun because so many it's so good because so many people that are just sports fans just watched the ESPN all day long to you how many bars have ESPN on all the time just on a loop on a little I'd leave ESPN on yes I'm just at home that's my default you spit yeah and I don't give a fuck about sports but I understand it I know it's such a big move for the SE it's huge I think it's like home for that perfect home yeah I agree I'm so happy when when I when I heard it was happening and then the streaming service because you know because I spend so much time oh yes James I spent so much time doing online stuff I was really happy about that I was like good streaming is where the future lies what his Felder's ranked he's not right he's you know he's probably top 25 they don't really rank you until you're top 15 though he's I'm in the top 15 I feel like well that was why he didn't get that khabib fight and Ally acquainted did but in retrospect that was actually really huge because I fought a great fight I went five full rounds with could be which Connor couldn't do and then beat Kevin Lee's ass and his next fight and then I was ranked number four in the world and should be and should be a lie acquaintance when he's focused he's a fucking gangster he won wrestle right he I don't know what is rusty was I was talking about JUCO it's not gonna Dustin and and choco somebody asked him and Mike round they I think Jimmy said what's the one discipline that you think is the best thing to have in the movie try to be smart getting a conversation going wrestling's everything man it's the ability to dictate him inside takes place that's why I do loser and get all the champions hand me that night I remember when counting I remember when I brought Brian to Carlson Gracie School Beckham Carlson was still alive and Carlson of the school and Holly went off Hawthorne right when Vitor was making his UFC debut and Brian and I became friends yeah and he was wrestling with Sergio Cohen it's Sergio got mad at him ahead but remember that Brian because I was I was taking a lot of those guys down yes they didn't back then they didn't know how to take that's what I was doing wasn't remember watching I was rolling and I was look I was a white but no I was looking over at Brian and Brian was going hard with Sergio can go to harder just like this yeah because we're going takedowns I had my elbow in and he just pull it out and my boom knocked you out he broke my brother's nose did you say how to get my septum what you're saying I was young I just kept going yeah he goes I think they got broke my nose I saw that shit we were like little kids like I can't believe we're here Bustamante Carlos Mejia was there yeah Vitor Belfort yeah Mario Supergrass told Vitor I tapped him a couple times no we did not hurry up Sperry was teach the class Mario Sperry was hilarious one of the things Byron space said he goes I got so good at my triangle because I get my girl in my guard and I get her in my guard and I just beat and she says no I don't want to do no more say fuck you you stay there I taught an old friend of mine a triangle so she gets brilliant to it she's like oh my gosh she's a stripper back when I worked as a DJ is to prepare yes sir club so I showed her triangle and she because I wanted I wanted her to do it on her next boyfriend and then have him ask her where the hell you learned that from pissed on her you know that man chess so she was obsessed with you try marked her she's obsessed with triangles so I'm trying to watch Howard Stern right and she's trying to put me in a triangle and I keep telling to stop I'm like really into this Howard Stern episode she's trying to put me in a triangle you fucking stop she's laughing she's putting in a triangle and say you gotta stop you gotta fucking stop and I got really pissed I go you're gonna fucking start crying right now stop watching this fucking it stopped and she wouldn't she's laughing so she put me in a triangle and I fucking Ricardo Arona her on the bed though I wasn't trying to hurt her so I picked her up and I tried Lee didn't start crying she has me in a triangle I picked her up and slammed her on the bed it was thought that when I slammed her on the bed she lets go bounces off the bed and goes flying and lands on the ground and lands on her wrists and she starts fucking quiet so she runs to the bathroom and I walk into the bathroom and she's got the hot water running over her wrists and she's crying I say get dressed we're going to the emergency room she goes what I go get dressed we're going let's go let's go let's go to the emergency room you should broke him I just wondered I just wanted to get her to stop crying and she stopped and now is it what round is this second oh yeah the second yeah Paul Felder lifts his hands up feels like you've won that round I have no idea what happens in a good story was a great storm you hurt yeah never slam ago show your girlfriend trying but you're fine yeah I'll take a swing at you yeah I had a girl take a swing at me and a half way into the punch I was like I can't believe this is happening I know you guys saw her I can haul up I owe this she's not gonna fall through with this I was like oh my gosh what did you do I've gotta need this that I grabbed her like what no way dude

that's the second fight they've had yeah okay so he's back was he throwing a large amount of punches and was in the first like 30 seconds my take on it Francis is a fucking specimen and his story literally is like right out of Conan the Barbarian for the you know he worked in a fucking sand mill digging sand making sandbags all day that's how he his body got strong I mean he lived in this incredibly poor country in Africa Cameroon yeah and he went and moved to France it was homeless he learned how to fight and they wanted to be a boxer and they said you should do MMA four years later the guy is like at the pinnacle of MMA fighting in the UFC against world-class competition and fucking people up do you understand them when he knocked out Alistair Overeem with that vicious like trouble hell I'd be the hardest oxlike uppercut I've ever seen it's it's insane that he beat a guy who's not just a world-class fighter but a k1 grand prix champion has been 120 here I found any

champion level yeah that's a hard one those me I'm right there with don't listen losing money me and Wolf Blitzer was on Jeopardy I'd lose five pounds can anybody here spell the beats last name mmm try to get online why would we spell that and you know it spells really what I'm saying Jamie can do it those who names are hard to remember get out to this day right now I still don't knows the beat slash hormone Munson sharapov there you go but here's the thing about the inner thrust and work for the FC bro but did you have to I practiced it over and over again because I had a really hard time with it to the point where his coaches were saying just calm rooms I eat I felt that was disrespectful but yeah but I felt like this is the gentleman's name their bond and he's he's excellent [Applause] I never thought like the team's last night mm-hmm I gave up on it and said there's no way I could do this well you know we have to respect the family this but we have to respect the fact that they have a totally different language in terms of like their letters to respect the fact they have completely different language it's very hard it's I don't know what the fuck's right here I do not know what the and we hear them discount get his head in YouTube or some show okay we just need to watch this on our own I'm in my opinion this is what it is the greatest the in terms of best I've ever seen performances he's the most one of the most stunning athletes I've ever seen Cain Velasquez like one of the most amazing heavyweights of all time if not the best of all time he he might be the best and then Francis and all the guys I've ever seen fight is the scariest of all time he has the nearest of one show yep yep most potential he he's only been fighting a small amount of time and he's already in like world-class competition you have to understand to knock out a guy like Alistair Overeem literally like five years in the training that's insane he's something uniquely special in terms of his like like the the what the shit they had to endure working in a fucking sand mine diggin bags of sand the kind of power that he possesses if he just gets all those other pieces in place he like in terms of like an overall physical specimen he's one of the scariest of all time so this is nervous this is an amazing fight yeah I mean this is like as good as it gets if you're an MMA fan holy shit this is literally as good as it gets it just depends what car engine of Kane we get it's not uncommon in this sport for you know fast rising stars that are rising because of their beastliness and their knockout power it's not uncommon for them to not train jiu-jitsu right we've seen plenty of them you know what I mean how crazy would it be if Zingano actually trained jiu-jitsu right and fell you know I got time for that you know we don't know what he does right we don't know he does nobody she just hit Center but how about if he like this is like photo trim let's say he just he just went to danaher's and just fell in love with John Tanner they just became best friends now would be any jumped in imagine how he's 36 you know what I mean up with jujitsu holidays that hold us you could only survive with your knockout power for so you know what I mean right after a while you're gonna be getting clipped easily to tell huh guys we're killing this show by talking over each other like this yeah you're a hundred percent right no what I'm saying is yeah ventually no matter no we see it over and over again no matter how beastly you are and how powerful you are with those punches eventually you're gonna get clipped we're gonna go down so eventually you might have to switch your strategy to instead of going out there and just trying to knock a dude out to going out there and trying to take it do it he'll write and submit this buck here we go well and he's so powerful we go if he had good wrestling skills holy sure you're gonna find out right now exactly City this is out if that if the thing is like with wrestlers don't you think that you have to learn it out of really young age well George st. Pierre didn't write oh damn dude he's so dead he's so big so dangerous he's incredible dude he blew his ACL MCL LCL something's wrong with his leg or maybe not dude and cane is one of the best of all time that's how good in Ghana was damn he got through that block scariest guy I've ever seen and it wouldn't have been a surprise if in Ghana was super cautious maybe two rounds of being super cautious we wouldn't be that surprised Payne was the aggressor right chill out bro yeah but the fact that he fucking threw down like this boobie well almost like we're armed we got four armed in the first the first no let's see this again never got hit anywhere everybody we all missed it fry the end for Kane huh let's be real back injury I said it this that Bal CLM tailbone MCO like that when it's bent this way when it comes to all of them that's MCO how old is he now I don't know but he's all a third whatever he is you could only take so many wars each war is significant in your life like each one took some of your life yeah and eventually that's it you can't you already you with the five crazy wars that's not that that's what summer that ended that way well you know what it is man I think guys that are that championship-caliber like Cain their mind is so ferocious that their body is almost like a spaceship re-entering its missing tiles and it starts fucking chicken apart they're so powerful in terms of their abilities driving and then the knees go and the neck goes the back goes and then you deal with these physical realities of the body that you hear it's still there I'm in the middle and try to come back right now since my show it's been six months in like since my shoulder surgery had my bicep reattach to my shoulder had knee surgery about ten months ago that's still not a hundred percent like it's still there not right there's still 20 when they roll in with I'm rolling with 130 pound blue belts red right now shit the last three weeks I've been wrong with some little blue belts I gotta be able to have like 50 pounds on them right right and have total control right you know at this point you know to me I wait for Francis was a blown a seal for Kay well I mean it definitely is a blown knee for Kane but Francis was right because like when Francis was coming after him and he clipped him he definitely clipped him with that forearm behind the neck eighty to a hundred percent that's a nightmare that's a fight for him that's a nightmare outcome a hundred percent because Francis just clipped it not but do you want to hear about this eh yeah what do they have to say yeah give me some volume but I look at the tits on him I don't hear anything good job Jamie there it goes [Music] he blew zinnia but he did but I liked it the way he was moving in on him man I mean he really did look that Landro foot that forearm did the formulas maybe you asked for his shit blue you know what man I'm gonna rethink what I said I'm gonna rethink it I know I thought I saw his forearm clip his neck let's not worry blows that were you know no trouble what do you think you know he kind of fell though before they sneak is out just see the thing is he's so heavy-handed you I think you might be correct but I do think they connected with his neck other guys this heavy-handed well a second that note on his shoulder I felt that was nothing here nothing nothing there nothing up knee goes out you're right you're right I was wrong I thought it was I thought it hit his neck it did not hit his neck it hit his back right his shoulder was clear there is the top here we go ready yeah holy shoot he was touring around he's a freak Fred to sing go time [Music] at the defensive line right there a middle linebacker right well he's not done see the thing about this guy's he hasn't been fighting for very long that even though he loses to Steve Bain has that that timid performance there goes he says so little mileage which what does he say about his name it's the worst very classy Kane very classy you know never bitter how weird is it the Fox and this one he's not even talking about his name thing he's in retired things are retired it's my way by the way out is how good is John annek he's the best that he's available it's such a bummer to lose wonderful doctor John Eric is so good I love John I'm so impressed with him like when I work with him he's he's he's so like he's such a good commentator on ESPN let me look at this was shoulders was the was maybe an uppercut might have landed right there with my oh my right there uppercut - Adam down uppercut my cheese go so nothing so far not this right let's just right hand right okay let's see these missed it that was a legit too close he blew his knee out for sure because the uppercut this is what's important Matt Taibbi has a fantastic article out right now about one of the problems with society today is that people look at the news like they look at sports like someone has to be right about things you have to know everything but this it's a great article that Taibbi this is a perfect example of for guys who are lifelong martial artists and we both went both ways I was like you're right and then we saw it again like you're right that that's how you're supposed to look at shit ya can't be attached certain fights to get stopped early okay TJ and Stu who dub I thought it was stopped early don't say they didn't think it was stopped early yeah oh my god but I felt like when I watch it that you gotta give a guy a chance to fight more but in the NFL when they review plays they review them and one of the most important things about reviewing a play is that you have multiple angles yeah it's give me all to commit to three angles they keep going back to the first angle yeah we didn't we didn't get a good enough angle cuz right that right head was like a ghost right now I don't see you guys well you know what is so exciting with shit like that is going on and the UFC truck is the best in the world like Mark Telegraaf day and all those dudes back there Anthony Giordano and the whole crew they're always moving Martella Crotty motherfucker he figures out when to replace I love him he's like yeah I didn't know that I fucking love that dude he's the shit so he does like the hill like picked the play-by-play angles he'll pick like shit and cuz he goes on fights because he knows yeah Todd Feldman made Bank off fucking Francis by the way he did big bank damn I'm telling you dude if that guy keeps learning and it seems like he got it he had a weird spot but you know what I really liked about that weird spot that he got into friends yep he was honest about it he said I carried over fear from my last fight Oh a guy who can look at himself that honestly Negro plus his ego got out of control can use not little dudes out and then that's a good thing you know he said that an interview like even his his ego coaches like he's not he's bigger than the game they got humbled and now he fucking just knocked out Cain Velasquez before that he murked fucking homeboy yeah I mean Chris blades I can't remember the name he looked he looked like using a different way castrate you know it is like the future is an athlete that really at 265 pounds doesn't have to gain any weight doesn't have to lose anyway oh they're gonna show it to us again the future debut of Fox Cain gets knocked up by JD s cheese the dreams you of ESPN it's knocked up by Francis he took that jab right there - Francis Francis clipped him with a hard jab fast here back up just a wee bit to play this over and over let's look at this the the extremes were sweet see he hits him nothing yeah fucking right pants yes put it right up or shovel it's a shit show we could slow-mo is that yeah he hits what a right to the face he said see ya try one more time because he's okay right now no hell no wait a minute that's why I came demon and he goes close to soon are you so powerful watch this watch that shit Jamie just play play pause play pause play pause play pause DirecTV guy like it's a VCR in the 90s yeah this angle it looks like we're trying to get a titties in the 90s for sure Ghana is a good angle friend watch this watch his head move yeah geez and that's why that's why Kane didn't address them because I got too close too soon he's too when you when you think about a person that might be like for one's like okay party where is it you think about a person like you know he's essentially like optimized at 265 he's optimized he's like a fit a real 260 for five rounds localized well here's the thing though all he has to do is get better at that first round and do you really think a lot of guys gonna make it second fuck I miss this angle it looks like him there hundred percent that's clips um yeah says that you see his head move that's why King do throws a single leg on the ref but he's concussed he went for the singleness is scariest of all you guys went off all time over Oberyn dude the thing about Francis is speed he's he's learning at this like really rapid rate when you look at a guy that's only been doing it for how many years now a hundred percent trained he's been fighting for - he's fighting for like maybe five years that's I think five years from the time he learns martial arts his dad was some legendary fighter he was doing this was say yeah yeah dude he's a movie character if he can just get over the hump that he got look the Steep a Miocic fight that's that's what's up man I mean he got to that that the top of the mount dude he's a fighter DC now you find your boy Michael Jai White gonna air fire right now spawn so what he is huge but Francis is a giant giant so wide as a giant don't I've trained with him he's nowhere near as big as hockey was sure and he still played rock you train with him right Michael Jai White came into a box woman maybe he's not a small spawn in John ooh maybe he's not as tall as him but in the movies you could make him talk well for sure it's Michael Jeremiah be the perimeter check fighter Oh 100% dude i watch i watch Michael Jai White do a hopping sidekick on a bag at Legends and snap the chain the chain broke No you fought killing what happens in this pond he's a legit black belt and cook shit he looks and nobody nobody is more critical judge of kicking technique than me it takes perfect yes he does everything he's a monk a hundred percent legit black belt so I'm telling Michael shy why mr. Brockway there's a good story let me finish this so please here Michael I'm telling Michael Jai White over and over I'm trying to explain to him how bad of a motherfucker Joe is with that turning sidekick I go dude I'm telling Michael I why all the stories that there's so many stories of Joe hid in the bag in front of traditional martial artists you know nobody can kick the bag like fucking show yeah everybody knows that now cuz it's all over YouTube at 50 but before that how was the one trying to fucking tell everybody cuz I'm hanging out with Joe he's kicking the fuck well that delle grazie when he's holding that thing you were kicking out and and everybody GSP freaks out when he just feet freaks out when Joe Rogan kicks I and I knew I had a film this year so weird flexible you can do the splits I'm just peppering I'm telling Michael Jai White all about Joe Rogan's turning sidekick I'm blowing him the fuck up telling in the GSP story that's on YouTube that has a million you're not gazillion views right all this shit everybody knows about it now the old taekwondo footage is coming out where he's fucking there's a there's a clip with joe doing a turn in sidekick hitting a dude and the guy drops you know what I mean in georgeous walks away like he's seen it like he's done in a million times he just you know so he's become legislation so I'm telling Michael Shai white all this at Legends and then we walk up to the fucking the bag he goes I got a pretty good turn in sidekick to the at legend this is a real story what years he fucking does this is like eight years ago he fucking just mass Legends does a turn in sidekick blows the bag I think you're I think I was there for the 100% of it but I'm pretty sure he did a hopping sidekick I don't think whatever it is his techniques do his techniques of paper oh yeah did he ever do same brush larger like you know a shitty about deep do like high-level martial arts like he fought geocaches I know he fought like real kyo kitchen fights you know and not only was I embarrassed the first thing I thought was like oh shit Chris Riley own the gym like oh shit we gotta hide the chain so we turned it into one of those grappling bags that you fuckin mound and beat the shit but we had to get rid of the chain he looks like a legit athlete it was like a scene in a movie that's Michael Johnny Bravo's talking about kicking bags and chin Michael Tighe wife walks up to this bag literally the chain breaks fly enjoy SEMA spawned oh and someone said to me I enjoyed yeah we're having a problem with that Jam I shut the fuck up it's like you would have a problem with that change anyways Joe's kick I shut the fuck up about you I never brought you up ever do some fucking drink videos that's a real story the goddamn movie if you put that in a goddamn movie yeah I saw him flying Spock Bryan Callen we're talking about one thing any time fer no I'm just saying like basketball nobody nobody is watching this most people we can show they seen went you know what let me let me try and hit the myths you'd beat up everybody yeah yeah yeah there's certain athletes and this is what I'm thinking about Cain and one of thinking about Francis tonight there's certain athletes that if they can get the mental game into a place little world like Kane was when he was at its peak yeah it's all about it's all about like how easy is it for you how much you have to work for it how much of the reason why you're successful is because you've built up this insane work ethic so you have phenomenal cardio and an ability to push and can you get a guy who has that but spectacular genetics like how do you get a Michael Jordan you know how do you get a Brock Lesnar how do you get a how do you get a freak and can you get that freak to train the way like the best train like yeah can you get that freak a genetic freak who has advanced a there's a big difference so you might be a great athlete you may be a great athlete but can you when you get hit in the face when you get knocked out what are you like when you what are you like the next day at practice how much does that get in your action because I think certain fighters 100 certain people that doesn't deter them and some people it would know you're Berkeley I said did you ever want to do play football he was because he's so big and he goes those guys played for one day and I was like these guys are crazy they bang into each other yeah so what happened with Bob Costas yes where he's like football's bad there should be CT they went cool lunch hit the Super Bowl I know his exact words were someone told him that he crossed a line yeah but he is on their platform in network shit that's like you shitting on you it is a weird seating do you go see you go cool that's your belief and you're probably right but we can't have you on our airwaves well there's gotta be a way to sing Dana white on your show and you're like talking shit on him well listen let me tell you something hilarious Dana White is one of the first guys to tell people to stop he's one of the first guys to tell people to stop he told Chuck to stop he was paying Chuck was not fight it was like don't fight he goes I'll pay you to not fight I do not want you to fight Wow yeah like he'll tell guys that he can make millions of dollars off no don't fight Wow they make plenty of money yeah I mean there's people that want to fight and there's this is what the real philosophical debate comes in like if you think a guy should retire but he doesn't think he should retire but he's gonna die someday and so are you who's to tell you you have to say fine what you can't I can't do after you have to say you're right you're right and he's right everybody's right that's the problem it's like one of those really complicated debates where it's like what does that mean didn't you do that to Brendan yes but I loved him and I knew he was on his way out I knew he was on his way out and I would hope that if I was fighting and someone was close to me and knew when I when I was like really good when I was doing Taekwondo tournaments we got to a point when I was somewhere around like 20 or 21 when I realized there was no future in that and I started dropping off and one of the things was because I started training with other young guys like a lot of guys were doing kickboxing and boxing and I realized oh they're doing it the way I used to do it but I'm not doing it that way no no it's that they're obsessed in the gym all day they're living it and I realized I was like you know I'd met some some young guys one kid this guy Dana Rosenblatt I want to be in New England middleweight boxing champion we did a lot of training together it was a really tough fight on Tuesday Night Fights yeah he fought Vinny Pazienza twice knocked out Terry Norris he was obsessed with it yeah not excuse me yes he did knock out turn yours he was a knocked out Howard Davis jr. - he was a legit he was really the boxing coach for American Top Team and you sparred with him oh yes a lot he'd beat the shit out of me dude he's clip of no one I definitely did that but I hit him you know but the thing is like he let me know from sparring with him that he was he was way more focused on fighting than I was and I used to think I was as focused as I used to be then I realized oh I'm not anymore here I'm a 20 year old guy with a bunch of jobs so 21 year old girl with a bunch of jobs and here's this kid who's I think at the time he was like 18 he was kickboxing and boxing and he and I talked about I was like just box he's like you think I'd go yeah your boxing is fucking awesome because we were spar that's where he would fuck me up he would fuck me up with boxing I'm like - there's no money in kickboxing there's no money back then zero there's still no but there's some glory pays Bellator pays you can make money lion fight pay see there's this plenty guys won it's hard it's hard what I'm saying is max Jenn white thought it was nothing but money you say that kid was super passionate about it herself I was like I gotta get out of this I'm gonna get brain damage I'm like these young guys are gonna fuck me up spar with them with kicks yeah we sport we did bollocks we kick boxed and we box box to the other land side kicks on his ass um we sparred man I don't remember was like we were I'm sure I hit him but but my take from it wasn't you know my take from it 100% was oh this guy's way more focused than I am yeah like I had my foot out the door and so when I saw that you had your foot out the door I was like shit he's got his foot out the door thank God you did Oh cuz I saw it I was like life is so good right I was like dude you don't have a real chance struck while the iron was hot boom yeah wait who had out you had a desire golden opening I was like dude you're funny guy yeah like you're you're a fun guy to listen to I like hanging around with I think people like you - they're gonna like you don podcast and do it stand up you don't have to get punched in the face and he misses fighting everyday look at him you can't give that advice to everybody and a lot of people got mad at me for giving that advice I'm like I wouldn't matter all we love Joe I was like I can't believe I did that dude I was like this is a hill I'm willing to die on I know you don't want to be doing this no one wants to tell you don't want to be doing this no thank you I love it thank you brother thank you for listening thank you for listening because instead of like losing a friend you know a friend grow know what it is we're died in that first night like the competitor came out I was like fuck Joe mamak on 205 and I was dieting training I was like what the fuck am i doing I knew it was a perfect Lenny's pictures action of us all three of us well no I've never told anybody to do that before so let's move on oh yeah man it's like we love you man yeah you almost started crying when you were going out I don't know if you miss fighting whatever just no no okay which crazy as I did I did whatever last row back then watch boy Nelson croak croak up fight about how crazy is this it's amazing it's amazing I knew it I knew you could do it because you have a pro athletes work ethic applied to something you really enjoy Joey knew me he kills both of us illest I don't see him if it ended up on the ground no way is Brendan gonna be able to finish Joe no really no you know I think so it's the pair let me say one thing to enemy way to get worried about job Eddie Eddie Eddie but y'all fuck you excuse me sir can I just have to say one thing I know I have seen Brendan Schaub with some of the best you just two guys in the world please and I've watched him tapped them every 12 seconds and I'll tell you the names afterwards somebody saw him listen I saw Brendan a hundred percent stall out with cyborg and get in his guard and go to the ground with him purposefully come on there's no way no listen I'm not dog you gotta stop it I'm not he would crush me like a bus and I gave him his black here's where I'm at Eddie you know where he's joking tapped me out right now if we're dead sir I wouldn't give a good for you working on new material we were just staying in a fantasy world I've never tapped anybody was any good anywhere in my response Brendan this physical advantages that people have that are so they're so stunning they're so stunning that it's creepy he's a giant people that they get a hold of you it's it's confusing I watched a cardio I'm trying to tell you I'm trying to give you props I'm saying I'm going back to Brennan because I know Brendan's a new material about being a Backstreet Boy really well he puts those yoga mats on his hips and does like 500-pound fuck thrusts yeah I'll just settle down bro he's a different kind of person it's a different kind of human I'm saying I know the difference between yes you always got no chance man nobody times I saw him get through a round and I wanted to give him advice on what he did wrong that's the interesting thing I've never done more cardio in my life yeah I do cardio like super regular because those feels you run or no joke your boys at my cardio is my cardio is always the worst part of my jujitsu game forgot when you got somebody in a fuck in the truck and you put a crotch repre go with just read wrong through people's legs the crotch rippers it's a it's like a banana split and yeah but it's a little different the legs are spread differently crushed

in crimson he was a racer he was he's got his son who races now I believe so he was the greatest and he is such a monk he wouldn't even hang with Norwest we would he was like a matador he only he only thought about racing and who's a beast dude yeah and I think everything went through his he died that funeral everybody came out holy fuck there's an amazing documentary just called Senna you can get it on iTunes Netflix maybe I don't know maybe it's on there why is everything Netflix with you it's not I'm not I'm not sure but I got it off for iTunes it's fucking incredible man we will see the the footage it's nice guys man this is just like I mean you're living your life on these split-second decisions and controlling some impossibly powerful vehicle when you're going around these fucking turns and everything's happening so fast and this guy just had this lightning precision ability to make decisions he was here it's like Dale Earnhardt jr. when his when his Pappy died then they fixed the car so no one's really died since once his dad died like we need to fix his shit yeah now there's all sorts of safety stuff in it it's um that was a fascinating conversation about how many concussions that that guy's had because I never would have thought of that how many did a ton rehab for it a bunch of em and he had like moments were like four six months he's just a mess Andy stuff like he's had so many concussions because they would blast doors and he would be the one to set the charge now all his friends are hanging and hidin and he'd be like where the fuck am I gonna go he said he's had over like 200 shot in the hip can't can't feel his his foot from the why is he staying with you right now because he had nor he had place to stay but I go stay with me with what he doing when we were on the man show we had a sketch that got declined it was about an Asian NASCAR driver oh that's right was blowing up because he was just always wrecking and taller drove the ratings up so they everybody wanted to have an Asian guy like if Bobby Lee wrote that it would be cool but people loved him we're watching golf how darest she's ever played the shit late its performs a handful a lot more happy plays right display once a year in a chair but they can't wiretap you out and the fact is you know that's why that's what all those rich people do out there going it's a fringe I'm glad you guys read that you have the same view on politics we control well I think that's it's just an excuse is there a one-game that symbolizes more like really super rich dudes out there making deals playing a game like golf nothing nothing they literally tell you if you tell us if you want to succeed in business they people tell you what I should learn how to play golf tell us how it happened and it's 99% slight he doesn't go out there playing this is just but imagine thetic li-like oj it's a real story stories how does it go here's a good story for you tell me about it so I think my mother and my father my this guy comes out to play call from my father who was a big investment guy and he wanted my father would invest in his company versus in this investment firm whatever things here be this is 1929 t 1990 yep 1990 n he they go out to play golf in Greenwich Connecticut my mother watches him everybody cheats at golf but my mother sees him kick the ball just a little bit into a better lie cuz it he he was in a taller grass kick the ball into like shorter grass we can get a better swing here's the difference when I do that I go I'm kicking the ball in he did it but he looked around make sure nobody was watching my mother Sicilian girl from New York City just went fuckin snitch bro so watch it that's a mother mother goes wow that guy just cheated secretly and it's a bullshit game hmm she was bad guy she says my father had you know he knows you guys watch it she doesn't invest in this thing that guy's a crook my father goes bullshit she goes if you do I'm gonna divorce you my father goes you're really serious I'll divorce you well hey what if you were playing check it out guy went to jail guy was 15 years I guess Donald I'll tell his name afterwards but is a huge ocean he was a huge fucking scam artist he was one of those guys in the news everything else that whole thing everybody who invested went don't do shit mama counts a snitch you know that guy you know you know that guy little things in life you can pick up perfect example any remember there's a one time where Eddie met this guy and the guys just just started doing jujitsu like he was a white belt and he called Eddie up and he told that he yeah I got a bunch of guys on like triangle today I arm barred a guy and he was like what the fuck are you talking about and like you knew like right away like this guy's full of shit like you didn't triangle a bunch of people an armbar people's your first day you don't even know how to do those things but he knew right away like Eddie and talking to him was like what because the only reason he started doing jujitsu is because we were he wanted us to go promote some kind of martial arts event and I didn't know would we know that I didn't know he was a legit promoter or not he seemed really cool he knew some cool you knew some people that I know and he was he had he wanted to do the show and he was gonna involve me in it and that you know then he came down to my school and and after one class he's telling me the next day I fucking loved it man I trying old a couple guys like wait a minute first day em yeah it was yeah so please comes natural to me and I thought shit maybe I shouldn't go into business with no exactly so right there I was like I gotta back out yeah this motherfucker lying about jujitsu he'll lie about everything else and so they came a time where I had to sit him down you know but it was ugly not icky come another Joe a nice Joe and I were ever since we were like we've known each other at 28 and we just be talking and like I'd say something I bet yeah you know I don't know I do yeah I thought whatever it might be like I tapped him out and I'm like not really you know whatever we'd say what do you tell a little white lie cuz you just didn't you just it's convenient and I you have to walk it back you're like mad didn't happen it's a weird thing when people make shit up though yeah he was a kung fu champion travel to Okinawa fought everyone heard knock over there was a fight a lot of those guys when I first opened up 10th planet this is 2004 there was a girl that trained there and she just started training that she was like a CrossFit that checked she was like buff and she just started she was like six months into it and she starts telling me that she tapped one of my purple belts and she's 105 pounds I don't want people to have like a false sense of security in jiu-jitsu you gotta know you you can't if someone if you sometimes when you go with the kid you let him take an armbar I mean you'd ladder when they're kids yeah but when they're adults if you do that to them they're gonna actually think they really tapped you they're not gonna know some of them some of them will say oh he left me he's be learning he's going like he'd left me he's going like some will go fuck I'm tapping these motherfuckers out fuck yeah and this girl totally thought that well I remember when I first learned man I was a little confused I was like what's happening here am i actually tapping this person this isn't making sense I figured it out pretty quick and the girl called me the girl called me and said hey listen I'm excited I just won first place in my division and second place in absolute call me not gonna tell you what's up cause she was so excited she won first place in her division and second place in absolutes how many matches do you think she won 2-0 Oh what did everybody forfeit she had one match in absolute and she lost scene win cuz acting like she wanted lottery there was a girl so it's crime and shit there's it going one I think like did she say an American Idol alright some people do that like Delta I went on a date with a girl and she was weird we went on a date I was like this is weird this did since she was just weird just a little saying and then I get a call from her a year later and she goes um make sure you watch it was like I feel like the practice doesn't make sure you watch that why she goes um because my hands are in it and I put like I I push a door I'm not kidding and I go I go I start laughing yeah well my hands are my hands are you'll see my hands like I'm just calling my friends Tom because that's like my first TV I go I go you got to get out more are their hand actor oh yeah I got more she goes why don't I go you can't like that how go you can't tell people that you can't do they have my old family watching what he's like mine's my first time in to be a girl it's not your hands because I guess Glenn Close somebody was gonna push the door but they used her hands instead you can't tell me which was so excited she's a good person be good yeah tell people that you can't tell them because they're gonna think it's weird and some people just don't have a gauge maybe for how we're it might be a big deal to them though you know like you're on all these big game shows not a big deal if she comes from a small town she's like those are my a huge part of a huge part of success is knowing when you suck and when you're good that's not a matter of sucking or good in honor of its not being that important a moment but my likes you she thinks maybe you'd want to see her oh that's my friend Alice's hands know every one baby or maybe she was trying to reconnect I know I was number 78 she was a well-read handsome gentleman with a real six-pack without her rear and she was trying to fuck she likes strains whittled down wrists and hey pokey wrists designed being a difference man the only difference is you're better at being a person than you were when you were 32 or 22 or yeah stuck in your way no you better be a person you're better at doing it with like the least amount of fucking stress and what's more friendlier in life what's better but at the end of the day you're just a person it's all the same shit did he have what is that obliques there's a 6-pack root or Santa Cruz when guys pull their sweat pants down totally normal it's a weird thing that you know it's kind of grown I think it's gonna go the way the bell-bottom personally it doesn't correct yeah I guess no one shows it now guys are still slinging it the game fat dick I wanna let you guys know I co-opted that's my term dick root I invented that shit you know my boy Bret Ernst says that guys got a good route it's impressive route that's a different thing itself he's talking about the route is the base like the bottom of the tree bro like where the logos good things are clear that he's got a Macbook being clear on the right there well you know there's skyping them in man that's the difference between like ESPN from decades ago and now people don't give a fuck think about how many YouTube videos and people watch that are all going shit they don't care they want the information I wanna hear Cormier talk what's going on I find CNN I think he needs good production Washington Post he's he's gonna defend his Mexican brother DC vs. Francis would be fuckin crazy ee DC wow really I don't bet against DC unless he says no I don't it's hard a bet against and gah know that guy really hmm I mean you could tell how much stronger John Geoghan usually Cain throws people around but he couldn't throw this dude come on came from 2000 to be honest ready John would beat friend let me tiny Star Jones yeah John's on another level the thing about if he give DC fought Francis DC would not you know he has more options he's healthier than Cain is right he's got more options in terms of the way he moves 40 also yes but also he's got success at heavyweight against IPE he's won the Strikeforce Grand Prix I mean through knock down every day look he was a fuckin tank man he was a tank when he was in Strikeforce and 205 you know it may very well be that he fights at his best at heavyweight I like to draw a heavy weight because DC is alright heavyweight gonna cut way up we've never seen John a heavyweight I don't want to see the mat light heavy we've seen how that works out just not it would be a phenomenal fight at heavy heavy weight Henry big but this guy at heavyweight this is that's the scariest one I find John scarier boom I find John's here you think it'll be like a DC avenging his brother's loss oh there it is gonna be sometimes ended up but DC's gonna retire in March he says he turns 40 which Dana's might shut you for this time thanks Jamie if they keep couple once a so here's your money pulls out this John wait here's Brock who's John or here's Frances DC to me impress it like just from his stature is the most impressive fighter to ever step in the Octagon in terms of what he has to work with as far as being five nine five ten feet taller than that he's I think he's 511 I see at least five years a 510 let's give it a 5/10 no but you're righties below six feet tall and knees and shoulders are narrow and just tastes defeated except for John Jones it's astonishing is he slows down today we could find out right oh you but you the google doesn't count for height and weight it's so we put shake on it six five you can wear high heels zip up Carmen at six five he's six - um shaker I'm pretty sure it's like you know is probably the shortest Heavyweight Champion the history of the sport all right oh he's a hologram right there look at the dough in Ghana well that'd be nice and steady and this is keep mom in Ghana base like 10 times more muscular than that dude and God it was a real true unusual person oh shit snap you just want the I don't give a fuck bout to college basketball yeah I don't care though it's weird though when you see these at my understand it when you see these athletes like them like LeBron James who's like a clear top of the food chain freak when you see one of those guys you you see more of those guys in things like basketball football clearly right what do you mean more you mean all of them all of them right what are the numbers so it's not all but what do you think it means being honest yeah yeah freaks where the freaks in the NBA everybody has the base frame and be hey let's just add them all let's go there you guys are free in a line let's go all three together Bob how about your boy put your corn Fred Fannie Brett brought to San Diego who's that Jackie Joe Clemens 9 ok that gigantic gentleman is from another gene pool fuck it's super nice guy he's skinny right now oh she's like the worst dot you've ever seen it every day this is crappy example because this is a hitting each other all day long different sport they're tackling well you know what I mean there's ups fries freaks and bolts just herschel all there are freaks in them be a busy one freaks you the Greek reduce down the freaks to guys that are just throwing balls there's some freaks in every different beast right there guys with the ball there's nobody tackling him against a guy that where there's people trying to kill us the nature the sport as far as pure athletic ability MBA has the biggest freaks in the world Wow tallest guys Louis you have these specimens to stand out in almost every sport right and Brock Brock Lesnar is a great example that what basketball play can fuck with Ray Lewis name one well hey and if you did decathlon of all the athletes from NBA NHL no no I don't I'm a football guy they're MBA beats all of them in terms of like yeah like speed jump know everything you're doing it's basketball but okay so let's just say dominating another man but let's just say let's just let's just say let's go let's go NFL let's go and be a UFC just narrow it down to those three C's wait what what are the right but what are the percentages of real freaks like the brock lesnar type freaks in the NFL and NBA yes who gets the most who get that most NFL and what is that like they're all get down to the UFC did ten percent or you're a freak because unusually hugely unusual and every faceted like well you look at a LeBron James you let I mean fill in the blank there's there's a guys I'm Jordan there if we get all that the fuck no State Warriors the Greek freak yeah yeah I mean 6-3 you know the height is important in basketball because in basketball for sure but I mean it's not a fight in football too well you know when talking about fighting football is a way more violent encounter and people that would like be probably better at fighting would be drawn more of a freak to be in that more of a violent sport that's a bright and export especially to be like super competitive every bit well here's the other thing too it's wait there's way more on the lawn I got it's way more on the line in regards to physical punishment exactly but that's love it cuz you're willing to run into a wall or punch it does it doesn't mean that that's how you're any separate rule but we need super athletic guys to survive in this but here's the thing so important in the UFC ain't going on there's not enough money but here's the thing well none of those guys are trickling over they're not in the UFC why would they trickle over the Joe well because they think that David education ants at controlling their destiny fighting than they would if they think 20 years colliding with people all the time in the football field the thing about colliding with people is like I really feel like certain guys like look at Ryan Bader's last few fights I mean they were talking about this yeah they were talking about this in the Bellator broadcast like yeah the guy barely got hit and like three fights he's won the heavyweight Grand Prix one punch against world-class competition like I don't know that's good question a picture he made shit a lot of money football player like 10 million years right but the thing is like he controlled his destiny in these encounters which I don't think you totally can in football but said that but still Ryan Bader the money he makes and the longevity and all that is a fraction where the NFL aren't being fined a percent so you might you the most famous guy in the world but there's the guy who's the third string quarterback on the San Diego Chargers who makes more money exactly no you're right I'm a hundred percent way third string third string stuff they only carry two and then by these days it's just an exaggeration wouldn't you rather be the guy who controls his own destiny like the thing about well because for every guy sorry Jose right for every guy that controls his destiny a lot of those guys are fucked over mmm do you have a penchant to in the air well yeah well cause deformation right there's a blueprint pop on her high school I'm good I get a college education I'm good I get dropped in he made a $150,000 flat and then he made taxes that's what do you think upon us yeah what do you think he made with his sponsors and shit cuz you can belt or you can do this bomb let's say made $250,000 all tall told 100 grand hmm Wow it's about it huh he's a world champion yeah he's a double champ yeah yeah he's a world champion light heavyweight and heavyweight over there that's a weird thing right though world champion thing it's almost like no one should be able to do this remember they try to do that shit with fade or they try to give him a Momo they gave him the the way my world the way my championship was that they invented Obama and everybody was like why did you call it hey were you when you were watching croak up last night I thought are they gonna do crow got paid or did that run through your mind it's crow cops first fight belt so I went I bet they can do setup right I'd watch this shit if they both sit and that's that's where I'm at with those guys right like if they still want to do a cop obviously I don't want to do maybe you talk about well it'd be hard I would really want to talk to some it was Joey Joey and Yoel was great because I knew Joey in a new Yoel like when Joe and Yoel were together Joey was like translating back and forth that was great but I would have to really know someone real well who spoke Russian friend any Russian spies count be dead Callens got some connections meet by we got to go to the beach and pick up a bottle with a message they say faders favorite place there's Red Lobster and it's favorite clothing stores Abercrombie curves I find fascinating likes that smell I'm plus some pretty faces on the label come after me Starbucks out there just straight Starbucks Starbucks gun to your head you go on in one store nor shoes yeah it's conspiratorial you got a Bloomingdale's you've been there jeans I went in there to buy my wife some jeans like god dammit these motherfuckers a former business sheet well good but you know what I want before this podcast you're less of a human no it's okay it's okay yes I won't talk to you guys you hate me for what you know I want I want one one example idea of why we should believe the earth this flag as long as it's a joke and it's funny I'm gonna get angry dude it's not fun I'm not married to that it's right if it's joke I'm not married to it junkie convinced me that it's flat there's no way I could do that God really there's not one example takes about a year and a half here and a half this to my very hard on internation so strong you look at your son's cartoons it's all space I look at all my shit all the shit my son likes his everything is there research on this currently a space I want to direct everyone to hash tag spaces fake I've been doing research that's being fake is that real that's a real site yeah a hash tag spaces fake is something I'm investigating for my next hour yeah I'm for legitimately looking deep into what space this is not very organized no what I'm saying is I got everything I couldn't have it all wrong no I know but anybody that thinks the earth is flat they totally don't believe what we're taught about what's above us so the fake they run the Sun they mean all the stuff information we're getting you're lying about that shit that it's not that it doesn't exist of course it exists we see right of course but space is fake sounds ridiculous like this I'm looking at it and it's it's fake that's ridiculous means that all the information we got about overall lights in the sky yeah something like their lies their lack their lines why would NASA lie and there's a reason why we tell you but you guys don't want to hear give us a like the the cliff notes he doesn't need to be let's here just some few of it if their goal has always been for the most powerful Emperor's is a one-world government always wanted a one-world government all the Roman emperors they try to figure out they try to do different combinations how about it and they would fall and they would a new emperor would come and go you know what I'm gonna fucking world domination Lister I'm not gonna let my soldiers get married that way we'll have a stronger army they have different philosophies everyone believe different shit but they all wanted a one-world government there's no way to have a fucking one world government if nobody's into that shit right not even other rulers from small countries like one world government that's gonna put me out of a job fuck your one-world government people don't know shit about politics don't want a world government there's no way you're gonna sell the one-world government it's impossible the only way the only way to make a one-world government work is to have the people embrace it they have to want it cuz nobody wants it so the trick is to make to make people want it to embrace it there's only one way I gotta pee there's all along oh this is very missus I know this okay I don't know the only way and they've known this forever the Vatican knew this the Vatican the Pope wanted to rule the world they all knew it but they couldn't do it they all knew it but they knew one way but there's no housing iron man the only way is if there was some extraterrestrial threat from up above us that would be the only way to have everyone embrace the one-world government they all knew that for year this didn't work the plan they could never City Brando dad they didn't have the technology 500 years ago the Vatican knew about it they wanted it and you go to the Vatican you see eighteens that paintings of like everybody follows with aliens in them and back when I used to believe in UFOs but before I figured out that UFOs were they want us to believe in UFOs they're preparing us for a fake alien invasion that's always been the plan a one-world government the only way to do it is to get us to embrace it and the only way to embrace it is from an alien attack Ronald Reagan talked about it many times at the UN CFR he talked about a cause wouldn't it make he looked at all the leaders of the of the nations of the world and said we're gonna make our lives easier if we just had some you know some kind of extraterrestrial threat he said that shit he said that in front of the UN wouldn't oh like he's trying to get everybody into energy I don't think he ever said no no he said that many times it was vice president right he was talking about and there's many videos of him saying we're what lies before us he's in front of the nation doing a State of the Union address saying what lies before us is the opportunity to forge a new world order a world an order because he's talking about like a think that means the the space is fake yes no no no no no when people ask me why would they fake space it's always been about a fake alien attack you can't have a fake it never falters never took care of the fake an attack without space but I've never heard that politician you have that space first so they always you know who promote its space more than anybody who want artsy's Nazis Russians before the Nazis you know can sex know the Mayans the Vatican they have all the biggest they have all the astronomers they're all Jesuit Vatican's all of them all the ones that are giving us this information about space they all come from the Vatican the Vatican has the most the Vatican set up here with the name of the most powerful yes do you know what it's most powerful telescope the Vatican and you know what name it is I've done the research on YouTube I got jokes but do you notice in the maze one and chilling the most fellow powerful telescope in the world it's in the Vatican you know the one service that falls loser stick and ball I've never seen this fucking town yeah it's legit dude I think the biggest ones in Chile I think they have to be in high altitude yeah I don't think it's in the Vatican so when people ask me why would they fake all this shit but I don't think that's the biggest telescope it's just a crazy theory I'm trying to I'm just it's certainly these funny theory but Eddie these new chill a very large array telescopes that they're creating are fuckin gigantic and they take over enormous pieces of land those very large array it's called none it's called the very large silica telescope I watch the documentary with you at your house it was like 2001 and I say in five years yeah I'm gonna but they're putting their it's a documentary about them putting together the very large telescope in Chile and they're talking about by the Year 2005 we're gonna have this we're gonna have three telescopes linked with a computer to make us we're gonna see further into space than ever before none of that shit came what are you talking about nothing sure can is that up there's a very very large array up yet no telescope but I know they have they have them in Hawaii we said it weird isn't it weird that every space documentary all this series I had them all gel atom all we watch them all the time I try to remember all the shit about a neutron star and a super hypernova I was balls to you Joe we're balls deep in space and every now and then we'd watch this documentary after documentary Morgan Freeman at the universe we had a shoe that shit I DVR'd all that shit anything that's at space will smell is long long I thought it was better than people at you cuz I knew so much about space and every now and then I'd watch all that shit and wonder and wondered what this is all cartoons Eddie wanna listen so hard and then I go okay whatever whatever and then I keep watching all DVDs on space are all CGI there's nothing real and everyone watches out they believe it the narration is all programming what's above us and what we're on we're being lied to once you go flat you never go back there's the one thing I want to say okay it's like it's not that we believe something ridiculous and you don't you're you don't believe it we're gullible we're gullible we believe some weird shit about the flat earth we believe some weird shit you don't believe it you're smart it's not about that it's about we actually don't know what we're honor we always say that we don't know but based on all the shit that we got by the mainstream we don't believe that here's what I do believe that I so it's not that we believe something crazy and you don't because you smell it the bullshit is that microphone use a cell phone right it's science hold on I believe in that sign I believe in it okay why do you believe in that and why don't you
