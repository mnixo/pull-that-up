the girag and experience brothers and sisters lovers and children Brian Redman and Eddie Bravo are in the building hello much respect to the Korean zombie Eddie Bravo's wearing a Korean zombie shirt and what this means for you non MMA people there's a guy named Chan Sung Jung who's the they call him the Korean zombie that's his nickname and this weekend on Saturday night at the UFC against Leonard Garcia he pulled off the first twister ever in the UFC and the significance of course is that Eddie Bravo our guest today actually invented the twister setup this setup the setups yes the finishing move no and you call the wrestling mode the people used to finish people within wrestling you can but did they do it your way with the S grip on the forehead I thought that was all like your your innovation to turn into submission no no no people were crying I don't know if they were cranking it exactly the way I crank it but I'm pretty sure you had you seen other people get submitted with it before you ever started doing it we would like to in high school I wrestled a couple years and then I wrestled in Santa Ana high and in 9th grade a guy named Jesse Barrios and another guy his buddy is the one who showed me I can't remember his name I couldn't even remember it for my book but Jesse Barrios is his friend Santana high school 1985 if anybody out there is from that there's Jesse Barrios friend the other leg rider on that wrestling team fuck I don't know what his name was anyways he showed it to me and both of those in in wrestling leg riding is for weak people and all that means is is we need we're so weak we need to use our legs a lot more than the big strong dudes who are wrestling and and hitting the weights and had big chest and shoulders those guys really didn't rely on their legs as much as the weak guys like me I would skip rest weightlifting practice I was in the back of her house I was I was weak even back then I was a terrible athlete I've never been a great athlete so how to rely on using my legs and I thought you know they came to me Jessie came to me and I go dude you'll be perfect for this you know because they knew I just get out just get smashed if I try to go up heads up with people so it's a pinning in that I learned in wrestling and I got I got pretty good at it I would that was my shit even in high school that was my that was the thing I always tried I got some cool hair stories that maybe one day I'll uh I'll talk about him but I have some cool wrestling stories but anyways I sucked at wrestling I only had one takedown two fucking years I sucked so I just totally relied on leg riding and and using it's actually called the guillotine it's actually not called the twister it's called the guillotine but when I started doing it in jujitsu Higgin Machado and Jean Jacques Machado we just call it the twister because the guillotine already existed there's a lot of people out there that that think that I'd like took this wrestling move and I said I'm gonna try to fool the world and change the name and say I invented it there's thousands of people that think that it's hilarious in my books from day one I I you're being a little bit modest because you invented all these setups and turned it into a very high percentage finish yeah yeah there's a lot of setups from a lot of different places yes where it became I mean doing that none of that stuff existed but this is the transition so I ended up quitting wrestling the work the work the work the work ethic you need to be a good wrestler or something that is just not in my body chemistry I was not made to work really hard physically I I just I hated work regular jobs I knew that's why it was all about rock stardom or or playing football it was I just wanted to be like a famous dude who just played for a living and got paid and was a fucking adored by everybody that's what I wanted I didn't want to work I hate of course who doesn't know my god what worked like actually like killed me inside so it drove my art stick side so once I realized that Mexicans don't play football I'm like oh my god I was in ninth grade and I was the slowest motherfucker out there and and now that was it you know I had these dreams of playing football or making any music the football was crushed in ninth grade once everyone starts growing you know what Junior All American and peewee football that's fucked up I played offensive lineman and middle linebacker in football I actually thought I was going to be a defensive lineman and a middle linebacker because when you're 18 you're 9 everyone's the same size and you know you did some brainwash going on that really thought I was gonna be a football player I really thought I was until ninth grade shit oh man when when I was in sixth grade I was supposed to make the football team because in my neighborhood in my neighborhood I was pretty I was a pretty good football player around Mexicans from like a really poor neighborhood I was pretty badass but when you go to school when you go when I went to sixth grade and in junior all-american you know football peewee football was pretty that was pretty good but once people start growing and start changing in sixth grade I would the sixth grade I didn't make the football team they cut me I was so embarrassing but it was flag football it wasn't tackle so in my head I'm like wait till ninth grade when I get to high school I'm gonna play some tasks I'm gonna show you what the fuck's going on so that's what I was thinking that I go fuck this year fuck since sixth grade so seventh grade I transferred myself to a far a school far away that I only went to because there's another store there's more stores well III was driven away from my junior high school so I went to another school I tried out for the football team in the seventh grade I could again but it was flag football but I was so embarrassed that I told I told my friends growing up all my kids I told them that yeah I made the team second string quarterback but you know what I got in a fight so they had to cut me man it sucks I told the kids that I grew up with thought I made the team but I got cut because I got in a fight with a dude that's a I kept that going that's so I was so embarrassed that I didn't make the team I was so embarrassed and then in the eighth grade one of one of my the guys that I grew up with went to that school too he made the team he was awesome I didn't make the team again he never brought up the fact that he never asked anybody didn't he make the team last year that never got brought up they never humiliated me maybe they were talking behind my back like like I don't know I no one ever brought it up but I did lie about it and I'm coming clean with it now I totally lied about it don't you think for dudes that competition like that any kind of competition whether it's football or wrestling or anything is it so important for kids and their growing up to know how hard it is if you really want to get good at something Mexicans listen if you're Mexican and you think you're gonna be a football player look at reality listen to me liquid reality there's not that very much there's one Mexican anyplace quarterback you think you're gonna be him get out of mat get out of football get that shit out of your head if you're Mexican unless you got some tall motherfuckers in your family there's a couple Mexicans out there but Cain Velasquez could easily easily MIT as a for Maine maybe you think maybe dude that coach there's a lot more than just being an athlete everybody's an athlete in football you gotta have some serious skills and serious magic you could have just been a really strong athletic guy there look at Matt Mitrione mean strong and athletic match material is a fucking athlete right you know he didn't so do you think that if those guys came over to the UFC those super athletes those NFL dudes do you think that like that's what we're seeing was like John Jones cuz that's the talk that you know John Jones has two brothers I believe that are playing football right now I mean yeah that's incredible I mean he's John Jones is he's a super athlete and there's there's dudes that are super athletes that are in maybe other sports and we're starting to see him in the UFC that's like a big topic of discussion like what how much of a difference does like serious athleticism make it makes a huge challenge has been a fucking doing he's been doing mixed martial arts for only three years before that he was a wrestler you know I mean that's incredible we're gonna you know what it's already happened in boxing just look at what happened with boxing culturally yeah look what happened it's interesting though that football and it's I guess it's just where the money is that the the high money ones like football and bass they get the best athletes yes I mean even though the UFC has been around now for you know since 93 it's not been like a real accepted you know a mainstream thing but for like the last five or six years right wouldn't you say yes yes you know it's it's the super athletes that start jiu-jitsu early wrestling their whole lives and striking early they put it together like the Ruffo brothers yes it's the best athletes did start off like the rough Oh brothers you know I mean it's some people can start off with jiu-jitsu and wrestling and striking early and achieve so much physically from it but still they weren't born with the athleticism you know I mean you got to be unnatural it's got to all come together you got to have all the pieces together to make it in the big sports that we see today like foot you can't start start playing football when you're 22 and make the NFL if you do that it may have happened once or twice some African guy I don't know it may have happened why not I mean you know one of them matumbo McKenna Bay guys that started playing basketball first it's 18 months and he's in the NBA you know what I'm saying every now and then you get those freaks but generally 98% of the time look at what's going on with all the sport they just go and find that dude and say hey you want to play basketball I don't even know I'm just one of those dudes I'm sure Manute Bol come be matumbo I can't even say his name but one of those dudes I'm sure started playing basketball Nate do you imagine what it must be like living like Manute Bol it's like you're living in doll houses everywhere everywhere you go there doll houses everyone's building is built for dolls you have to hunch everywhere you go not naturally for girls for girls taller guys naturally the taller you are the more attractive you are naturally but what what exactly what size six eight six seven does it become a turn-off to girls because there must be a turn-off point or are they turned on by guys that are seven foot three do that there's a guy a girl look at a guy seven four three and it's totally attracted only seven foot three so rare I love them so much or is it like mmm that's too tall I don't like of that tall it's ridiculous yeah you know what I mean what is it well they would also worry I think evolutionarily about that is this real that a real word about the baby getting too big inside of them and get stuck coming out of their pussy and just blow it all out if you got a 7-foot 3 dude you imagine how big his fucking babies are if it's half his baby you know you've got a 15 20 pound baby inside your hooker you know what I will say this though I am not attracted to like that I'm not attracted or real tall chicks I'm just yeah that you know and especially when they get fucking ridiculous if a girl six foot one usually they gotta be they gotta have really pretty faces and then usually their bodies start to get out of whack I mean it's just like but I have looked at big tall ass chicks and when you see them in public the thoughts will raced around my like damn that'd be nice just to pump a load into her and see what my baby would see my boy would turn out like you know how do I be of that fuckin kid you know what I mean he's six foot three and that's my son and you imagine he's six foot five and that's my son and he's eating ask Todd Duffee looking dude oh can you imagine that's what you look for in a girl that's how you who cares what she looks like two conversations of the same you imagine that's how you found girls that's like how you went to go date girls just by looking at them it has a mother to a child like a super athlete like you ugly Wudi that's what that dude who Zulu remember Zulu the guy who fought Hicks and Gracie yeah he has this story about the way he described it was a large negress and that he knew that she would make great babies for him so he found her and he described like like what he did like how he shot lows into her to make to make a boy that he knew that the way he was doing it was definitely to make a boil you had some method and then Zulu came out do that what pace a great story I would pay 50 bucks right now if you said I got the DVD the documentary of that I go I'll give you 50 bucks that I would even go 75 bucks but I'd go your your dance a lot but goddamn it but I'll still pay for that's an awesome story you imagine how much of a pain the answer must be if you're a kid and your dad was some fighter and you're supposed to be a fighter to you like god damn really I can't just have fun I can't just go hang on no I gotta go in a fight oh shit or like losing like his son his son didn't really seem like you wanted to be doing that right you know I mean it's almost like I mean you almost have to if your dad is Zulu you know your daddy's a famous guy who got a bare-knuckle cage fight with fucking Hicks and Gracie back in the game maybe he maybe he wasn't into any kind of God just like you know what I I don't want to work a regular job I got a name I can actually write but he did do jujitsu though he was alright at you consider like a purple belt back when he fought so yeah he was doing jujitsu so in a weird way Zulu like jujitsu beat Zulu but Zulu son was into jiu-jitsu that's pretty cool right yeah yeah do you remember that Hickson gracie footage for those who don't know Hickson versus zulu is one of the very very first like no rules fights you know that was like where they planned it out they had a whole arena full of people in Brazil checking this out and a young Hicks and Gracie he was like 18 I think he was a representative of jiu-jitsu fought this giant super athlete black dude named Zulu this guy's just yoked he just just slamming them and Hickson eventually gets his back and strangles them and it's one of those all-time great videos where people watch it like jiu-jitsu guys back in the day it was like this is proof man this is proof like look if you get a good jiu-jitsu you can overcome a guy like this like and you're easily 18 it was like a big fucking deal and the footage is so bad but it looks cool it's like 50th generation all that footage it's dudes taping it off VHS somehow it got the DVD and then a copy and it already started off as terrible footage now it's like like silhouetted kinda it's like a yellow and black and orange type thing but it's classic coolest things that I ever got out of being famous was I got to have dinner with Hickson dad Tom I wanna close things out oh man I had dinner with Hickson and then we went over his house and we watched fights and he broke down what dudes were doing wrong he was watching Mario Sperry fight and Colosseum and he was just talking about space he's just talking about no space I give no space he was talking about so like it's such an intense dude you know like he was talking about you know like his philosophy on juju it's very simple we start at zero and from zero we're going to one and we're not going back to zero and then from one we're going to 2 from 2 to 3 to checkmate that's where we're going to go I was like god damn you get the chills talking to me like I'm sitting here talking to X n motherfucking Gracie and he's giving me like some intense life philosophy on how he strangles dudes you know he's like he's into it you know we're we're watching all these fights he's breaking the shit down and he would watch the Funaki fight with him and for knocking those Hickson fights man god I wish there were more of them so annoying man so annoying that you don't get to see the the best supposed representative ever of jiu-jitsu at the time fighting those guys you know finding all Mark Coleman's and you know all the fucking guys that everyone was scared of mark Kerr and all that shit how fascinating one that a bit man yeah fuck that would have been awesome damn that would freak me out it really would it would freak me out to sit and hang out with hex embraces he's cool as fuck that would freak me out he's a super nice guy is his son is cool so nobody else in jujitsu yeah yeah like Hickson you know what I mean marcelo garcia to me marcelo garcia is the number one jujitsu guy that's ever lived I think marcelo garcia is the number one guy that's ever lived you know but Hickson wood is the most mystical and rock star ish yeah you know what I mean he's like motherfucker was not Incredible Hulk you know the vision of the Incredible Hulk with Ed Norton when Ed Norton is learning how to calm and control himself kicks and Gracie's slapping him in the face that's that's the man I would freak out if if if with me and Hickson what you're sitting there talking to jiu-jitsu I mean it's not out of the question that might happen in the future for sure it might am I not I would love it I would that would be a fucking dream of mine to hang out and talk to Jitsu and break down with the core the people who don't know the history Eddie Bravo tapped Hickson's brother Hoyle er in Abu Dhabi in 2003 and this giant upset when Eddie was a brown belt and he caught him with a triangle so there's like is perceived animosity sometimes because of that but there's none exist you've never been anything but respectful of any of those guys you know it's just there's I know that they were trying to do some sort of a rematch with you and Hoyle er but uh yeah yes that was what what happened is a promoter called or emailed me last mmm October right October or November and it was a guy that I've done privates for I know who is and he's really high up in jujitsu in the Middle East in Abu Dhabi and they're putting together they were putting together a noogie World Championship in Abu Dhabi they never had a noogie one they're doing gay World Championships out there but the noogie ones they wanted to have one in April and they asked me if they wanted to have me and Hoyle er as a super match but they never contacted him they told this is what happened then I emailed him back and I'm like you know me I'm down to rematch Hoyle or anytime I've always been down I've never been the one denying it I want one more match I want to try
