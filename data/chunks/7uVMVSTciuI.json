the girag and experience so I love it when your song was released and then it was destroying the charts for TLC and then you gave you TRL to your hero and then did you forced to get rid of yes I was forced to for 98 degrees that whole thing was it's a very uh it's a very uh you know there's a desert there's a little bit of intrigue here ya know that went behind the story because there was you know some some things done TRL that were not necessarily ever made public right like okay well filming on the whole detail what happened what happened like the L story the l and TRL isn't necessarily right it's not necessarily live all the time so it was just not on anymore no but was the song what was the song what happened okay so we went to Seattle and we were filming bits in Seattle and we thought hey this would be funny to do this song called the bum bum song my favorite songs ridiculous idea and I would go and it was just a silly video of me going around Seattle saying my bum is on the cheese my bums on the rail my bums on the boat my bums on the duck it was a silly sort of like a dr. Seuss style and right here I'm rap and and in the comedy of it was me out the street sticking my ass on everything and confusing people and filming the reactions right and singing the silly song and then we played it on my show and we said we want this to go to number one on Total Request Live which is you know their countdown music show that they would have every night hosted by Carson Daly and so we played it on Seattle radio and it went to number one instantly this was when my show was on MTV it was it was a really doing well show on empty the show was doing well in MTV people went to number one people saw the absurdity of this song knocking 98Â° Britney Spears in sync and whoever will tell swooz on the JLo I think out of the out of the number one spot and so we went we played on the show we asked people to vote for it people voted for it it went to number one on Tuesday okay the show I think aired on Monday it went to number one on a Tuesday this is the song remember this year this was like fucking a huge hit yes song was there and this was the first uh song to be like this was right when mp3s just started so it was the number one downloaded song that year I thought uses I think 14 way down low to the three no it was that it was no no this was not 99 to 2000 2000 99 so what happened so they squashed your song yeah it went to number one on Tuesday then on Wednesday when on Wednesday it was num number one again okay and then on Thursday it was number one again and then we get a call on Thursday at the office and they're saying guys um we want you to kind of play ball with us here and we're like well what's the deal he said well you know we need we need you to go on the show on Friday and retire the bumbum song and take it off the countdown and we're like why it's we got the number-one song in America I'm TV man Yeah right it's amazing right money off this this is unbelievable let's keep it number when they go well the thing is we pre taped the show next week his Carson's going to be in San Francisco and all this stuff so what kind of kind of like who we thinks going to be and we hadn't predicted you airing the show on Monday and it instantly going to number one so kind of screws up next week's pre tape which is all in the can so can you go on on a Friday and just retire it will give you like a retirement home plaque and the year I was on MTV and I had my show on MTV and I didn't want to get fired right everybody's already mad at me about all this other shit screaming at me all day about you know I want to suck milk out of a cow's udder because I think it'll be crazy let's put it on TV and they're like can't you can't do that you know we're arguing non-stop it was like it was a most stressful time in my life and that's saying something because I'm pretty stressed out right now too now right now but most of the time you know and so so I'm on the show and I'm getting yelled at all the time by everybody everyone's always screaming at each other trying to like you know make the show crazy or make it less crazy and then so you know I played ball I went and I got a nice plaque and you know what I'm not even to be honest with you not well yeah you know I think of it now I think you know we could have rode that thing a little further I could have put out record I probably could had you know had some fun with that but yeah that's what happened that's what happened that's that's interesting that's Fox you're fucked by the corporation's yeah exactly was it makes sense that it would probably cross them a fuckload of money if they'd already pre-tape things I there was a reshoot five shows it's like you know craziest and then now you find out what the rankings are like it's all they totally actually made them up it probably had deals with the record company like we need to push 98 degrees and here's $100,000 we need to be they do that probably it's that's illegal I mean they also dealt he did that hotel they did that I never heard any just making shit up no no I'm just throwing shit on the table everything I have they never did anything like that I think it was just basically was a very strange week and they'd sort of so if it wasn't for that week that song could have stayed on the countdown and we can I can't but you know I've told that story before I don't think anyone at MTV cares anymore about that I've done well why would they care that they fucked you you're the one supposed to care you could have got paid so it's out on you know I'm driving that fucking song right now yeah in the form of a red Ferrari yeah that's true I'm saying and it could be rolling with a big fat diamond encrusted watch yeah letting bitches know and they'd be like Tom Green how did you get so rich bumbum bumbum song you recording no it is already what the fuck son
