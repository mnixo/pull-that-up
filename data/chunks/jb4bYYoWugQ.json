the girag and experience so I'm playing with the idea of dark spiritual forces at work behind human history manipulating Moctezuma manipulating Cortez and plunging mankind into the sea of cruelty and misery and you know what redeems the story for me and does it at all times is that the human spirit still shines through even in the darkest times there is courage there is decency there is love people people struggle to show the best in themselves and and and and to deliver the best in themselves so I've tried to show both sides this this book is about the battle of good against evil and it's not that the Spanish are good and the Aztecs are evil because the Spanish were wicked wicked wicked as well and they did terrible things they fed people to dogs they they they burnt people at the state what is actually burning somebody at the stake if not a form of human sacrifice that's what the Spanish would do to their God they were sacrificing people to their God so no different from the Aztecs in that respect the level of sacrifice was so insane I I tried to explain it to a friend of mine and he he literally told me I was bullshitting when I told them that 80,000 people were sacrifice and were sacrificed a period of like what like four days four days with teams of killers 50 teams of killers working at the top of the Great Pyramid to process people within a minute or two process them to think of it that's how it's done it wasn't done on an industrial scale queues of victims stretching a mile in every direction marching up the pyramid and having their and having their hearts cut out and all of this in honor of of a demonic demonic entity which the Aztecs passionately believed in they believed that he needed to be fed human hearts and blood what did they call they called him Witzel Apostoli which means hummingbird at the left hand of the Sun he's the war God after whom this after whom this novel is is named and he the way the way I look at it the same demonic entity is manipulating both Moctezuma and Cortez he appears to Cortez in dreams and takes on the disguise of st. Peter he appears to Moctezuma as though as the Walker but is the same demon that's playing with men and that's one reason why I wrote this is a novel because you can't get into this stuff in a non fiction book but it's very real it's a very real part of human history and the whole shape of the world we live in today the the terrible genocide that happened in North America the destruction of the North American Indians the the conquest of Peru the whole relationship of the European powers to to Africa for example all of this was based on what happened in those years between 1519 and 1521 when the Spanish conquest of Mexico unfolded and and I think we would lead onto a dark track imagine how it could have been if those two cultures if the Spanish and the Aztecs had met one another in a spirit of mutual learning how much there was to exchange how much each side of the Atlantic could have learned from the other instead it becomes this kind of conflagration of of blood but it's difficult to place ourselves in the mindset of the people of that time it's difficult for us to do that today and I have to say when you look at the Spaniards I mean four hundred and ninety men turn up on the coast of Mexico in 11 ships and they are going to take on this empire that can put two hundred thousand men into the field that will if they catch you will march you up the pyramid and cut your heart out and many Spaniards were sacrificed in sight of their of their colleagues it was an extraordinary time it was an extraordinary event and men of those times were different from from men of today I believe what is the mainstream explanation for human sacrifice like what what do they believe started off well that it's that it's a feeding of psychic energy to supernatural beings that's what human sacrifice is about that you take the psychic energy of the individual you're going to kill you kill them take their psychic energy and feed it to these vampire like creatures that are lying in the beyond that that thrive on human misery and pain and you know who are we to say that such things do not exist we don't understand the nature of reality and if you look at human culture day I mean look at Wars look at wars that are happening in the world today look at the tens of thousands of people that are being slaughtered in warfare today that's also a kind of human sacrifice I think we have to consider the possibility that some kind of demonic force is thriving on this and and and being nourished by it and that's one of the things that we need to do as human beings is to separate ourselves from that and say no we will not do that we will not feed that energy we will not offer lives either the beyond I don't go with you on that but I do in a way I don't believe in demons but I do I think it's undeniable that there have been massive groups of people that have participated in horrific things so what is that is not demonic I believe it's I believe it's demonic I can't prove it I can't prove that that's the case I just think we should stay open to that possibility that the nature of reality is so complex and so multi-layered that there may be much more going on than we think and that if we just if we just confine our explanations of things to purely economic in material terms we may be missing part of the picture and that when the ancients spoke of angels and demons to use words I'm not saying that I believe in angels or demons as such but when they spoke of lot and light and dark forces negative and positive forces playing on that on the human race maybe they had something going maybe there was something to that well I always consider the fact that human beings have this incredibly broad spectrum of possibility it's incredibly broad spectrum of behavior and personality of circumstance of genetics and that there's this yin and yang of life there's this pull and push of life and that the extreme ends of it are good and evil good and evil yeah and and it's may not be a demon but it might as well be a demon if you're marching 80,000 people off the side of a pyramid and cutting their heart out with a fucking stone tool yeah that's demonic it might as well be might as well be a demon yeah and and and that is that is worth considering and the and the question is what is you know what is going on here I have a very dear friend called James Tiburon who refers to this world that we live in as a university of duality that we have that we have lessons to learn from Jew ality maybe duality is not the whole thing maybe there is an overarching unity and oneness in in all things but right now here in this incarnation on planet Earth we have to learn from duality and the thing about duality is human beings can choose we can always choose even in the most straightened and difficult circumstances we can always choose for the light rather than the darkness we can always choose for good rather than evil we don't have to take that act that causes pain and suffering to another human being we never have to do that we can always choose not to the alarming thing is that people often will choose the act that causes pain and suffering to others and we are defined by our choices and this is where we need to grow up as a species and start to choose start to choose the light
