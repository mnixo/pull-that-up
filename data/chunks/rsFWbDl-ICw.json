story show up so I'm flying him out after him with our cold okay I'm gonna do podcasted him with subtitles in Spanish then I'm bringing him up here on Friday what yeah mum please do it for me in Spanish with subtitles and then I'm gonna bring him up he on Friday and we're gonna have a three-way about Cuba Wow well it was like to rest on the whole thing if you don't mind wow you mind so I do mind about subtitles just for that bunion okay cool welcome or totally chaotic so no we will not clash with you dude the three of us together would be the greatest podcasters I could interpret you would be would be it would be a real heaven may you could really talk about on the hooks and to rush that's a fantastic straining in Cuba where they ship them cuz they ship you off when you're a young kid did a lot of people don't know yeah they look at your knitting oh hello cattle you don't have a choice they look again they go to us and Lucho at home that's it I mean they take in a certain age in their or they need to send you the Nicaragua or Russia and you train and that's why a lot of Cubans and Udo cos because they go to rush and learn judo wow so he's gonna tell you how they shipped them off they don't just tell your mom like would take them tomorrow that's it but it's always been interesting to me because the Cubans and the Russians in particular were always thought of as being very technical it's really the Russians Russians are super technical that was what a lot of people attributed George st. Pierre success in wrestling you know George didn't wrestle in college or in high school but he trained with a bunch of Russian nationals in Montreal and apparently phenomenal wrestlers they have this incredible wrestling program like when you see when you see nurmagomedov the way he malls people inside the Octagon like what in the fuck like that is like a perfect example of that like style of super hard super technical wrestling they're so good at it there's so many you see you know you see low mischenko used to be a wrestler there's a video low mishchenko looks like he's doing Sambo it looks like he's got like a Gyan and it's him and some other cat and he's like 11 years old or something like that so his father put him in everything his father made him do you know who Loma chenko is yes yes yes one of the best boxers ever like literally one of the most technically beautiful to watch boxers it's ever lived but this guy used to wrestle to like his dad this is a I don't think this is is it does him okay is this him wrestling with somebody yeah this is one now where he can still do this shit this is like pretty recent like he showed some of his wrestling moves but the other one was him when he was a little boy like he's really technical man he knows how to wrestle this is legit like can you see the way he's moving his body he's not faking that he's done that a bunch of times and yeah there's a this is one when he's a little kid man it's crazy it says greco-roman wrestling but they're wearing Aggie so I'm not exactly sure what it is but he gets his kid and gets behind him and sends him for a ride so he was he's always been an amazing athlete like in everything I think there's there's something to that there's something to his father had an idea it's a crazy idea his father took him out of boxing and put him in a dance for like several years a Ukrainian traditional dance style apparently they were talking about it on one of those HBO shows for like four years I think it was the HBO show but for four years I think he just danced you imagine that his father's like you want to learn how to box you got a dance and now nobody's got footwork have you ever seen him Joey yes you've seen like it was highlight reel yes it's a highlight reel because my daughter goes to ballet and 80% of the class is Russian so I was thinking about it yes that was watching the movements the last pair a movement I'm like Jesus Christ if people did ballet could you and I was taking GSP like you know me I'm like yes pre probably fucking done ballet would that would be it's great footwork this guy is the Wizard of footwork it's crazy because he's like right in front of you but he's one step ahead of you at every turn like he knows what you're gonna do right while you're doing it he's moving in a way that you can't move he's in front of you and then he's not it's crazy like he's the one of the most technical boxers I've ever seen just an amazing stylistic achievement like what he can do with his body his style is totally unique I mean everybody lot of guys have done it a lot of guys have moved in now a lot of guys have done it but he's doing it at such a high level such a high level that it makes people confused guys quit in their corner that like what in the fuck and I really think a lot of it probably had to do with his father's cross-training and particularly with the dance I mean think about how effortlessly he goes like steps around guys I mean he's got some incredible control of his feet but it makes sense that like you would learn how to move your feet in a specific way that weren't the way you weren't learned how to move your hands in a specific way right like think about a guy like Floyd Mayweather right his hand combinations with his upper body they're so precise yeah right but with his legs is he as precise as yes precise moving with his legs as is with his hands Rosie's 60% or 70% or 80% lomachenko is probably perfectly proportioned for his style with his ability to move but also also his ability to box and hit you well he's got both things going on at the same time with next-level angles so that's why I was saying fine when you're young in Cuba they picked you it's not like you wake up and go I want to be a wrestling no they look at you and go you look like he could go wrestle and like what I was hearing back from them in the early 70s was like they just took you away from your family did right that was part of your training you know you're then they put you in there go we didn't know you know where you trained them like their army have you talked to y'all about this good yeah well yeah like no we've discussed with this thing is I already have graphics on the podcast well so I figured that I put them up and we'll do a podcast in Spanish with fucking subtitles like an English film like a like a Giulini movie whatever one of those movies people think are unique okay because his English is too rough for me and I know what he's trying to say and the frustration in his face so now he did a tape the other day of him in Cuba waiting for biz being in Cuba he went is being went to Cuba No Romero's back what is the see if you can find it sees he's not he's nuts he's fightin Rockhold now which is a tremendous fight on the tensile right that's a crazy fight that's a crazy very good fight it's very good fight Rockhold when he's on is super dangerous you know when Rockhold made one slip up against Bisping but you know fair play to Bisping he he came to that fight regardless of where anybody ranked him you know like how they felt his chances were he came in swing yeah I was like I think yeah I'm like eleven days notice something like that what was how many how many days notice that Michael Bisping get when he fought Luke Rockhold I want to say it was something crazy low it wasn't much time Luke lock Luke Rockhold is very good he's a beast very very good his top came thanks Wayne let me tell you some I think when he fought Michael Bisping in my own idea I think his focus was a good little off maybe two in a way I think he was dating rock stars and hanging out in Hollywood I think he's not dating or whatever anymore no he's just fucking he thought when he beat branch he looked nice but his jiu-jitsu is great yeah he has great cakes he's great with his hands his movement him against your well is gonna be interesting let's skip vicious kicks man he's four and he's one right so Luke Rock Robles is number one I believe so yeah I think the whole ten door easy for ya it's a great fight and then you got jock arrays back in Johnson you know what's crazy like I always say to you like I don't mean to pronounce his name wrong and let him die alright like when he fought stiopa can da know who got home when he fought my man immigrant mentality like a motherfucker yeah he hits hard and all that stuff like that but now that dudes still gonna be more dangerous now he's gonna fucking take that loss man he's like a machine she's you gotta think how crazy it is that he went from being a guy who was homeless to five years later fighting for the heavyweight title this is like a total amount of training five years of MMA training fighting for the heavyweight title and he's the favorite he's the favorite over guy who's already defended it twice I mean it's crazy that's how talented he is that's how terrifying is that's how special he is but a loss like that to a guide like that like to a real champ like steep a is that once you realize we're the top of the game is there's another there's a few more things to learn there's a lot more days to get in and training but that guys just begun his just began he's been gone five years ago he didn't know shit he's way better now than he was two fights ago yeah I see the difference I see the difference in the way he moves when he fought over him it was since significantly different than when I saw him his first and second fights his first second fights he was very good it's very but just insanely strong he would hit guys with these combinations and clean technique to men he's like he's not just a physically strong guy he's also very smart because he's learning to do everything mechanically very good it's not like a guy who's only been striking for like three or four years so they look a little tight and weird but they could if they land they got a lot of power nah man everything is clean like besides from digging those trenches Jack oh dude I'm the type of work gets you tough he's just a special athlete if he keeps going man I mean boy that guy learning more to think about how little you learn in five years most of these guys have way more time in way more time in wrestling way more time in kickboxing the average guy by time he gets to the UFC I would like to know what the number is like how many years of training and competing they have but it's gotta be more than two like he was he was like right in the UFC and smashing people it's his amazing story man it's an amazing story and for a lot of people the way it ended is a good lesson for martial artists it's a good lesson see what even if you in Ghana fan you're bummed out that he lost I appreciate that I'm in Ghana fan fan too but I'm more of a fan of mixed martial arts I'm a fan of an honest like it's like I want to I want to know what it is like what what is this like what's this what's this contest right here what's what's actually going on here what's going on here is phenomenal athletic talent massive potential like super alpha athlete versus one of the toughest guys ever who's been in the game longer who knows more he's wrestled he's been fighting way more he's been in the trenches way more times he's at dig deep he knows what it's like to be really hurt and tired in a fight see I appreciate the strategy of like how do you go into fighting a guy like perfect it was like Rocky against mr. t yeah that's what exactly was like so it was like heart and fucking a little smart stay away from that punch it had to be and I haven't watched the full fight you know I was working then fucking stage my getting hit by Francis in Ghana MMA gloves yes it's a night worst thing to a person he's terrifying and steep a got cracked multiple times in that fight it sound like he didn't get hit he got cracked but he had made up his mind he was going nowhere he knew what to do he'd been there before that's like that's an incredible lesson just for the overall the the sport for the for mixed martial arts in general and the lesson is like he figured out like he had like the craziest end of video game character ever right and Ghana was like the big like at the big boss in a video game they're like fuck I got a flight I got to play against this guy that's in Ghana and steep a figured out how to beat him being 20-plus pounds lighter than him you know way you know way less intimidating in terms of his physical presence although steep it's pretty fucking intimidating but in Ghana's so intimidating he's so next level 265 natural giant crazy frame you look when you're next to steeper that's when you realize is too big fell on TV you don't look that big when you next to me like this guy's a big fuck he's a big fucker walking his asset is his mind oh Jesus yes I told you immigrant I listen American ingenuity is fucking brilliant and with the image of mentality mix like let's say you're still an American but your dad could have called you Steve no you can still call them steep and Miocic to remember where the fuck you came from you understand me his father came that's really weird like that you know I was on I almost called you Joe I hate calling it I almost called you to go when was the last time you watched Bronx Tale oh you know it's been on all week I watched it a year ago when he fucking finds him with the guns and he starts smacking the kids in the neighborhood I still remember people's parents smacking kids in the neighborhood Wow like people's parents come on what the fuck are you guys doing get the fuck home I won't kick got a kick to the stomach and the father points the other kid and nobody said dick nobody said dick dick no like I'm watching this Brian with a biker scene what was the laugh like I haven't watched Bronx Town 20 years it's on AMC he's eating this shit and lost here's the bikes is shit and he walks over oh okay nice like a gentleman yeah ain't no problem bit and also they do a thing and he walks up today I gotta leave no one now you can't leave and Calogero I thanked I named the Sun collage Errol who would do something like that that means just you want your son to have the immigrant mentality but when they throw that beat on the bike it's that's a true story present that's a true true story I would listen in the 60s you couldn't have long hair walk around the Bronx it just wasn't really yeah that hippie shit that didn't happen in the Bronx is so hot what if like a hippie was walking through the Bronx they called you dirty hair they insulted you they called you a bunch of shit and they threw a beatin on you well and it's hysterical because that scene so accurate because after the adults drew a beat anja then the neighborhood kids chased you like the young kids would sticks and that's what we do Wow you know like the little guys were chasing fuck once you were beat up but it took all your money it's a classic scene I was thinking about that I'll hear action I got a call Joe and ask him window at last and look at this look how bad to the bone that rather he stole the job whether he stole the scene or look at this you drive away I'm your man is timeless you got a late one I just tell him Sonny I always come together so get them around right yeah oh this is a great scene this is a great song I built a scene it's a perfect song right perfect song what he walks in it starts in the beginning to go to do go watch this is this gonna get us kicked off you know no as long as we talk over okay this is it right here [Laughter] [Music] there it is shuts the door I will never forget the look on their faces all eight of them their faces dropped all their cards and strength was drained right from their bodies they had a reputation for breaking up Boris they made a fatal mistake this is real Joe Rogan this was 1968 unfuckin Giroux man so this is a true story Jesus Christ this seems fucking brutal this is it this was when this was allowed [Music] this is craziness bro this was this was the Bronx in 68 69 and the neighborhood you know like the neighborhood would tell you hurry up the cops know people on the third floor would tell you we could see the cops from the third floor we could see the Bulls coming down the street you're like the whole neighborhood was in on it you know what's interesting to me like this is all from immigrants right yes it's all this was what because of not but this also movie is about him dating a black girl right and what that meant that to say I forgot how this movie was this movie's brilliant yeah shout out to Frankie Renzulli yeah um this movie is a genius movie look at this watch my car you know chance Palma Terry's great in this fucking this is it this was it this was it I forgot how good this is now see the young guys now that's us right what see what's going on now you take this guy we would fuck him up when you think about their one generation removed from people came off a boat let me tell you what the other side of this here here's the other side like all right the big thing was as we we came to move here I remember he would come to the store Frank star Mike star was your friend and he would come to the store there was a big room with that chest all these stories from him and put this together and there was like this little war going on but now from Frankie rents and Frankie was always the other good gentleman there was somebody else that was wrong that turned out to be somebody very big and but there's a story one time that a bike could do it all gravano money and your viola was hitting him and he fell off the sidewalk and broke his leg so Gravano one night went out and fucking did something like this I'm like with 20 guys they beat up a bike I don't know how true it was but I still remember being five like if I could think if you could put hit me with truth serum I I could go back from being 1968-1969 in the Bronx my daughter is five and my mother would send me from the dry cleaner that she owned to the corner where there was an Italian place that had slices and Italian ice and shit like that right like I was allowed to walk to the corner at Mercy savage on Tremont Avenue like I think about I was looking at my daughter I was watching Bronx I'm going oh different his time change like I was allowed to go to liquor store with a note and get my mother Marlboro Reds and bring him back in that neighborhood we didn't live there my mother just had a dry cleaning up there was a bookie numbers joint that's why we had the dry cleaner we were partners on the dry cleaner you didn't know that no that's why I got scars on my face I got bit by a German Shepherd as a kid those three by one of the eyes that's what we did when we came from cube I lived in 205 West 88th Street and after my father died my mother had a dry cleaner and that's a we were up we were up in Jerome Avenue and train bombing Grand Concourse and we had a dry cleaner and every every weekend that would go up there and I would sit there with the fucking I learned how to dry clean and had black Mike black Mike was the guy that I earned everything but he made the best spaghetti in the Bronx so even Italians came to be black Mike spaghetti really yeah this was uh I knew all that shit when I was a kid because when you have a numbers operation you have to keep moving it around right the cops can't so you have to every three or four weeks you have to move it around explain the numbers to people don't know that the numbers is the paramutual it's the last three numbers of the paramutual the track which is the amount of track made for the day so if the track made six hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred eighty-two thousand dollars a number for the days is 482 and it comes out as the Brooklyn number so there's three numbers of day in this Brooklyn the Bronx and New Jersey but what happened was that was a big business until the eighties - the lotto came out and the lotto cut that in half but before that that was all put a little different a little different immigrant neighborhoods all over New York City because his immigrants world want hope yeah you know we wanted that money to get that refrigerator and the stove and shit like that it's such a weird thing that they would gamble just two dollars a day remember two dollars a day wins you a thousand dollars yeah I can do a lot in 1975 with a thousand dollars with two kids my grandmother was obsessed with the numbers yeah she was obsessed and she would always have like a number in her head that she thought it was gonna be and it was like one off or something like that it was like these stories she would tell you what would you say that what can I say I was like five I just remember it very distinctly my grandmother who went to jail for running numbers in New Jersey she wouldn't she wouldn't rat him out so they put her in jail and so she made sweaters gave sweaters to the guards mrs. D she's the nicest thing did you feel like your grandmother at that time what did you think we didn't find out until I was probably like I wonder when I found out I think maybe I found out my teenage years I was like what what the fuck people would go to see her like where's uh I don't want to save my grandma's name out of respect but people would say you know where is she and oh she went to visit her her cousin or she wants to see her aunt and she's you know she was in the pokey for like six months I forget how much time I was but every time we go over those like some do excuse you New Jersey they put you in New Jersey they put you in jail for yeah I guess New York City they don't they give you a ticket you know they would give you like a ticket and shit in those days I don't know what it's like now this fucking limo you and Jeff will we'd known New York they have a fucking though my grandmother was one of the few people I've ever known who are legitimately thought they had intuition she says weird intuition she would do things it's real weird like when my mother was a kid there was a rainstorm I was like real bad rainstorm and for whatever reason my grandmother decided to wake my mother up take her out of her bed and bring her downstairs some crazy hunch she had the ceilings collapse like right above the bed where my mom's sleeping so like pieces of you know it wasn't a lot it was just chunks of plaster but like you know three or four pretty significant pieces of plaster fell off of the ceiling it was rain came through it the whole deal with the ceiling gave out somehow or another she had this idea in her head and it could be because she knew that the ceiling was fucked up and she knew it was raining or it was probably gonna give in anyway or she might have had intuition my fault everyone was always convinced it was intuition everyone's always convinced like she's a little bit psychic yes in North New Jersey shed a monkey named Chi Chi and she she would bite everybody but my grandma my grandfather made to keep the monkey in the attic you know my grandma was crazy she had a monkey he would open up packages of gum and chew gum know how or where the fuck she got it I'm telling you my grandma was Kris and the Italian people had butchers in those days and they get you anything she kind of gave a pigeon she kept a monkey in the house man do you understand how crazy you remember the monkey yes Chi Chi the monkeys name was cheesy bite you now you never bit me buddy bit my sister he bit my sister yeah she would fuck you up I think he bit my sister I think he tried to bite my sister I think was one of those things he might bit my cousin someone our family got bit yeah she was crazy and once you give no disrespect but to give those lunatics that an option that they do have intuition you're done you're fucking done they start giving you the fish eyes who don't do shit and I listened to her cooking was from another planet it's from another planet it was like pure immigrant cooking like the pasta the lasagna you just sit there and go holy shit just perfect just knew exactly what's supposed to be in there she baked her own like she would make her own macaroni should make her own ravioli she was stuff her own ravioli she'd be out there rolling and flattening out flour and shit throwing the flour on top of it flatten it out she was a wizard so he should get a monkey call it cheetah respect among keeper here dog how they respect the grandma my grandma was a special lady she was powerful yeah once you give us like I listened when I was a kid man I went to my buddy's judo school I didn't join I just went down there to see what it was like and it was hidden in Union City it was on 7th Street but I knew that my stepdad played cards on 9th Street on Wednesdays Wow ok I knew my stepdad played cards down and they played baccarat okay and they've gam worn this little Club and that'll be maybe 10 but because I grew up how I grew up but the numbers I always had my eyes out as a kid when I went to judo that man at the end I gotten the bus to go back and I noticed unmarked police cars and I went home that night and look bro you know me dawg get Christie love used to be a show on ABC about a black chick that knew martial arts that tried to capitalize on there with a sister and she was good-looking with an afro when she was a cop and she come in and do karate more so on Wednesday nights at 9 or 10 o'clock you caught me at home watching get Christie look I'll never forget that my stepdad was leaving that night and for some reason I know you don't apply back around tonight and he looked at me was getting dressed a suit on yeah like a billy bat suit on and shit I think you're gonna play cards or five men why you getting dressed to the nines right and I said to him I said hey man today I went down there to go to Martin's judo school and I saw a bunch of more cars down there if I was you I want to go after that and he fucking just looked at me he said I love you and he walked down the stairs he got the car started they opened the garage bro and ten minutes later I heard the car turn off in the garage clothes and he came by because I think you're right and he made Sundays for me and him and next one in that card place I got raided so now they would listen to me when I was except I had these fucking morons under my spell but you want me that's here without side you're open like this is mean like me and my stepdad had this weird relation H where I wanted my mother for myself you know what the feeling is drying when we've all gone through it when you lose a dad and your mom remarries there comes a day that he's not gonna tell you what's going on anymore and you know what I just want you to know that I'm the motherfucker that runs this joint you might be sleeping with my mom but I run this motherfucker so once I gave him that advice like it really for awhile there him and I were going afloat I kept stealing his coins from his Santos he had this same Lazzaro thing and that was everything to him so he had this big bottle of like scotch that was empty he would put silver dollars in there and I would steal him he would come home that bottles looking like somebody's stealing Mike I destroyed his mind for years because he was a very particular man so he had different bundles of mine I gotta tell you something I respect him today because I saw him get out of the joint and I saw what he did with bookmaking and how he became partners on a butcher shop he started businesses he started different businesses so after I saved this that night with the bacharach he wouldn't listen to me and then one day I went and I'd signed up for Biddy basketball and you didn't city and they used to give you know like now if you signed your kid up you got to pay $80 and write those days you just show up with an address right and they gave you a t-shirt they put you on the team and he gave me a number they said like Union City recreation there was a purple shirt my number was 57 I walked in the house and he goes what he got there and I know I joined the basketball thing and he goes what number is it he goes 57 Cubans again a very superstitious 57 he goes put a number on that and he picked up the phone I go five he called some guy he goes gonna be 557 for $10 guess what happens your rug well the number came up right the fuck this motherfucker at the age of 12 so he would listen to me my stepfather one at the time was 47 drink imagine did not drink did not do drugs carried a straight razor Joe Rogan a straight razor cut people yeah in a Sun he used to cut use the web carpenter pants with the stray rays at this point the guy had money he would have a gold chain he wear a Chinese t-shirt which a lot of people do not know what it is that's what real pimps wear their silk handmade shirts from China that you wear and they have three little buttons well when you're a real motherfucking spic you cut those buttons and you get your initials and you put them in gold with diamonds in it that's how spics ran in those days whoa and once I had him there Joe Rogan I had him he trusted me he trusted my eyes so one night were in Union City and I fucking went somewhere on the walk back there's a place called pastoral music and there was next to the new moon Chinese restaurant and I saw a bunch of mark cars and I'll never forget that I went back to the bar and I he go I told him I said dog I saw three I'm like I had him right and I know that see I seen three unmarked cars up to corner he was very always scared Allah thought even though he was a bookmaker he never used the phone Joe Rogan never used the phone and he would never have a conversation closed-door phone this is because he always felt he didn't now like phones he did everything like a pigeon his he would write the numbers on a little piece of paper and fold them up and put him in his hat and if he ever saw cops he would just eat the piece of fucking paper he always had the piece somewhere close sometimes you put in this ring this motherfucker was a savage oh my god so that night the cops were gonna jump on us on the bar but it was for a drug thing it wasn't for him but when I went back I told him listen the cops are up the corner me and him he grabbed me by the hand and him and I walked from 29th and Bergen line to 58 and Bergen line down the Hudson telling different bar owners that there was gonna be a raid like that's how untrustworthy he was a phone's number by the time we got back to the bar we got raided and there was a dude in there his name was moneena right moneena is those those crazy Cubans that are back wah moneena means good man like y'all my bra yeah the Abba quoi they're the ones they don't be pussy pussy and they fuckin you can't fuck around with animals because they sayin Lazzara no they sure they have a very specific religion yeah they have their men it's a manhood they were longshoremen in Cuba and they maintain order so we haven't fuck up they come over and fuck you up they were but he had a wig I'll never forget this the guy moneena had a wig and the cops were there and they threw him I'm like 12 dawg I'm up against the wall this side should meet through in their search of my stepdad they got my mom and they went to moneena and they searched him in the complex at his work and he goes check the wig and they pulled the wig off and he had a little book making numbers world is fucking nuts that I grew up in I love it still I love I wonder what it's like that is not businesses well it's unfortunate because you think about how many bets are placed oh Jesus Christ I mean there's so much money is so much money out there people love to gamble fucking games when games are on people loved a gam what do you think is spent this weekend Jamie come on Jamie my question Joey like not a problem like what what it what's helping us by letting them regulate that shit like why why does that have to have a licence to gamble why you know if you think someone's not paying their taxes and you can prove it is it because it's money it's cash that's being thrown around mostly like what why is it an issue the government's got not getting their piece it seems ridiculous that grown adults could tell other grown adults they can't gamble but you can here but you can't there Oh gambling is one of those things like legalization of marijuana legalization of fucking cocaine like legalization of anything bro you know what there's gonna be fucking winners and there's gonna be fucking losers my hands 2 years ago Connecticut did I did an expose on 60 minutes about women who have just lost their fucking minds gambling and Mohegan Sun because they installed no no disrespect the Mohican Sun a casino industries they installed these type of slot machines that could just fuck with your mind why so these women were going down there and losing fuckin mortgages houses you know sounds like a John Waters movie the dogs no dog it was just something that listen get away the biggest percentage of degenerate gamblers are usually women let's look this fucking percentage up here women go fucking deep that's a fuckin hole they don't give a fuck about nothing they they fucking play cards women fucking bang it out Wow and they bang it out while you're at work Joe Rogan while I'm at work they start with a horse then they go to this you know those little toys they doin in Jersey we can say well you know when that landing city was in Atlantic City you went to Union City right you paid 15 bucks to get on a bus they gave you a coupon book and when you get to Atlantic City give you $15 and corners back so they're basically driving you to fuckin gamble and drive back well I believe in gambling I believe in making a living I believe that it's a niche it's an illness whatever but when you're losing your house there's God that's where I want to know where that's where it bothers me it's just like okay it's just like I'm drug abuse it's just like the opiate problem it's just I can't even fucking anything else it could fucking it you and I both know people who have lost their fucking lives gambling okay you've seen people in pool halls you see how they get your open there's no difference in the drug addict than the gambling addict no points no difference there it's just as scary to because they're conscious it's like if you see the drug out do you see him he's shooting up or whatever it is and you see him fainting you know that poor bastard but when you see a guy who's fully in the grips of gambling trying to figure out how to make get his money back he's all jazzed up with adrenaline he doesn't understand why see this gamblers like Michael Jordan then this gamblers like Joey Diaz this gamblers who have the means to gamble and that is a fucking killer also like a Michael Jordan like a Michael Jordan and I'm not saying nothing bad I'm a Michael Jordan he's just accusations that you hear that even bets on his own one-on-one basketball games he was very competitive oh yeah but now how Joey Diaz was doing it not how people Charles Barkley lost nearly 30 million dollars gambling it says yeah those errol's uh Joey how much money is Chameli ass how many people did you call but that were like Joey Diaz did I have the means that were 19 years old yeah okay and one night they put a ten-time better than a fucking knick game and they won $50 when you're 19 $50 is that's a lot of fun so now you think you got the world by the ball so you do it again on Friday Saturday and now you enter this world Joe Rogan that gets dark it's it's uh instead of the drug addiction of the alcohol addiction every morning you wake up like is today my lucky day it's like the people who go to the 7-eleven every day and you're trying to just get a pack of rolling papers you're just gonna you just left you jitsi just wanted rolling papers and water and there's a guy in front of you and he's done you give me 360 eights for 64's and this poor fucking whatever gives them 20 lottery tickets and it's a hundred and eighteen dollars this is what this guy's doing every day seven fucking days a week my friend and he bite me he might be winning $200 a fucking week but every week he's getting deeper and deeper into a fucking hole because in your mind you think you're today's your lucky day and it's never your luck I was in that all when I was 19 dog and I saw a friend lose 80,000 when you're 18 years old and he had to get three jobs and I never really fucked with that again I learned that addiction that should left my world early you know wasn't degenerate lose a gambler who John Gotti he wanted because they brag right that's that conversation in mind get away from me well you have no fucking idea if I had fucking Michigan in the hook I would have made thirty thousand they lose eighty ninety two hundred thousand a weekend that the system is designed to bury the degenerate gambler like from from August 15th look at this mahjongg Gotti secret obsession and that wage 600 bets in Scrabble and a three thousand dollar monopoly buy-in you have no idea guys with the degeneres for like eight for like seven months I played this fucking ugly game Joe that I would start I knew the action I knew that you had a bet on Monday nights and try to win and you know what I lost every week and all these people who sell you information listen arch Lisa played the fucking game lost Pete Rose bet and lost even Michael Jordan bet lost yeah there's rumors that that's why he was asked to play baseball for a few years because it was a cover-up again I did not write this this is just things I hear on the road everybody has a fucking pub camp grabs you fucking weird weird and they grabbed me for a long time I kept thinking that was the day and I kept betting 40 times what's up Jimmy if they had a problem playing Scrabble they would call up the Parker Brothers hotline dick mobsters would to dispute the rules and have them explain me is a word is a word joke stop me kid is not a would stop Inc is the word wiki but wiki wiki dude he told me I saw stop me that's why they were getting arguments but garbage man real word garbage man cafe you know gambling is a fucking nightmare and once you get caught in the web and you and Joe Rogan's shuts me down then I start putting bets with Jaime and then pretty soon I started fucking dipping into accounts and pretty soon now you're done now you get forced into a bad head I told you that I was a backer on the road for a while my friend Johnny B when I started making money doing stand-up I put together a little bankroll and me and him would go places and gamble and he would win or lose you know sometimes he'd win sometimes lose but it was just being in action it was fun you know that kind of gambling I was never good enough to like play those guys but I could play like people that were like my level and you'd bet like 20 bucks or maybe if you want to get crazy about like 50 bucks I never bet like a lot of money gambling on pool but it makes you think more it makes you play like way more serious it's good for your game and if you can have a friendly sparring partner they play like friendly games like maybe erased 7 for 20 bucks so it's cost you probably in any city pool halls I don't know what the rate is per hour but they got to be like at least 25 what's wrong I want you to break it down for me I walk into a pool hall with Jamie yeah I got 10 G's cash in my pocket Jamie is my main man how do i exactly make and why is it that the people the room pass money around and how does that money get dispersed it's real simple everybody puts like you put in I'm in for a hundred like it depends on who's putting it together because they might decide to just pooling all their money like everybody put in on one side pooling money and you know and and back this guy or they might be betting on the side they might not even be playing the game there's always side bets side bets are probably more like if you had a bet if you had a like a big pool game right you know there used to be a place called was it West End billiards I think in New Jersey West End I think it was worth called we'll see if you found West End billiards it was a world-famous pool hall we would take the drive from from New York to go down in New Jersey to this famous pool hall that would have these like serious high-level professionals play there and real high-level hustlers from all over the country would go there for big-money games you go there and watch people play for $5,000 $10,000 I mean the best in the world would be there all the time I got to play against some of the best in the world they killed me but I got to play again against him like real good guy to the tournament you and I are in the tournament and you are Efrain Reyes the grace of all time or Earl Strickland or Johnny Archer and I'm just Joe Rogan I barely could play it doesn't matter I put my money up I enter the tournament I can play against you yes it's a huge huge like where you have to get invited so now there's Joey Diaz come on the side and go listen I'm putting three-to-one odds on this sure some people don't so that decide yes I don't know hundred bucks on Archer you know oh you'd never seen this Diaz kid play I got a hundred on Diaz and dudes I'll take that I'll take that and then you just work it out and everybody works it out but when sometimes guys will get together and back somebody to like say if there you got it like a friend it's a really good player and this guy's coming in from out of town and he wants to take a crack at him no well he wants to play a hundred dollar sets okay then you have to think how many barrels do we have a pool your money together okay we got four barrels that means if he wants to play sets we can lose four times so you have to be able to lose a couple gained a couple like if you're gonna really play a guy out these guys would play 1012 hours then we keep going back and forth and back and forth it's crazy like I've seen guys and you would see him the next day they'd still be playing you'd go there in the morning they'd be playing all through the night I don't know what the fuck they were on most likely some sort of Infanta means that was a big thing in the pool world for a while guys would just break each other with gambling it would just it would be about who quits it wouldn't be about who won it's very rarely about like you know like you would you'd be you would be frowned upon highly if you left on top say if you're ahead by 500 bucks and you want to quit me and you and I'm still ready ready to keep playing I still got more money man let me win my money back if you just walked away nope I've got what I wanted I'm going to leave now like that would be you did you'd be what's called bad action what guys I got two kids or having good up to seven goals yeah cool motherfucker with two kids you're not playing that kind of pool there ain't nobody with two kids playing that level pool in pool halls like gambling that's a pool maybe now there's actually a few guys I take that back there's a few guys with kids that are top of the food chain there's a pool hall mile from my house whenever I get whatever I going to Hollywood now I can't do Laurel Canyon no more so I gotta go a long way and then get off on victory just to see it fucking always fell with degenerates I'm petrified to pull in there some places were home to me you know what I'm talking about right next to the strip club is that on the redic Turing right when you exit then there's a strip club right next to a pool well I know the only good one in this area Washington say the only good one the only good one I know of his house of billiards and Sherman Oaks I like this area have you you bet you've been on the 101 have you seen what that place is that way you took me there a couple of times to eat we did comedy there remember Hollywood billiards you took me there yeah it's fucking a building what did it know I go there next time what does it look like I don't want Joe next time I I drove by and I was like oh my god that you should be we did comedy there to eat there with Arya completely Poole there are born time once a time that place was great fucking done that whole area is completely that's where I met crazy max Eberly really yeah like that dude can play some fucking pool woo so when you play max eppley how much drive to put up guy still put him on the wall I would get tortured you would have to bet like that I would go to you're never gonna bet on me like a guy like max Everly he's top of the food chain as far as his technique and delivery he could win a World Championship Tournament like legitimately he's that good I have no chance like if we played 12 games I might win a couple I might get lucky when a few maybe I'll win four he's gonna win way more he's gonna get to 12 for sure quicker it'd be a terrible bet the bet would be how many games do I get - that would be the bat if you say you'll never get past three because a guy like max happily can run 10 racks in a row and I'm not exaggerating I've seen him do it but I am breaks runs 10 racks in a row but to the point where you're sitting there he did it in Vegas we were all hanging out thought I think was man wasn't Ari I forget who came with me actually you guys above the Italian place yes that place is amazing and that's what exactly were max Max's plan he would break and run out on guys they would just get frustrated they'd be like what the fuck man they just kid didn't get to shoot we watched him he was gambling some guy and when the set was over the guy was just pissed off cuz max just wouldn't miss it was crazy just watch him he's playing a guy that really just wanted to take a chance and play like a top of the food chain guy and he gambled with him but just watching the difference between a kid who can play a little pool was pretty good versus a world championship caliber pool player they're so precise like his technique is so clean and his angles are perfect and he's just efforts it effortlessly moving the cue ball on the table to where he wants it he sees clusters and problems way in advance and breaks them up it's so high level that's my boy that's max Albert Lee he taught me how to play pool not that I didn't already play it before I met him but he taught me how to play it way better way better he made my game way more technical he was explaining things that I was just guessing before and he was explaining what was wrong with my approach and like what was that what's what's a better way to do it he's a wizard when it comes to technique now he can make a living going from pool to pool hall or no way because he's that good he's an artist too fortunately for max he he makes pretty cool artwork like a lot you see some of it's probably on his Instagram I could just poke you for something no no no that does pool cue somebody along the way he said he makes like fucking 8g poke you ivory Eric crisp that's my boy Eric fresh a curry so that's what I play with up there with his cue his cue is uh he's a wizard man he's a guy who's like really into like the grains of woods he's really into like patterns and he thinks of like to him wood is like mesmerizing he finds like the most beautiful pieces of wood and Comp combines them together and they have to have a certain harmonic frequency like he drops him on a cement floor just like dink-dink Lee he wants to hear a certain sound from the wood otherwise he won't use it he's like finding logs on the side of the highway and shit and recognizing some weird hardwood that no one's ever used before he cuts it up and makes a cue out of it it's a wizard like his cues are referred to any he doesn't give a fuck he makes as many as he wants you you know sometimes he don't make them for a while makes him for his friends won't let me pay for one I have to I have to pay for everything just to not feel terrible he's like the nicest guy ever play some fucking pool too so I don't even know when this podcast started heads aren't against it's happening but it's funny before we started we were talking about yeah 4.8 billion oh my 3 percent will happen in Nevada that's it only 3% so it's most of it online live is that chris christie thing you pulled up earlier James listen gee and banks banks there's still people who I like you know they have they got a ton of loot chris christie goes to supreme court on sports betting is he trying to get sports betting yes they passed something in New Jersey I think in 2011 to allow betting in sports but it's still only a lot in Vegas because of the whatever law there is I'm back on you team Chris yeah alright so he might have a few problems but we all do seventeen states also with him on this I think they want to do it so he won he opposed it they want it again they want betting again because they have an NHL team in Vegas and that's always been like the logic is that you don't be some issue whatever you can't be betting where there sports being played because someone will throw the game everybody should be able to bet every city he'll do whatever you want these games though these I'm fascinated by these games you say are hypnotizing ladies and going crazy losing all their their money okay 60 minutes there's a whole whole piece on these games are like laser ish just you know and people actually but the percentage was higher most women because of it's just it's like video games more gambling it's very fucking so addictive like a video game but ambling very gay so that's what their beef was to remove these type of games because I'm Tonya since I was a kid I always I first off I looked at my mother she had a lot of problems she had a lot of great issues but she was a degenerate gambler on baseball Shh between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets they killed it oh they killed her and I saw the decline I saw what it that I saw a person watched two baseball games at the same time remember in those days you can have split screen and DIRECTV so if you reporter Rick and you took one TV and you put it on top of the other TV and you got fuckin NBC and you had Kable where they came with the cord the morn HBO still had the cord to the fucking thing and it was a thing with a box that you pressed and you switched three levels and those days maybe there was no edit and there was no a be a package or n be a branch you got like one other game so we would pray and it would be the Boston Red Sox and she would watch both fucking games and gamble at the same time nah not even that the numbers if she had a dream about a goat man if she had a dream about going back to Cuba that's if she had a dream about seeing her daughter BAM it was a number they would call her they require at a quarter to three because she had all that all those contacts so that was that gambling then there was that then there was the track addiction which started that aqueduct in the afternoon if the Sun was shining that was an excuse to go to aqueduct for my mother let me go to aqueduct I'll see you at 3:00 after school and she'd be there at 3:00 but the whole time she'd be scratching because the metal man started at 8:00 said she knew she catched the meadowlands at 8:00 so guess what happens that if you lose the eight o'clock Meadowlands well you haul your ass to Yonkers with the death of death this is where you go to before you go to a pool on the side of your blood you got a Yonkers Raceway do you understand me have you ever been to Yonkers Raceway yeah we leave there a quarter one what do you think you're going either going to sell your soul or give you a blood seed go shoot pool because you're saving the day you cannot go home a loser right right that's all Dave gambling so that was her thing so I also grew up an Italian family that the mother was a Chow it was like a fucking act it was like an act she had three kids they were tremendous kids I knew the husband he worked for a big corporation they drove a nice car they went to church but on Saturdays when I go over there go Asia mom they go our mom plays cards with with the Rogen's and in this name but wise I got old the one day somebody said to me don't be careful when you go over there why they might shoot that lady in the head she likes it's a letdown I mean when I was a kid I was like 13 and somebody came from they said be careful when you go with a beautiful moms a little bit on those card games scared for your life from a card game imagine being scared for your life well it was a different game you know that's how they something you win so a lot of the people now I also grew up with men degenerate gamblers but I know all the symptoms I know the itch this this thing on 60 minutes just spoke about this addiction with a computer thing with women that was it that was really interesting but I know how it fucking creeps up on you it's not a couple years ago it's called slot machines the big gamble oh so it's just slot machines in general dayz machines computer ones yes they have an effect on women in particular maybe man the fuck up ladies how about that no dog here's my take on this whole gambling thing like remember horse betting in New York like you'd go the horse off track better yeah it was right there right there they they made that for a reason yeah I mean they're just trying to make it legal this is legal come on it's is legal it's not legal it's to take a piece Joe right yeah no I'm saying what that piece have you been to a medical marijuana store recently no I haven't okay well if it's $60 your tab is now $76 cuz it tax it's 16 dollars in taxes if you buy something for $60 the thing about weed though is it goes so far think about how much like $100 where the weed goes you could be on the moon for three days for three days you could be on the moon with the proper edibles get $100 worth of the proper edibles how much do you think you can handle how many Jumbo's do you think you could handle you ever have a Jambo what do they have like depends on I think 100 to 200 years yeah dude I fucked up Nate for John Bunce my I felt my cells I felt all the cells in my bones I felt like where the tendons connected on my spine it's like you could get fucking blasted on in the last 12 hours and then take the other half that's only 12 hours no other tax is higher in Las Vegas Jaime than they are here for weed yeah a 5% here how much 35 and what's in Vegas it's high but it depends on a train they changed the motherfucking game dawg like there's no more stars of death that's so silly no more hello - she's the TKOs I bought the final fucking I got a card town I'm like Pablo Escobar I got a fucking cachet of the ones I ate this morning those hello the TKOs yeah yeah you can't find them but I got a conscience I got em they become my Cuban cigars oh my god I cube me cigars now so some people are just gonna keep going there's no more like I told people there's no more stars but they stars like people go fucking bananas Napa's my head you gotta see the way like I only go to two weed stores but I go to one that's by the book and I go to one that they just said you know what we're like sleep in my own chick they don't give a fuck this is immigrant mentality we open at 6:00 we close at 10:00 we give away free bagels if you come at six o'clock and you got to see it that rock on the road wow they're gonna sell those two hundred milligram stars so people go down the fucking end Wow or the DEA comes in and shut them down they don't give a fuck that's too like if you're on Ventura Boulevard you got to be really cool cuz you're done I don't think there's anything wrong with having a limit on the number of milligrams if that's going to keep it legal it's in that's also not that's it you know much it cause you know how much it's gonna cost the stars at that dude to stay open how much a half a mil oh my god because it's 70 grand just for the license tree money they take that they take that paper off the front they're like Led Zeppelin they're like Peter Griffin 1975 but look the economy is gonna improve they're still gonna kill oh no nobody's gonna improve I'll tell you what how much are they gonna take right off the target is a bang they looked at Colorado's thing and said listen we're coming in with steroids we're coming in with THD forget what they're doing listen we're doing just a set shop now we don't care have you been in business of not just a set up shop we got to get a piece of the action okay fine if they just they work deals out with banks and made it easy and acceptable for these guys put the boots right in a lot of places it wasn't they were dealing in cash they hired especially in Colorado in the early days they had a higher a lot of like spec ops guy I love saying spec ops like I know what the fuck I'm talking about just sounds cool they would hire like former seals and shit and they would have to carry the the the money to the bank because everybody knew there was like giant sums of cash so it made it very dangerous they weren't allowing them to use banks or credit cards rather they weren't allowing them to you know sell we with credit cards but they were selling weed and credit cards in LA medical in the 90 the hot store when you turn me on to my license the hot store at the time which they're not there no more that dude at the height of it was walking out of there every day with 25 gram himself life Wow that's dangerous he was at but you know what he was a dumb as fuck when the DEA came you have that cash and a safe right there that they just moved on I know a guy who got shot he was a really nice guy and he used to work at the Englewood Wellness Center and this is the early days of the medical legalization it was like I want to say it's like somewhere around $2.99 somewhere somewhere in that range 2099 and he apparently was coming out with a big bag - and someone shot him right in the stomach took all the cash there was no fire people yeah you gotta hire people you know I see I see amateur mistakes yes honestly I see amateur mistakes constantly for example the store I'm talking about he lost he lost everything Joe Rogan when you always their way he lost everything he would any weave he got this guy was an exotic guy himself like he was a head when you're a head you love when somebody brings you so he bought as much as he could he was a head nobody uses they don't use that anymore so what he would do is when you walked into this place he would have sixty weeds on the wall and he kept all his weed on the property when the feds came it was like stealing he had everything there everything was there while in the open you have to have an apartment and you have to have an anon a mouth six ounces it's all you should have one weed if Jamie comes in he wants eight ounces give me ten minutes I got a pigeon that'll bring it over here five million right across the street knit I got a little apartment with some stash there you have a couple safes you have two if the cops ain't gonna let you deposit it you got to be fuckin creative if you read all these guys stories the hardest and you're open you ready for this expression the hardest thing is what to do with all that cash think about that problem Joe row and cereal now it's a real problem no no think about this roomed what was the movie I just want oh come on oh no no I just on a plane you come when you're on a plane and Tom Cruise's on you gotta give him the benefit of the doubt oh I got an edible in me i watch the Barry seal thing how was it it's not an Academy Award winner but it's very interesting when we're just burying money child wrote it four million is shot it means you are the yard like burying money like a suitcase with hundra now the bills falling out of it and you don't give a Frenchman's fuck I always wanted to know this Snopes this did Barry seal died with George Bush's phone number in his pocket that's a we said and he died they shot him on the way to the trial what George Bush's phone number in his pocket no he was top notch that guy he had it all he's seen it bro he took pictures of them loading a fucking plane in Nicaragua with Escobar and the top and Nicaragua they had him by the fucking balls no matter what how you that took balls fuck yeah they fucked him in the ass they told that they wouldn't release the pictures yeah then they released the pictures resolution that's why they got shot that's fucked up they should have taken him and hit me fuck is interesting though they assassinated that guy that's a 100% assassination in connection to some sort of illegal government it was the fucking about that was Escobar that said buried a message they had a deal where barrack seals could land though right like that wasn't part of the thing was with the people on the ground on the ground that was in me no that's but here's the problem this is where Eddie Bravo comes in right they were landing in those Everglades and don't quote me on this right and he broke it down for me and somebody else broke it down me to be honest with you and they were allowing that on your boys clock Clinton come on that's that's always be his drops out because the truth is fascinating the truth is two boys were murdered and the coroner the official report they gave to the parents was that they had fallen asleep on the train tracks so the parents pay for some sort of an autopsy and it's revealed that the kid had been stabbed and that one of them had been stabbed and then they find out that around that same area was where those guys would drop their drugs before they landed they would parachute down their drugs they would they would like and they would land and these guys they would drop points where they would put their shit and then someone else would come by and pick it up on the ground yeah Gordon right and these kids apparently saw something they weren't supposed to see so they fucking murdered these kids with knives and then the coroner was all in on it so they had to conduct some sort of independence so that is what got this whole Barry seals things going it was this lady trying to figure out this parents trying to figure out what happened to their kids you know Joe was fucking crazy stole you have to imagine okay that these guys were getting you know let's just draw a number I mean I'm just an idiot but let's just draw number but they were probably getting $4,000 per kilo what would they put on those planes and they were sending five of those planes over a day and dropping them in Louisiana this one listen and my told you a thousand times of the podcast in 83 they found the bear dead next to a duffel bag filled with cocaine in Aspen Colorado in the mountains because they were dropping the fucking coke in the mountain say okay Barry seal seal had organized a sting operation where he managed to get photographs of Pablo Escobar helping Nicaraguan soldiers to lo twelve hundred kilos of cocaine onto a seed pot 23 plate soon afterwards Reagan went on television with the photograph to denounce Sandinistas as drug smuggling corrupting dot dot dot that's how much he was getting for that four million eight hundred thousand he was for one fucking load now here's the tricky thing here's what here's what really pisses me the fuck off that I see narcos and I see everything but now this is your uncle Joey talking to you Joe Rogan please show me the good side of Pablo Escobar no no no no no there's no good side to Pablo Escobar the saintly Harvey Weinstein this is a story that we have never brought up but you have to assume ok you you see all these shows and the whole fucking thing and they were in bed for sure with Nicaragua let me ask you this do you think that it is the actual CIA or is it people or if it when it was let's not even say CIA DEA FBI made a bunch of fucking letters put them together is it the actual organization whichever one it is that's bringing it in are they complicit or are there just Cowboys see the theories always been that there's been these few Cowboys corrupt guys maybe they get too close to drug deal too close to the drug deal and then sometimes they get seduced like there's a many many stories of under kind of undercover cops getting seduced by the actual lifestyle of being a criminal young kids they probably did a little crime themselves here there they see some cops doing some dirty shit they see him some guy you know there was a thing that came out about was it Baltimore what is the city where cops had it came out in trial they had kept toy guns on them to plant at the scene of a crime like if they just decide to shoot we're talking in a big picture the big world picture as an intelligent individual as you are the plant it was plain and simple the CIA wanted a piece of their action and the DEA was tricked into going down in a really control of war you can't be this and I'm not saying you as an American you can't be this dumb so the research that we've done right all the research that we've done with general north he was in on the page with battery seal the whole fucking thing in his woods gets even deeper let's talk about the deep to subject that nobody ever even looked at and you have to think of because I heard this story a thousand times there was a guy by the name is Carlos laid there that that he got crazy you know they showed him getting his dick sucked on the radio in Colombia and everything and all these TV shows no he was on an island snorting coke with long hair talking like Jim Morrison and having fucking threesomes and the fucking their own cartel gave laid air up to the law there to keep them off their back it was five partners it's me you Jamie and red band but fucking red bands out there doing videos of him snorting coke with a fucking pigeon on his head we can't have this they gave the DEA fucking Carlos that cup and I calmed things down for a while when Dan 83 and 84 when Reagan sent his troops down there don't quote me on the dates here but I will tell you as a professional cocaine sniffer what was going on in 85 the price of cocaine went skyrocketing and it was in the it wasn't because of cocaine skyrocketing it was because the cocaine was coming in but the toughest part was getting the ether alcohol into Colombia to process it the Colombians had got a tip that the they were the troops for coming down to raid their jungles now what they had not told you in all these shows and research but this is Lanka lowers gonna drop on you is where do you think they took one other they took some labs to Nicaragua and they shipped cocaine out of Nicaragua but guess who else partnered up with them to your buddy sit down sit down was shipping it in yeah he's gonna be on the podcast in three weeks can you imagine having $4 your fucking shit you infidel you would truly my god this whole block would have snipers and fucking everybody Fidel just walked in with his soup and you had to teach him like a UFC moving shit it's for Devon come in and ask you send your rogen be Michael Moore escape ok haha lucky cuz they were anyway but they were serious man they won't be very nervous in the presence of a guy like that lay bare said in front of Congress that he was getting 800,000 he was given Fidel 800,000 a shipload to come in under his flag at the time she imagined being in the presence of Fidel Castro just being in his presence like if he was you know in his prime if you're in the room with him in his prime no one here and you have no idea dough you have no idea maybe he would be annoyed this terrifying to me as a Cuban American you have to hate the guy I have to hate him but as a man that thinks you have to see what his path was crazy again that's where my man TJ Inglis comes in with a van a knock point to hide the revolution for how he started in three different places at once mmm the revolution it just wasn't eight monkeys that put on gorilla suits and went to the mountains of Cuba right he came to Jersey first got arrested went to Tampa got arrested he was already passing out fly they always confused Lee Harvey Oswald no it wasn't Lee Harvey giving out pamphlets it was Fidel Castro that's a joke please don't quote the CIA it's a joke I'm not writing yeah Fidel Castro was in Union City New Jersey I can't tell you the dates but Ike I have my friend call into the podcast and tell you the story about Fidel talking to his mother on a daily when she would wait to get on the bus she was an Irish girl in Union City if she goes I know Fidel in 1952 and just think of what he did to the Italians he kicked everybody out fuck no you casinos mine now it was a very brilliant move he started the mountains he fucking he you know he just took all the little villages you know and then he changed their minds because blip first of all it wasn't an easy thing for to them to do Batista was really fucking the country he had really divided the country you have no idea what racism was told you were in Cuba 1955 black people weren't allowed in casinos you have no idea these poor people today everybody's crying about you have no idea what black rights were in Cuba for those black fuckin people they got no rights so those people were poor there was such a high level of I'm tired you see all these people dancing but on the other side there was a fucking famine why people were fucking dying so they wanted a change Fidel came in there as a hero first of all he came in as Cuba was gonna change but then he switched it on him and he aligned with Russia and he became a communist that's what made it worse that's what made the worse racism and hunger has always existed in Cuba it did that that was the problem that they always showed that party side of Cuba but that other side of the island probably was people starving Wow and Batista come on but how do they keep up the tobacco production that I don't know I don't they still think of that Joey but not all that they had the best cigars in the world but that people complaining now they're not the same cigars some people are complaining but a lot of people getting frauds apparently apparently when you buy Cuban cigars from untrust untrust e people you could definitely get some fake says now they're talking about how the soil isn't rich people go there's an expert Oh Bobby Kelly Bobby Kelly he's a real expert like he was on Ari Shaffir spot cast they were talking about cigars Bobby Kelly really knows his shit like he was he was going in depth about how many fake cigars there are and how he could even kind of taste a fake Cuban he smoked so many cigars and he thought maybe one of ours was fake it might be fake night girls no I think this is real I think this is like it's like he's like that discerning about that shit huh there's a lot of weird freaks when it comes to cigars like people are super into them they get suit they get you high as fuck - this is something that people aren't talking about you smoke a cigar you're like whoa that's there's so much nicotine in that you had the Cuban coffee to it oh my god that's how the process is supposed to go down with the Cuban coffee that's avoid the cigar and you go deep deep deep yeah little taste of inedible and then half a half a brain and you'll be there you'll get their jackets next relationship al smokes it with sometimes with cigarettes in it we did it the other night in the back of the comedy store with cigarette and I've tobacco with THC yeah whoo you get elevated it was it was interesting I got one time from San Francisco to Reno one time from the San Francisco to Reno Doug the cops were looking for me in San Francisco and you go down to the any of those tourist districts and they have like our bus that'll take you to Reno so I just jumped on the bus to Reno with this chick and well this is 1985 when we're sitting in the bus and there's this Egyptian can't forget this and the back of it you could smoke on the bus in those days cigarettes so he had rolled a blunt with hash weed and tobacco and it goes and I had never done that before guys I'm not gonna lie it had never even I took two hits of that fucking thing though I had a puke in that bathroom I got high as fuck but that combination together at the backhoe this weed yeah ash he had the real special yeah that's too much wrongful Joey that's a bit much rubble Joey the first time I ever smoked a spliff with with Charlie Murphy Charlie Murphy rolled them his cousin Richard rollin - Charlie could roll he would that was he would take swisher Sweets old-school you know any kind of cigar paper and they would turn it into a joint with the cigar paper which is like you inhale weed you never really inhaled those cigars you you could just kind of get them in your mouth and you taste it then you blow it out but when you take a drag a weed you open your lungs up and fill your lungs with the smoke cigar smoke is too harsh for that you don't you know you don't smoke like that for the most part most people don't but when you do it with pot you do so you get this crazy blast of nicotine and a crazy blast a weed and you're like wow it's very different than just weed I think I smoked yeah last night on the podcast I took two hits off a friend of mine gave me one of those I like those and it was pretty fucked scared of I'm scared of less I'm scared of I like the ones with cigarettes in them I'm scared no no no I'm not smoking cigarettes but the ones with cigarettes and it's an interesting little high it's like ooh this is a new door to the room it's it's interesting that's what like I'm smoking dope one of the hardest things I ever gave up we're smoking cigarettes after you smoke a joint right that is just pure brilliance when you hit a fucking joint and you take a little sip of coffee and after you smoke that - totes you lined up a Marlboro of some white its life the fucking changing bro I know a lot of people love them after I'm a real good meal well the whole it's the whole package so it oh my god let me add a meal a meal a joy and then a cigarette another cigarette and a cup of on top of that some dessert another cigarette you have no fucking idea cigarettes please everybody I can't smoke him my Tony's hooked my blood pressure be 2,000 over 80 Tony says he can quit at any time no no fella and you know what was the best of what I realized was two years ago I shot something and I smoked that night I asked one of the camera guys let me fucking give me a cigarette and that next morning was when I realized how really fucking bad they are you felt terrible oh come one two two cigarettes two Marlboro Lights and I was fine that night you did a comedy club and I was like what the fuck is going on I want to smoke the fuck no no I'll never do it again after that night in Chicago I'll never do it again I took one of Tony's ones before a show it's interesting cigarettes are interesting doesn't it does a weird little thing - yes it does yes it does one of the reasons why I did is because I would read something about nootropics talking about different vitamin like what's good for brain function and one of the things they said that nicotine nicotine is actually a nootropic and that they found that some people under the use of tobacco with the use of tobacco they achieve like a elevated state of oh like certain functions of the brain like it actually has some sort of a small measurable effect so it really does stimulate the way your brain works I don't see for me it's different I have to get it's the combination yeah that's for me hmm like I would just enjoy right now you myself but cigarette with the weed but if that coffee was brewing hot right now and it was maybe 60 degrees outside with a little bit of wind and sunlight well you know when you stand out in the Sun you're warm when you're in the breeze you're a little cool yeah you go outside and a good joint of some fucking tremendous reefer with the Sun hitting your face and you take a nice head of a cigarette all combined or even or even like I like what I do I took a cup of coffee I'll pop a fucking number and then a little nicotine gum to give you a little guts and some blood pressure my blood pressure medication on top of altogether it all works out you don't say if you take them apart nothing really happens I get it but together that's where you put them a phone go in yeah for me it's a small shot of Jack Daniels and one to two hits of a joint before commies choice s just a little just a little tap a taste yeah likes one hit is really preferred it's a smart move - it's as if you're feeling I do got an idea cuz you know I do the tequila the other night ooh three points not bad Oh would you weight

old maybe 13 one of those came out and we took a hit of acid and we all went to the movie theater on a Saturday take the number one bus to Jersey City and they would play two of these movies doughnut dad and something else Night of the Living Dead or something fucking groundout Night of the Living Dead was the first one and there's one scene where the black guys go for the helicopter just chops is at all jesus fucking christ movies would scare the living I don't know how many times I took the number one bus to go to Jersey City than a Journal Square there was a movie theater that's why I saw Richard Pryor live at the Sunset Strip the first time on a Friday night I got stabbed that's right you got stabbed I got caught I still got the scar that's where I saw the Pink Panther movies that was my first John were into getting high and going to the movies like I knew I couldn't go to the movies in North Bergen reunion City because I'd been to one of my mother's friends or something so me and my little gold bonds figured out if we went to Jersey City we could get on the bus cause a little drama get a six-pack split it four ways and smoke a joint then going to those movies and giggle and act like an asshole we also went down to the see the groove tube and Kentucky Fried movie Kentucky Fried movie was a genre that started before Saturday Night Live and there was a movie put together by a bunch of sketches but one of the famous sketches is there in a courtroom and [Laughter] yeah they would just say different stupid things and the fucking guy go yeah do this movie today this is on HBO we were killed so you had to talk to your mother it again HBO because groove tube or Kentucky Fried movie was going to be on yes you should I'm getting triggered yes you could you could do this movie they don't have the balls to do this movie tonight girls are getting look at this look at this shit this is crazy you can never do this in a movie today in a regular movie they would never allow that Catholic High School girls in trouble and the guys banging a girl in the shower and you see her tits pressing up against the glass like legitimately see everything American Pie was not I mean it's not a sketch thing but it wasn't too far different no but even American Pie I think you'd struggle to do that now I think the climbing shin no no no with there's still a part of America no P no they're trying to they took f1 grid girls out of Formula One racing the grid girls like Hot Wheel they took them out and now they're petitioning to take octagon girls out and bring car girls they're saying like we need to stop this like Inger they're like what are you talking about how we make a living stupid like what well it's the objectification of women I think if you can have Chippendales and you can have I think you should have ring-card boys see who gets hired Joey what happened they have just as people are crazy people you know you know you made a point the other day with those two young men that you said something about the desert somebody got mad at people with the vagina hats supporters were mad because it represents the woman's March not everyone who's a woman has a vagina that was there they're upset it's transphobic fucking as much as an American as you want I'm fuckin done I mean three months ago the fucking some guy came out with a brilliant movie Stephen King that's can everybody then he not it was a number-one film a birth clown yeah and all of a sudden there was a parade you know they got together clowns marched in protection of clowns because it was just that movie came out a bunch of clowns lost their jobs oh my god in the spring like they were booked for the Fall so they blow you know we'll get into something now that's just totally out of control I read the Amy Schumer thing with the on Zeon's re I read you know you try to not avoid everything but it's right in front you know every day there's something else I'm worried you know you just waiting for the fucking shoe to drop every day I am gonna continue to be Who I am Jerome our stage I don't really give a fuck about sensitive I can't I'm a stand-up I can I don't have time I feel you I think about it I was also watched a podcast of you with Brendan and Brian and you talked about something that didn't happen - no no it did happen to me where I was at a child children's school at a fair and and I tried to turn it into a bit I just couldn't sell it said to be funny kid was playing in front of me and I could tell there was something not right with the child and someone the child called him a faggot and the kid's mother came out she goes he's not a faggot he's a transgender and then the mother came up to me I'm high as fuck how are you this is three months ago okay this is three months ago on a park you know before you go those events you get tuned up Oh can you put Visine in your eyes and you go down in you try to be as nice as you can as a parent but you try to avoid talking to a lot of people your wife does all the talking you just sit there and wave to people hi how are you who do you think something wouldn't Machida yeah yeah but see that and you just you're just watching the girls right you try to do that but there's always something at those events that you get back in the car with your wife and go mrs. Rogan what the fuck was that about there's no break it down for you tell me I'm lying to ya and every fucking thing it's like you you were talking about the people believe in the earth and there was no Adam and Eve that's what I'm starting to when you were telling that bit I didn't know what the fuck you were talking about this poor bastard but now that I have a child that's five I'm getting out to see different people's views that in my age and this lady came up to me and gave me a whole hearbeat how the kid is fifteen they had my medication and he's known he was a woman since he was nine and that but then she fucked up Joe Rogan she said she always wanted a girl anyway no Jesus but you guys are talking about something about there was of somebody and I got in trouble for a three-year-old give her them blah about that world no nothing Owen Benjamin got trouble got fired from his agency they dropped him because he was tweeting a bunch of shit about someone using hormone blockers on a three-year-old he's like this is crazy what I listened to that day and where I live I thought my head was gonna blow up when she came over and explained why he was going to be a trying again well here's the thing that's my behaving here's my thing if kids behaving a certain way let him keep behaving that way you don't have to fucking throw hormones in the mix you don't even know what's gonna happen when you do that you're gonna change who he is so you're telling me that he has this urge to take hormones that are not native in his body the same amounts he's this urge to do this so we should just let him do it no he has an urge to be identified as a woman like you don't even have to do anything to do that if you just decide you identify as a woman most people are gonna be cool with it like we're saying that a child has to take some camera goals in the middle of their developmental cycle is the only way we can do this this is a smart way this is a smart way when they're six or 16 or whatever it is that's crazy that doesn't make sense from a developmental standpoint like I'm not a scientist but I understand enough about the stages that the human being goes through before it reaches adulthood and you're not really completely formed until you're like 20 years old or 25 years old or something like that it's like the frontal cortex doesn't form - you're 25 so your decision-making is always a little weird you know what the fuck they want to be a fifth don't know it's six or it's three no okay so she said that he knew it nine come on and I went home and I told my wife my wife said well you gotta watch a show every week on A&E there's a show about kids that wanna you know make the child listen it doesn't matter it's just that I'm trying to I'm trying to tell you that I'm finding out about shit now that but do you know what's weird it's like why why does if someone feels a certain way they feel they are a certain way why do they have to take chemicals to achieve a new state like what what is this it's a we like they identify with being a woman so they have to take chemicals to reach this state I think man if I was a person who was a transgender person listened to me talk I'd be like shut the fuck up you don't know shit about the baby cheered if you listen it's this but all I'm saying is that this is a very unusual situation it's very unusual I don't think it's a bad thing but I think that doing it to someone who really can't fully make up their mind yet just seems insanely risky and what what could happen to the kid could be terrible and people have made successful transitions when they transitioned in their 30s you don't have to do it when you're six if you want to be a transgender person in your new 30s sure were your twenties or whenever we decide that a human being is rationally capable of making full life decisions that are is dramatic that doesn't mean that someone at sixteen who thinks they're a woman couldn't absolutely become one later and be super happy with that's not I'm not saying that's not possibly either like everything is possible there's a thing for everybody and if that is what you feel like is your your thing you want to be that that's is sure it's who you identify with and you you have every right you have every right to do that so what you're saying bro you know me fucking drugs I did between 16 and 20 it's not funny you did a lot of drugs from the time I met ya the fact that you have your schedule before that no but I'm talking about like I I tried to stay away like I was a karate guy like you and the kids from karate on Saturdays there were geeks we either went to a martial art festival we competed or we went to a karate movie or we went to work on the martial arts supply oh man those places so we saved our money I think you wanna go to movies and see the five deadly hands Donna we gotta save our money we're going to harm the next week to buy a Kabuto tonfa like we would always violate the ones that you'd hold with the just so you know I don't fuck around what are you drawing what are you drawing do you know how to write Chinese letters yeah if you look at those old Chinese things they all had this like that so you would I knew all about this you would buy the handle that I would hold of canvas and you would stand in front of it you makiwara a makiwara yeah and it would have like though you were getting those guys would really oh my gosh in there now we would save our buddy we were geeks that's what we did at 12 but to add a little goombas in my neighborhood and when there were 12 they did something completely different they went behind the school and they would roll one joint and put it in a piece of glass tube and light it up and we were drink for Oh the fruit should not get pukey so I didn't know who to hang out with so I would have to be like a double agent that was a tough job for me as a 12 year old I liked hanging out with my karate geeks you know right I like going to competitions I like doing forms I like doing the semi contact competitions where you couldn't kick above the head yeah those are good for kids so you don't like it anybody you still kick the kid and get thus qualified but fucking I picked up at the job did you see you know people did that this isn't life was simple for me this is so I had to make a decision because the colorful kids didn't get no pussy they just weren't into pussy they would talk about girls and they maybe had a crush on the girl in the 4:30 class but they never asked her to come to any of the events my other buddies weren't the pussy so eventually I cut the karate fucking geeks out and I started hanging out the little druggies and you make your transition and from those developmental ages like I tried to hide my drug use I tried to hide it especially a marijuana use for two or three years it was just marijuana Wow then once I became a freshman I didn't start basketball my freshman year I decided to let's venture out into this acid thing let's venture into this mescaline thing ooh it was a different name it was mescaline but it really wasn't mescaline Joe Rogan it was a little Tod it would know wasn't even pay out it was a little thing aren't they the same eh Oh Liam yeah yeah but mescal is what they sell you in the South they supposedly put in tequila something this was Sal right yeah this is something that two little fucking white kids made in a pillow was rat poison with something else and something else and it was very tiny it was maybe a little size of this that's it and it came in aluminum foil even smaller than that even smaller than that way smaller that little thing that that's it you paid $80 for it and you got a hundred of those and you started looking for $3 apiece and that would fuck you up for six hours were the two hour haze in between the how a buffer I would have come down and I did that for three or four months then they introduced me the THC crystal which is snorting they'd sold it is what we do is we get a bunch of stems and seeds from the reefer we put it in a pot and we boil that pot and whatever separates from the stems and the seeds that goes to the sides we scraped that off and that's where you snort in your nose oh my god so I was I was I had like a personal karate rule but I would always just smoke it and do the mescaline but I was never gonna put nothin in my nose oh you had a rule like a drug addict put something to nose right like that's it like that that's a complete different range I'll never shoot heroin Ronnie man as a karate man I carotid morals yeah I was just straying away with the reefer and then I finally ended up snorting that fucking euro a biscuit because that sort it was it was angel dust they just tear like every Sunday me and my friend Carlos Perez would buy a six-pack of my Cologne you only like mikkel oh yes the good friend died this kind of special appeal with the beer will pour must say something more yeah yeah call it tonight that's long brown brown what we talking about Mikkel oh no we would drink lowbrow we will get a six-pack on a row and fuckin snort a $10 package of THC Crispo my mother would go to the track on Sundays so I knew she wouldn't come back till 7:00 so me and it would snorted as soon as my mother stepped foot in that car at 11:00 me and him would have it and we'd snort it and then fuck and just sit around like and be fucking zombies all day yeah but that was a development and then I went after my mom god I just want on a cetera fucking year God knows what was in those goddamn things god fucking oh my god this is like a sketch it's a truly great American beer why why doesn't have American name motherfucker what are you embarrassed he embarrassed to be from here American beer Lowenbrau lower browser shit actually it is an American beer right that's like steep a Miocic keep your fucking real name just as American as it gets is he still around Lowenbrau I don't know but if they said Loewenberg that was their name and they started the beer company and they didn't change your name that's as American as it gets so I'm wrong I should shut the fuck up it's even looking up it's the German brewery lying about American American made apparently they make a lot of American American plants make a lot of cars now that you think of Japanese cars like Toyota Tundras they make them in Texas they make a bunch of them in Ohio - yeah that's weird right like if you think you buying a Honda you think you're definitely buying a Japanese car if you think you're buying some American cars it might be a Mexican car how crazy is that like what companies making their cars down in Mexico I think they I think they closed a couple plants I think Toyota was down in somebody else for a while but here's the thing if they put him down in Mexico but they gave him American money like the levels of American money that's in Mexico they would stop doing it actually Wow look at all these different ones Chrysler has three plants for two three plans GM is four plans mazda has one they do it down there because it's cheaper which I guess they have to do what they got to do and I'm sure it helps the community because I know it does I know people that have had manufacturing down in these countries and they for the cheap but it does help the people if there's some places they don't have much but what's arguable is like why is living like a Western person so important when these people have been living their own way for thousands of years it just they just didn't have like all the crazy infrastructure and all the shit that we had they didn't have the crazy cities and you know other than a few cities in Mexico like Mexico City so they would go and put these plants and like why is it doing I mean I'm all for people being able to work but is that better is that better than the way they were living before when they were living like indigenous people or living like villagers or living like trades people or whatever they did get by I don't know it is better maybe let's go back to the whole situation here I still remember cuz I'm a little older than us to remember where it was kind of starting to get taboo if you bought a foreign car yeah like I am that always better that that I still remember the mid 70s I still remember when Toyota advertised the Nissan habit as the car for 1995 1900 hours stupid like a crow or something yeah and I still remember there was a time in this country when if you bought of what you own the first person on this block if you showed up with a farming car you got a little bit agreement hmm you got a little bit of grief and then it felt like they sold themselves it felt like we dropped the ball at some point as Americans as they you know I don't know what happened in Detroit and all that stuff I know that where's the highest population to Puerto Rico in this country I don't know you think it's the Bronx right well it's not it's a suburb outside of Cleveland why because in the 50s they took a bunch of Puerto Ricans and put them into this suburb to work at the car plants all the car plants shut down and that we ended up going other places and whatever and blah blah blah and blah blah blah and the farming cars started kicking our fucking ass why again I don't know was it the workmanship was it the quality all I know is if I got a fucking Toyota I could drive it for 80 thousand miles without stopping to get gas you know right you as a consumer and as an American you want to buy American products and you want to buy american-made products you know so there's a couple places now like beside Mexico there's class where we we have places now like in Indiana we had Plato yo and it has a couple places and they should bring it back I mean fuck it let's some you know so we trade we get someone tell you all this stuff which is a what kind of car are they they Japanese or Chinese the Japanese Japanese yeah and let some of us should get made over there that's part of is it NAFTA that's North American North American Free Trade Agreement so that's uh that's just I think I think I'm just talking on my ass here but I think that's just us Mexico and Canada so when we build a car in Mexico it's a lot cheaper developed that Club because of the rate yeah they're less blessed is cheaper to get land these people don't have anything else going on down there or not as much going on down there obviously as they do in America and some like heavily populated cities and so they can offer people much less money and they do it there's a lot of plants that do that that's here's the thing like it's the real question is do you think that this is just going to elevate these people and they're eventually going to catch up with the Western world and live the way that we're living right now in the United States like this ultimately a possibility of that or are we saying well we're always going to have these people that would treat less good and we're just always going to keep them in that position they're never going to get any better I mean which one is it it's either one of those two things or I mean it could possibly be that people just want shit cheaper so bad they don't care they don't care they don't care if your guys making $1 a week or whatever the fuck they make how much do they make if you had a guess if you guys how much does someone in a an automobile plant in Mexico make as opposed to an American worker I'm sure someone must have done some sort of a study it's weird man because if they were doing the exact same thing on this patch of dirt we would go what you can't pay that little then you say oh but down there everything's cheaper and they're giving these people an opportunity like why is it better here's the question why is it better than the way they've always been living in Mexico $2.00 per hour workers make $40,000 SUVs $2 an hour Jesus Christ do you imagine a person working all day and you hand them $16 you sir are a piece of shit could you imagine a guy busts his ass on an assembly line all day you give him $16 fuck you that's crazy started at Dollar 10 an hour oh you make more in prison that is ridiculous and that's Mexican money that's American money $1.95 I deal because if your your bottom line for your companies to always outdo every quarter at a certain time people start getting desperate and they start cutting environmental corners or cut in research corners they're doing whatever the fuck they have to do to keep their bottom line down and keep their profits coming in and that's what you could say about like these prescription drug companies people want to think that these companies are evil they're companies their job is to make money okay and they're caught up in a storm where they're allowed to make legal money and this legal money is fucking substantial it's a giant amount of money these pharmaceutical companies are making on opiate so people are dying left and right Joey left and right this is one of the craziest unspoken epidemics the human race is seen I know you rather hear the truth on everything I still talk to my drug dealers they were good to me when I needed them and from month-to-month I still talk to the Armenian I still talk to Don sleazy in fact Don sleazy just did a big move he got a couple wines a big movie that's awesome they do what they do I do what I do I have a family I got a call from the Armenian I saw him as rouse yeah baby did you see do about the Armenian is my favorite all the Armenian it routes he gave me a hug I saw with his kids and kids are you right now you don't know how many times I met him with his kids and he would put an 8-ball in my head you know I've been in that position now I had groceries and I hugged him and if I called you later you know yeah can I meet you I want to ask you a question I didn't know I thought he was gonna ask me if I still did blow I didn't know right you know I'm good I'm good and when I met the man made him what he wanted know was because you're a comedian and I just wanted to ask if you know anybody who go get bills you're free to take them because no no I'm stuck in pain oxy or whatever again I shook his hand I gave mohawk Joe I don't know nobody right yeah a week later I told him I'd ask cuz I do know a guy kind of sort of white dude in Hollywood right and I called him like a whole week later your meeting called me and he goes you know I'm sorry hold on and I went I looked when I called his white dude and he called me back and he said give me a couple days he called me back and what he told me was mind boggling what did the prices how much is getting of what you pay for pharmaceutical he hit me back and he told me three numbers on the phone with three different names of what this guy had and I'm not a drug dealer I called you I mean I just said listen this what he told me and this is what he wants and then I goes oh hey do tell him in a week I got a thousand of them I could not believe the amount of money for these pills well you know I never was a big pill head but oh my god the black market for pills is fucking ginormous and I knew this kid in Hollywood well comfortable I know him 15 years he's a big jujitsu Dumbledore and they can't close it it is mind boggling when you pay for pills well you know what happened right you know well it all started well this is what happened first of all they're obviously very addictive second of all something happened in Florida where they allowed people to get the prescription clinics everywhere it was basically what off-track betting is for gambling right that was heroin sales so you Joey everybody's got a tank you know sometimes my fucking neck bothers me after a couple of podcasts I need to get a little oxy my back just I can't sleep here you go have some oxy they would have a pharmacy attached to a doctor's office town of 3200 was flooded with nearly 21 million pain pills as addiction crisis worsened lawmakers say whoa a town of 3200 people was flooded with 21 million pain pills town West Virgina Jesus Christ people in in those towns like from the wild and wonderful West's of West Virginia what is that the whites of West Virginia remember that wonderful what kind of wines with wonderful whites of rest Virginia oxys xanax Nick whatever the little ones I got the little ones Springs you know like an anxiety I get him lately before I get like if I haven't gone on the road for a while oh really that Thursday morning oh my god you're Rogan as I'm getting ready I keep thinking like I'm fucking not packing right right I forgot something I forgot the hose and sleep apnea and I've been bite and a half of it you know what I even fall asleep I got on the plane I fall asleep but on the road people give me weird creepy things and it's hilarious so now I just go on the web daddy and you look for pill indicator and if it's something good I'll save it and at least I got it if I ever have an emergency if I'm lonely one night or something you pop all these little pills on there you know what dog when they told me to like I knew when that was a kid I would go to Central LA to Washington Square Park and I could get 810 milligram valium with the V in the middle that's the real deal when you're gonna fuckin still and they got a V in the middle cut out oh shit I could get eight of those for $10 and there were here's the question do you think if it was legal more or less people to use it or the same why you what is this trick day I'm curious we use gambling drugs pills you give people the green light dog we're fuckin we're creatures of habit we're all gonna fucking guy some of us are gonna control it listen there's some people that get knee surgery and neck surgery like yourself and you've thrown away the vicodin and there's other people that take that prescription and two years later they're shooting heroin yeah I don't understand it I think people feel any different I thought I have different holes in our genes bro well there's some people that like pain I'm not one of them but there's some people that genuinely like it they get pleasure out of it what kind of pain do you like I don't think this is the question I think they think there are syndromes where and it's probably fairly and turns it's not just one person it's like several people they could point out that experienced actual like pleasure like a serotonin burst from certain amounts of pain they don't feeI don't think they feel it is with the way we feel it and so they're always trying to do things to themselves and they say there's some of the people that get like a lot of piercings have that some people that get a lot of tattoos have that they start to feel it you want to feel it more so they want it burn it into themselves it's it and I'm not obviously not a psychologist but it's apparently pretty common theory another I want to talk to you about that what's the podcast can't leave after saying - like I'll watch the podcast where you were talking about because I wanted to do to really tell you the truth the podcasts are you were talking about that maybe some Jones John Jones actions what caused by head injuries could easily been I tell you not caused by not cause I could easily be a fact I gotta tell you some Joe Rogan again well let's go back to abuse from gambling or pills to mind with cocaine is a very tricky mom oh yeah and it takes a year off I'm just telling you this from experience because I learned a lot about nootropics from you I don't really know much about it but romanovski sent me two of his jugs it's the shakes that neural water orange juice that's a shit that got me into nootropics when I got off cocaine that came in the mail and I really drank and I didn't tell nobody my secret because I knew especially for a guy like me you know John Jones just 26 years always a phenomenal fighter I didn't think it really had anything to do with anything I think it was that good when you are on cocaine in that year afterward cocaine takes to pleasure patterns out of your mind out of your brain serotonin and melatonin I don't know don't correct me on this but I feel that it took me a year to 18 months for me to become a human again hmm and I haven't gotten hit not since I was about 13 I got beat up by the guy I tried the mug and I got hit in the head with a flashlight it really took me 18 months to embrace humanity yeah I want you to remember that I want you to think of that morning what happened in Santa Fe with when he ran the light he ran away from that hmm what where was he Jaime do you think he just woke up and was going to church no he was out for the night before yeah there's no pleasure you know you take it takes your mind a long time you know what's the thing when I get off the juice I gotta do something for my balls to grow again you'd have to take something called clomiphene okay what what there's a couple different ones apparently it's an estrogen blocker it blocks your estrogen that's actually one of the things that John tested positive for so how long would it take for me to get my balls back again it'd take you a little while a days they happy amount of time that you were doing it okay if you were if that's why you're only supposed to go on like a short cycle unless you're crazy body builder God those guys just stay on long I hated thing with the cocaine bro I thought about you statement that I went home and started writing and thinking I got off in November of 2007 it took me a year and a half just to become a human being to realize I was fat I was 400 pounds idea to go to Weight Watchers so we a team wants to realize I had to marry my wife took me a long time for my brains to think normal like anybody else did right so I want you to take that into consideration alright then I definitely do I never saying I agree taking a long time yeah you know when you do blow and you go on stage that's if I do blow three nights in a week and I go on stage I have no control sure Road I'm looking at you in the face you've seen me on stage I have no control I have no connection from my brain to what's coming out of my moon yeah I can't now you're going do you have are you speaking Tourette's no it was empty words there was no passion behind that that's why I wasn't funny you know you said to me you said it blocks love it blocks the love yeah that's it the love in between my brother cocaine and my is gone well that's what stimulants do stimulants ramp up the aggression and the impulsiveness and they ramp up your fearlessness they ramp up your courage you get disproportionate they ramp up your ego like some stimulants on some people some people obviously look there's people that can handle booze there's people that can't handle even a little booze and I think that's the same with stimulants I think that's the same with pretty much everything every almost every life experience in fact I think there's some people that can handle things and some people they can't and some people that can't at first and they eventually learn - someone sent me something about Rodney Dangerfield was fucking great man call from the New York time - relentless thing yeah send it to me fucking a it was amazing yeah I read that it's amazing it's amazing oh no Tate Fletcher take Fletcher sent oh he's great it was taped shut off to take Fletcher where is tape jam letter of recommendation Rodney Dangerfield it is an amazing piece who wrote this what is the name of the gentleman Alex Halberstadt Alex you made a masterpiece that's a fucking hell of an article about one of the greatest of all time when it comes to stand-up comedy and he just talks about the evolution of Rodney Dangerfield and how like it wasn't until he was like in his 50s that he really fucking got it together like and became the great stand-up that we know him as and his process for boiling down his material Joey it's a fucking amazing article joke I read it two times ray look I get T ISM what do you wanna do this special yes we're gonna do it special I'm gonna direct your comedy special we're just gonna figure out when to do it and where to do it June at the ice at the ice house is the place I think yeah let's do six shows let's do six let's do this do I want to do two Thursday to Friday to Saturday oh I wanna get those crazy weeknight savages is a different kind of animal that goes out on Thursday night one hour they're a little more ramped up going for one hour 15 minutes you don't you're gonna go crazies we're gonna do I just want it we're gonna capture the real Joey Diaz experience and we're gonna put together a special June we'll give everybody the details but this is the first special that I've ever even attempted to do something with other than my own so thank you very much for the opportunity you would be the guy fucking crazy yeah I think there's a lot of I think the name of it is immigrant because Tali emigrate mentalities perfect respect this already process right I'm ready to go I think the ice house is the place we've been there a million times it's home it's a family oh my god it's all yeah it's a great place to film and when that place gets Rocking holy shit it's going to Colorado sign I'm going to Colorado I'm flying in a daryl yeah I'm interviewing Antonio ladee's oh I'm gonna go show people right kidding that Bella show people the halfway house I'm gonna walk around Boulder I'm gonna tape all that I'm gonna have that up this fucking spring I got some shit I'm playing I was doing a little mixtape type of stand up drop we got to let these motherfuckers yeah I'm ready to shoot this special they don't had a great time in Charlotte man yeah you were in Durham yeah you and I would discuss in the comedy scene in both Carroll was amazing how I just want to thank you people and the week before that I was in Austin in that place is like this last time I got emotional in Austin like I don't know how many times I drove from Houston to Austin to do the Open Mic on Wednesday so wrong it in that little stage I could tell you look at your face five times and now was headlining and selling the place huh I just didn't walk in that dog I did the open mic for Margie and she would tell me you're too dirty for me I'm saying yeah I'll be a mother Austin is fucking it's really weird to see the growth of cities but not only that to see the growth of comedy in these cities yeah Portland OR again like that's what happened that's how Fidel took over Cuba just little growth in different areas and the internet the Internet has made people more aware of common 15 years ago we would go to Houston and be excited we would go to New York and maybe like three other places everything else was just a regular town yeah every town is excited about your Rogen Bert Kreischer fucking Chinese girl Amy Wong there's a lot of fucking excited about people coming in town you know it's a we've seen this growth like it's been an amazing like see I got into comedy on the tail and like when I got into comedy people were telling you it's over kid because five years before that emcees were getting fifteen hundred plus air and features again twenty five hundred plus air and headliners were getting five grand plus air and all sudden when I got in it I still remember the first notes he gave us was before you guys get into comedy I'm waiting to tell you what happens to the bubble it busted and he broke down or comments for getting paid I didn't give a fuck he was just trying to discourage us yeah he's wrong he's wrong you know what the bubble is not writing jokes yeah what's a bubble that was the bubble those the bubble in Boston I'm almost positive I don't know what people blaming of the excess of comedy on television at the time I don't believe that because the great ones are still there I think what happened was there was a lot of guys that were really really really really fucking funny because they had taken their act and polished that motherfucker like a diamond and they they brought it to you and it was just perfect it was a perfect act but it didn't change it was a perfect piece of work but they didn't write more some guys did but not enough guys did and so people would keep coming back to the shows they'd be able to say the jokes word-for-word year after year like they'd go to see some guys then we do the same act year after year and they never left Boston and it's a very unfortunate thing because like when it comes to like proficiency level there's guys like Steve Sweeney that used to kill in a way that you like oh my god what's the guy used to drink the white Russians in the container Don motherfucking Gavin guys having Boston when I start that you heard about you boy to Lenny Clark packing some heat let me mean when he was killing it and what's the guy that had the shows he was funny in 91 bro Anthony Clark yeah was fuckin throwing he's emerged a murder he used to fill the Fanueil Hall club with all screaming chicks I never saw anything like it because he was cute you know and he would he would be silly on stage girls loved him I mean to the point where that place would be overrun with girls it would be like 80 20 girls in this Fanueil Hall comedy connection we'd be like what the fuck like what other comic brings in girls like this that love him and then he's another one they'd see his same bits over and over and over again they didn't care they would find with it it's weird it was a weird time what fucked everybody up was people would go to see someone special like Kinison did a special and then he tried to do the material from the special on a show and the people already knew the material and they were like yelling out bits and fuckin up bits and I think comics then started realizing once you do like a real special and put it on HBO or something like that it makes you famous you got to throw that shit away and write a completely new set get out that's why it's so tough now tard because you try to develop your hour on the road then you put your eye on the road and you go out and follow a week to promote that hour and you got the same half you got a half hour of that hour yeah unless you're fucking Harry Houdini well now I've prepared for that already when I went through after the last time was a big fucking lesson everybody has that lesson we see that right now so time just plays out that's it yeah and those weeks when you're putting that out just stay home yeah just an old old embarrassed you don't try to do something stay home and get 15-minute bits of the show and once you get six of those 15-minute bits then you go out and put 45 together you start from scratch and then what you still got 30 to 35 minutes once you shot your bed yeah once you shot that 15 minutes you stood up 35 minutes to work on again there's no shame fucking your boy is an atom we stays home for a pup in here to work on her now and then oh is that Russell Russell Peters yeah he stays home for a long time he still does some gigs in the road be MCS and just talks to the crowd foxes both shout out to our little pep part the Friday night sound not the staples only the second comic to do it whoo-hoo so lot staples Gabriel did he really Jesus Christ Friday that's like 20,000 people fry them to Laker game that's a Laker game gabriel iglesias hold out a Laker game Friday night at the Staples Center gave him and Kevin Hart are the only ones to dunk an animal not a fuck doing it here's why he's funny anybody can go see him you can tell your kids to see him your mom to see him he's a nice guy everybody loves them you're getting what you want to see you're getting a funny comedian having a good time thousands I want to say that's at least like 18,000 people I think that might be torn for it might be 20,000 I think here's the beautiful thing I still remember him paying me 35 hours otherwise and I think I'll do the bicycle club and he would host Wow how many people 21,000 Jesus people powerful Gabriel Iglesias holy shit that's nuts baddest fucking yeah there's there's some the height of comedy yeah he's right at the top right now him and Kevin Hart in terms of like being able to do that especially being able do that in LA he's a hero in LA he's done more shows consecutively at the ice house and sold out like fucking ten years ago he was doing that he would do like Monday shows Tuesday shows two shows Wednesday two shows two he was just fucking crank them out man he was taking people out to breakfast after his shows yeah Christmas Eve he still get he stood those two shows on Christmas Eve that's amazing he could do shows at 3:00 in the afternoon he would do shows the ice house like whenever he wanted and they were packed three afternoon fuck it pack let's go whoo people wanted to see it have a couple of drinks watch some funny comedy why not thank God it's just just the amount of people are they going out to comedy I'm just honored to be a part of this he doing you know Joey you and I've known each other for a long time now and so we've seen like a couple of ways oh my god no way nothing like this fuck were you at The Wiltern sold-out New Year's Chappelle and John John they're at the fucking Forum they were sold out - he was sold out but he did a warm-up tonight before somewhere else like yeah let's just try it out just to see it for us and that's sold out - like people are out and about chat yeah people are round about well we're we're very very lucky to have Dave out there right now like like doing a lot of comedy like he's the top of the food chain and he's doing a lot of comedy did two specials last year and two specials this year and they're fucking good man from DC that is a really good special that's a whole I enjoy how about every agent told you the belly room would work it's not gonna work you dumb fuck their silly family room when you get into a groove in the belly room okay let me break something down here at the Comedy Store and again you're gonna go we heard this guy's no you haven't heard this room because I just found this one out fucking three weeks ago when you got sick that night and you couldn't I covered for you in the belly room you had the flu and they called me that went to the belly flu and I know I write to the belly room and I have this certain energy it just wasn't doing it the belly room doesn't where the belly room doesn't require the efficiency that the original how so so you want to slow it down a little bit in the belly rooms are you saying okay so I'm sparring with you and when I one 50% we're doing 30 now right in the belly roll if we do 50 it's a little too aggressive you did too right there the energies right there I learned this after 20 fucking years of doing spots that remember the belly room was where I learned to story-tell before that I was rushing to the punchline and not getting the joke out the belly room was where I learned to sit back a little bit and explain what the fuck you it is you're trying to tell us why you just kept telling me what you see there's no segue here there's nothing Joey right you just eating some girl's asshole it's great we don't want to hear that we want to hear how you got that I learned that in 99 in the belly room fucking around and I went back up there a couple of weeks ago for me the main room I got to come out like a fuck in the main room I got to come out like Mike Tyson when he beat up who did he beat up in Atlantic City knocked him out in the 57 seconds of the brothers with the mouthpiece these pink things Michael Spinks ie dick in the main unless I come out jabbing crossing one two it's a different room I gotta come out one two in the main room right in the original room the gauge is who you're following hmm I gotta follow Chris D'Elia with a I gotta who came out this year who came out I can Travis with a flying side kick Fabricio version I gotta come out with a flying side kick at the original rule there's no people break it down for you in the original room you gotta follow Joe Rogan Chris D'Elia or Bill burr like I had a couple weeks ago I got to come out from the curtain okay and throw fly sidekick upward this hasn't been done since Bruce Lee in the Chinese connection there's no it's not only me and you would usually do a flying psychic from a naval ground right no I gotta go upward hmm that's the comedy in the fucking original room that's where you see me go bananas where you see me at my best like crazy red in the face about to have a heart attack pitching your heart out on stage you have to come out with a flying site that's a crazy move you but you're go on a vertical or a tremendous up you're on your back kick and you're got to get on my shoulders and kick up and try to get you in the jaw that's the original room the belly room I can rest on my right hook I could rest on my one to the belly room you can I could breathe and just throw one two and keep you off me do you breathe deep get my composure and even though you hit me with some of those zoom Gayo slugs oh god no if I keep my hands up and stay away from your right I'll be okay that's the belly room that's why the belly room I always thought would be a great place to shoot you know what's great about the belly room is the same thing that's great about the it--how the Icehouse annex the second room yes that's that yeah there's no room for an act there's no room for an act it's too intimate like you have to figure out where's the no-fat aspect of the bit and you got to be tuned into the bit they feel about 55th birthday up there woo up at the ice house what days that it's a Saturday the 19th cynth I can't get the Comedy Store so I got the original room I got the small room at the Ice House in the 17th and 19 and then the 18th I got the original room I got the belly room at the Comedy Store and it's the leg before George Washington's birthday so I got people doing that one too so I'll turn 55 that weekend oh shit I'm working out with uncle Joey I only tried 10 or 15 bucks I'd do that once a month and I go on this stage too and you just fuck around you just we think I write down a notebook that I don't really know about hmm and we develop it together up there sometimes it's phenomenal nine other ten it really is phenomenal it's a good idea what I'm gonna tell you why was I'm at 30% I purposely didn't edible purposely I wouldn't do that at the Comedy Store Saturday night no no I purposely did that able to take the edge off okay I might even have a shot of alcohol whoa oh just one that's three points yeah cuz I don't need much alcohol so I'll do it edible and have a little shot of alcohol at the ice house and tape it and always get one or two great things Joe Rogan I'm not gonna tell you an hour of greatness but because you're so relaxed and they know what they're getting it's a very different show The Comedy Store listen how do you sharpen metal with metal Comedy Store stones you do uh we do we do a special in June May I gotta go to the comedy store three nights four nights a week that's Jim and throw it the who's next no no no no Thalia get up there okay and do take downs for now take them down I don't care how is that's what you do before you shoot you think you need all of it right you need the sets you need the writing you need to set all of it you need the writing you need to working out yeah yeah absolutely you know I think you need you need friendship I think that helps I think that would I think that when you sent help to me on the phone the other day and you also know that you got it when I get there you gotta leave some stuff to aggravate me but I've thought about this many times like who would I be without you guys like who would I be without you who died be without Eddie who'd be without red band who would I be without Ari who would I be without Duncan I think you know to save the Tom Segura think about the same thing who would I be these these people like Bert they mean a lot to me like they're very important people and then there's your family which is through the moon that's that that kind of love is very weird that kind of love is over whelming how how much it changes who you are yeah but you were talking about at our G kundo the Bruce Lee book and you were saying that you know a lot of excerpts we're stolen and yeah I don't even know we're not even that's not the proper word that I used plagiarize I have a tower Joey Diaz and half of that tile is what I learned from Joe Rogan the other half of that tau is what I learned from my hard work and with Duncan none of us are very original I just kick it up a bit one thing I love about you is you then sell t-shirts happen show you don't need to do nothing when I go into it down I focus on five shows no wonder your podcast I don't want to go see the statue I really don't you right you dare to kick ass I'm there to go to get them a good meal after the first show look it's a small club it sold out let me not go out there and take pictures let me focus on the important thing I'm 55 I gotta give me 150 fuckin percent right and those two the towel you know I'm up early I do my radio I'm up early get out of there every once in a while on Saturday you gotta have a you gotta have a drink with the audience you know shot on stage or whatever you know what I've come to think of myself as one piece of I'm a piece of three or four you guys I fire you want the truth re I like our ease relaxation on stage re it takes four chances like we all what all three of us love to take chances yeah that's why we do what we do you're not gonna get the same hour year after fucking year not even close we also have a similar style of mixing everything everything yeah everybody has their own town man yeah you know Bruce Lee just he just wanted to teach you how to combine it and that's what we're doing right now for sure you think I'm Johnny original I take a little bit you mean anything I learned from Bert yeah I learned from Tom I learned from Bill burr I learned from Dave Chapelle and now this is your art again this everybody's armbars the same whether I go to you or John John gonna show me the same Brian right yeah it's how I do it yep yep it's the same point it's a really good point I think there's no way you could ever say any one person is not influenced because every single style of stand-up comedy is in some way or another originated with like the Lenny Bruce's and you know the the Dick Gregory's and the you know the guys who are doing it wait did the Dangerfield's guys doing a way back in the day even Bob Hope all those guys they started this thing you got to think the world has had no stand-up comedy up until like what a hundred and fucking fifty years or something that's nothing this shit just started and the old was one of the first guys to do it mark motherfucking twain mark motherfucking twain would do readings of his book and it was funny and people would laugh he was in front of people rocking he was killing who's telling stories and reading and people thought he was hilarious I'm sure but he was a just very popular right every years ago yeah days living proof that that standard form a a form of this art form existed before yeah it's some civilization I did read that a couple years I'm sure yes there was some store and because and now I see myself on stage like my tape my sets now Bruce's yeah that's I loved that levy Bruce said shit that you didn't know people said fuck yeah that wasn't dirty no just a certain word like when I go on stage that you know you don't want to know maluca in the place malukas rose murder what's he what's he's right right right malukas just bad luck but that's something Lenny Clarke would say the fuck were you he put them a look on me we're all we're not plagiarizing or doing anything like that no we're influences were influenced and what's wrong with one thing that's important is we're all real fans of comedy I know you're still a fan you still enjoy watch his comedy he'll love it he's I've been going I go to the fourth wall a lot I wrote the fourth wall was what Mickey told Rocky to do because he wanted he somebody took oh no I'm sorry Apollo took rocky to the dirty gym I listen look at they look at these motherfucking he back no no no took him to his own black gym and he goes I wanted you to look at these guys so you can look at their eyes and he goes my boy in your eyes used to be like that Raoul that's right he doesn't when your eyes used to be like that rockso lately I'm going before I go out and then I go to the fourth wall in North Hollywood and I pay five dollars to do five minutes and don't rule is you have to sit day you know most open my should do your states time when you leave Bryant you have to sit there and watch others well I'll tell you something the last six weeks I've learned more from watching these open my curse also realized that where I was when I was one of these guys I wanted what I had right now I wanted to be a headliner I wanted to not be a rich guy but I wanted to just be funny I wanted to be accepted as a comedian and ever since I've been going in a fourth war I go there three or four nights a week Joe Rogan I paid five hours until five minutes I'm no better than anybody else but the main thing is he asked me what I want to go up and I always tell them towards the end because I want to watch these kids enjoy every time I leave their Briley laughing and I fucking learn something really and I'm back no I'll call in there Joe Rogan hmm just fucking eight people watching you do five minutes I want you to think about when you were doing five minutes and what was going through your I'm just telling you my heart's beating man because I still remember bombing and leaving there thinking now I'm gonna have to get away the job or now you're gonna have to get a cook job these guys all have day jobs they all talk about their shitty jobs but every time I go to the fourth war broke my fucking learn something I go there some nights I go to flappers I go there some nights I go to the store I go there some nights I go no hahaha I do it that way but I always go there and every time I go there I always go there with like five minutes planned bro it doesn't even hit this age because from watching those guys I learned something and I remember something and I just come up with this crazy story so I look at it as like like doing kettlebells yeah that's a good way to look at it I really do I look at these young guys and I remember that pain and that confusion that I had mm-hmm that fucking feeling you had when you weren't open Michael and your friends are telling you you were funny but you still had to drive the limo or keep the paper job route or still drop off papers or whatever the fuck job you said you had you told me the story about meeting a Atlantic's and all that you're still in that crossroads of comedy well you don't know what to do but you know and your fucking heart that you just can't wait to be a headliner if somebody would just give you a chance back down I wasn't even thinking I could ever be a headliner I was just hoping I could make a living I never thought I'd wind up being success but you mean living you mean food one bedroom yeah cable-tv there was a guy that had a fucking loft he was the king the guy had a loft they had taken a schoolhouse and turned it into condominiums this guy I never I'll never forget I looked up to him but I couldn't believe where he was living deejay hazard that's his name hilarious comedian oh my god yeah sure well DJ has always been a real nice guy and excellent very funny very funny guy always has been but I remember he had a like a loft apartment I remember everybody talked about it it's like what this got brick walls inside he's like he was the king he was living like an adult but he was he was a stand-up comedian like everybody else we had thought about like you know you live in like you're barely getting by stuffing a bunch of guys into a house you know there was a lot of like comedy flop houses or comedians would wind up moving in together or you're living in some shitty apartment you could barely afford or you live with your girlfriend or something so it's it's weird when you go back and think about it you know like you could have quit at any time think about it think about your early days when it's terrible and just bombed all the time like it wasn't for John Leguizamo yeah I watched him do a set one night at the yellow triple and in front of a nine people in his mind he was at the garden oh wow like I get it now but would you be to pick I left at home you know who one of the most proud moments as a young comedian when I was at The Comedy Store and I did a set in front of you know like literally like maybe five or six people but I did it is hard as I would do it in a regular room and I heard in the back Paul Mooney going laughing in support you know how Paul Mooney would laugh and support and you would go oh shit I just got the green light from Paul fuckin Moonie like Paul Mooney was laughing at my shit and he came up to me after a show and he goes he goes you're real comic he's like you did that show in front of all those people and he goes you knew that there was five fucking people in that room you did that show like it was packed because that's a real comic because you made me laugh that's what you live in comedy when a guy like Paul Mooney says that to you when you're just coming up you're like holy shit like I might be able to figure this out I might be able to do this it's big right someone coming up you know it's crazy when you do a spot at the store you know you're in the big leagues bro like no matter where I do a spot when I travel that's one day when I might destroy it there is day night Tuesday night you know you're in some fucking good company you're doing something right yes or you did something right yeah it's uh I love we comics are in the room I love laughing at comics I love going to the store early and

home we stopped at a diner to get to me I literally fell asleep head down on the table I literally was like a drugged-out well you are the Dramamine yeah I was on Dramamine and I was only like 150 pounds back then 154 pounds I was like what what I was weighing when I was competing and I never did anything I didn't do anything I didn't drink I didn't smoke pot Indian I didn't do shit so when that drama hit my system my sister was like check please it just shut down I couldn't had no tolerance at all I felt completely asleep at a diner but I tried to take with my friend Jimmy tuck he's way bigger than me I think I just overdosed Harvey Weinstein gets out of rehab and he was come on I'd let him on if you're coming on to why cuz we're gonna have some fun with them oh yeah it's hotboxing we want out we want the fucking real cheese you can't you can't you can't have them anywhere you know that guy especially in the middle we're joking around folks especially in the middle of a trial cuz he's in the middle of like a ton of trial well he comes back he's gonna get charged off for sure something's gonna happen there's so many different trials and turns like civil lawsuits and stuff there's a lot of women saying he did horrible things it's a undoubtably there's no way he's gonna skate something's gonna happen something Civic trial criminal trial some usually have civil trials absolutely we're changing as a species that's what's happening and in the way it's like we're making it up as we go along there's a lot of rocky things were happening a lot of chaos and but there's awareness of like what you should and shouldn't do to human beings in terms of like forcing yourself on people and you know fucking them when they say no it's like rape and the idea that we're still doing that in 2018 and people are doing at a really high level it's like boy I have creepy things I'm fucking town of course right off the bat as soon as I got here I heard the creepiest fucking things yeah more you got into like the movies like I already read creepier things and I saw creepy behavior and listen man you never want to call a fucking spade a spade because you get in trouble but you look at Kevin what's his name spark wasn't that which guy Kevin Spacey's Kevin Spacey you can't tell he sucks dick point I knew he would suck a dick part time if you looked at Kevin Spacey if you look at that fucking dude Lee Harvey Weinstein you can't tell that that dude would make you suck his dick before think about that and all these people took pictures with him but that'd be to the fucking agents to actually set you on that mission to Lee Harvey the fucking hotel room I want to know where the fuck they are they didn't know that Lee Harvey was going to come out with a massage and ask you to suck his fucking dick or watch him naked but we knew for a long fucking time everybody knew when there's a fucking gap when you have a dream and you have power a lot of things could happen I mean I'm no fucking Liberace well I got my dick sucked at The Comedy Store just because of being a comedian and somebody thought that you were like had supernatural powers it's fucking crazy and if you don't know about fucking Hollywood listen man they've been fucking people - they're dead fees look at this fucking Marilyn Monroe they killed that bitch and you know who else was a dirty motherfucker that fucking Liberace yeah that guy was making you sign contracts making you fucking have plastic surgery making you are you fucking kidding me there's been some creepy fucking shit in this town that leaving got away with four fucking zillions a years and now and I'll tell you what man I'm all for the movement I'm all for it I have a daughter you have daughters I have sisters I got friends I tell you what fucking bothers me the most I tell you the only thing that bothers me out of this you know what bro who was him Papillon with Steve McQueen I don't remember Dustin Hoffman was he if he finger-banging 73 shut the fuck up all right shut the fuck up people change I'm not the same guy who kidnapped cat Bell in 1987 I'm not sorry Joe I'm not so how you gonna come back at me about something I did in 1987 I was a different guy I was doing blow I'd ask you to finger bang you you can't do that that I don't want to do don't then somebody's fuckin career cuz he stuck a finger in your ass in 92 and now it came back to you to the scale of amnesia you can't do that to me you want to call me out personally call me the fuck out call me at home and go hey man in 94 one that you asked me if you could eat my asshole you were wrong listen I was doing an 8 ball a day what do you want from me all right right I resolved that issue that I understand but don't call me Alan some I did 1972 people fucking change bro that's what pissed me that's a giant there's some tiny gaps were talking about like Piven it was 1985 and don't fucking call me out if you call me out call me out with a friend what were you talking about look at what level though if it gets to rape that's all listen from that's not even a lot that word never had in my mind right I'm talking about if I was coked out of the bar one night now what I'm telling I told you your titties were banging alright and I want to put a coke rock in your asshole right you can't come at me for some in 1988 cuz I used to do it every other night that was my opening line listen you assholes on fire what's it gonna take for me to stick my tongue in that fucking thing if I make that day Jimmy you know you're not gonna listen you're not gonna get a piece of ass by selling somebody real estate you gotta sell them dick well what the ones that it works on cuz the ones you want like if you can go up to a gal and say that to her yeah if I knew you were a girl and I know you did coke and you had that certain look in your eyes what's the coke look the coke look that is when you do cocaine you do dirty fucking things so when you look at a girl that's doing cocaine and she's like I said she suggests to you that she's going back to your hotel with you it's on nobody goes back to their hotel with you when they have a boyfriend if you're doing coke it's on the Senators keep getting go higher and higher well coke apparently makes people promiscuous right right makes people go fucking bananas to go suck your dick so you take somebody's wife up to your hotel room and it's 6:00 a.m. and she's doing coke with you you'll notice that one of the times she comes out of the bathroom the button will be open then the next time she comes out she'll come out to tell your story and her pants will come out and she'll bite them in front of you little things start to happen to give you signs and pretty soon you like this enough and then take off your pants let me see doo doo doo doo doo that's what the what gets me right now is the the 20 call out the 30 you call out man gonna ruin Dustin Hoffman's career he was giving out foot rubs he was asking asking acting creepy but you know what bro part of that shit we allow that creepiness and society we turn their fucking heads you follow me here I'm sure you're not the type to let return you and I'm not the type to turn my head but I notice it you know they say the cocaine thing is a real interesting one because you see people making crazy decisions just a real nutty fucking decision oh you sell a Tony Bennett Tony Eversole system so your whole system is delusional I remember going out like after a long night and not sleeping okay now it comes to a point where you have this paranoia where you don't leave the house but now that comes to a paranoia that you're gonna leave the house and bump into somebody hmm and guess what sometimes you actually do you go to a 7-eleven to get a soda and you bump into somebody who's the same predicament as you that happened to me once I was I went by Gavin's I think I was staying with Ralphie and I went by Gavin's and I'm the first floor there was this chick that we used to be a stripper and she had a daughter that was about 13 kind of ugly she was like Pavarotti we used to call her Pavarotti cuz she had thick fucking eyebrows and shit but the mother was kind of a freak and I got up like that like I was up all night it was like 9:00 in the morning and I was about to call my drug dealer to get a package at 11:00 they keep the party alive and I bumped into that animal in the stairway and she asked me like you know I get some coke I was on my way was engaged oh I'll never forget this she was engaged and I go I'm on my way right now as she goes do you want to split a gram I go yeah yes Lily grab it was like 30 bucks we went over there we split the fucking gram we went back her daughter was sleeping so we had to do the coke in the hallway on the first floor all right understand way right and that's what we did to blanks we were just thinking they have looking at each other and she's like don't even ask I just told the guy that was bothering me all night I wouldn't give him a saintly I wasn't it's 10:00 in the morning I do something here yeah do something and I started swapping spit with her next thing you know she's sucking the helmet and when I went to come she goes don't do that and I came on the jeans oh I think it was all over her jeans it's 11:30 in the morning you come on some of these jeans you're coked up I felt like a piece of shit that's like the worst of it I see her three nights later and I'll compadre and she's with her boyfriend I'm like oh no and her boyfriend comes over to me he goes hey man we might have a problem here and I'm like what what's going on he goes I might go a little bit angry I don't know what happened but I think you should apologize I felt like I came on the pants I should suck my dick tell you that like that's how easy the coke world is oh my god like she told her boyfriend was angry with me it's none of your business why but so he came over to me cuz I don't know what's going on you're a nice guy I don't know what's going on if I going you know why she blew me 11 the morning I thought I came on his jeans I shot a load of the jeans she couldn't fucking you know what are you spraying your jeans to get shit off I'm gonna shout it out shout out that sperm if she fucking wanted to that old coach sperm no vitamins in my system I weighed 380 pounds those jeans were stained for life I did the dumbest shit on all the house drugs the dumbest shit and especially the year it took me to get off it what's going on someone at our door okay who the fuck is this paging me of 546 in the morning cracker dawning what's going on max probably someone dropping something off anyway my brother nothing we got to get out of here eventually eventually I'm good I'm having a good time it was good to see I was good to see to man Jamie my man I thought about you when I saw fucking the Crescent I come back against them I thought about you would you bet that one yeah I lost on that when I'd tell me Karl and some stuff ah fuck I go straight up you love those sucker bets go straight out in a lottery why went on 20 bucks when you can win 200 no because I'd rather raise my percentage of bet one and double up on it and just worry about what why am i sweating two moves with the fucker - sweat too loose I don't want to get in that long game oh my god fall too deep like you're talking about the whole four pieces what's the next fight of exciting we got some great cards to go over the rock over marrow fight that's a great Romero and then you got March seventh khabib against Tony for comin at you from all directions that's gonna be the rook in New York are you doing a show that weekend yeah isn't it April it's April right April April 7th I believe yeah that's that's a crazy fight is a hard time I'm handsome Rock'em Sock'em robots fight 23 that's all who the fuck knows fight you know that's one of those fight be like oh that's gonna be a crazy one Tony Ferguson's a bad motherfucker and khabib nurmagomedov is already one of the scariest guys I've ever seen competing ever malls people already this is his first shot at the title just stop and think what would happens if that fucking savage gets the title that guy's some mashes people what he did the Edson Barboza was supernatural it's like he's not even the same thing you said something during that fight that said it all there was one point in a fight that you said look at the look in essence face yeah and I've had that look and that's when you're getting chased by 18 people he had a look that he didn't know no no he went into like a survival situation like like when you see a deer that's getting attacked by a crocodile or something they have this like survival thing were you like you're just trying to survive obviously deers not the same that's a terrible analogy correct this what I think is that Barbosa had realized that like there's no way he's gonna beat this guy on the ground it's not even close like I think if he went to that fight you probably thought he'd be little stuff more takedowns and probably able to get back off his feet cuz he was doing that with a lot of guys in camp but once that guy gets ahold of you there's an acceptance that certain fighters go through where they they're locked down like holy shit like they're just drained from this animal mauling trying to retain their energy trying to recharge their batteries get back in it and you gotta realize that guy had some problems one of the best fucking kickers ever ever he's one of the best kickers ever that fucking guy is the fastest switch kick I've ever seen in my life outside of like professional MoIT I like sanchow or bull cow or something like that he's got a world-class left leg kick I mean whoo he's fast as fuck he couldn't keep that guy off him that was scary to me where he drilled for hours he drilled take down the fence he drills everything there was but he never drilled this couldn't do it like there was one boy where he looked and it was like wait a second I've done everything I can I even trained with the Giants taking me down for a week different Adam never felt this I don't know how he keeps you down on either his control that side is fucking something that is there's certain guys are never a grappling skill that it's very hard to see when you're looking at even if you you're a skilful grappler yourself you're looking at someone like you like why is he able to do that to everybody like what what is he doing differently like why is this one guy being able to do certain things that other people can't do and there's a few of those guys out there were you watching me just go Jesus like what the fuck but he was the number one guy in that category because he's never been defeated he said one moment of adversity in the Octagon I get clipped by a punch from Michael Johnson I can't think of a single round he's lost not off the top my head at least I mean may have lost rounds on some judges scorecards but he's essentially mauled every motherfucker they put in front of him he's an animal so this guy vs. Tony it's phenomenal fight cuz Tony is a savage and Tony fights very well off of his back he has a seriously dangerous guard you can't sleep on them he's durable as fuck he can knock you out he never gets tired and he's his game as they come and he's a fucking champ right now he's the interim champ you know when he beat Kevin Lee with a triangle he'd beat a top guy like Kevin Lee with a fucking triangle that's a big move Tony's dangerous nasty Darce chokes his Darce choke as well the bag that was great but he wasn't ready for Tony Kevin Lee was sick too that's the heads direction no time unquestionably yeah he wasn't Tony as is too high level that was too you could see in the second round perhaps I would like to see that fight again we have to say that but I think that if you wanted to have them fight again and Kevin Lee can go in there that fight healthy I think you'd see a very different fight I don't you would see Tony I'm not saying that you would see Tony lose or Kevin win but I would think you would see a Kevin Lee that could sustain his performance longer I think being drained from staff is just there's no if I've had it before it's the worst your body can something worse but it's not good your body goes into a very weakened state it's you are not the same thing you just not you couldn't if you're a real professional you can go out there and do your job and a lot of guys have a lot of guys have fought in one Luke Rockhold be Chris Weidman on antibiotics how about that he was fighting off staff when he beat Chris fucking Weidman that's how good Luke Rockhold is guys have done it but that's not him at a hundred percent he wanted he wanted 70 or 80 or whatever the fuck it was you know there's no doubt about it staph infections and antibiotics both fuck you up and Kevin Lee I believe opted to not take the antibiotics so after the fight so he didn't want a week in his system but he's still weakened by the staff fuck fuck Demetrius Johnson versus TJ Dillashaw super fight targeted for UFC to 26 in co-main event oh shit to 26 they got some good cards coming up that's the greatest Kevin countless leads me don't sleep motherfucker this game might run by by a shit those motherfucking fights are getting better and better now again I love to see Steve day become a superstar me too I think I think he deserves it and I think you look at where that guy is right now like what is more American than this guy like you said with his immigrant name what is more American than a guy who works right now as a fireman while he's the UFC heavyweight cheese in the world and he's a great dessert good and broke the record broke the record for the most defensive beat the scariest contender we've seen in a decade you know again I watch the podcast a lot and he had those guys on you were talking about the tower Jake we know and I think that a lot of people really miss out on the main thing and this is what you miss out with me and everybody everybody I miss out with you know no other people you mean yeah like whenever I watch these Bruce Lee fucking things and I see these kids are the 30 talking about Bruce Lee I get sick to my style because Bruce Lee didn't bring martial arts to this country and he gave immigrants hope problem I was a kid I just come from Cuba The Green Hornet on Sunday nights I would throw you out the window hmm the watch this you know when I was five and then they canceled them and then he came back with the first one that's supposed to be Fist of Fury man some argue that was a flat that didn't do that good that introduced him it was the one and 71 to Chinese connection when I was eight that's great movie that really put this country over if you were it didn't mean you were a tough guy how many how many on YouTube how many black guys are there I think they Chinese then they got wisdom what was the guy used to send you videos of a bunch of those things make people tougher he gave immigrants blacks he gave them hope I mean black dudes started dressing like Bruce Lee and you know doing crazy shit and wearing gun few hours kung fu' outfits you know who he's wrong about Bruce Lee cuz I saw it and I saw his death and I saw how people would go to Chinatown because there was no internet fighters till today when they go to Seattle they go to his grave I went to his grave I went to his grave took a picture and gave it to Eddie Griffin that's why Eddie Griffin will always be indebted to me cuz I gave a picture of Bruce Lee's brave kid that's honest Bruce Lee when he died there was no internet they didn't report Bruce Lee's death on the news how do people find out about it you found that a week later when the Chinese newspaper hit New York and then in Chinatown it came out from Chinatown when I heard about it I was forced to go to Chinatown and get the paperwork with the pictures everybody had to pay him it was an open casket in China and then the open casket was glass around him and him nobody believed Bruce Lee was dead then after the dragon came out but I being but a boom everybody made a million dollars and nobody said nothing but his death bro fucked people up like you know Bruce Lee gave hope because the Vietnam War was going on and there was something else going on in this country that people don't remember that destroyed this country you know it shot this country down what when the beatles broke up jesus fucking christ did people lose their mind so you always get into arguments with people Led Zeppelin's a good band yeah but wait till the Beatles get back together bitch because they were always threatening you with the Beatles dawg I like Jethro Tull yeah but they're not compared to the Beatles so until John Lennon got shot then those people had a voice fuck you in the Beatles bitch you know your Springsteen is the man you know what you would love go to the the Mirage show The Beatles Cirque du Soleil show it's called love fucking crap when did you go credible couple weeks ago you were there doing with my family okay and I wanted to see the Cirque de Soleil show it's supposed to be amazing right I see the original circus du Soleil well there's that guy nobody's problem the beatles broke up this country went to a tough time you have no fucking idea now you don't have any idea if you're you're young you have the Beatles let it be out on the end that it would let it be dog that was it people will crack why people were crack Jack fucking incredible song when you think about when John died when John Lennon died what happened in New York that's Sunday you think about that that was amazing to look at now he was on another level the whole band was on another level they were very psychedelic you know the Beatles were breaking up Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali but also in 1973 this is a very interesting fact at 50 dollars at $15 ticket sales at $15 $12 $10 ticket sales this country grossed three billion dollars in concerts really go watch the 70s on CNN the one about music I can't see so much good music came out of that time that toured they had a list of who was on tour Zeppelin the stones who when I was in high school we always went to concerts you always in concerts high school we went to see Jay geils Band yes I saw Johnny Winter I saw Jethro Tull I saw George Thorogood and destroyers he did a 50/50 tour in 1981 that dude he did 50 states the 50 days that was the big thing to do George Thorogood man destroys dude people forgot about Jay geils Band J giggles band that was about freeze-frame angel is a centerfold he was married to Faye Dunaway that singer
