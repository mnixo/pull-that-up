the Joe Rogan experience I don't want to fuck this up but it looks like it says Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa I'm probably fucking that up but this is how it's pronounced I know how to spell it you look like that one guy that got arrested for murdering his wife what's that phil spector show up for court yeah with these crazy wigs on he's got a brother the real Elon Musk he's a super genius that exists in the lotus position floats in midair and some wheat silo somewhere in New Hampshire and they go visit him a couple of times a month I wouldn't mind I would be like give me a free Tesla every a couple days they probably got that dude in the bunker with Dick Cheney right now Kimball musk what if yeah I want to know what Kimball does he teaches kung fu he's in those videos that I always post on Instagram he's just imagine if his brother was just uh not oh look at him handsome bastard trading coffee at my age 45 regional manager for a Blockbuster Video always from South Africa which guy it was we were having a good fucking time though that was before anybody knew who rampage was I misunderstood him because he was going by the slug once again like 99 2000 I had finished at UCLA where it first like got my taste in jujitsu at UCLA and then I graduated and I went to teen punishment and I get on the mat and Fabiano IHA was coach there at the time one of the best arm bars in the day Monday was sick especially far side and so we I got on the mat and I shake hands with his dude and I said hey my name is Jimmy and he goes I'm rampage and I thought like I misunderstood him I was like I can't sit you know I was like it's a Randle or something and I just misunderstood him and all I knew is I knew armbar in a footlocker at the time and he was so big as I was gonna fit like him and and I went for Ollie straight full locks on that get oh my god oh my god I'm got him and then I got and he lifted me up to the ceiling with one arm just around my ass just went boom dropped right on me and Fabiano comes running over mad like starts screaming at him and he walks off turns to me he goes that we're cool right yeah we're fine man I'm a wrestler as you know no big duck and slam before and that was it Simon met Quentin man back then ladies and gentlemen Jeff Novitzky how are you buddy what's up Joe doing good I don't have to ask you do you mind the nickname the Golden Snitch it's the first thing I was gonna bring up this Golden Snitch bullshit I just want to say it's not my nickname it's Brendan jobs he came up with it a hundred percent on his own who's gonna ask you it's all good though it's all right it's all good so a couple funny stories about that so when do you come up with this about a year ago at least yeah so so people in the office started coming up to me saying hey Golden Snitch and what the hell is that I did a little research I see something about Harry Potter or some character name there I'm like what the hell does this have to do with me so about a month ago somebody lets me know hey check out Wikipedia so for whatever reason there's a Jeff Novitzky Wikipedia page you go that page now it says says actually my formal name Jeffrey John Nowitzki aka the Golden Snitch so last week Donna Mark aleni you know Donna long 15 year employee of the UFC now works with me and talked about her little laters a great asset to what we're doing she sends me a text she says check this out so she's got one of those Amazon echoes Alexa I think so she says Alexa who's Jeff Novitzky and Alexa's name says Jeffrey John Nowitzki aka the golden snow so thanks a lot job what have you done just beady eyes locked in on me and I think this thing's gonna kill me and so I'm thinking you know when I say I'm thinking I don't know if I'm thinking I'm just I just remembered what I what was kind of going through my head at the time I thought oh fuck I'm gonna die and my protections right there like I'm gonna die this is that sense you situation where I'm dead and they talk about it and he could have saved himself but his guns on the ground and I think that that was like go for the gun was my whole thing so I start to go for the gun Yanis would have been here as I remember it and so I start to go for the gun and realize fuck I don't have time to get to my gun and it's three feet away that bear is like right there coming so fast so fast so I kind of do like a football Juke move left right and then wheel around right do like a spin with my back and then start running to the left and at that point Yanis it I didn't know this at the time because I looked at some pictures afterwards kind of piece everything together so Yanis was sitting right next to me I think he got up to turn there was some trekking poles right here he grabbed the trekking pole so probably well I was joking he reached around grabbed the trekking Pole swings around hits the bear in the face Jesus so then the I see the bear running off then I see someone going down the mountain with the bear I'm thinking he's got someone so I grab my pistol start going down the mountain yelling cowering up I guess I count off and everyone's like what right and then Garrett pops up out of the bushes and his eye he's like wide-eyed so Garrett aka dirt dirt myth was the one who was on top of the somehow he's on the Bears back so I think when the bear wheeled around he like hit him and he ends up on the back so I saw just legs and bear going down the mountain I saw his legs on the back of the bear Sam thought like maybe the bear had him in his jaw yeah that's what I was thinking yes and then we kind of circled up around the tree and the real scary part was that bear so he was so thick you really couldn't see you could see maybe as far as the wall is from us with the trees feet yeah and just real thick brush and you'd hear the bear charge in again and we only have the two pistols Yanis and I and the the the wind was so strong there's no way we could use bear spray so we hear the bear charging in and me and you honest like pistols out ready waiting for this thing to pop out at point-blank range and then it would anywhere yelling bear and then that thing stops and then it would just you crash off and then it would charge in from the other direction like circle around the tree the other way and did that I think three times that was just under it's like a horror movie where it keeps coming in from different angles oh it was weird it was not a fun feeling you just felt so small [Applause]
