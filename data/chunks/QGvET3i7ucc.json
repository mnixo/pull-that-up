five four three two one fuck it we'll do it live fuck it we'll do a lot of live we'll do a lot live Josh Zepps today's a sad day yes I still O'Reilly I'm mourning a you morning Jo I feel you should be but I'm not what I found a loot was that said he made a ton of lewd Wow I mean since 96 when Fox News launched and he was like the big I'm just making it up that that's when Fox News launched let's check out Jamie that when Fox News launched 96 check it dr. Chuck it check it now terminal I uh he has pulled in so much money for that network and for himself oh yeah he was one of those was the main guy really he really was in a day in broadcasting they're gonna find another old cunt to fill its fuck they're gonna have to now old that's what people don't look at that October 7th 1996 ladies and gentlemen you're welcome America you allow her that he was unlike hard copy or something like that right I don't even know I was too young I wasn't even here in the States oh yeah I was a school child in Australia a little child I don't remember him from anything else I just remembered him being on a Riley and watching it and going but it it's like that longing for a nostalgia thing you know I see an older gentleman and a tie who just said well that's the way it is yeah hi goes in the tide goes out can you explain it like what in the fuck is this guy doing that was when he was talking he was talking to an idea Stan Lee who was he was it oh I don't remember who was like maybe was Ricky Gervais so some lot coming but he was in Reverse well maybe it was Sam could it have been Sam now oh I don't know who it was anyway someone some idea I was saying like we were saying what he was like and Bill was like I've got the absolute number one reason why you have to believe in God because tide goes in tide goes out always been that way always will be that way well and goes around or spins around how do you explain that if not God it was just super obvious that he was pandering cuz the guy went to fucking Harvard okay Bill O'Reilly not a dope he might be a douchebag but he's not a dope he's no I think religion makes people dope you know I leave I don't that don't even know about I don't even religious I think he's barely religious I think he's religious enough to get by with the job that's interesting leader if you think he's instance he had been under Percy a hundred percent because I think he's one of the look I don't what's the show a lot so I'm not sure but he's always struck me as one of the more straight shooters I think he is he's smart but not wise yes you know he feels what he feels in his gut is more important than what the data tells him and I think he falls for a bunch of fallacies that a lot of people fall for especially if they're religious like the idea that there is a certain order to the cosmos and how could we all have come about how could this whole thing around us exist we'll all these butterflies and the the moon and the tide comes in and the tide goes out because here's me and Joe these spiritual creatures these being sitting opposite each other on a at a table in Los Angeles right now some people just find that too inexplicable to explain without a deity so they're like alright there must have been a big guy who did it it's even dumber in my opinion to think that one dude engineered the so fucking thing we wouldn't wouldn't you just think that oh wow there's some crazy super complex system that sort of works in some odd way where it balances itself out with predator and prey and food and water and fire and dirt and all this stuff together and then you realize that it all has to form out of the the actual elements that come from an exploding star it's magnificent just the actual this the full realm of things that they've absolutely proven to be true in terms of like scientific discoveries about the universe and them yeah just the very elements that constitute human beings and everything you see the table and laptops it's amazing the idea that one dude is sitting there up in its class early on and of course moderate religious people will say well of course we don't believe in that kind of a God we don't believe in a God with a robe and a beard sitting in the clouds we believe in a more sophisticated metaphorical version of God yeah but you still believe that whatever consciousness created black holes and the whole cosmos gives a shit whether or not you beat off well also that it has to be a one yeah they god of yen one thing unless you're a Hindu in which case I've got an elephant got over here I've got a Vishnu over here I've got a multi-armed monkey and you got a lot of hash you gotta say though lately dude yeah I mean one of the one of the things that's interesting is I think at any given point in time people just assumed that the universe was created by whatever thing happens to be around them roaring so house was on the podcast I heard that that was a great episode I had him on my podcast with no I had my point of inquiry actually which is a different podcast and my normal one way to people like the week before he was on yours yours was way better you can talk about a lot of shit in three hours Joe talk yeah that's why I like doing it but he broke my brain with this one thing he said he explained that when you talk about the universe being 14 billion years old you're talking about the observable universe and he's like the problem is space moves faster than light the universe is moving faster than the speed of light so what we're seeing is what we can see from 14 billion years ago because but that doesn't mean that's all there is right he goes space itself beyond bending but if what he's saying is space itself beyond that could be infinite it's just moving faster than we can see Peter's present plan yeah exactly so what he was saying is like when you're talking about the observable universe being I think it's thirteen point something billion yet almost 14 billion years old that's just how far back we can see he's like but before that like when you go back further yeah it's not really nothing greenair that's right it's just that we can't see it because the space itself is moving faster than the speed of light that's right and you're also what you're looking at is not only the edge of the universe but the edge of time yeah because they're not even the edge what he's saying is it's it's very likely that not only is it infinite but there's an infinite number of possibilities beyond it yes and those things beyond it may also be right alongside us I mean in terms of the other dimensions and things like that like he didn't even get into all of it all of that stuff but if you believe in string theory and quantum physics and if you believe in math then you sort of have to well it's quite physics and string theory - a dope like me is one of those things where I have to kind of take your word for it it's almost like before the you know before the lutheran times before the bible was translated you had a lie on the priest just trust the priests I'll just you know why because he knows Latin he speaks Aramaic to read this shit yeah who told the priest well the Pope who told the Pope don't ask questions but we can go in a key food that's why it's so important to to appreciate like when people are science deniers it's so frustrating because everything you use everything you enjoy everything that you in terms of medicine technology is based on the work of countless people who have worked generations after generations on the innovations of the past like the people before them invented some shit they improved upon it they figured out more they studied the calculations of those people they added to it and then you get to 2017 so whenever someone steps in with an incredibly limited understanding of science or of what were what we're dealing with in terms of the universe itself and says whoa ty goes in the Todd goes out you can't explain it like you motherfucker they've been explaining the tides forever are you talking about I think what he actually means is you can't explain why there isn't why there is something instead of total chaos and anarchy nothing you can get or edit yeah he's a douchebag okay he's I think he's pandering I think he was just trying to I think he knows there's a bunch of old dummies out there crocheting you know with three teeth listening to his seat I don't think that you can be highly intelligent and religious yes you can but you highly effective at individual pursuits now when you talk when you say highly intelligent well he is really as soon as someone is religious in terms of like if you believe in preposterous notions like there's a guy who came back to life he turns water into wine he walks on water if you believe that you're not intelligent you're just not well I don't believe you're intelligent I think you are intelligent in individual disciplines but obviously if you believe something that makes no sense whatsoever you believe that someone was magic someone defied physics someone had superpowers someone was a person who could bring people back to life someone could come back to life themselves there's no evident on what degree of religious you believe this on the flimsiest fuckin evidence that wasn't even written down until 70 or 80 years after that dude died because Christianity didn't so I mean we've been worse than that because the Old Testament is far older than totally notion of Jesus yes but that's not it hang on III do quibble with the idea that this that you can't be smart Stephen Colbert is one of the matters well the word smart this is what the problem is like we define smart well you stupid shit are you smart you are implying that the reason why Bill O'Reilly talks about tide goes in tide goes out is because he's pandering to people because he's a Harvard guy and there's no way that he would be dumb enough to believe that no I'm complying that because I looked at the way he said it and I know what he does and I think he's manipulative and I think what he's doing is playing to his base I think there's a lot of people out there they want to see some smug liberal atheists could take it down a notch and build just a guy to do it and talk over them he's a big giant guy and yell and get all aggressive what I don't understand is like Stephen Colbert is obviously a very smart guy he's a Catholic mm-hmm Andrew Sullivan I know if you know him the blogger he's a friend of Sam Harris's like he's a Christian good luck these people who are going ways of compartmentalizing logic I guess so like as you say that they believe in something that is totally crazy I mean the idea that you can say a certain number of Latin words over a over a cracker and it'll turn bodily into the flesh of someone who existed 2,000 years ago is crazy magic talk well it's crazy talk but there are people that are religious that are extremely intelligent and I agree with you on this like Jordan Peterson right who's a brilliant man who is very religious in the sense that he studies religion and he believes there's some fundamental principles that are involved in religion that are inexorable to the human condition and I think he think he thinks they're important to our society into civility and ethics and morals I don't think he believes people walked on water I don't think you believe someone came back from the dead I don't think he believes this stupid shit and I don't think the stupid shit is even the original story the huge prize problem with religion is translation over time that's one of the biggest problems the oldest version of the Bible that we know of is the Dead Sea Scrolls they don't even use that because it's so fucking crazy if you listen to some of the translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls or you read some of it it is unbelievably crazy I mean it sounds like science fiction stuff and if you go back to that version of it I mean you're talking about stuff that was written on animal skins they used to do they did DNA tests to make sure that the pieces that they got you know you know the whole story behind the Dead Sea Scrolls basically but you found them in Qumran these scrolls were written on animal skin so they were broken up so to piece them back together they had to do DNA testing to make sure that the piece of skin came from the same cow and then they had to try to figure out okay where does all this shit go and then how to how to put it into place but they don't even use that version of the Bible and even if you use the Old Testament people say well that's the Old Testament we don't really we go by the New Testament which is even more preposterous because the New Testament was written by Constantine and a bunch of bishops and men decided what to leave in and what to take out they decide of course and the debuff whole chunks of it a contradictory and around the hadith as well as the the Bible but I mean we're just talking about the bio for now Constantine wasn't even religious I mean Constantine wasn't even a Christian until he died he was converted on his fucking deathbed I mean he just did it so that he could unite Rome he knew what the fuck he was doing who's getting all these people to operate together does this mean there's no God absolutely not does this mean that I haven't the answers that you don't have of course not I'm just saying people are full of shit and that story sucks it's that simple why don't me I think what we do too much of is confusing two questions one of which is is there a God without defining what God is right and the other of which is is there any reason to believe in a particular faith or a particular denomination to be a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew or whatever I think we'll you break it down even further than that yeah people don't know and anyone who says they know that's what I'm not telling the truth yes we're not talking about well we do know about that carbon comes from stars when they explode yeah well that can be scientifically explained and prove it we're not talking about that we're talking about do you know whether or not Jesus was a man who came back from the dead and turned water into what you do not no one does is lanza but I know with as much certainty that he didn't do that I don't know anything about the past but you don't hear you honestly don't you don't well how do you know what Napoleon did you don't right well we know historical records we know the stories of people from back then but the idea that this one guy did things that no human being could ever do today yes I'd be logic physics the laws of nature the laws of life and death all the different reality like the realities that we accept today in terms of what's provable what we know about biological life all that stuff was violated by this one guy yeah it could have happened it could have it could have in the same way the ramallah course might not have happened no if you say less likely than that you reckon it's more likely that Jesus was divine no the opposite it's way more likely what a lot of the Holocaust didn't happen then that Jesus did all of that shit and I think the Holocaust is 100% real it's not like me - I mean that's that's kind of my point like yeah there is a religious people put an undue burden on people non-religious people by saying look who's to say I say there's a god you say there's not a god it's a 50/50 toss-up I'm just going to believe in Christian I've heard Colbert say this to Bill Maher on his show look I'm a Christian I've got nothing to lose if I turn out to be right and Christianity is true what we do I get to go to heaven if I if it turns out that Christianity is wrong then I just die but at least you know give it a chance this is Pascal's wager right this is this idea that you might as well be religious because hey if it's true you've got an eternity of goodness but here's the thing and you avoid health I can't be true because no one knows like no one has died and given you the debt no one died with a VCR or you know a VHS tape recorder and come back with a knot here put this in the machine and play it this is heaven I've shown you but it's not even a 50/50 shot is what I'm saying it's not like like Bertrand Russell can demolish this idea with his teapot analogy where he said like okay I'm going to claim that there's a teapot circling in orbit between the earth and the moon and now if you deny that then hey it's just a 50/50 shot maybe it's there maybe it's not there who is to say obviously you would say no I think it's not dead because if there's no evidence that it's there I'm not going to just going to believe you because you say it and similarly if you say oh this guy Jesus two thousand years ago he turned water into wine he walked on water and then he was the son of God and that God requires you to believe on him otherwise you're going to go to hell forever and you say why should I believe that and they can't turn around and say hey it's a 50/50 shot it's not a 50/50 shot there are good reasons for believing things and bad reasons for believing things and religion almost always only offers bad reasons for believing in it well as soon as you start talking numbers percentages and stuff like you're just making those numbers up right 50 whoo yeah where you coming up with that how about a 50/50 shot what this is Vegas odds like what is this a lot of religious people to believe in I mean here's the thing if people are listening you're getting fucking pissed doesn't mean there's not a higher power doesn't mean it's not in order to this unit for leches means that it's super likely that if there is something that's unbelievably powerful and there's some law that keeps the universe together and some force of good that's trying to guide us in this there's some you know there's some beautiful inclinations towards that direction what I'm saying is I guarantee you that the people who lived 2,000 years ago who wrote this shit down on leather with you know ink that they made out of plants they didn't have all the data they just didn't know they just City they didn't have a theory of disease I mean they didn't even know that the births spun around the Sun how are these I'm sure the people who understood the most about the cosmos yeah it wasn't I'm sure that today I mean the reason why they didn't want any pork is because they figured out trichinosis they're like oh listen these fucking pigs man converging sick left and roll your stop doing that as for those things that crawl off on the bottom of the ocean yes give me any of that shit exactly well you got hooked up with red tide like you're dying we're gonna stop eating shellfish there's a lot of like real logic to the water the reasons why they had laws and makes it makes sense but the real issue again is the it was that the the ancient Hebrew version the Bible ancient Hebrew the words also double as numbers like do you know that letters are numbers in ancient Hebrew yeah right their alphabet they don't have numbers so the letter A is also the number one so words have numerical value like the word God and word love is a numerical value all that was lost in translation yeah translated to Latin Greek eventually English all that shit was lost like it's the the ancient Hebrew version of like if you ever read like some really goofy translation of English Japanese yeah like what in the fuck yeah or if you translated English into a foreign language and then translate it back from that finally into English it becomes gibberish well one of the things I love about Instagram is it has a translation thing that I use a lot of times that follow a lot of Russian fighters uh-huh a lot of Russian MMA fighters and I follow their pages and I'll go okay let's hit the translate and now hit translate like Jesus Russian seems especially hard for some reason it's got a lot weird pronouns and things are always saying good this verb is the best fighter well it's also like their language looks different yeah no it's totally sold in Cyrillic have you heard they had the claim that the 72 virgins in the Koran are actually 72 raisins no but you know the word mean the word is almost the same between raisin and virgin know the expression 72 is like a fuckload that's what it means yet doesn't mean 72 virgins but it means like there'd be 72 when you're like wow that's that's enough that's enough we're good I would not need more than 72 virgins or raisins it's about me I am the life it's probably not even the number 72 it's just like our translation from arabic to english to screws it up and then someone probably came up with this numerical value a long time ago and they stuck with 72 so believe in science people so talking about Bill O'Reilly do you think you should be fired I don't know what he did and I know I don't know he didn't do you know I don't know I know he's definitely done some gross shit in the past like there's a the audio of him calling that chick and say he's gonna take a loofah sponge yeah why better than your loofah haha big big oval with his loofah in the shower I don't know you know who knows I would imagine whenever you hear a story about a guy like that that some of it is probably fabricated I know I just don't imagine that all the people that say things about him are all telling the 100% truth I would not imagine that would be true well we cannot be honest like once I get beyond a few people then you think that the preponderance of evidence is that there probably yeah I guess you can't say they're all telling the truth but hard to take their word for why are they oh you know you definitely don't if there are six seven eight people only general story you definitely have to go hmm but you don't have to take all their word for it because first of all you don't know those people you'd have to know those people you'd have to really know if they were honest you'd have to really be there you know to know what really happened is so fucking hard man because first of all people not only the full of shit but their memory sucks people's memories like if you I'm sure you've had a conversation with someone about something that happened to you witness as well and you both have totally different memories of memories are terrible I've come to accept that though for myself over the last few years like I used to like cling to memories and then try to argue them but III think it's been scientifically proven that the human memory is one of the worst pieces of evidence that you could ever call upon ya the justice system is starting to deprioritize it as well as it should do because in the past like I witnessed with you know accounts in courtrooms have been very highly prioritized like they've been very highly valued and prized by prosecutors well well I mean this person points out there who in the you know do you see that person sitting in the courtroom today madam and she points their finger and well just slam dunk of course that was the perpetrator now we realize people memory of a terrible error all the time we're really susceptible to in suggestion and influence and all that sort of stuff but I think you kind of remember whether or not your boss who's a television star put his hand up your skirt very likely probably but there's also someone who could be seriously deceptive and very ambitious and realizes that Bill O'Reilly kind of a twat and there's what I'm going to do I'm going to get close this old cunt and I'm going to get this guy to get creepy with me and then I'm going exaggerate what he did and I'm gonna profit off of it yeah I mean you understand that they've paid fucking millions of dollars to people so there's a real industry and getting Bill O'Reilly to get creepy with you like if I was a chick but especially if I was like a really unscrupulous chick tied to my name half-a-million he went up too high that's a million aha this guy's a douchebag because what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna like kind of give them a like a semi greenlight you know so Lola take it back a little bit chicken the problem is that this kind of skepticism towards women's stories about sexual assault has is what has permitted people like him to get away with it for decades and centuries right like I don't agree with make a point that it's hot happened you know it's just that she said I don't think that's what I think power has gotten allowed them to get away with it I think fear and power the fear of this powerful man I think that has been the destroyer end up being believed part of that it may be I think the repercussions that he's going to ruin your career that he's gonna that he has influence and also that if you just play ball you'll get something from it you know yeah I mean I'm not especially I'm not talking about an individual person and saying this individual person is not telling truth what I'm doing is just making hypotheticals I'm just saying if I was a check and I was a an unscrupulous sort of social climber and we all know that they exist and I was the type of person that really wanted to make it in this business and I was like look I'm working for an asshole and I already know this five chicks we got paid they've already paid out 13 million bucks I'm gonna I'm gonna pluck and move in on this I'm I'm interested that that rubric turned on it that Rupert Murdoch turned on it and then kicked him out when he's still making a ton of money he's still a number one cable show right where he was well maybe tuck across and had a meeting with pull them aside to listen oh god that guy comes in and down because of the Moody's because I'm fuckin gravity come on tie off speaking of someone who will say whatever they think you know the author audience wants them to say that well the caca that's your guy right there that with his stupid or bowtie he doesn't have a bow tiny one you know he got rid of it in a straight time yep yeah both times two gay exactly you don't want go and be associated with that or you know someone's got like a camera in it I'm amazed that he's had his Renaissance taka like he was there was that classic John Stuart moment when he used to host crossfire Chuck Tucker Carson and John when Tony was like you're a grown man wearing a bow tie stop hurting America was the Johnson mansion in that regard where he was funny on his show when he was doing a scripted monologue and talking to people who's gracious but did you if he came on your show and he had an issue with you you would find out how fucking smart and mean he could really hate y'all go after you absolutely which is which is good cuz I mean Tucker yeah whatever you think about whether or not Bill O'Reilly believes what he believes only thing Tucker knows like taka has this constant fate he has this have you know if you if you're listening with audio podcasts you can see my face but he's kind of furrowed brow and like mouth-breathing kind of like you know he plays the role of like the bemused clown the government who's just I'm just a common man for Mom just middle America I don't understand what you're talking about he's like very very what very riding the fence very kind of riding the fence very like never quite having Anna I'm just missed a common sense like either I'm just saying it like I see it anyway yeah I don't know you know I would assume that a lot of these women are telling the truth what I'm not I'm definitely not saying that they weren't telling the truth what I'm saying is I don't know I don't know what happened but what didn't happen I don't know whether he should be fired or shouldn't be fired you mean uh he feels that he fills a niche right and if it's my company and you have to worry about this guy representing you well okay I see where you wouldn't want that guy representing you because he's problematic and people think he's a creep but he could just go do his own shit like Glenn Beck well a little run antic a filthy wish or something he's not going to go away quietly why would he I mean it's an interesting probably such an interesting question about what happens to the right-wing media now because if Roger Ailes is no longer at Fox News and Bill O'Reilly is no longer at Fox News for the same reason for the same reason exactly both guys the same it's a good point it pretty much plays into the same narrative doesn't it a dirty old white guy just a fuck that's going on over there Fox News it may have just young where it's like an old it's like an old Porky's movie or like one of those new 1970s National Lampoon films with women with that teen hanging out people are on a bend or tweeting at Hannity now your next handed he exactly going after him now and right and bright but sad it's dudes they've been and sidelined in the white house and then he can get along with Trump anymore no not true I don't know I'm not friends with him I love rumors and I call him up hey ace Davey hey Stevie bait how you done with that with Donny these days apparently I still closed jared is running the show now that's right I think he had to make a decision any kind of sidelines of the the white nationalist bit and he kind of empowered the old-school Republican orthodoxy gee you'd be pissed if you're a trump later wouldn't you do have a Jew Ron shit well not just doesn't help Joe doesn't help but no I just mean because like so much of what he sort of ran on was like it's going to be different it's not gonna be the same old politics and now you know we're going to repeal Obamacare well that didn't work out right that's just going to be tax cut now a bomb Syria well you weren't supposed to be bombing people I thought we were going to get out of all these foreign wars and jail care like that so many people there this cognitive dissonance that they have in addressing his actions so they're the support of him they're so happy that they won they would they would never want to take away their victory like the people that are happy that Trump is in office are so happy that he won and they won with him that any little thing that happens they just come up with some sort of a way to rationalize some of them do some of them do I sort of story the other day about about a county in Pennsylvania or something which is a which had voted for Obama twice and then voted for Trump because they thought they were going to get changed and they're all just like well he just seems like a regular Republican he can try to tack cut taxes for the rich and go go to war with foreign countries isn't from what this isn't what we bargained for but it'll be interesting to see whether what they flip back in four years yeah I think your point that that they're just really happy that Hillary's not the president there's a lot of people that are really happy she's not the president I think bill is the biggest I think Bill super happy it's like saying god I don't want to have to go back in there again I don't know there's a lot of tail in that house he gets playing tail yeah I bet he'd outside TV O'Reilly the we clinical system in the WikiLeaks memos about the Coelho was talking about him banging hookers on the side no yeah I was like talking about how bills at home banging bimbos and there was something about me call it out fucking baby email they talk shit leeches like regular people yeah put in an email very well done and we learned nothing don't send it to fucking anybody whose get an unsecured server no well just don't write it down at all you're not even you can't really talk now anyway because everything's gonna be spied on me I know whatever I how we're going to have a private conversation which is just poor shit on people or doesn't let it fly just like this maybe that I'd hear because I actually have been in a private email yep that's no questioning whether or not Bill O'Reilly intelligent or whether or not he really believes that or whether or not religious people are actually intelligent which I you know clearly there there's a lot of religious people that are intelligent part of the problem is that people give too much of a crap about things that people have said in the past I mean we've spoken about this year before in relation to political correctness or something or like using the wrong language I think as more and more of what we say gets intercepted or at least intercept able in emails and also in phone calls and so on and we're being spied on all the time things can be leaked and things can be hacked people are just going to have to chill the fuck out a little bit about people's past otherwise we're only going to end up with the most boring anodyne people in positions of power because it's only going to be people who've always watched exactly what they say who are able to who have never kind of triggered a tripwire and who have never gotten people angry well in that sense Trump's the big victory for that that's right yeah what I said after Trump is elected the political correctness just took a missile to the dick a little it looks like this is just it just shows you you could be out there grabbing pussies talking crap fucking people I mean it's okay like it's it's not it's the world has changed in that regard and part of the I mean part of the problem there is that the things that he's some of the things that he says really are bad like I don't think that it's appropriate to be too talk about women the way that he talks about what I think it's appropriate to grab a pussy talk yeah basically what that basically but I promise that is he's talking to a dude and trying to make him laugh yeah I mean he's having a private conversation with a guy and he's doing what he called locker room talk yeah guys talk shit and they say things they don't really mean and he's what he said was and I'm not I'm not an apologist just let me get this out of the way what he said was you can just grab them by the pussy they let you you could do anything that you want when you're a big celebrity yeah he just grabbed him by the pussy yeah like what he's saying is not I grab women by the pussy and I sexually assault them when he's just being totally outrageous it's like a punchline for a joke he's exaggerating the reality of the situation he's saying may famous saying when you're as famous as me you can do anything yeah I'm grabbing by the pussy they implied anything I met you again they let yet meaning implying consent right I say he's not talking about sexual assault was so when people are saying you know he's doing sexual assault no he's talking about girls that are enthralled with the fact that they're around this guy who is his fucking name on skyscrapers and he flies around with a jet with his name on it and if you're that type of woman and there are that look there's that type of men there's that type of women we're not it is not a gross generalization about men or women but guaranteed you know our son some women that when they're in the face of a guy like Donald Trump they react that way and they let him do anything they want they love it yeah there is that possibility there is that possibility I also thought that the phrasing of that term was it was kind of funny like if they let you grab them but like how do you grab it exactly like where do your fingers go like was it witness or some who's doing like so what it sounded to me like was someone who is inept sexually which by many accounts he is like there are lots of accounts of like when he was married to or dating the most beautiful people he'd be downstairs eating Cheetos watching late-night new cable news while they were upstairs like how do you feel about or to not believe that well because well just just compare it to whether or not it comports with what what else you know about him which is that he's very image focused and cares a lot about being thought to be the best at everything and the most glamorous and the realist so it's you imagine that it would be consistent with his personality that he would want to present a front of being more of a Slayer and more of a sexual demon than he actually is sexual diamond drum great names little demon it's the size so they grabbed him by the pussy it sort of reminded me a little bit of the way that 15 year old boys would talk to each other yeah dude I totally grew big rubber boots man I say ridiculous things that they don't mean get other people to laugh I will I will grant you that girl's due to my point about political correctness is I don't think Trump is our best ambassador for the anti political correctness brigade no right like and part of his rise part of the backlash is a backlash against the you know we've had so many conversations that we all know it by now we're bored of like people who go who absolutely lose their you know just go crazy because you use the wrong transgender pronoun or something like that you know you say he instead of she or whatever it is all these times or microaggressions and stuff like that or all of that kind of bullshit I think gave rise to an environment in which people are so frustrated with political correctness that they unleashed and it was like a pressure cooker exploding and the Trump hair went everywhere and get crackin he's that yeah exactly but I don't think big you know things would have been better if we hadn't gotten to that place and we could all just take a pill I think we need to learn you know and I think we need to make mistakes so that we can learn one of the things that's really unfortunate is that he doesn't tell the truth and that he's the president and he shows that you can just not tell the truth and be the president yeah about all kinds of things yeah the alternative facts analogy you know he's what you know I mean I'm trying to grapple with this on my podcast because I think it's I think what's what's dangerous about Trump is that is not just that he doesn't tell the truth because like as lots of people point out many politicians don't tell the truth it's that he doesn't even care that he's not telling the truth and he doesn't behave as if there is such a thing really as truth like the other day he talked about the the warships that were heading for the Korean Peninsula did you see this miss story he said that we've got this aircraft carrier which is going towards Korea it was going in the opposite direction to Australia to not attack a strategy but do a military exercise with the others and now and then Sean Spicer got there you know the press corps went crazy in the White House Correspondents um Sean Spicer was like well I agree he was saying that it had been heading it was going to be going to the Korean Peninsula but it was just it do on a dieter so he wasn't saying the actual direction of the aircraft carrier he was saying that it was he was talking about the overall strategy of what and like poor old spicy is out there trying to make Trump's statements comport with something with reality in some way but Trump is just an explosive like vomit machine just weeding out stuff that doesn't even have to map onto reality at all and he always seems to take pride I think in the fact that he can say whatever million people at the inauguration when I started talking the rains not ever and the Sun feels pretty good are you working on that Joe no and then like the impression this needs work it needs a little work but everyone's got their Trump but you know I mean he he will say things and then almost take I feel like he gets his jolly gets his rocks off through the sheer audacity of being able to say whatever the hell he wants and just make his opponents go crazy because they're done even it's a game of whack-a-mole then right it's like when he says I'm trying to politician true so he's acting as a politician for the first time in his life and he's 70 so his entire life has been this braggadocious guy who has exaggerated facts and built up this amazing persona and exaggerated wealth and accessible but exaggerate that success so like the thing about him winning the inauguration remember that really interesting exchange that he had with a reporter there was a young reporter and he was up there saying we won by the largest margin a lot just not enemies in electoral college I said it's not true yeah and he said well the largest four Republican Republican that's also true so he said George Bush or George Herbert Walker Bush much larger margin yeah and so he explained to us well you will agree that we won by a substantial number yes when you are the president thank you like you'd like good I want to Cocteau exactly you know it's just it's just he's not a politician and that's what people like about him you know but then he starts doing all these different things like you know he's trying to get all these different plants to reopen and give Americans jobs and they talk about all the jobs have been created and people get excited and he signed this new thing yesterday you know American made American sales and trying to encourage people to buy and make American and and then trying to get rid of foreigners that are sneaking over here and doing bad things and you know the base the people that have been you know clamoring for that kind of response get very excited and I go well we'll deal with the lies the lies are fine as long as he opens up that Ford plant though the lies are bad - look he got those guatemalan terrorist drug dealers out of chicago or whatever you know i mean yeah and i think that i think that there's a feeling that the whole people who regard themselves as being custodians of the truth hoity toity out of touch elites who have been shitting on the Trump support the honest hard-working Trump supporter along that they deserve to be slapped in their face with a little bit of untruthful truthiness sure a lot of time we notice journalist and the judges and the academics people smarter than you yeah people more educated than you and we're updating our tracks and it makes you humiliated ya feel dumb yeah like the tide goes in the tide goes out explain it kind of the same the appeal yeah right no goddamn with that time that's right there's nothing you can say about that it's black I mean that people do love when liberals get their comeuppance yeah liberals are really classically associated with education higher education bigger vocabularies with amenities one of the funny things about Trump that he's the anti a latest as if there as if it is non elite to be a Manhattan real estate billionaire you know how is that how is that the anti elite you just have to say when when George Bush pretended he was from fucking gay Texas a lot of people don't realize he's from yes from the know he went to Yale yeah he all he did in Texas was clear brush but he know his hair and brush it it when people are looking yeah cameras rolling absolutely yeah change going down trees but it's you know it's the American Way you pitch people an image I mean it is why they have publicists why I mean when you say though that Trump is like is not a politician that's what people like about em yeah there's the worry is that when you're President of the United States should you say has an impact yeah right it is an important position so I think the things that you say can be misinterpreted by the Koreans or the Russians and there's a like if you are the president you should know that people in the executive branch such as the president people in the White House should not disparage people in the judicial branch right because we have a separation of powers in the United States of America so when he made those comments for example about the judiciary I think a lot of people think like oh why is everyone getting their tips and the tangle about just because he said that the judge was you know implied that the judge was biased in the Trump University case it's because presidential candidates shouldn't be shitting on judges right because otherwise you end up with situations like you've got in Venezuela or now in Turkey they've just had this referendum over the past weekend which gave sort of quasi dictatorial powers to Turkey's president yeah and allowing similar things happen to her everywhere in Turkey right come dictatorships essentially essentially and remember Russia has done that over the past 10 or 15 years and when you listen to people who are experts in these things they always say I was just listening to Marcia guessing who's really in to know Marcia she's a Russian journalist who lives in the States now fascinating person should be a good person to get to get on the show and she was saying that the the things that that nascent dictators always like to do is take take down a peg people who who rely on facts for their living so that's journalists it's people in the judicial department and it's academics so it's judges lawyers academics and so on that's always what you see like the Putin's and again the sort of Bill O'Reilly mindset of like tide goes in tide goes out hey I'm just a regular guy I've got my gut going for me I don't need all these fancy book-learning it's just you and me let's go to Washington DC and take it back from those fancy elites make America great right and we're going to do it just without bull we're gonna grab them by the pussy and we're gonna drag this country into the 21st century come what may dude you should run for office you can god damn in front of the country that's a stupid rule it is America most countries don't have that natural born rule most countries if you move to that country and you become a citizen and you live there for a certain period of time sure you can vote up for the hinds I want to run for office would you run for office if it was available I think I can run for office I think I can't run for president right well obviously Arnold Schwarzenegger is government right exactly so I hereby announce my candidacy for the governorship of California I don't even live here dude I do now when did you move I move I've kind of oozed between New York and Los Angeles over the course of the past four months yeah but you're an elite bicoastal guy knows where we're going to set you experience of guy and from another country look if I was al Qaeda and I would say the way to get somebody to slip them in is not to get some Brown guy looks like an Arab get an Aussie handsome Aussie no one's going to think that that an Aussie especially a game anyway that's right I married bringing twins Joe oh my goodness husband how does that work it's very complicated do you have somebody that carries them for yeah does she live with you no oh that's weird yeah now that her sheets right yeah we're trying now I don't want to be I don't to be me a controlling who's jizz did you choose we used we as my jizz because we use them because I go to the boss you were a lot of exactly are you the dad well we haven't figured that out yet to death I didn't say we had twins yet they're in the oven I have a couple that lives down the street from me they're gay couple and I've known them for probably 15 years and they have a child and I watch this kid grow they went through the whole thing and they went through the whole thing their kids friends with my kid and has been since it was a baby and he's about seven or eight now and they went through the whole thing where they had a surrogate the whole deals carry and then at the end of it she's like I'm keeping us oh wow yeah they paid for the kid wait and that was kosher she won I mean she got me yes we've had a lawyer you know yes you know that's unusual because California is usually out sorry it's not in California but it tends to have pretty good pro-family surrogacy laws by which I mean it makes it hard for the surrogate to change her mind at the at the end yeah well they did in 2000 it was like early 2000 mi tat I was getting some women do you know bloody Australia I mean let me whine for a moment about how backward Australia is ten or fifteen years ago when I first started coming to the states I was able to look down my progressive nose at these fine United States of America and think of it as being a more conservative center-right country but now you guys are legalizing pot all over the joint you've got the gay marriage Australia still doesn't like a lot of I feel like a lot of interesting stuff is going on in the states in on the progressive side of politics and culture that Australia has just been too slow to pick up so on the question of surrogacy there's this weird like alliance in Australia there also exist in some communities here in the states between essentially extreme feminists and like right-wing Christians to say that women should not be allowed to take money to be surrogate carriers from the Christian Right they say you know we shouldn't let these fags you know be using women to I don't know to create life right by the bed and from the feminists it's oh we have to protect women from being manipulated and taking money for having it for renting their wombs out but you want them to have the right to kill an unborn baby well no no it's not that it's what we don't want it's a medical procedure it's not telling you baby it's a bundle of cells until it comes out yourself you have to let all of a sudden click it's a social security number yeah real so you want a woman to be able to kill that bunch of cells but you don't want her to be able to bring that bunch of cells into existence mmm then get paid for it in Australia you can't it's against the law to be packed to pay a surrogate to carry your channel that has to be a favor but prostitutions legal so you guys are gone they're just confused we're a confused nation lost on the wrong side of the planet well you're a tiny land you know it's a giant chunk of ground as big as the United States but a tiny group of people tiny by far in Los Angeles that's right we're the same population is well bit bigger than Greater Los Angeles you don't count Mexicans they don't know you're a Mexicans are over here they just don't they do and they do a census anyway we'll say say most people say where later la is 18 or 19 million Australia is 24 but who's counting listen it's hop grader la is connected to Orange County is connected to the Inland Empire's can it's not like it stops you know like when you start checking your Joe I'm as you okay we agree about the large Los Angeles Charlie your country is not as big as ours I'm just saying but it's the same size the same size yeah if you exclude Alaska then the same size as you know it's a tick ewis you know you can see this United States exactly and it's got basically half the population in California yeah you have a tiny little spot I know it's in terms of human beings well you know so mark you honey where have you been to New Zealand yet no I heard it's awesome though it's great and I want to go that is a small place god it's gorgeous it's too beautiful I'm half New Zealand are you yeah how do you know like ours in the same shit it's basically it's like it's like me half Canadian in California saying they're from Nevada what do you know well it is a different country it's like Canada it's out Island right it's another Island it's two islands yet got to fly over there yeah row 1200 1200 miles can you row 1,200 miles fuck yeah Polynesians can make that's true they can and did they did do they go to Hawaii Tonga used to control basically all of the South Pacific they were they they were absolutely badasses since eyes those fucking people yeah no big the giant of giant bones they had they round the canoe they build big canoes burberry big canoes there's a canoe full of Thomas and the fly de l'épée three trailers 50-pound tons big humans they're probably really big back then too even when people weren't as big they're probably bigger I think they've always been bigger yeah hello Americans are giving them a run for their money right now in a band Aziz started to get fat well it's food yeah the high protein count I mean you seen in Japan as well you know people are just larger ya know they're eating more food and and we're eating more sugar that too well there's also the head Gary Taubes on who wrote that book the case and sugar and one of the things he was saying it was really kind of interesting is that when you feed people a higher sugar diet the higher insulin count is actually making larger people so he's talking about his kids and that like you almost like wants to feed his kids more sugar to make you know bigger athletes and I'm like that's crazy so big another in terms of having more body fat larger large I guess larger Hulme like taller as well bigger yeah just bigger people yeah there's some evidence in Poinciana the high sugar diet as well as the high protein diet are contributing factors to people being larger could I just ate a lot of Donna now not now not at all talk about yeah you know how old would I had to be when I went to let go no ish I think you have to be like I won't have to have a couple of twins come follow her sugar stuff their faces full of chocolate as I've heard all day you just kind of get like to the wall of diabetes and pull back this would be Gretchen by the way always wanna get real quick I don't know the fuck I'm talking about don't go feeding your kids donut and I don't remember exactly Gary's upset Jamie's ones a liability of bring joy over the other day I showed you this is after the show red skittles spilling onto Wisconsin highway we're headed for cattle feed oh yeah they do do that the cow candy yeah that's just a fad in the month of April yeah yeah yeah they do do that they feed cows candy to make them fatter they've done they also feed them antibiotics just to just to make them bigger just make them grow fast well actually the reason why they feed them antibiotics is their bodies reject the green they feed them corn and things like that and the availab abscesses in their body to perfection it's twofold apparently it's for that reason and also it just has this side this by-product that it makes them grow faster antibiotics to antibiotics yep weird yeah was up I don't try to take those things anymore no I really need them surgery when you get surgery you should take it yeah that's right but you should be real careful about taking them for like a little cold yeah and I'm just going to take a z-pack yeah yeah you're going to make a super virus you fuck that's right and if you do then make sure you take probiotics and should eat a lot of kimchi and sauerkraut and all that's done here you go buddy yeah I know I've been listening to Joe Rogan you know what I don't know where I got that but into mind impels work yeah exactly that's right she should good value isn't she she's a genius yeah she's making a person I wonder if she's going to feed it sugar how the hell long as I go to a third trimester okay yeah I needed to learn all that shit I'm not good with like the numbers of human physiology I didn't know what a trimester was it's difficult you're a guy you can run I don't have cycles I don't have the cycles of the menstruation and the moon and the tide comes in and the tide goes down and the blood coming out comes out it's impossible to remain and the baby comes out lead baby Jesus is the only explanation Joe so explain to me what the law is right now in Australia like can you hire a surrogate or is it being pushed back well it's a state-by-state thing because estrella is also a federation like the United States which used to be a bunch of separate colonies so it used to be a bunch of you know penal colonies but Britain basically after the American Revolution Britain had nowhere to send its criminals and it was a very very tough law & order' state in the seventeen hundreds in the UK like if you it was three strikes and you're out that wasn't even the start of it and there was incredible inequality there was no welfare obviously and no food stamps and shit like that so people who were starving would steal a loaf of bread and you do that twice and they'd be like alright we're going to send you to the moon which is essentially Australia right so they went and found they've discovered this Great Southern land that had been rumoured about and it had been kind of sketched on the edges by some of the explorers from the Netherlands and from France so far and they sent out Captain Cook to settle it basically so they would have a place for British criminals to examine a huge vast sunburnt land for criminals to roam free in now that they could no longer use the United States any of those call meanwhile it's one of the most beautiful places in the world and some of the nicest people in the world live there like they've dug they'd be in a better place in England it's not that they says the criminals over there the criminals like you know what a problem was we were living in fucking England it never it's never sunny people are cunts yeah bars are a thousand years old like Jesus Christ I feel so good I'm gonna be a criminal anymore I'm gonna go surfing all right oh please judge don't send me to the other side of the world to a tropical paradise and I could be living here in London where it's dirty and disease-ridden and it's rainy and drizzly and grey all the time but isn't it weird how there's a balance to everything because when you go to Australia everything can fucking kill you yes that's true problem.this bought goddamn box jellyfish Brown spiders and brown snakes and almost different things it can fuck you up but you don't feel afraid of that when you're in Australia do you you get out of that in 24 hours no name really and I'm really Arif I have bugs and snakes and shit because I mean you do realize to typically that you're much more likely to be killed on the freeway here in LA or by someone shooting you in the States than you are by a spider button unless you go near the spiders in the snake which is what I would do I mean the problem with me I don't approach them I have a buddy of mine my friend Adam green tree was a big bow hunter in Australia yep so he's trying to get me to go hang out with them and I'm matamoros okay yeah I'll do that and then they send me a picture of some fucking spider that a vicious poisonous spider eating a vicious poisonous snake what there's a fuck you live man this is insane crocodiles everywhere they went bang and they didn't bring any water and they just figured they would find water and they use water purification systems and cleaning out so they're drinking buffalo piss water because these water buffalos they piss in this water and then you have these filter pumps and you pump out all the toxins but it still tastes like piss potentially drinking purified pets yeah and they were cooling off in this water and they they didn't realize that there's crocodiles in the area so they easily could have got jacked by a crocodile yeah probably I'll slide into that water and they just sit and wait but it's one of those things that you just learn about as a kid it's a bit like I mean people it's like when you talk to Canadians about the risk of bears and they just sort of laugh it off because you learn about how or like people from Finland about falling through the ice on a frozen lake these are things that you learn about when you're a kid and you should take it for granted right you I know where there will be crocodiles 99% of the time go and I don't go to those places but they don't well sure yeah exactly get ready farmer Yammer OBP with a group of people I mean in terms of the in terms of like how good it was for convicts I mean people came out to Australia for you know Brits came out to Australia even if they weren't criminals just because they wanted a new like a new adventure I mean my and some of the states of Australia actually were free settler colonies like South Australia which is which is one of the States was never a convict a penal colony and in fact when Australia became a country in 1901 there were in the constitutional conventions in the 1890s which which created a country out of all of these previously separate colonies New Zealand within negotiations to be part of that country as well and Western Australia because the western half of the continent was going to be a separate country and the East and half the eastern states of Australia and New Zealand could have been a single country and then at the last minute New Zealand jumped out in Western Australia jumped in and now you've got two different countries but anyway Australia is what yeah but husbands aren't they don't hurt you who gives a fuck killem I get those I think you get those spiders the other spiders inside even in Sydney but then on some harmful goddamn giant crab that's huge it's on a broom so it's that you can tell it yeah big enough to scare the fuck out of you if it was in your underwear you'd die yeah uh-huh you know New Zealand is a place it's really fascinating because they brought over all these wild game animals from other countries to turn into a sportsman's paradise and yeah I think they did in the 1700s of the 1800s 1900s because I think it was only settled by white people in the seventeen hundreds yeah and now they're the run rampant around the island cuz there's no predators so they have these you know towards red stags from Europe that are wandering around New Zealand because you know I think we spoke last night about the about the attempt that New Zealand is doing to basically eradicate all of its predators all of its invasive predators who have come from abroad like New Zealand because it was the last country to be settled by white people by white foreigners that is who brought you know foxes and rabbits and whatever nasty things I always forget exactly what are all cats yes you get issue I can't even remember what every time I say this publicly someone from New Zealand is like actually those foxes on Twitter so I definitely do in Australia Kathy I have the same issue you have the same issue in Australia totally totally but in Australia it's too far gone there's no way that you would be able to actually eradicate them whereas in New Zealand there is like it is it is a New Zealanders patriotic duty to murder as many little mammals as they can because those little mammals eat the native birds needle the native wildlife and stuff so New Zealanders like my cousin's over there they set traps out in their yard every one anything like that would bloodied hands pulling out the caucuses of animals they've killed now is good job good for you well Austrian a bit bow hunting magazines show people holding cats up like domestic cat hey hold on I got like an arrow through the heart and there was a guy recently who got attacked on Instagram because he's an Australian bow hunter and he was out bow hunting and he killed his cat and all these people were freaking out that was somebody's pet you piece of shit and like actually you don't understand like yeah this is a ruining leonetta field line ground nesting birds all these different animals live in the ground that we did the animals that have never had a predator like that in there mister just getting destroyed they're a menace those cats they get out yeah it's hopeless on the question isn't that beautiful nice shirt wrecking nose blow right there you got a cold or just like someone off fight one off don't take antibiotics okay I'm almost out of it but I worked out today pretty hard some fucking crazy bro what you do lifting weights years kettlebells you know I do was I going to say about Australian animals too I forget no it's a it's it's it's amazing that there is a imbalanced oh that's what it was you're Tasmanian tiger it was an animal that was extinct apparently there's a bunch of sightings of this thing and they're pretty sure that it might actually still be alive I've read that I hope said to be there's there's this really depressing footage you can see it online of the the last ever Tasmanian tiger in a zoo just pacing back and forth and back and forth they wiped out completely 1930s right yeah why don't we put it yeah really early I mean they basically destroyed everything in Tasmania they wiped out the native Aborigines that I walk out the people and they walked out I mean it was like yep here we are the British Empire let's make things better by killing everything is it interesting that you guys change the British accent just a little where's like most Americans can't tell where the fuck you're from how do you not tell honestly it's really insane but it's obvious like I got in the air spend half up you know from here I can tell the difference between Canadian and American well that's easy Tony is because you're American here about exactly but and they're nicer I mean actually that is less different than the difference between British and Australian considerably utility more like we're going in New Zealand and Arizona accent and a California accent mmm but don't know neither one have one was a trick question come on with an Arizona action with a fuckin arrow accent yeah no the only American accents that I can easily pick apart from the big city ones because you can tell Boston you can tell New York you can that's a bit less basically about it now is yet the South well issue there's that Midwestern thing where like Minnesota and Wisconsin about that all 9da oh by far girl that sort of Fargo accent and then you've got the other West Coast thing and then the lot that father thing is similar to Canadian as well a little bit get a little bit confusing sometimes yeah when you're Florida like my family people that live in the cold that's right yes they have to be like helping each other out sense of community Canadians are sort of like Aussies you know they were also big landmass not very many people mostly inhospitable most of them are huddled along one stretch of land in Canada it's the border and in Australia it's the coastline yeah I think they have less people in California as well yeah they have about the same I think they have a bit more than Australia I feel like they're you know somehow yeah exactly might move there those are the two places I've moved by the way if I didn't live in America like if some shit hit the fan here if California California slid into the ocean of the airport or something I would either live in Canada or Australia well here it if I hold Joe are you aware of that to not hold on Vancouver no but it's rainy and cloudy and great beautiful green on the three days a week when it's a year when it's sunny it's beautiful people accruals fuck 262 days a year horrible ah don't be a pussy grizzly so what since I've get you down again mr. Roy didn't I tell you vitamin D when it is is something like I guess I guess I get seasonal affective disorder because my sister-in-law is from Finland when I go to Finland and it's gray and dark I don't feel good it's sad I get said I get sad and actually I don't mind the cold cold I don't mind the really frigid freezing I lived in New York for 10 ish years depending on how you count it and the and the winters out there when it's crisp and bright and blue sky and you grew up in the Northeast you know what that's like well it's a nice day I don't actually care if it's only 5 degrees Fahrenheit if it's if it's like sunny right but but I don't like gloom New York in Boston in particular it gets really gloomy in the winter I definitely think that affects people I definitely used to affect me but it's not as bad like Colorado gets super fucking cold but it's really sunny and Colorado doesn't have any of that shit it's not I agree with you it's not necessarily the cold as much as it is the lack of Sun we need clear skies that's Ryan's feel better yeah that's what I don't like about London and Amsterdam and cities like San as well Seattle and one more than Portland tomorrow hollow 2 shows okay good night city but again fuck you Portland's awesome how many days of the years a train 289 days of sunshine in Vancouver bullshit what is Jamie why you looking up here and we chose a result it does cause 166 days with measurable precipitation so a little bit up but the note on to coverage is it rains part of the day but hang on $289 sunshine and that just might mean that at some point during the day that there was a bit of a glimmer of Sun that's all I need bro just a little alarm to go to and as it would I know we're still on a planet I know there's a bubble I'm good have you seen about about the election in quite a few stories coming out of Europe this week I did a story I did my podcast today about there's the British prime minister just called a snap election yeah try to reaffirm her mandate for breakfast and the French we go to the polls next week in for the first round of the presidential election which could see the far-right leader marine lepen win in France and if she does she wants to crash out of the euro currency you know break do freqs it sort of brexit cross and if France leave the EU then that actually is all over like any written friendly if that happens would France leave the EU I saw that there's massive anti-fascist protests this week yeah so the way that their electoral system works is they instead of doing it all in one day they basically whoever can run and get on the ballot that there's like maybe eight to twelve candidates who are on the ballot next week and then assuming that one person don't get one of them doesn't get more than 50% of the vote which I almost never do that then goes to a second round ballot which is next month's and that's the actual presidential election between the two main candidates and what it looks like is that the far-right leader who is softer than her dad who founded the far-right party was but he was like a Holocaust denier and like a serious anti-semite and she's just an anti Muslim like anti-immigration and de you sort of like more right-wing version of Trump she will get through in next week's election which means she's going to win her I don't know the polls say she won't but the polls didn't say the brexit was going to happen or that Donald Trump was going to win either so the question is will people stay at home because the person who she's most likely to be running against is just this kind of slick nice handsome doesn't really believe in anything not really a politician but kind of pragmatic I mean maybe that'll work I don't know but it's a bit of a worry if you care about the stability of Europe and like Germany and France not ever being in a war again for them not to be missing together and into the European Union I do worry about it and then there was a turkey thing that we were talking about so we've got these three these kind of pieces of jigsaw puzzle that have been bashing around in my head over the past few days about like will we look back on this period as just a starting point to something even bigger like I already think that it's amazing like the Trump is amazing like I mean if two years ago I was on when was I first on this show maybe three years ago or something like I don't you know if someone had walked in that door then said to us okay in 2017 you're going to be back on the show you're going to be talking to each other and the FBI will be conducting an active investigation into whether or not the government of the day conspired with Putin in Russia to spread misinformation and illegally hack the emails of the Democratic Party on by the way the president is Donald Trump and we know that the hacking happened we know that the russians hacked did hack this and did spread misinformation but the only question is whether the FBI is trying to figure out whether or not there was active collaboration with the government what do you think about that I mean we would be like that's a Carter that's a fucking cartoon story that is cray crazy cloud cuckoo-land and so that's where my head has been at but that would have been if we did have that conversation that would have been before the nightclub shooting in Paris that have been before the truck ran all over those people and nice yep like the those are those terrorist attacks that they have had over in France and in Germany have scared the fucking shit out of people yeah and letting all those people in from Syria with no vetting and letting a lot of Muslims come into the country that may have some real hate in their heart for this new land that they found I mean they've got some real issues yeah and that's when a person who's a fascist who comes along who's like this anti-immigration you know comes from a racist background super right wing that's most people take hold well this is what I always say I'm actually I'm talking to Sam Harris tomorrow on my podcast and this is something that he and I talk about a lot which is it we have to find a new way to converse about the problem of Islamic jihadism without being so full of shit if we if you are if you are a globalist an internationalist like I am if you basically believe you're a globalist that's a negative thing but I know I've only got it I've only started using that term lately because the old right thinks that globalism is like this Jewish you know global conspiracy and I love Allah so I'm like trying to take over the world I'm as oh I'm an open-minded person so I think what I would hide it well I would define it as being someone who doesn't like borders and who doesn't like nationalism and jingoism and believes that we are all one and should try to get along you know what I hear bro I hear New World Order that's what I hear this motherfuckers New World Order I'm Jerry we have him on the show Franklin camps is that what it was and I was shown suppression was getting close wasn't it Alex Jones as a performance artist is that what you claim you know what I asked people on twit what I should ask you and overwhelmingly overwhelmingly it's all like why does he legitimate quacks like Alex Jones really don't equivalence problem oh no no no I didn't review Simon about by factors like Alex Jones how many people don't interview like Alex Jones yeah first of all I don't interview anybody not interviewing you am i no I'm not an interviewer I suck at that I kind of interviewed Ron Miscavige yesterday I talked to people and I record it sit not journalists but I stretch the imagination Alex Jones been my friend for 20 years he's fucking crazy I showed everybody how crazy wasn't my podcast by getting him high and drunk and having talked about interdimensional child molesters if you watch that and you think I'm legitimizing Alex Jones some sort of a way then you're just you're you just you're looking at things in a very cookie cutter way you're deciding that this is what I've done but a lot of people listen to you and so I think the criticisms these people have is like people put faith in in you and they assume that if you don't raise a question again something that that means that that you tacitly agree with what's being said and that that allows you know the range of the questions about Alex Lydon oh I didn't listen to your raise questions but we were more bullshitting than anything and having fun and he was hammered I mean people got a chance to see if they're actually using footage of the conversation that we had against him in his custody battle because they're saying he was in Los Angeles on film smoking marijuana he's a loose cannon and that's the literally being game against that he doesn't even give a fuck they asked him about a battle they asked him a question about kitty couldn't rumors also had a large bowl of chili for lunch today I can't remember he's fucking crazy he's crazy and he makes ridiculous amounts of money I'm so luckily he doesn't give a fuck he's a great guy I swear to god he's a great guy okay just he's just got a ridiculous platform and he's kind of character hmm but he that's who he is man you think he's a performance house I think there is a part of what he does that is most certainly theater I think anybody doesn't go there I goes out Todd comes in Todd comes out it's a bad impression gonna work on it almost as my Trump impression fortunately I never listened to Ellis Jones so I don't really know what he I mean I see clips of him when someone shares something with me online but like it lasts too short to listen to Alex Jones the best clips or when he gets mad he apologizes I'm a Christian sorry I have to say no he caught someone someone said something about him recently and he went all I never swear never swear and 20 years of nurse Warren on the air but this fucking fat fuck me he fucking crazy I did well you got and these I'm sorry I'm sorry I apologize on children listen this is wrong I mean he's fucking he's a maniac I'm not giving him I'm not giving him legitimacy he already has a massive platform arguably bigger than mine what I'm doing is showing you what I see when I hang out with Alex shows people like why you're friends with Alex Jones like he's a nice guy I like him look I have a friend do I argued with for a fucking hour yesterday thinks I'm pretty sure he thinks the fucking world is flat yeah that's another one thank God satellite if Danny Bravo yeah he thinks satellites aren't real he doesn't believe in dinosaurs he thinks dinosaurs are bullshit he doesn't believe in nuclear bombs he's out to lunch he doesn't believe in nuclear bombs listen man you can't you can't even hold it to the fire it's it's ridiculous I don't understand his thought process and again I've been friends with him as long as I've been friends Alex Jones it doesn't wait closer with Eddie way closer yet he's one of my best friends huh huh he's fucking crazy uh-huh but if you talk to him about conspiracies but if you talk to him about like MMA or he's a jujitsu genius he's like one of the very best to Jitsu instructors on the planet earth without a doubt maybe this comes back again to the like how we can compartmentalize our minds right like a religious person who believes in that story of Jesus but is also otherwise super intelligent that's a perfect analogy yeah yeah it's it's and you know I don't know how people's brains work I don't understand I you know I've I've tried to study like people's really irrational thinking and tried it but you know what I worry more than anything I worried that it's a contagious disease I think it is I think it is and this is one I'm a bit worried about where we're at culturally at the moment and and because I think that concern about irrationalism being contagious is not too dissimilar from my concern about a disrespect for the idea of truth and falsehood being contagious so you know when I was talking about the the this analyst this Russian journalist who was talking about the ways in which Putin and Chavez and other one in Turkey and the Hungarian dictator whatnot dictated Hungarian president who is a becoming a quasi dictator the way that they kind of use the muddiness of the whole question of what's true or false as a way of throwing sand in the gears of the whole democratic process and sand in the gears of people's ability to kind of analyze the world and figure out what's true and false and what's important and not important that if all you're doing every day is just tweeting out like a stream of nonsensical bullshit that is neither true nor false but kind of exists in like this meta area of like you are Trump's ego then I actually have found myself becoming less convinced about reliable sources of information and myself becoming more susceptible to irrational ideas like I don't feel as confident anymore like it's easy because there's so much you see so much stuff of like I'll tweet out something that The Washington Post or The Wall Street Journal or the New York Times have published all of which I regard as being upstanding publications where I have faith that the journalists are doing their best not always perfectly but doing their best in the long haul to tell the truth and only report facts and then people will say ah fake news back news others are bullshit and they'll link to something they like show instead if there's kind of a kind of equivalence between those two things and I have to remind myself email you know said are you talking about an actual specific thing you just speak in generality no people have linked people have told me that they believe there's no difference between the credibility of Alex Jones and the credibility of the New York Times does the New York Times talk about interdimensional child molester not yet not yet but let's give you time Joe it's it's early days in the New York Times has fucked up in the past yeah and they they have strayed from unbiased journalism which is an issue because as soon as you start doing that as soon as you edit Oriya lies the news you open yourself up for people who point out that you editorialize the news and then point out the fact that you're biased and look they have but hold on they have been not that's an issue and I think they realize that they that has been used against them and I think that's one of the things that they addressed when they talked about sort of reinvigorating the idea of objective journalism and they start talking about that after the Trump election after you was elected president they talked about this reinvigoration this sort of recommitting themselves to real hard dream yes that's right I think a lot of people also don't understand the difference between the editorial page and like the opinion pages and the news mm-hmm section is true but even the news section has been biased you know there have been scare has been a couple of occasions I've read in vastly overblown I think yeah they have but as soon as you just leave open that potentially a possibility that people go oh you're a bunch of left wingers like a lot of people think that because they got the election wrong that means that you can't trust polls here's another way in which in which this kind of insidious idea that nothing is trustworthy and there's no such thing as the truth or facts or you know your version of history is as good as anyone's version of this you did another thing that Lawrence Krauss was saying on my podcast by the way which is he thinks that there's a link between the kind of postmodern like hippie 1960s like philosopher movement of like hey believe whatever you want to man like there is no truth right like soot is all salt socially constructed and like gender is entirely socially constructed and there is no such thing as masculinity it's all just I don't know some kind of capitalist story that we've all been led to believe so I like put a flower in your hair and bust out of it and let your truth be whatever you want the truth to be he sees a link between that and what you might think of as being something very opposite which is the hard right kind of alt right Trumpy sort of fake news phenomenon because both of them make the claim that there's no such thing as the truth essentially and your truth is whatever is true for you there were a million people a dog at inauguration okay the warships were steaming towards North Korea okay Trump said it doesn't matter whether it's true or not true with some let's unpack that one step at a time I definitely think that some of the as we said before some of the reasons why Trump became popular are these ridiculous assertions that gender has no basis in biology that you can be anything you want you can be Fox can you know that you can you know you can identify with being I mean is there's people that are trying to figure out whether or not transracial is a thing yeah Rachel Dolezal was on CNN and she was talking about the fact that race is a social construct interesting wasn't it it is interesting because people don't want to accept that black people get really mad they're getting really mad and yet they also say the same thing like I mean anyone worth their salt understands that race is not a genetic thing this is a cultural construct and I mean I find it I find her logic sort of hard to fly in a default in a ways more a social construct it's most certainly more solid than saying there's no biological basis for gender that's right there's more biological basis to sex than there is to you know there's more relation controller and sex yeah horizontal issue there's an X Y chromosome that males have and if a male decides that he identifies with being a female look there's a boy that's running track now there's a new ones they've had a few of these is the one that was a girl that was a wrestler that was taking she want to be a boy so she was taking testosterone and crushing all these other girls and wrestling she won the state title in Texas I think you mean he was I crazy or whatever but now there's a boy who's not even taking treatment who decides he identifies as a girl and he's just whipping everybody's ass and track because he's a fucking boy right no he's a girl but he's not he's not a girl we have to find a way to like separate the psychological psychology from the physiology I wish for its second sports that 100 especially in combat sports and I took a lot of heat because I was saying that there was a there was a man who was a man for 30 years it became a woman and didn't tell people that he used to be a man for 30 years and beat the fuck out of two chicks yeah before eventually came out and now once once you're out look I say especially in professional sports you have you have a right like to to say no or to say yes to compete against that person I think of a woman wants to fight against a man if a woman's 130 pounds she wants to fight against the man at 130 pounds they both agree do whatever you want I think you should be allowed to but I think that there's a big difference between someone who has been a man their whole life has had testosterone flowing through their bones their blood their body their whole life and then decides they're a woman versus a woman who is born a woman raised a woman and is a biological woman her entire life yeah a transgender woman just is not a regular biological woman it's there's a difference but saying that gets people so angry saying that a transgender woman who you can say is a woman I say that but saying that they're the same thing as a biological woman is just not factually true well it's different they have different chromosomes yeah they have a different structure the hips are built different the shoulders are wider the hands are bigger there's so many factors that's right this is what makes people so frustrated about you know the whole political correctness they're right that we set up trip wires and if you trigger one of those trip wires by making a claim like the one you just made which is that the trans woman is not exactly the same as a sis woman a non trans well I'm not using sis I can do it not going to do it not real what you wanna call them disease I'll go Z observe no Z is the Z instead of she for a trends no it's not instead of she with later shit sorry did I just trigger on a hook apply to that it's non janitor so transphobic it is a non gender bait no that's what I'm a heel it's he or she for people who don't have a gender it's what the fuck it is and you sitting over there as a male was an actual male an assist male thank you very much yeah not an actual male biological male not all men have penises I had buck angel on oh yeah who's a transgender man who uses the term biological male he says there's a difference in biological man he was born a woman and then transitioned to being a man and he says biological male and he says that trans people hate on M for using the term biological what does he mean by the term there was someone who has X Y chromosome a biological male versus his because XS oh I see I see yeah yes oh I thought you meant that he calls himself a biological no no he a cause other people biology drug yeah sure he's like you sure you should be able to differentiate without being prejudiced it's so I mean that's crazy look weird I just I just think that people should be able to live however they want to live their life and grow I don't you know I don't spend a lot of time thinking about this but I just wish that we were all generous enough that when people find it a little bit difficult to understand you don't assume that they're bigoted just because it's a new concept for them because you and I think as you say it this is part of what gave rise to trump the I mean the parallel that I was drawing a moment ago between like post-structuralist there is no such thing as gender and Trump's fake news campaign was not so much that were the one led to the other it was just that both this is the point that Lawrence Krauss is making both undermine the they both erode the idea of truth and what's ironic is it's almost exactly the same thing that Bill O'Reilly said the tie goes in the time comes out people push this way and then people go fuck you there is a biological difference and then they push that way and then they get bigoted transphobic I mean there's there's a lot of people to get upset at ridiculous ideas and then they get they go overboard yeah oh the other way it's so stupid like louis c.k has that bit about gay people as well he's like I understand people don't understand why people get angry at the existence of gay people even if they're not in their lives well I like even better the gay marriage thing yeah exactly people get furious okay Louis says like I would understand it's like there were a couple of guys fucking on my lawn and I had to like hose them down to get them or like the gay people were just like touching their dicks in front of my face as I'm trying to eat my breakfast cereal right but as long as they're not bothering me and understand the point in getting upset about their mere existence out there yeah and it's the same with trans people I understand why that is this big thing about trans people I understand it's silly what I mean this comes to also like people who are currently obsessed with political correctness as being the biggest problem facing America today I feel like have missed the boat their fight in last year's battle they're fighting yesterday's battle when the actual battle to fight is the day before yesterday's battle which is today's battle which is a battle against bigotry I think which is a battle against Trump a battle against the idea of fake news a battle against America eventually having its own Putin like strongman anyone who's spending all of their time doing all of their shows about how terrible political correctness is and you know my lowly innopolis should be able to say whatever he wants which of course you should is not I think is like well political correctness is a response to people feeling that there's an injustice people feeling there is bigotry and prejudiced and so they go too far with it they get Nick Ulis and it's also a natural human inclination to try to control other people's behavior people like to be bossy and they like to be able to tell you what you can and can't do they like to tell you what words you can and can't use it's a weird thing that people do and it may be a response to the frustration that they feel legitimate frustration from actual bigotry and it makes them go overboard it makes them go too far yes it's a lack of perspective on both sides then that's a giant issue with human beings and you know what I think it actually was like the past few times that we've gotten together and shot the shit on this show political correctness and the extremes of it have been a major topic of conversation and I think justly so but I do think that last year with the election of Trump and the kind of welling up of kind of subtly anti-semitic coded racially coded language during the election campaign last year how do you clean rat anti-semantic when Jared Kushner is like his main guy I don't think Trump is an anti-semite other think some hates Jews so Evoluzione ice-o-matic a lot of people who support Trump hmm right but there's no evidence that he is right I don't think so no I think he's just an old no why I I think he's an old white guy with traditional ideas about about what made America great and those traditional ideas coincide with an America that was a lot wider and more Christian than in the country that we see today I think that's the way it becomes racially I've never even been a religious person not really interesting why isn't it talk about no children of God yeah be forced to supple sure to feet like what a fraud is such a go and get your steak knives and your Trump University do that's like you know he's a charlatan Trump steaks steaks may also shows her how fuckin corrupt the religious writer for having gotten behind him so quickly when he was he went down a Liberty University he gave a speech II was like you know the my favorite part of the Bible 2 Corinthians but not it announced 2 Corinthians its second Corinthians ever even even if you defensive part went to Bible School when you're a kid you remember that so they know he's a fraud he was asked by an interviewer what his favorite part of the Bible is used like well I'm not going to get into that kind of personal you know that's personal hasn't read the fucking Bible now he doesn't pray he's got a long Bible we gotta hit that I wrote it exactly as well McKnight is underwear and he talks and somebody writes it down yeah one day that'll be the Bible the best Bible it's been an amazing Bible so they're all corrupt and full of shit the religious right for getting behind him when they always talk about how important personal faith is and that in their candidates yeah but I mean what else are they going to do they go towards Hillary I mean what I'm sorry I mean during the primary yeah but who else would they go with he's going to win they knew he had hers Ted Cruz's never shot he's too wormy people see him sweat too much yeah we're easily lost the election but what I'm saying is they would rather but yet they would rather have Donald Trump win the election than have Ted Cruz lose the election on with principles yeah well which is amazing because now you see people saying I wish Ted Cruz was in office like there's a lot of people on the left that would have been happy with Ted Cruz yeah no not me well he's really anti-gay he's very anti-gay and he's very smart he's extremely you know he was like a champion of the Harvard debating team parent I think was Harvard I reckon right what do you think when you look at him you got gaydar right yeah I do it good yeah being a gay man can you pick out gay James me up if you're in a room yeah baby yeah yeah yeah I'm pretty good you're pretty good at it he doesn't really he gives a visit on the conservative right there's a fine line between slimy asshole and closeted gay another man you don't think there's some connection some some like well know that I'm saying legalize a relationship like they could be but the problem is they never underlying root system fungus sort of connection they communicate via electronic signals using fungal yeah deep under the surface pray the gay away it's possible but they often they also like ted haggard is a good example yeah right you remember that guy yeah yeah he was he seemed gay to me he had a little like his sibilants were a little bit skis you know what is that found list bees and gay I don't get it well I don't know because I'm like obviously not the most gay presenting person that you've ever met so I think that work yeah I don't know it's not cleaning I wouldn't know yeah so you could present as gay well so here's part of the thing about gender as well this is the right that brings us back to Rachel Dolezal and race and stuff like that like obviously so maybe there is some biological reason why dudes are attracted to dudes tend to exhibit mannerisms that are more commonly associated with femininity right maybe a sing-songy voice a certain style of walking swish sashaying a sushis and like my friends that I was talking about the couple yeah very clear male and female in the relation interesting one of them does appear gay like yeah that's a gay guy uh-huh but the other guy you would have to know him right you wouldn't know and so but then so what I think if there's a kernel of biology in that I think it's been ramped up aggressively over the past century by people also playing the role of gay in the same way that masculine dudes play the role of you know musculus directors will play the role of masculinity and girls will play the role of being girly and in that respect people who point out that gender is not the same as sex or right like gender is a bunch of behavioral tropes that we all act out and so it's interesting to me like when you say why are gay people what if gay people act a part of it must be an act well there's like maybe real Telegraph to each other maybe yeah but there's also just this broad spectrum of individuals it's so different I mean there's there's there's masculine people that are so incredibly different than other masculine people there's a feminine women that are so incredibly different than other feminine women I mean just people are they vary they vary widely biologically socially they vary by their own neuro chemistry I mean there's people that are just almost naturally inclined to be depressed there's some people that you could shit right in their hair and they be fuckin happy a few people are weird man I'm a pretty happy person what do you think you lie on that spectrum of happiness I'm pretty happy yeah but I've worked at it I'm pretty aware of the pitfalls of like inactivity and I'm very I exercise a lot but even having the ability to motivate yourself to take action is all no something that you're learning have yeah I guess but how much of that is from learned behavior how much of that is from what you know the way I grew up there's a lot of factors yeah yeah there are my parents did not exercise at all I mean fucking zero when I was growing up zero they would come home from work and drink and I did I just was like look I gotta do something with this body like this body wants to go to war I gotta I gotta get out and run I gotta hit a punching bag I got to lift some weight I got to do something yeah I was just always like like I felt like there was an engine inside of me that was revving up all the time and I had to go run it I didn't I didn't get out there and push it I didn't feel calm and it took me till I was like a teenager before I figured that out and then once I figured that out once I started exercising it was like there was me pre working out and then me so I go now I can think now and then I realized I was kind of under the influence of biology for so long yeah I mean you're lucky that you didn't channel that that into drug czar or alcohol or grass drugs or a question yeah yeah violence is the real worry like that that's a giant issue with boys when you see kids playing and I was at party recently a little kids party it was an adult's party when you're doing a little errands potty like I made that with all right little kids okay and there was this one boy and this one boy has these two parents that there you have a kid late in life they weren't early paying attention they were inside drinking and this kid was fucking hyper aggressive running around pushing kids he hit kids like I watched him I watched him call this kid a loser and you know I had to have a conversation with the dad I'm like dude your kids really aggressive he's like he's a good kid I'm like yeah I wanted it's so hard because you want to say hey man you don't even fucking watch ya kid you're in here drinking yeah I'm like look I saw him push this kid and call him a loser like that never happened like oh my god he goes look I'm trying to apologize because his kid did something I'm trying to apologize for his behavior I'm like you not apologizing you're saying he didn't do anything my god I'm sorry I'm sorry that this is the case but this is what happened what is it with parents defending their kids so much these days if a parent had come up to my parent when I was a little kid and told them that I've been doing something like that it would have been the grown-ups gathering together against the child in order to kind of communally raise the child like if my dad would not have said he didn't do that he will come up to me and said did you do that this guy and his wife were both drinking that could have definitely been a factor and there was a factor in me not pushing because I didn't want because first of all he when a guy says to you that didn't happen when you know it happened yeah yours two steps away from beating the fuck out he wasn't there you were there you know what happened how does he know that it didn't happen and this study we're doing today we're two steps away from well he was watching his kid at all yeah and his kid first of all he they had to go to visit his kid because his kid hit other kids on three occasions his father he has really good ground sorry leaving that it never happened it's probably happened over a course of you know this is over a course of a couple of hours yeah kid hit three kids and so when you say to a guy that your kids really aggressive he's like he's a good kid yeah no he's not he's a good kid oh he's a good kid you evil fucking no hey maybe he's a good kid who's being aggressive right now doesn't change what I saw what I'm saying is kids especially boys they have this thing inside of them some of them do some of them don't but you know we very biologically some of them have this aggressive tendency that's why boys like to play football that's why boys gravitates or some boys gravitate towards aggressive activities so you got to get it out of their system you got to exercise with that kid you got to do something with them play catch with them run around with them wear them out there people are not meant to sit down in a fucking classroom and just pay attention all day to some shit they don't want to pay attention to and then go home sit in front of the TV and what do they do with all that energy they put them on ritalin that kept us from you know kept us alive kept us from predators kept us from invaders I mean that all that stuff is biologically programmed in the human animal and we ignore it you're being very transphobic by implying that there's something male intrinsically I'm a transphobic or is it gender I don't know gender essentialism I think that's what it's called no I'm with you and this is a problem I mean it's a problem about the about fatherhood right or something I'm thinking about about now that I'm about to become a father like how do I run around take care - yeah and how do I also make sure that like they grow up with good masculine role models and people and that I give they enable them to be the best kinds of human beings that they want to flourish in - and then you've got the whole question of adderall and Ritalin and so on like these my neighbor did that my neighbor put their kid on ritalin one of them Prozac Ritalin something like that they had this kid and he wasn't a bad kid he was just fucking ignored the same thing you know the wife the wife was always trying to get dick from everybody she was like flirting and everybody worked with my friends flirt with everybody and the husband was just fuckin dealing with this crazy bitch for a wife he didn't want to be there and he would work late and this poor kid was just bouncing off the walls they put him on drugs there's a em there's a economist called Tyler Cowen I don't know if you know of Tyler he was he would have he's the kind of guy who now that he's in his mid-50s says that he's sure that when he was young he would have been medicated if it were you know if if he were a young person today and the point that he was making about that was that human psychology is complicated and there's no sort of yen without the yang right like the be distracted nurse but he had was bad if what you wanted was for him to sit still in class and pay attention to something that he wasn't interested in yes but fantastic in a whole bunch of other ways that he means were invaluable yeah right yeah well my best friend Sam in Australia who is a brilliant like soil scientist one of the country's and possibly the world's best scientist in his field has a PhD if if we'd been growing up if instead of being born when we were born we've been born just ten years later what would his creative what would have happened to his creativity if he'd been meta matted in order to be able to get through class because he was always distracted herons don't care they want convenience especially parents at work all day they work all day and they come home and they want this kid to fucking behave because there's nerd and they want this life that they see in movies and in television shows they don't know what it's like to raise a human being and it's very complex and you know especially when you're sending these fucking kids to schools that they promote these rigid ideas of how children are supposed to behave and you know and tell you that if you don't follow their rules you're not going to be successful I mean how many fucking stories have you heard where teachers tell rowdy kids they're never going to mount anything I had a teacher telling me I'll never fucking forget it yep I had that as well because she was just so dumb she was so she was so dumb and such a bad teacher and I was a terrible student I mean she was certainly frustrated his public schools right but I said something and she was a this black woman a terrible accent she had a very bad Ebonics accent and I was a talking to my friend and she goes mr. Rogan would you like to come up here and do both of these problems in front of class so I go would you like me to do both of those problems and you know everybody everybody started laughing Harlech kids are like oh shit and so she kicked me out of class for that and I said all I did was talk the way you talk yes and you kicked me out yeah go just because you're teaching a math class shouldn't you learn how to talk shitting learn how to talk correctly for students and she kicked me out and she I remember said go ahead laugh mr. Rogan mr. Rogan is never going to amount to anything in life yeah unlike schoolteacher but i rep something wrong with being a public school teacher but I think she didn't amend very much it's not true it's a great job if you do it right what I'm saying has influence over public school teachers a worthless and should be executed that was precisely the policeman I'm trying to make so rude first of all you're not even American not over and say that shit we have public school teachers no of course I love that school today in the guy why was saying that is because she's a cunt she was not another we should be criticizing her not for her occupation but for her constant what's a fucking horrible job man I mean I wouldn't want to deal with Noelle at 15 yeah who the hell wants to deal with a fifteen year old boy we didn't want to pay attention who doesn't give a shit about math but you know she left a weak spot do you think well also the whole question of like how of speaking well as a teacher if you're an educator then you sort of have to have your shit together in terms of being educated but then that also bumps up against are we being racist by implying that black American English is less educated than standard white English because some people argue that that black English is just a dialect of the language well you could argue that but you know what the same would be held if this was I mean this is in Massachusetts the same would be held if it was a guy who was a teacher who had a ridiculous Boston accent and I mocked his Boston accent yeah like if you said you know something about pakiya fucking cat and I was like which is like me to pack my cat correctly yeah kicked me out because of that it's the same thing Australian accent hey heaven forbid you're mocking someone's inability to communicate correctly and because look whether or not it's good or bad like you might like saying both better you might like it and there's nothing wrong with that look if you're a happy successful person you don't like to say both you like to say both what the fuck is wrong with that it's just a sound you make with your mouth sure but if I can say it if I can repeat it and you you're so touchy about it you kicked me out of class were you fucked up hmm you fucked up you got a soft spot that's right no yes she feels she feels insecure about it exactly how big laughs but on this one of my first big laughs I was like ah I could mock things yeah but just you know she just she's under pressure terrible job not getting paid very much and you have to be a babysitter as well as an educator yeah fucking horrible I mean there's I had Frank Rich on my podcast on with people who was who he's an executive producer on the veep and he was the katli was like the main columnist on the New York Times opinion page for about 15 maybe almost 20 years in the 90s and the 2000s and he sort of started the New York Times weekend review section which comes out in the Sunday paper these days and he had a piece in New York magazine which was about how much empathy we should feel towards uneducated people he was talking specifically about Trump about like Trump voters because like since the election there's been quite a lot of hand-wringing among progressives about like we've been focusing too much on these issues like trans rights and gay rights and so on and identity politics and black lives matter and we've lost touch with the working-class base like the Democratic Party no longer speaks in a meaningful way to white working-class especially males and especially in Rust Belt cities you know in in the Midwest and his point was actually fuck'em you shouldn't need to pay attention to them there are lost cause they keep voting against their own interest by voting for people like Trump and voting for Republicans don't try to win them over and stop trying to understand them and wringing your hands about why you've lost them it's an interesting episode of people what I mean obviously I'm grossly over exaggerating what his actual position is but you should you can actually listen to one side I can see how someone would take that stance but I think there's just a natural inclination to go left and right with people there's a natural inclination to react to certain right-leaning behaviors by going far left and the natural inclination to go like like how many people grow up from really regressive religious backgrounds and then they become like really secular they get older they abandon the religion they become reformed Catholics it's really common yep it's really common to to see the suppression of one ideology and bounce in the other direction if you have a parent I mean there's a lot of people that you know they grow up in the parents are super hippies and then they become conservative yes a rebel against their parents it's really common yep that's what I'm always thinking about in terms of Parenthood as well like no matter what it is that I try to fix in the way that my parents raised me where I think they could have done it better that's just going to swing in the opposite direction that my kids are going to do the opposite because because you always think that your parents did an imperfect job right so you're writing yesterday so everybody does an epic job it's impossible to be perfect you're a fucking human being there's no perfect human beings they've never existed Jesus Cupid the Dali Lama is not perfect how about fucking Gandhi Gandhi used to sleep with a bunch of girls naked in his room he was probably a freak like Gandhi was most likely a freak and he just they just kept it under wraps because he was Gandhi but you know the story used to sleep with naked teenagers yeah there's also weird things about I mean him and also Mother Teresa have weird things in their personal lives what'd she do well I don't think it was sexual but I think there was a lot of there a lot of questions about like our ethical dealings in terms of the mother Teresa foundation and where her money went and like would it go too well for a start she didn't think that it was very the she didn't think was a good idea to empower young women what if you would found out that all her money went to a warehouse filled with dildos well I thought fuck like she did a lot of good but she also bought a lot of Dilbert is it fucking gigantic show about one of these she'd be way more than she could use way more than anyone took at the door is Dorothy's fucking Harley Davidson powered vibrators I love it yeah well I mean some people are not perfect and most charitable organizations are criticized for spending far too much on infrastructure and you know the administrative costs and then you find out how much money actually goes to charity like you just have an organization we've given people jobs and by the way you also do some good there are some good it's interesting because like whenever I give to charity I always try to pay attention to how many how many other heads they have and how much money is being spent on admin and so on but then it was actually I think will McCaskill or someone who's involved in the like the the life you can save kind of like give well movement which is one rationale is a practical altruism a rational altruism where effective officers have nothing on my podcast yeah last month yeah it's great um he was and and they were saying in actual fact it does take quite a lot of administration to make a dollar work well of course so if you just look at the ones that the charities with the lowest overhead then that it doesn't necessarily actually mean that they're doing the best work in the field because it might cost 40 cents out of every dollar to make sure that you're targeting the remaining 60 cents in a way where you'll get actually sixty cents of value rather than a place that only has a 15 percent overhead but then the remaining 85 cents are all being squandered on bullshit projects that don't have any measurable and then unless it's on the complete other end of the spectrum you have the Clinton Foundation which was a ruse I mean you look not essentially a prestige play wasn't it doesn't exist anymore God existed going under yeah they're closing it down as a matter of fact but please pull it up pretty sure they said they were shutting it down but I mean Bill Clinton would take hundreds of thousands of dollars and speak of his charitable events like people with Ghent they would spend a gigantic chunk of their budget to have Bill Clinton come and speak and he would take all of it he would take all the money he wouldn't have it back yeah so he would he would take these gigantic donations from people and then he would speak and get paid hundreds of thousand dollars yeah the speaking phase of crazy I mean even the fact that Hillary Clinton was taking speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and did not think that that would look bad in it saying give us all so stupid no I think now she gives a fuck well you know what Bernie Sanders drilled that and I'm so glad he did yeah look it's bribery it's a loophole there's a little in his bribery nobody wants to pay to hear her talk get the fuck out of here she's a terrible speaker at least hey you know I'm saying I mean it's not Chris Rock we're talking about this is she's not a good speaker the whole point date here because this is the whole thing about these a late Clinton Global Initiative to shut down lays off 22 as donations play but this is washing or that's a that's a no no no right-wing rag hug dare you check them that's that's not the only place that I saw it I saw it on a lot well this is they're shutting it at the top the top click is sniped so that'll tell little that's a em consider 0 the whole story about Snopes though know about the guy who run Snopes no God Snopes is run by a fucking kook the guy runs Snopes left his wife he started with his wife left his wife married a prostitute prostitute has a website where she was as recently as two years ago was getting reviewed for a prostitute work she's a skort and there they both have a clear left-wing bias clear like like she's been involved in well I mean show me you know I wish I mean II know so many smokes pages that say that something is true when it's not or the Saints nothing a selfish real there's not necessarily that it's true or its false there's these ambiguous areas where they always lean left and that's what people have stated about snow so it's kind of tricky okay but it's not it's it's simple it's not like this computer-controlled objective reality fan but it's wrong it's like PolitiFact's is also it also gets accused of being left-wing because right when people who are full of shit don't like being called out of it fake news yeah exactly it's not accident no I mean I haven't seen anything on Snopes that is it is questionable what do you think about that so the CNN thing when you went into the CNN reporter you are fake news oh my god well this is this is that reminded me of living in a banana republic it reminded me of living under in Venezuela you are a fake news yeah you are fake just that statement what the fuck does that even mean you are you're not news this is a goddamn person X you inveighing you are fake news Bank news also but so effective people loved it when you're you know the thug life meme yeah the the sunglasses shot down I saw the bunch of those and said that you are fake news sunlight I mean it did you guys were in the states when you were like kids we like did you have like I know you I you said you are but what am I like that kind of bullshit everybody that I think basically what he's saying yeah like people accuse no you like he was elected on the on the back he was elected by very very narrow majorities in a few key swing states that had been inundated with bullshit stories on Facebook that were coming out of Eastern Europe with Russian funding a bit and expend exploding all of these fake bombshell Bo's a is about how Hillary Clinton helped the FBI prosecutor who was looking into Hillary Clinton had been found dead and all this sort of stuff that was actually fake news then the word the term came into public public consciousness last year or now anyone who criticizes the administration he just does he just pulls up I know you are you said you are but what am i neck trick and says well that's not fake news you're fake news your face is fake news what did she think about when Julian Assange implied that that young man who worked for the DNC who was assassinated who shot in the back even they try to say was a robbery like they left his wallet they left his watch they left his phone they left all his money then that didn't take a thing from they shot him at four o'clock in the morning in the back Julian Assange was insinuating that this young man had been the source of the DNC leaks that implied that though that showed that Hillary Clinton and the DNC conspired against Bernie Sanders in the primary and you don't really hear about that anymore that guy's dead dead there's no investigation there's no no one was found guilty no one was tried there's no there's no no one's looking the guy was killed well I'd like to look into it I think Assange has kind of lost credibility by essentially becoming a conduit for the Kremlin like all of you know WikiLeaks we all know that the I mean people in security so every any time I talk about this people are going to respond and say oh you're just buying the security services line you just believing what the NSA and the CIA want you to believe right okay yeah I'm basically taking on faith the conclusions of security agencies here in the United States multiples to give more than a dozen different security agencies also confirmed by the Brits by British the British Secret Service all believe say that they have good reason to believe that the Kremlin was behind the hacks and that WikiLeaks released what must have been in cahoots with the criminal because otherwise how did they release the the dancy well there could have been many people that were here and the MCG was dealing with like you see fingerprints on things they know how these things work they can see the backdoors so do you think that Julian Assange was lying when saying that guy was part of the leaks I think could have been one of the conduits yeah it could have been one of the people that leaked it to Russia in the first place that's possible yeah that's possible I just don't know why I would be trusting Julian Assange about any of this because he says that didn't come from Russia well the other thing that I would worry about with Julian Assange is that this poor fuck has been trapped in the embassy in London yes so long and he can't get out I think his head is I think he's got a problem with his head these days I was actually not damn he's back Pamela Anderson makes a sixth visit to lover Julian Assange as she brings vegan cheeseburgers his Ecuadorian Embassy for the WikiLeaks Foundation what Pamela Anderson is banging Julian Assange hot powerful Julian Assange wait a minute hold on a second Julian is trying to free the world I love him for this panel Anderson reveals her feelings for Assange in rambling blogs on sex and faking orgasms they watch actress and model for Donna said to have been dating WikiLeaks founder has been stuck inside he's been stuck inside the embassy in Knightsbridge since 2012 it's not anything he's been stuck inside that [Music] were posters too big for him to get stuck back in Oakland well I guess he's done well for himself for a pale pasty Australian who's never would you say Jamie she's been visiting him there and whatnot for how long last couple months at least she's looking pretty good when you cover up put her on block yeah how old would pebble render some beta or not we just read it Oh already 1945 oh okay he's 45 she's 49 she's older woman Oh dark and hold her comes around doesn't look like a okay I mean time wins all of us yeah I look like shit compared to when I was 25 doesn't happen you could do about everyone does nothing you can do about it it just beat you you reckon we'll get to a point where science can reverse that it's on the way 100% the imagine not imagine what people would pay to be able to look and feel like they did when they were 25 well you know that Peter Thiel guys already getting down blood put into a system that doesn't trust him and Julian a son should should meet up and create some little underground empire you trust him I don't know he's something fishy about him he's a big trump guy which in itself in and of itself is not bad but he's such he's a very smart billionaire Trump guy billionaire gay trump card yeah weird and also that whole you know suing Gawker until it went under well they're even negative prick well they had it comin I mean they outed him and then they went after Hulk Hogan and then the guy said that he would release a sex tape of a child you know if he could get away with it remember that yeah I do and I didn't I didn't join them but I don't like setting up a precedent where very very rich people can just because it this wasn't the only thing that he was suing them about he was basically just throwing lawsuits at them that so fast that they couldn't keep their head above water and then they went under because I mean how can you eventually the person's going to win a lawsuit I don't like the idea that media companies well then jockey constantly sued they went after a creep I mean well they were creeps and they went after him they went after a rich guy yeah well we live in the we live in America which has a First Amendment they're supposed to be able to do that without without being sunk but should they be able to reveal details about his life that he doesn't want public that's what the First Amendment is you're not that a First Amendment that you're allowed to go after someone like say if somebody decides to just go after you you're not even a public person thank you izzy probably as a public person how is he public because people know who he is i don't actually know whether that was part of the purpose example it is alright crazy shit about you unfortunately yes really because that's what freedom is like i don't think that do you think that america would be a better place if fantastically wealthy people could launch an endless string of lawsuits whether or not they're legitimate at media companies they don't like that's a good question it really depends on what that media company did and why they did it so i mean i have not no fan of Gorkhas tawdry like i didn't consume any of that stuff i don't want to believe in out in people i don't think that that they were right but what it says about his character is what i find troubling it much like trump I basically don't like vindictive people who the moment you cross them they then spend the rest of their lives and fortune like coming back to hunt you down I don't think that's a man shoe a character trait I see your point I see your point arm the question would be what if they cost him money and they profited from it for nightingaie and then he well not only just a Crimea fuckin everybody I'm not the best example it's not the best example because you know something wrong with being gay should just been out in the first place right but that's his choice isn't it yeah it is his choice and I really believe in adding people but on the other hand like just grow up like I know but he didn't sue them over that he just decided they were cuts and he was good sue them about that but they didn't work and they sued him about he sued them on multiple occasions if you've got infinitely deep pockets you can ruin you will find a way to ruin people by dragging them through the gun secondly he should have been able to bankroll Hulk Hogan do you think Hulk Hogan had a legitimate great yeah I think so right I mean because wasn't wasn't the case he didn't realize that he was being fired at a time yeah yeah you shouldn't be able to have a video of you having sex with somebody that you didn't know was being taken yeah splash all over the Internet yeah and then profit from it and then profit from it sure though the real question was should he have been able to bankroll exactly that's right yeah or should there be some limit to the number of like lawsuits cuz I mean you would want people to be able to bankroll cases that they care about deeply right maybe not three or four completely unrelated cases all against the times hellenization side right that's work it's weird but there isn't this the like life in general yeah it's slippery yeah there's this I mean it's like we're talking about with abortion like what is it is it killing a baby Depp or is it a medical procedure you know they all just agree that it's both but like that not understand why they're especially in this country like it's so so polarizing here you know they're probably not a debate no oh come on man I know Austin Lee Dawkins had tweeted something about it that there's nothing did people like a human embryo was essentially the same thing as a pig embryo like ridiculous comparison to abortion well it's the religious right will always be crazy about the things that it's crazy about and people will always get offended on Twitter when Richard Dawkins tweets something that sums up go out by the way I have an interview with him coming up if so if you don't let me just plug if you don't subscribe to we two people live and search for We the People all one word and your podcast app I'll be talking to Sam Harris tomorrow which will get released in a couple of weeks and don't shout at me I'm not releasing it immediately like you did last time Twitter and we'll have some not to shove it we'll have some good now that they're right the exactly first remnant right it's true I'm going to sue their answers and drag them through court and I'll be talking to Joe about I'll be doing launching a little um ask me anything because no dog anything and so I had dog I did an alive a zero Dawkins had a stroke he's great he's fine he's doing well well the stroke did not affect his his cognitive function no did affect his ability to sing which is interesting oh that's interesting a tune yeah and so there are a few motor functions that aren't affected but it didn't did yet as you say it didn't affect his cognitive so that'll be being released so follow at WTP underscore live I'm talking underscore go find it it's all signed up weird people anyway so what Richard Dawkins was saying and is people are going to be angry at him on Twitter regardless of what he says but I still affirm that in the state that's in the states the conversation around abortion is uniquely different from the way that it is in Europe and in Australia it's much more of a it's just much more of a fault line issue and I wonder whether in hindsight it wouldn't have been better for roe v wade not to actually have been decided by the supreme court that way right well just because I know people going to hit on over wall you fuckin cisgender piece of shit I believe I believe in a motion surrogate mom believe in abortion rights but I don't believe that it's that you can find in the Constitution of the United States a right so inalienable that the Supreme Court like where is it in the Constitution the Supreme Court said there's a right to privacy therefore there's a right to abortion because we don't want to interfere in women's affairs but that presupposes that the embryo isn't a human you don't have the right to privacy to kill somebody right I mean if I go into a room my right to privacy doesn't extend to me get being able to get away with killing a baby the question of whether or not it's a baby is the relevant question right that's not addressed at you know in in Roe so I think that it should be legal but I think that it should be legal through the legislative process I think that is a legitimate democratic aspiration for people to be able to and if it means that it does it's not legal in Alabama because a majority of people in Alabama don't want it I don't think the founding fathers would have a problem with that well there's a strong amount of large amount of people that don't want men talking about this at all ya will feel that you should be able notice process yes that's the advantage of the problem that's one of the main problems and email issues we're seeing a woman being upset that a man with no stake in the game is stepping up and saying that a woman should or should not be able to have an abortion well why I mean how do I have stake in the game of whether or not for example murder should be legal okay this is not that this is this is something different this is no more if there's nothing to read something more Allegiant it might be to you but it might not be to them if it's just half okay here's the morning-after pill mm-hmm is that the same as an abortion I don't care because I don't think there's anything wrong with the pregnant no I don't think there's anything wrong with a brother is if it's a nine month old baby the baby's in there it's about to come out the next day you decide to open her up and stab it in the head this is what I'm arguing fall is a kind of incrementalism which you were just alluding to right it's not a black or white thing why can't we but work out we all appreciate that it's both because it's become so polarized in the United States that both positions are bullshit and people on both sides know that both positions are bullshit it's bullshit to say that it is just a women's health issue and has no ethical implications whatsoever even if as you say you're talking about cutting a woman open at nine months and stabbing the embryo in the head it's also bullshit to say that the instant and egg is fertilized that is a person that should have all of the rights to life that an adult should have and then it's murder to kill a blastocyst but smaller than the size of the head of a pin right it's over the condition is stupid this is an incremental situation life evolves it grows a fetus grows it becomes a human being when Peter Singer the great philosopher also an Australian says that under certain conditions infanticide the killing of babies should be legal and could be ethical well he's an animal not he loves animals more than but he but he makes a legitimate point which is that you know why does it make a difference one day after the baby is born suppose you've got a premature baby that's born you know four weeks early in fact now we can already make babies survive it right right around the point of viability which is where abortion is still on the on the fringe of so say you've got a 22 or 23 24 week old baby no not not we called baby after that I'm taking our time from me from the moment of Inception conception that could live outside the womb right at the moment it gets born it becomes murder to kill it but you could have killed exactly the same organism with exactly the same future exactly the same prospects and exactly the same life if it was inside the womb in the ER devastates well which on the road under roe v wade I'm not talking about late term I'm talking about the point of viability roe v wade state the viability time it's been interpreted as being like that 20 to 24 weeks so this is not perfectly set up I don't I don't think I don't know whether or not that comes out of the actual ruling where they were writing it in roe v wade but I do know that that is the way that it's been interpreted by lower courts since then but maybe they actually spelled out the number of weeks either way you know he's pointing to it to a legitimate and remember sort of moral hypocrisy the very sighs complicated slippery issue it's not simple black or white right and the idea that we shouldn't be allowed to think and talk about the the moral quandary of this because we can't have babies well I'm not agree until I'm not agreeing to that no and I'm saying that is an argument that women want a because they'd feel they feel like there's just unjust sort of male dominance on the female reproductive system look when I see a bunch of white men white old men sitting in Congress making rules against women predominantly young women predominantly young women of color who are in areas that have less the least amount of access related are usually women of color how so because safe legal abortions are more difficult to obtain in places like rural Alabama than they are in places like New York City yeah there's a lot of white people on rural Bama I don't just really think it's a racial issues much of poverty issue yeah okay like things like Planned Parenthood and shutting down Planned Parenthood's they're just going to affect people that don't have much money yep who are disproportionately people of color as well disproportionately in terms of the actual numbers of human beings are intended a census percentage-wise not the actual numbers of human beings it's not right but you can understand how it would look bad if you want to add people of color to that it accentuates the issue of makes it even more problematic and makes it more of a big left-wing progressive issue right that can't be argued against do you think the opposite is elimination against people of color oh don't want to do that it's people yes you may think but do you think that the optics would look as bad if all of the old white men who were writing the laws were black I think it all looks bad I don't think I'd look as bad the ID hold on a second you're saying that if old white men make these issues it doesn't look as bad I'm saying it looks work that is possible it looks worse than it will be like men we're making this issue against all poor people yeah because all the white men just seem to drip privilege because they you every single check box they've got going for them they're both male they're white and they're all in their argument anyway they're tortured argument I think UNR Thomas you don't think it looks weird when Clarence Thomas votes against abortion yeah I do yeah so there you go but I mean my point my point is simply I take the optics as being a bad thing I think the optics are worse if it's white people and if it's black people but I'm happy to happy to yield that point to concede that point if that's the sticking one the point is we have to be able to have conversations about anything without allowing our identities to prevent us from being able to think I mean agree with you behind that I came on this show was because I was getting into an argument with an activist about whether or not I had a right to have an opinion about whether or not Stephen Colbert had been racist right and she was claiming that I didn't I didn't have a right to have a conversation about it because I'm a white man well that was just the way she tried to get out of the argument you know the whole thing before that was her not understanding the joke and she didn't want to own up to the fact that you didn't understand the joke and then when sort of explained it to her she was using the you as a white man thing to try to deny your opinion don't you think it happens all the time I mean what and you're just saying I think we're both on the same page here in that I think we both agree that you should absolutely be able to have a conversation about this the question is should a man be able to decide what a woman can and can't do with their body and should we be able to make the laws so you just smuggled in the term with her buddy well it is a baby if it's a blastocyst and it is in our body right she's implying that in her bone in her body right so that is a decision that we're talking about that so when it gets to be an embryo or a fetus along the way somewhere along the way it ceases to be just a body but an unrelated male human being when should that person be able to make a decision and should a male human being be able to make a decision at all because if you can make a decision about the embryo or a fetus can you make it about the blastocyst like when can you decide and why should a man be able to make that decision in the first place because he's got because he's got a brain as well and we're only what no no no you talked about enrolling someone's body you are talking about controlling a body no which a woman with another its own outside of her you tell her she can't take care of that blastocyst and remove it she must make it viable and bring it to birth which wasn't about when Masai bian comes into existence that's a philosophical and ethical question no it's not if you're going graining it as being if you're telling a woman's body no no because we're talking about the rights giving someone a right or stopping them and controlling them yeah if you're talking about a blastocyst inside a woman's body yeah and you're a man you decide you don't even know this woman you decide by your moral argument in judgment she should not be able to terminate that blastocyst then you are deciding what she can do with her body no you're deciding what she can do to the blastocyst it's in her body gets inside her body sure it's also inside her body when it's nine months old so you're serious saying am an unrelated man should be able to have input on whether a woman should know terminate a Blastoise no I'm saying I'm saying that the democratic institutions of the state should be able to decide that I'm not talking about democratic institutions we were talking very specifically about a man there's no manual the aside life it's a dictatorship then I don't agree with that I mean I do believe her people should be able to I think this is something that people ought to be able to vote on yes I personally again favor abortion rights but I don't think that I don't think that the gender of the person who is voted into power by the voting public is relevant in terms of whether or not the voting public thinks that embryos are human beings but you don't think that I don't think I don't think that embryos have a right to life but I don't I don't think that it makes sense to say that an embryo is just the woman's body we're not talking about an embryo we're talking about the entire process right the entire process of conception to birth and it's somewhere along the way what are you arguing you arguing that if there are if there are males in positions of power in Congress that they should have to abstain from ruling I'm sorry the male justices on the Supreme Court have to abstain from voting on abortion cases I'm arguing that it's problematic when a man decides who cannot get pregnant decides when a book a baby is actually a baby so should amend only allowed to vote sir I'm not saying that I'm saying candidates that are antiabortion don't you think it's problematic that a guy should decide whether it likes a four you're a hardcore well I've already said it looks bad why not just a leg-up thinks his luck looks ma'am but what a problematic man other than looks well it's not it's it's a huge issue it's not looks it's a huge issue that's someone who cannot get pregnant decides that another human being that they're totally unrelated to can't make the decision that five cells that are bundled together must be brought to life they think that those five cells are a person well they don't even know this I mean you're just a lot of cells they don't really know whole person they don't notice for why should they have any power over this person and when they have any powers are they determining when are they controlling a person's body and when are they saving a baby well that's precisely the question isn't right this is the question should they should a male have the right to determine whether or not a woman can murder her newborn baby it's a good question I say no at least you're consistent yeah I don't think one of your baby a one-year-old I don't think anybody should be able to murder a baby I don't think a man should have the right I think we society as a society no no no you were just I thought you were just saying that you you think that a man should not be able to prevent a mother from killing her baby no that's like that wrong what I mean is no because that is what you're saying with regard to the to abortion you're saying that a man shouldn't have a should not have the right to prevent a woman from killing her baby very odd in the eyes when we interrupt each other it's not going to work okay I I know what you're saying and I know that you're saying that we should all have a stake in this we should all be able to discuss this I just think that when you talk about especially like a blastocyst eventually becoming an embryo we have to agree in some way shape or form that you and I don't have a stake in it we're not going to get pregnant no it's a way it's a way bigger issue for a woman that it is for Matt yes so we agree we agree that it's a way bigger issue for a woman and also Iran they should be able to discuss I just think we both agree that you should be able to scout yeah I mean my ideal that there are things for me to do it to be where I'm coming from here is that I feel like we use identity politics to deprive other people of standing to discuss questions that are actually universal because they're moral questions right I think we all have so I one thing that I try to do as much as possible is understand where people who I disagree with are coming from and I know you do that as well so I am Pro abortion rights but in order for me to understand where people who detest abortion are coming from it's necessary for me to make the sort of leap of empathy and logic into their camp and see things from the way that they see them which is that the instant an egg is fertilized for them that becomes a sacred sacred question of a new life where it's no longer about the woman's body it's now a moral and ethical question that we're all involved in because we're all involved in what our culture is allowed to do and who it's allowed to kill and how it's allowed to kill them so it becomes a bit more like a death penalty question where you might say well I'm never going to be up for the death penalty because I'm never going to do anything that would require that would put me on death row so what standing do I have to be in favor or against the death penalty that's sort of a moot question like we're all in this society together we all have to figure out what's right and wrong and if we've got a brain we should have conversations about what's good or bad and the fact that I'm unlikely to be in a specific scenario doesn't actually really give me less standing to have a conversation about it or even to write laws about it if people vote me into a position where I can laws about it well I certainly think it does when you're talking about a blastocyst I certainly think it does when you talk about the argument of conception and when something becomes alive so let me ask you this when do you think abortion should be legal do you think it should be legal up to nine months or these things should be cut off period I think it should basically be legal all the way up to nine months not probably agree with Peter Singer that maybe maybe it's occasionally okay to kill Bob is so you said Wow so you think that a viable baby inside a woman's body at nine months old she's fully pregnant as long as that baby doesn't come out she should be able to kill it well I'm saying even if it does come out maybe this is because I'm evil that's annoyed achilles no I think that murder a baby well religious people think that you know not to be late anklet blastocysts not talking about religious people I'm talking about you yeah I don't I think it's obvious that the process of going from an egg into a Joe Rogan's is such a long and incremental passage that I don't see any reason why 20 weeks or 22 weeks or even vaginal birth is like the absolute moral cut off I would like what you think though that that's weird that you have this like really rigid opinion on it I don't have a rigid opinion would you have sex you could kill a baby you don't think that's rigid no because I'm absolutely open to being convinced out of that it's just I happen to have read a book by Peter Singer about that and so he's sort of convinced me I mean what you would have believed that you should be able to kill a baby when it's born well that there would be systems in place that would like that would help mothers I don't think that it should be I sort of agree with Bill Clinton's old framing that abortion should be safe legal and rare right that you should have as many opportunities for people not to get pregnant in the first place widespread concept contraception widespread sex education and that this should not just be a form of birth control right on the other hand if people find themselves in a horrible pickle and they don't know how to get out of it these things really hit the baby with a rock yesterday like years ago didn't Lee yeah I don't know Joe it sounds pretty horrible doesn't it it does but again you can't get pregnant and I can't get pregnant so that out people are getting all my kids on your rails they're getting furious at us right now for even discussing it because literally we can't get pregnant they're wrong they're wrong but you're right no I'm right that I should be able to talk about it but I don't know what the answer is you definitely should be able to talk about it but should be able to kill a baby with a rock we have probably nah probably I talk about that I'll never be on death row maybe that's how I get on death row Oh killing my children it's so evil and unsympathetic and unimpacted getting a blastocyst is the same German it is but you don't see that little fucker know the last assistant so long you would have to have like reading glasses on then you look at it at the head of those long as you put a comforter over the baby so you can't see what's happening I think what we're talking about is a really complicated subject and I think it's one of the reasons why people like to box it and put it into this yes or no black or white because it's so complicated you really sit back and think that hey if you have an abortion at you know four weeks five weeks six when does it have fingers yeah when does it have a heartbeat when is it okay and it's also incredibly fraught with tripwires right I mean people are not going to be happy with me laying there circles that you should be able to kill a baby and people are not going to be happy with you saying you should be able to kill a blastocyst I think more people will hate my position if it even is a position so well when does a blastocyst at the moment of conception like how much time do you have it's almost like a race to kill the baby we need what some people don't there so you should even be able to use contraception well that's right and also like this is one of those things where a bit like pedophilia it's it's a subject where it's not really possible like it's so it raises passions so immediately look at what happened to my low innopolis when he was talking about his pedophilia stuff right well he was also talked about his own personal experiences and framing them in a positive way yeah and even saying that he was a sexual predator that's been on my podcast yes when he got on the other podcast when he was on the drunken peasants podcast that's where it got more weird yeah because then he started framing it in a different way and saying that he thinks that there's a lot of positive benefits to a young man like a I shouldn't say young man a boy having a relationship with a man sexually that can help them and that there's positive benefits to being molested as a young boy I think that's obviously a horrible thing to say I think what was going on was he was trying to rationalize his own sexual abuse hmm I really do hmm I mean I think in no way shape or form is it comfortable for a young boy to be sexually abused by an older man and I think that in this process of rationalization he's created this way that's empowered him and he's also rationalized that he was the predator me keep saying that and joking around about it maybe wink that a nose yeah I think he's a victim I think his his he's a very strong smart guy and I think a lot of his intelligence has allowed him to use his perception of that event to sort of shape it into a way that benefits him yeah right right I mean the I was on a TV show in Australia where there was a question of whether or not we should be naming and shaming sexual offenders sexual predators or people who've been convicted of sex crimes and in the meeting before we went on air because it's a live show I raised the point that like I think the more sort of interesting and controversial angle here is what a bloody horrible nightmare it would be to be born being sexually attracted towards infants bro right now this is in no way to diminish the monstrosity that is pedophilia I think it's the worst thing that you can do to abuse the trust of children who are too young to know any better but it's surely no walk in the park like the reason I'm not a pedophile is not because I'm a good person it's because I have no attraction towards children right right imagine if the only way that you could express yourself sexually and find fulfillment in life was by torturing another human being like you're basically a form of I don't use the wrong word here but a form of it's a form of psychopathy in some way in the sense that like a psychopath can only get fulfilment by doing something that's awful so the job is to try to figure out how to stop the psychopath from doing something awful I'm not saying that pedophiles are psychopaths but you can see the analogy where if your only way of finding fulfillment in life is to rape children then let's address how to figure out how to stop you from doing that thing rather than demonizing you as a monster even if you don't do it you had some really very say that like a lot of people are going to push back on that as well and it's a very similar thing to where I'm just trying to figure out in my head what makes the most sense to me and as you say it's got to be some kind of a spectrum of like it can't be black and white either on abortion or on something like pedophilia but the moment you start having conversations like this shit's going to explode yes people are very very very strident like you got to protect the babies like you know we're gonna make the children yes I understand that but does that make it impossible for us to have conversations about right that's the issue is that should you even be allowed to have a conversation about it and should you have a rigid black or white view of this yeah and if you were and well here's the real question first of all we don't know what causes someone to be sexually attracted to children and we don't know how many of those people but there's a significant amount who are actually molested themselves yep I mean that's a huge factor yeah in in child abuse so what what causes that I mean is it and they here's how to you're even more fucked up throughout history some of the greatest minds have been pedophiles really sure Socrates Plato I mean you go back through history they were all fucking young kids well yeah the Greeks would like that one although that was online Romans many many ancient cultures that was I think that was adolescence right they were fucking order funding twelve-year-old yeah like would Nehemiah innopolis was talking about yeah yeah Elia and were you're talking about babies which i think is probably even more rare yeah someone fucking young boys yeah but it's it's a very bizarre part of our human history yeah very bizarre and it makes you wonder how much of that sexual abuse gets somehow another trans furred from a child being abused to that child growing up becoming adult become an abuser themselves what it is it a cancer of ideas is it it is almost like a sexual disease that gets spread from perpetrator to victim the victim becomes perpetrator makes new victims well do you think it's the same act now as it was back then because it's more accepted back then it was more talk back then so I wonder if I wonder if it wouldn't have been less I don't know if maybe it's not less bad I'm trying to think I'm talking now only about people who are sexually mature right so like someone who's like a 15 year old catwalk model let's let's assume that it's a woman who's walking down the the catwalks of Milan and Paris and has what she thinks is a consensual relationship with a 25 year old fashion designer that's against the law right and it's regarded as being deeply unethical in our current society happened all the time in other societies you know there's no I'm not saying that I think that the law should be changed I don't I think it's good to have have laws against these things and I don't think that it's ethically defensible for people who are so significantly older to assume that a person who is still kind of evolving and still coming of age is capable of giving proper consent well it's illegal of through just three years older nice work is really right well that is weird that's long I think a weak holder yeah exactly they're like seventeen and fifty-one weeks you have a person's 18 in one day it's illegal that's stupid there's a Romeo and Juliet clause that some countries have like I think in the Netherlands it's not against the law to have sex with people even as young as 12 or 13 as long as if you're 14 oh right or like yours like I know it's so but what is the law in there to know if you're 15 in your girlfriend's 14 is that legal I think it's the state-by-state thing isn't it but that's a good question is that what you would never be prosecuted but there have been these weird cases where teenagers have been prosecuted for hype for having like dick pics of not only their their boyfriends or girlfriends of their girlfriends Alessa trends but of themselves and they've been prosecuted for child porn does their a child and they're holding pornography I had over about it yeah that whole bit about this money ridiculous whoo yeah they they arrested her she was sending boys pictures of her pussy they arrested her for child pornography she was 15 years old yeah I mean that's a weird use of the law you know like if she's sending it to other girls and boys their age it's not your baby who are you preparing but throwing her in jail no one but it's a it's an ability but when you give someone a game called arrest people that are doing bad this is here's the law if they don't they don't follow by the bylines you're allowed to lock them in a cage and this is your job you're allowed to do that n I want you to rest a certain amount of people per month otherwise you're fucked yeah I mean that's the issue with quotas and police officers yeah yeah I mean it's almost like I come in who I heard saying this the other day that police used to go out and catch bad guys and like solve crimes but now we've sort of outsourced to police the job of just making everything kind of nice well police are glorified revenue collectors in a lot of ways I mean why they you know giving people tickets for you know certain traffic violations yeah I mean why are they making a plant yeah there's a lot of things that people get arrested for where they're essentially just providing money to the system you know they're not they're not serving or protecting it's funny it's one of the things where when I talk to Americans about the best things about America the number one thing that Americans will always say is freedom that this country represents freedom but the actual daily experience like I've lived in New York and I've lived in Copenhagen and I lived in in Australia and like the daily experience of like I was standing outside my apartment in New York drinking an open beverage just watching the world go by and a couple of cops came over and one of them was like you're what's in the glass what's in the glass and I was like just soda it was vodka soda just soda and his partner had to be like I don't worry about like come on don't make a big deal over it and they walked away but I was like go to a park in Copenhagen everyone's drinking beer so they're not getting harassed by cops isn't that a kind of freedom as well while taking off their shirts and they're playing volleyball plus you're talking about one specific area because if you go to New Orleans people walked on the street drinking all the time yes and it's more free yeah if you're in Vegas people walked on yeah yeah yes yeah I mean is it better to live in Vegas or New Orleans you know some people would say yes and other people would say I don't want that for the children it's bad for the children that I might abort yeah that's right I don't know man I'd and I mean I think it's complex the all these issues are very complex like when when should you just let people run free and ramp it to the point where chaos ensues and here's another problem and I was talking about this with a friend of mine the other day about North Korea um when people have become sort of indoctrinated into a specific style of life and behavior and then all sudden you remove the rain yes like when people who live in Kansas go to Vegas and wait yeah as opposed to someone who grows up in that environment or what you like say we were looking at the North Korea footage yesterday of them goose-stepping down the street and the giant throngs of people who are following the orders and doing the bidding of kim jeong-hoon we're saying like what would happen to those people if you removed this military dictatorship gave them a democratic life would they even be able to appreciate it in an understanding from or are they so institutionalized are they so indoctrinated into this very specific style of living and behavior that they wouldn't be able to adjust and like I talked to Ron Miscavige about that you know who is he got out of Scientology when he was fuckin 76 I mean stop and think about that the guy got in in 1970 got out in 2012 lived the bulk of his life in this really bizarre environment and now also needs this free man I think that's right and this is one of my concerns about about laws that prevent people from doing things but this is why I'm sort of libertarian ish when it comes to you know non-economic cultural issues because I actually think you need to inculcate in people an experience of showing restraint on their part by themselves because if the law is does it for you you you then remove the laws and all of a sudden everyone goes crazy it's a bit you know you can imagine that if all of a sudden Street drinking were permitted in New York that people would be vomiting all over the place and like getting getting drunk because they've been so used to so acclimated to never being allowed to do it that now it's the forbidden 3 just get smashed in the car that's all we can we can do now well you know about Amish pure honest yeah I'm not bring up yeah when they get to do that what was hell's playgrounds of the documentary in it there's a great documentary about it these these people they have this period of time where they're allowed to do whatever the fuck they want basically when they're in their teens yeah they've been let loose from the Amish communities and they were allowed to indulge a go hog-wild they go hog where they go they party fucking hard and then they have to figure out whether or not they want to go back to being Amish hmm and most of them do yeah strange it's interesting that you use the word institutions joke describing like North Korea because I think this is another thing that I'm so grateful about America for and why I'm sort of optimistic that crumpled is not going to destroy this this country that institutions like themselves like such a valley girl thing to say I was going to say institutions like really not out but there are partitions I like star umpire that's great oh my god but but it's but it's true you look at places like Hungary and what we've just seen happen in Turkey and in you know Russia and Venezuela and it's much easier for people there who are corrupt or who would like to to bring people under their spell to do so because there aren't these big robust divided institutions like the press being fiercely independent the new digital system being fiercely independent Congress and the executive hopefully hating each other just enough to keep each other in check keep themselves in check and also just the int the traditions of American life whether there's I think more acceptance of dissent and of weirdness than there are in those other places like Russians are just very not generalized here but allow me to conformist people like they've lived under the Tsar's and fuckin empires for centuries and millennia like they like following strongmen Americans aren't like that right some of them are there is this kind of militaristic jingoistic side to America which is very kind of I salute the flag and like say yes please like you're going to honor the honor the veterans and everything insurance but yeah but you exactly respect the office or like kind of stuff and I think that way tyranny lies the best the best thing as America that America has ever kind of given the world is it's flamboyant boisterous sense of possibility and craziness that expresses itself in Silicon Valley and maybe Peter Thiel who I might not like but at least he's unusual you know in Hollywood you know even in Wall Street there are a whole bunch of there's just an excitement in this place which which seeps out in so many different ways in America that I think to try to corral it as a dictator would be like herding cats like it was never you know it'll never see never quite work well we can only hope because of Trump has his way he would definitely try to do that he would try to get all these people to do his bidding and figure out some way to dismantle all these different institutions and make it much easier for him to make America great again adjust yeah force that agenda through yeah I don't think he would think that he's doing the wrong thing would he I don't know do you think I mean he said he admires Putin I mean which is very bizarre I mean it's very bizarre and when he compared what Putin does to what we do that we do terrible things to like whoa that's great that guy murders people on the street yeah I mean he any political opposition he fucking killed them he kills reporters I mean or somebody does I don't over them ulema D somebody does right outside the Kremlin you know on the main bridge leading to the Kremlin at night and all the security cameras from the Kremlin happen to go off and have their footage missing just when the murder it's amazing the amount of power that he wields is stunning yeah if someone on the left in America said oh who are we to say that Putin is a bad guy think of all the bad things that America's done they would try just demolished right that's the kind of noam chomsky thing to say you're right you know you know America's America's chickens are coming home to roost we did this in Vietnam and now you know we're no better than Putin fuck that I mean it's the right that's supposed to believe in American exceptionalism right it's not Trump isn't that well he's got a very bizarre interest in Russia and that's one of the reasons I think why he was one of releases tax the real real question is how much money does he have invested in Russia hmm like how much how much financial influence do they have on him I wonder if part of it is when he said that he admires someone like Putin if it's just his sort of constitutional sense that he kind of likes a strong man like his even his whole life sort of about I am powerful I am rich you know you're gonna kneel before me and people who can pull that off I think just resonate with him in some way that's more so I've always found like the how much money does they have invested in Russia question somewhat less interesting to me then why does he want to suck Putin's dick so much you know horizon is like a war minister predation a convenient interpretation of what Putin represents because he doesn't really have time to look at all these different things you know it was revealed the other day that he's not really aware that Kim Jong Un's not Kim jong-il you see that it is confusing there are too many kids in the Koreas but you know I don't really that know I was two days ago yeah there's like this ridiculous thing where he's talking about this gentleman he was talking about Kim jong-un and he was referring to conversations that Kim jong-il has had with Bush and I mean the whole thing I think there's too many things to focus on yeah he's so fucking busy with himself yeah his business interests and the things that he's trying to push through and put on Exxon Mobil and all these different subsidiaries and he's kind of invested in he's got his fucking fingers in so many different pies and he's also just not interested in the affairs of state he doesn't care about foreign policy and stuff like it's don't a bit he doesn't like learning stuff he doesn't like he's not a good reader well what's one of the big concerns is that he's not concerned with foreign policy to the point where he's putting off all these things in letting the military do their job yeah in quotes did you see the point that he didn't even authorize the mother of all bombs when it was dropped on Afghanistan last weight and military the option to do what they think is right and that's what Eisenhower warned about yes right but in some crazy way don't you feel more safe with the military doing it than with Trump doing it in some way yes absolutely well I think there's a real argument that the military has been that they've been held back to the Pollack's they have mean look you're engaging in war right and that there's a real argument that the people in the military make that people die because they're forced to take too many steps before they get clearance to do something they're being attacked and so their argument is it's better to let people who really understand war engage in war but then there's the Eisenhower argument that well you're dealing with an institution like the military-industrial complex you're dealing with a think of it as an organism that survives on war it there's a tremendous amount of money that gets pumped into this this thing yeah this war machine yep right and then what does it want to do it wants to fucking you know go to war that's right and have you noticed how the the military contractors if you looked at how how delicately spread out around America they are like they have plants in almost every single state so that there's always a congress person or a senator who the military contractors can call and be like well you're going to lose like so many thousand jobs in this little of course you know shit po tell it it actually be more it would make more economic sense for them to have consolidated their operations and be making all the submarines and warships in the same place but then I they make one widget and Delaware they make another one over here another one over here very so that Congress and you know no one's ever going to want that plant to close it's like modular things that we've talked about today they're super complicated and there's so many different things to consider and there's no real one black-and-white answer when when you're dealing with so many factions and so many variables and so many things that's one of the reasons why being a president is a preposterous idea is it stupid it's ridiculous isn't it if they have too much power I mean you talk about black and white and you like shades of gray how do you negotiate with the North Koreans and the South Koreans and the Chinese and the Japanese and the Russians about what to do about area well sure or Syria yeah I mean in some ways what did you think of the truck of Trump hitting Syria well no one died right what he did was attack Fields yeah they blew up airfields was a show of force you know is it the right thing to do shit I don't I don't know I don't understand exactly what is accomplished other than you blow up an airfield and have to rebuild it I mean you show people that you can do that but we already knew you could do that you show people you're willing to act I mean back in 2012 and 2013 I thought that Obama flubbed it by saying that we wouldn't tolerate the use of chemical weapons and then doing nothing when in reaction by the right and the left yep or very weird a war back absolutely I think they've relaxed a little of that yeah when we're welcome to go in and get a break yeah exactly I'm going back in yeah it's like you know when you go in the pool you swim for a while I come back on again I want to get all again when I was a mess foreign war yeah there was Vietnam and we didn't like that and they forgot about it long enough so we did Iraq and we didn't like that but now that's kind of fading receding into the into the distant past as well but I yeah I I actually interviewed Phil Donahue on HuffPost live because he was a very outspoken anti-war critic and I was saying at the time like can't we be nuanced enough to make a difference but to understand the difference between the Iraq war a full-scale invasion based on a misunderstanding or a misleading interpretation of what Iraq's capabilities in its minutes weapons program was and this Syrian problem which is a horrifying civil war where a dictator is gassing his own people and we you know didn't want to invade but drawing some kind of a line in the sand and saying you can't do that in the 21st century it can't just be dropping gas canisters on kids so they bleed out their eyes and like cough up their own lungs that's not a way to behave in the United States as an exceptional nation we'll do something about that you're right that about it really had his hands tied because he went to Congress and Congress didn't give him the power to do it but I kind of felt somehow sort of slightly vindicated when Trump did it like I was not one of the people on the Left who was like oh my goodness what's he doing I was like okay I mean at least that's a at least it's something I agree but it's also an incredibly complicated situation because Sode is against Isis superficially yes but he uses Isis as an excuse to be able to target all of his political opponents it's too much it's too twisted and there's no way to get rid of Isis without getting rid of Assad because the locals in Syria who are left hate Assad who are anti-assad they hate aside even more than they hate Isis so as long as Assad is there they're going to give Isis their sympathies so this idea of like I mean basically the whole Isis thing I think is just a smoke screen to allow Putin and Assad to crack down on dissidents but isn't it also a lot of the same issues that they faced when they D thrown Qaddafi in Libya you create this what would happen exactly ah now I think it'll be a failed state yeah I think we've missed the it we've missed the boat in Syria what the fuck would we do president Josh Zepps what do we do we built a time machine Jo and we go back to 2012 it's not much you can do I don't know there probably wasn't even much we could do do you think we imagined we usually have like one president that deals with just Syria like that should be your job well yeah that's right the idea of having a president that also deals with ExxonMobil and B and then also was talking to the coal people and also is talking to the people in Silicon Valley that's why you have an administration right I mean so the Secretary of State is broadly overseeing it and then they will have a special envoy to the Middle East who should be it basically is the president of the President of the United States for Syria yeah and then Sean Spicer is in charge of cleaning up lies I mean that's what he's very facts president yeah do you think that that the world would be better or worse off if America had just stayed completely out of the Middle East from like the end of the Cold War on I don't know and I don't know how you fix the problem of military dictatorships how do you how do you stop that how do you overthrow them I mean the CIA has been battling that for years I mean they all propping them up or propping them up or propping them up and shooting them down or you know trying to keep that issue over there and keeping them from becoming big enough where they spread to the point where they become another Nazi Germany or what have you it's a really good question and I'm too fucking stupid to give you an answer yeah me too I mean who knows I mean look it's just disturbing that something like North Korea can exist in 2017 I want to go I really want to go to North Korea it could be fascinating really yeah because it's like the last kind of Hermit Kingdom left it's the last true Soviet era communist dictatorship you can really go alright yeah I think you can I mean but the problem is you have to be kind of um you know accompanied by a chaperone who works for the government who only shows you the things that the government wants you to see Henry Rollins went that's right yeah that's right so gangster he's so good I was in New Zealand actually listening to your Epis to that episode at be at the lounge in Auckland Airport coming back to Australia a couple months ago and Henry was really inspiring to me in that episode because it made me realize like yeah just because I'm getting old and like I'm going to be a dad and everything doesn't mean you have to lose your sense of adventure that dude is badass you know he's got a hundred percent sense of adventure to the point where he won't have a relationship he's like it's not it's not worth it it's just too much work but he's also an interesting case study in giving kids medication a very early age he was one of the very early Prozac kids oh really yeah they rid illan rather yeah they hooked him up they hooked him up with ritalin when he was fucking five years old man from five years old to high school they had a sale about that now terrible I mean he just described it like it's horrible it was white knuckled his way through the day at the end of the day the ritalin would wear off he'd be exhausted hmm and we go through class I mean that's a good chunk of his intense personality behavior has to do with him being raised on speed yeah just crazy funny how it has a different impact on people who have a DJ on people who don't write you know what is a DD you know I mean it's a real thing but look how does it manifest itself in a person and how does it manifest in a person that is four formed in this environment where they're forced to be in as a rigid controlled social experiment called school let's run it why do we have classroom what do we has to be thirty people and they all have to be sitting in a row and they have a blackboard program you two have a regular job that you don't have yeah I don't know he doesn't have there's a lot of people who don't have jobs we in order to work in a fuckin cubicle well that's one thing that I assumed we would have we would have gotten to today which I'm surprised we didn't which is like the rise of automation and robotics and stuff I mean millions how many millions of Americans I think it's the largest the largest employment sector for working-class males is driving yeah it's what self-driving cars are just around the bloody corner what's going to happen to the millions of Americans who make a living driving trucks and others the big solution of that that a lot of people bring up is universal basic income but universal basic income you know there's people that have a problem with that because they believe that people are only motivated by want hmm and then as soon as you give them money then they're not going to just pursue their interests they're going to lay around and do nothing and just live off of that money only well then there's also the question of whether or not that's right or wrong comes back to America's sort of Puritan work work ethic as well right the idea that it would necessarily be wrong for a person not to be doing something productive but like if the robots are doing all the work and they're producing lots of wealth then who cares if someone's doing something productive on up right we're worried that they're going to get mad at the people like you that are out there being ambitious and they got a key Mercedes well maybe I would sometimes not do anything as well I'm Australian what criminals we have a saying that thank God we were convicted by thank God we were settled by convicts instead of by Puritans so well it's a good point I mean we're fighting off the echoes of those fucking ridiculous instincts from the Puritans at Lanza here we're still fighting that off I mean that's a big part of what America is yeah I think that would be a big impediment to universal basic income to set this Puritan sense of justice that there is justice and also I think maybe people just want work they want purpose like the people who were recommended had purpose as well as universal basic income you'd have to sort of program it into the zeitgeist of the culture and give people what voluntary ways of of expressing themselves by bidding that weren't tied to their income yeah encourage people to pursue actual interests like if you gave people universal basic income and encouraged them to pursue artistic venues or vinners maybe you know whether it's a writing or painting or whatever the fuck it is you say like look there's a lot of Merit of that like and you can do this your food is bought you have you have a home you you can eat and you can sleep you have a roof over your head now do what you want what do you want to do I think it'll be a fence it's a fantastic experiment and I'm glad that there are a few little jurisdictions in Scandinavia and Canada which seem to be trying it out because I'm really interested to know how many people I care you could you could imagine different groupings of human psychology like some people will be like awesome I don't have to worry about making money I'm going to become the greatest artisanal you know furniture maker that I can and that's fantastic and then at the other end of the spectrum there'll be people who are like we don't have to work like I'm just going to sit at home that's fine too right is everyone else many times I bet there are crime rates lower because of that I'm sure imagine that's which we should be hoping for and the idea the real good argument for universal basic income is that the money that you spend giving people a certain universal basic income you would save money from people going to jail juvenile detention you know medical issues all sorts of issues that come out of poverty there's a lot of issues that come out of Polly that are directly connected to that yeah this is one of the arguments for welfare as well I mean people who say that it wouldn't have any impact on crime I would just say look at the different countries in the world that have more or less generous welfare systems and the ones with more generous welfare systems do tend to be more peaceful places yeah there might be other reasons as well I think there's I think they're correlated and I think also one of the things that I try to do I really try to support people who make things yeah make things by hand people companies that like make stuff I like when people make stuff I like when when people pursue like like this this tables any line artists you know I like when people make handmade knives I'd like that stuff I think the more a peep I think people get deeps Attis faction in doing things like that yeah you know like Russell buildig I made that clock right there that's a handmade clock that dude built that fuckin selling that one dis TGG Studios have built that right there that's a handmade clock too I try to support that shit as much as possible I think that that is the future find that deceit there's there's when I look at that clock I know a guy made that yeah that means something yeah it's cool cool it is also a really cool looks pretty dope if you ask me to make a clock wouldn't know it's not J well you would figure it out I would if you gave you another diamond hooks and all that stuff but mate you might it might not be a clock for you and I yeah that that Buddha sculpture somebody made that and sent it to me it's great I mean there's a lot of things that people can make that other people would enjoy and I think artisanal goods and services and things that people do that are handcrafted they have a special meaning to them that people they value I wonder it is something that's mass-produced I wonder if enough people can find self-expression through that to counteract the the job losses that are resulting from and will continue to result from technological advance well I think that with universal basic income yes possible but I don't think making things is not necessarily the only way to do it I mean it's it is making art being creative encouraging people to think of that as an actual way to live yeah that's a big that's a big impediment and a big hurdle to get over it's like the North Korea thing that you were saying like if you got rid of the North Korean regime would the people who lived under it have the scope have the just a mental scope right to know what to do with themselves in some ways that's a comparable question with capitalism right if you took away the capitalist incentive to work and suddenly all of a sudden everybody was liberated and had a basic income that would that gave them all the sustenance that they need would they have the horizons available to them having been raised in this idea of like you've got to get got to work got a crime your way up the ladder got to get a nine-to-five job go to college get an education you know please the boss get your promotion to have all of that suddenly fall away and be like you know what just go and make clocks that's how you know people would figure it out but other people would be like lottery winners they just go crazy yeah like lottery winners almost universally lose all their money I know and they end up on the happier yeah there are little E's mad at them yes if you just if you win five million dollars in the lottery everybody goes Josh come on this is free for you I can sales bro get me up right then people start look you and I are going to do a business we're going to paint cars he likes talking on a pink cars the next thing you know you're loaning money out and family wants money from you yeah you're just dealing with a lot of bullshit and also you have expectations immediately after winning that things are going to get a lot better yeah and as you know from you know anyone who has paid attention to their the process of their own consciousness whether that's through psychedelics or floatation tanks or you know what Sam Harris and Dan Harris been talking about recently about meditation your your conscious perception of life is not determined by what's going on outside yeah it is trivially occasionally and like into like for in the short term but in the long term your actual happiness it comes from within but people always take the path of least resistance and oftentimes the path of least resistance is these patterns that we've carved into our behavior these behavior patterns that we've carved into our psyche and a lot of times those aren't even the path of least resistance they become the path of more resistance but we're so accustomed to those paths that we think of them and treat them as if they're the right path hmm mind blood fucking man there's no answers there's no answers to abortion there's no answers in North Korea we didn't figure out shit it's not the point Joe tried to figure it out please end this and do yours yeah one point I want to talk to you I'm going to do two like a quick quick round of questions and also Josh extraterrestrials on my podcast with Joe josh motherfuckin zaps ladies and gentlemen thank you sir funny movies are
