four three two one okay so I'm on my way over here and I'm listening to this new radio that podcast and they're talking about this new technology that's available I'm like this is the perfect thing to be listening to right when I'm coming to hang out with Eddie Bravo oh no there's a website called future of fake news.com where they show this new technology on display well you know how Adobe does Photoshop and so they can they can adjust images if they can take 20 to 40 minutes to want to do it with 20 they prefer to do it with 40 40 minutes of recorded audio of you talking then they run it through this machine and they can have you say words you've never said they can have you make sounds that you've never made and those in those those sentences that's so like you can have a sense yeah like you can have a sentence that says like hey Joe you want to get something to eat after the podcast and they can intersect hey Joe I got a bunch of transgender hookers and some heroin you want to get something to eat and go hang out with them after the podcast and it would sound exactly like what you said it'll sound exactly like your own word but I'm sure there's gonna be experts that can analyze it and go this is a this is a fraud for now yeah what they're essentially saying is this is the infancy of it have to get like experts to analyze the audio you can see it right there they synthesized Barack Obama's audio and they have him say things they'd never said they they have him in George Bush going back and forth telling jokes to each other that they never told dude I can we hear this yeah yeah yes you know can we think you're talking about yeah okay see if you can find that it might be on their website it doesn't sound good when they're doing that but it's in its infancy but it sounds like them talking yeah it just it sounds a little edited yeah you know it's not flowing together right but apparently they're able to break down faces to the point where say they were saying that like if Jennifer Aniston goes to China and she does a commercial for something what they can do is have Jennifer answers and talk for a period of time and they figure out how her her voice moves and they take all these images of her face and they can manipulate it so accurately they can have someone speak in man in Chinese where all the different you know different sounds they make and they could sync up her lips and her movement and the movement of her face to what it would look like if she was making those actual sounds which is just amazing so then they can have a voice like a Mandarin speaking woman who could speak in Chinese and you would see the exact correct movements from Jennifer Aniston's mouth so wouldn't like you know you watch like a that matter was made though right but yeah let's here just let's hear it because our parties have moved further and further apart and it's harder and harder to find common ground so you know when I said in 2004 that there were no red states and blue states for the United States of America that was wrong so you could tell by the lips in that one yeah have you looked at his lips it looked funk not that good but but that's just now like what's it gonna be like in a year what's it gonna be like in five years and this is this is what they're saying is that what we're looking at now is the future of fake news they're going to be able to recreate people saying things that they never said and it's going to be impossible for you to tell the difference so how can that be used for the Illuminati they use it for anybody that's the problem anybody is a good innit VC oh now we can do this I don't know it's hard it's hard to say what would be good because you never know what the end result of anything is gonna be when someone creates some sort of amount mind-bending world-changing technology like that it only could be for bad because it's a lie it's basically gonna be alive yeah whatever comes out of their mouth it's gonna be a lie so there's no way that could be good yeah but see what it is is the consequences of technologists pushing boundaries so the problem is it's not their intention is not initially to do something bad that's one of the interesting things about the Radio Times probably hold on because the radio lab podcast talked to the technologists and they confronted her with it and it's very uncomfortable to watch this lady be confronted with the idea like what if this is used for evil like whatever it's used for fake news and you can tell that they don't they're not even thinking about that hardly all they're trying to do is figure out how to do something that nobody can do like when someone comes up with a technology if you can come up with some sort of a voice manipulating technology like that or a visual manipulating technology you're gonna realize there's a bunch of other people that are probably closing in on something like that too and it becomes this mad race to get something done and to make a shit ton of money if you have something like that that could be potentially worth who knows ungodly sums of money I'm just trying to figure out a way you could use that for good to come far away the one thing that they were saying is you could take recordings of Einstein there's hours and hours and hours and hours of recordings of Einstein you could create a visual Einstein and you could have a 3d technology perhaps or virtual reality technology where you're hanging out having a fucking conversation with Einstein what and now step one right step two is some sort of a neural interface with virtual reality where instead of just looking at it through goggles it's it's going into your mind in some sort of a way it's interfacing with the very neurons and the very your visual cortex it's it's showing you images that you you know you wouldn't really be seen for sure it would be great for brainwashing or oh yeah oh for sure that's a no-brainer that's for sure go mr. brainwash but say like fake news like just like you says the thing is no one gets out alive with this shit so this is the thing just don't the one thing that might be fascinating about it is there's gonna be no control like everyone's going to be able to eventually use something like this and they said that it would tip require like painstaking step-by-step a person going over the data to see if they could figure out what was manipulated and they think they could find like 75% of the ones that have been manipulated right now we find the fake ones but the problem is like the amount of time that it takes to do that is astounding crazy it's an its people-to-people time like you have you have to be sitting there like going over it looking at what is this check that out go back what's this number right here why is this off what's going on here okay mark that move on and they have to like do this over and over and over again their looks or anomalies look for some sort of de evidence that it's been manipulated by a digital source or by some sort of a digital control and or a computer or something like that I think it'll be easy to tell in the beginning maybe but I mean how good our photo shops like the photo shop Steve how good are some of his photo shops and this dude is just having fun well how about that photo shop of I think it's Neil Armstrong where he's standing on the moon and it's like there's a shot there's a shot of him looking down it's like a selfie and then there's the earth in the background and they prove that's a photo a Photoshop already I mean they could just run it through shit just basic shit you could see that it was cut in well there was definitely some manipulation of photos for press use it's not just that was not just speculation 69 well they did it before that even they did it with the Gemini space program when we did defending that picture know what's cool that's real nobody defends that picture well I don't know if they do or don't but the craziest one is Michael Collins because Michael Collins you can prove it the Gemini 15 picture they took a test photo of him like in you know some sort of a warehouse where they would strap him up with a harness and they're showing him how to utilize this equipment and then they blacked all that shit out and reversed the image and try to pretend he was doing a spacewalk you never see and maybe maybe I mean I've seen so much on the moon this one's the best one isn't it's not even the moon it's it's just Michael Collins but you should see because it's like wait a minute why the fuck would they do that like see the disc on photo this is a hundred percent this is not speculation they took a photo of him at a test facility okay well they would you know prepare themselves for walking on the moon the one on the left is them preparing see you Telly's in a harness there's there's a bunch of equipment around and he's hanging onto this thing and they're pulling them like with this harness that he's attached to and then the next one it says it's a spacewalk it's the same exact image they just blacked it out they just took all the stuff that was in the background all the equipment and all the bullshit that's kind of a blurry copy see they find a better copy of it but what they did was they made a fake photo of a guy in space that photos not real that's a photo of him in the test suit and they just reversed it and blacked out the background they could get away with stuff like that back then man it wasn't that's a better picture of it there you got to get a a good representation it's just what what they did was they call that what they did was unquestionably deceptive so the question is how much of that do they do oh come on well that's the question the question is it's even this hard the most hardcore skeptics now even the most hardcore skeptics are like yeah I'm on the fence about that moon thing you know no one's really no one's really saying yes we went to the moon now even like Mick Wes will shut up about that you know there's Nicky will I don't think you're right at all I think he would definitely argue that we went to the moon well he's getting paid for that so the man has got to I mean the dude the dude backs up every official story yeah but people do that not necessarily because they're getting paid they do it because that's the mindset they're in they're in this mindset like we were talking about with someone else before the park side he makes money on his website sometimes very little money to be made of well bunking things well it's not the motivation for doing it when you're a multi-millionaire from video games I mean he made a shit tonne of money from from selling video games he was like some sort of a programmer in video games and then he has a good time debunking things but he has an official story mentality is what I would call it where no matter what like there's people that are objective and these people that are deep bunkers and he's a deep bunker and it doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong about a lot of stuff but it does mean that he goes into things with the intention to debunk and the intention to almost always gravitate towards an official tourist yeah every single to Harvey Oswald acted alone yeah that's a goof come on man that one's goofy he believes Tower 7 collapsed at freefall speed because the fires there's a lot of people who believe that unfortunately I'm not a fucking engineer I would like to know know whether or not it's possible to burn a building so bad inside that it does collapse like that it's impossible I don't know if that's true it's no it's it all you have to do is talk to engineers and architects I've talked to them you could you cried that's there's no there's no architects that outside of NIST a government agency there's no architects fighting for to debunk the tower 7 there's none and every account that's true it's you I don't know if you know that there's like but are these there's got to be some architects and engineers that don't think that that building fell because it was demolished look no well if you understand how its there's about a hundred thousand architects and engineers and the associations like the American Association of Architects in here there's about a hundred thousand and Richard gage he's one of them and he didn't know anything about he thought it was a it wasn't an inside job it took him years and then he didn't really know about our seven most of them don't know about power seven what he does now he discovered it and what he does now is just go from convention to convention sitting fifteen architects down at a time and boom about 99% of them they all believe it though they didn't even know there was a third tower it was not in the media that much they basically think that's crazy I think by this time everybody knows about tower selling they still don't know most people think no they don't you don't they don't I don't latter on on the mainstream media people have talked about it enough online to the point more than ever but now more than ever yes they go to hear about that tower seven thing but they don't really know the details they just kind of just know about it you know did you ever see the video that shows the full collapse which takes a lot longer you see the it first collapse it was the top of the thing falls into the center and that's the elevations yeah they explain architects and engineers i've sat with them I'm no structural engineer but you tell the comments and say this is what if someone told you if someone told you there's 85 columns that hold up tower seven mm-hmm and if someone told you of a structural engineer told you would you think he was crazy or would you believe him if he said and it makes sense I mean it's common sense the only way you're gonna get a building to come down like that any building any structure is you have to blow up all 80 comps at the same time otherwise it won't go down like that to me that's common sense to someone who believes this the government agencies said no that's not true one column went and then it spiraled out of control because of fires when you talk to structural engineers I've had Richard gage on my podcast twice every time it comes back he gets more he just piles on more because all I gotta do is sit him down they don't know nobody knows that's the truth see as he ever debated someone who's like an opposing viewpoint the Bader structure I know nobody's back this is what people would those know because when they look into it it's common sense anybody knows you so you think that they know that it's not true they think they think that power tower 7 was an inside job and they don't want to debate it because they can't win do you really think they think then I say that again so you think the people that are debunking it so like if he's got this opinion there's no our architects and engineers debunking it that's already looked into that that's already been late that's already been young inside that's gotta be a Texan engineers just disagree mm-hmm come on man you don't think there's any people find a video of a real government agency Jamie see if you can but doesn't that make sense what's of a an engineer told you a struck a do to build skyscrapers told you to your face like I've been told to my face they said the only way that thing and you see it on video engineer after engineer after engineer are they all crazy the engineer engineer after engineer ago it's impossible when you look into it it's impossible for a building to collapse like that unless all 80 columns are blown up at the same time we've covered this but here's the famous I don't know anything about engineering I don't know if you have diesel fires that get out of control if it weakens the entire structure where it just collapses like that if you have you have guests all the time there are experts in fields that you're not experts in but when you sit here you find out sometimes they're wrong yes unfortunately ramble about some stuff and then they find out that they're making some of it up or this no but this but an engineer a guy who builds understand this is right doesn't it make sense that make sound Google like try to figure out like who resists architects and engineers like what is it I'm reading right now an article from The Boston Globe that talks about truthers in 9/11 and Richard gages talked about I think they in they might have interviewed I'm trying to figure out what this is what they're talking about there's got to be some engineers that have had a conversation or a debate doesn't possibly have fall in any other way okay maybe they're out there there's the thing I don't know shit I look I don't know how my fucking computer works I don't know how do you know anything that constructs how do you know anything you know a lot of shit you know a lot of shit but if somebody wanted to argue with me about the components and how they worked on a laptop I would have to let go I you're probably right I have to talk to some computer engineer who's gonna tell me the actual reality of it I've talked about it wanna build buildings I've had a mom I'm sure but I just can't believe all the people that build buildings think it's an inside job so okay what if we percent okay would have not be slightly impressive if 90 percent that was really impressive it was a that would be impressive exactly it's 50 percent would be impressed it's about in the 90s I don't know if that's right so I don't know where you get in that number I'm getting it from Richard gage who's the head of architects and engineers but he might be a little biased right I mean if he's the head of architects and engineers from 9/11 truth and he tells you that 90% of the architects and engineers out there think it's an inside job it might be a little biased I don't know if that's true and I don't think you do necessarily either I think we're just guessing I believe it I would love to see I would love to see an architect or an engineer that disagreed with him talk to him about it and go over the data because until that happens I don't know what the fuck they're talking about no nobody argues with him nobody does that's gotta be there's got to be someone who debunks that guy everybody debunks everybody no they definitely a smear campaign are you kidding their campaign or is it just that they're saying things that he's saying that aren't correct it's not just him he's just saying he's one of the many it's common sense Dave maybe okay it's just like right but I don't know I don't know anything about making buildings I don't know anything about what it takes for a building to collapse I don't know totally I don't know either maybe it got hot but it's not just hot it's easily shanks of gods that were in the basement I want to believe that I want to believe that fires may hot I don't want to believe they blew it up because that's fucking that's scary I wonder want to believe the fire if a fire is in a basement and the fire has diesel fuel and it's burning at some insane temperature and this fucking shit loads of diesel fuel down there I wonder what effect that has I don't know do you I'm pretty sure based on my life's experience that that's not gonna bring down a building on fuel life it's based on common sense it's common sense that yeah if a building if a building's gonna fall at free spot fall speed boom like that if a engineer after engineer after engineer at some point I'm gonna believe them at at some point I'm not gonna well I understand Eddie but I don't I don't know if you've necessarily looked into the engineers at disagree I know I know there's a smear campaign there okay but have you looked into the engineers there's none there's not there's not there's no documentary it's kind if there's no documentary find a documentary if they have to know documentary for it to make sense what was that what if it's an article what if it's a peer-reviewed paper or what if it's some sort of those are all dude that's a smear camp there's that side there's the elites that don't want this out and then there's people trying to get the truth out so the elite have the control of the media so how are you gonna they have paid shills on you don't think you think that they drop they would have dropped the ball big time like earnest Byner in 1987 for the brows it would have dropped the ball if you're not if you don't have paid shills online strategically pushing the agenda come on there's a bunch of fake shit on him what Jamie Richard gage thing that I was trying to debunk see if anybody's debunking him I'm looking at I'm looking around I'm just looking around the Boston Globe article says that there's a small vocal subset of people of Engineers that are with this Richard gage that's what I had read I never read that it was like some overwhelming number just keep keep stirring it's it's hard because it's fun it's exciting it's exciting to think that there's some sort of a gigantic ball of super geniuses the world and they decided to blow up tower seven you know what's funny about the moon fuck powder selling Jesus you know what's crazy about the moon is the hardest shit ever accomplished the greatest by the human race the greatest accomplishment ever was landed on the moon right right so you would think holy shitballs I don't think it does know what listen okay okay but let's just at the time at the time the Internet is the biggest okay okay but I'm just talking about like a physical achievement three dudes they got shot up in a rocket they were in a like a orbiter and then the orbiter shot out the lunar like the LEM and then it lands they played golf went doom bug riding the donuts in the sand they get take pictures they get back in take-off dock with that orbiter and then fly back that's the hardest shit ever no one died can you imagine can you imagine that second mission six months later they did it again when when they had to break the news that that they were going to use different astronauts because every mission they use different astronauts what didn't you think they would like a show like I have the same star over and over know the three dudes who pulled it off keep doing it they do know you kidding they did it before yeah but they don't want to keep doing it what if they were planning on using Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong but they just fucking got Itoh some shit they start going to clubs and like a flake like you know shake the contract because I probably went to the moon for like you know seventy thousand dollars they've got that government check they go get you you won the second album or on the second it's just like the record business you know what I mean we make that much tape of course you say listen we'll get you on that second on the second and third landings back do you know much money you're gonna make you're gonna come back you're gonna be famous you're gonna be fucking doing all sorts of press think about the bitches think about the coke they probably got blowed out and got too cocky I wanted to renegotiate oh my god and then NASA said we just got to go with some new dudes they made $8 per diem when Uncle Sam fucks you raw dog he uses sand Uncle Sam uses broken glass on his dick come on that dude in the middle the dude in the middle in the middle didn't actually was hovering in an orbiter he was hovering in orbiter and they landed some little piece-of-shit lunar lander wouldn't delay and then they took and they show the only time ever they got one shot of it taking off and whatever was filming it followed it all the way up yeah who was no there was a live remote control that's it they said that they can control from Earth from Houston for sure that works the moon landings are so goddamn ridiculous oh fuck there's video of them like just maybe a hundred thousand feet in the air and they're like filming it making it look you know they're manipulating what the fuck come on that video stream that's the damming I've never seen anybody and explain that what they were doing well the video says that they're saying there are 30,000 miles out that's what they're saying something like that way to the moon then we have 125,000 miles away from Earth yeah halfway to make it look like they were far away so you know if they look out their window that little circle you're there whatever shape may be was a rectangle whatever the window it the entire Earth fills up all the glass of course cuz you're like still well it's you got to remember they blocked out all the other windows that wasn't damning about it what's damning about it is that they've got this camera setup where they're filming the blackness of the interior of the cabin and the sir killer window and the circular window supposed to represent earth this little slice of Earth with clouds on and shit and the blind they've got a stencil trying to create that I don't know if that's real see I've looked at that a hundred times it might have just looks like yeah looks like what I think more than anything more more likely it was just like yeah that's fake and now that is real but watch this is what you can see you can see oh this is just you gotta you got to go to the one where it shows the actual fake footage this is the actual video this is not gonna show the full thing where they pull away and you see the guys manipulating the dampers and pulling the things off the walls reveals that's it reveals that they're in low Earth orbit that they're not really just looking at Hawaii it's like they're they got a little hole and they're focusing on a little island google bart sibrel is I had a I had dinner with this gentleman back in the day he's very nice guy and he's a guy that wrote a funny thing happened on the way to the moon and he's absolutely convinced that they never went to the moon he was a it's not a dumb guy I had an interesting conversation with him he's fully on board and absolutely committed and not that they couldn't do it or that they they couldn't get the footage of it but that they faked the whole thing like they never even did every want to went out there some people think that they couldn't film it they went there but they couldn't film it so these is fake film that's but that there was other ways to track whether or not they went there there's some people that believe that and then other people believe no no it's all fake it's all fake from the jump they shot him in the low Earth orbit they float around in low Earth orbit and then drop back down I believe that I believe it was it's just a scam they're just making money and they're and they're showing you that was the distraction for the Viet from the Vietnam War all six missions during Richard Nixon administration they did one every six months with different astronauts no one got hurt no one died are you kidding me well did you ever see the video footage from the first man in space the video footage of the first man in space is so entirely fake it's fucking hilarious when Russia no the guy from Russia the Russian guy he did go in space but they didn't have a fucking camera crew inside the capsule with him there's like opposing lights and different like you could see like if there's a distance between the guy but it's just all fake it's always been ganda put up google fake video footage of first man in orbit what is it was the russian cat's name the first dude that went into orbit but they have a video footage of him inside oh let's go Oleg are sooo the love with Oleg Taktarov is like one of the first leglock guys ever right yeah you had a watcher shit with him who would Samba the shit out of your legs remember there was like a few leg locks back in the day just a few yep you know you know the craziest thing I found out I thought heel hooks for sure we're legal and Sambo and apparently they're not even legal in Samba oh they just do straight ankle locks and knee bars and it was cuz of the shoe and calf cranks they all wear shoes no heel hooks in Samba that's crazy what do you think about shoes she be allowed to wear shoes we're either in fighting or in grappling no no yeah I agree I don't think gloves - but then I'm broken record with that do you find it video of the just front fake kind face you wanna watch shoes fuck it yeah problem is MMA like to kick you and that goes in your eye yeah what is this no no no no this is the moon landing so Soviet moon landing now first man in orbit it's inside the cockpit it's like taking a NASA faking earth now just put NASA faking earth well what was the guy's name who's the first first man in orbit what's near Gagarin okay so go Yuri Gagarin video you could see the video so he climbs of this thing takes off and then like see if you can find the the first person like ya starin Adam there's a bunch of it where it's like so clearly not really happening it's all fake man they're all faking it Russians are faking it they're all they're all doing it together work there's no real Cold War but there was a some sort of a video on the analysis of that saying that there's light sources in there there wouldn't be a light source inside that cabin that you'd be able to film with and how far away with the camera have to be to capture this that they had these big-ass clunky cameras there wasn't that kind of space think about think about TV and the movies when they were born were they ever about like what's really going on you know I Dream of Jeannie was right away it's right away it's total bullshit right away from day one it's never there was never a show about what life really is it was always bullshit right from the start right from the get-go propaganda they didn't create TV for entertainment you kidding me it's not like one super genius wants to create something called TV and then they use that TV to manipulate the world what happens is one super genius figures out to take a visual image and project it into millions of different televisions at the same time whose paint a second because he's a technologist so he figures out how to do it they start broadcasting things through this and then the powers that be realized what kind of manipulation you could get out of something like that where you could show the news every night and presidential addresses and then they started using it for their own good but it wasn't created to control people's brains it was created because people have this inherent desire to constantly innovate and make better and better shit we don't even know why we do it but we're fucking obsessed with it so these technologists that create it they're they're so far smarter than any of the people that use it and manipulate people the people that create it the ones that actually understand how to make a digital signal with your phone stream live in a periscope and a guy who is in New Zealand can look at it in real time while you're talking about something would it be a good idea for the Illuminati to seek people like that out in hire arm wouldn't that be a good move it's definitely a good hell yeah you go after those dudes boy oh man I think lack Mayim I am you got him companies work directly with military and they get military contracts to make all kinds of shit they always have whether it's computer stuff whether it's surveillance equipment I mean there's lucrative contracts like that was the big thing about the Iraq war right like everybody was terrified the fact that you had this guy who was a CEO of Halliburton which is a company that cleans up after we blow shit up and that guy becomes the vice president and then they start getting these giant no-bid contracts to clean shit up after we blow it up like the money involved in something like that is insane right you're talking just hundreds of millions of dollars just flowing like water right it's just constantly flowing so if you think about that you think about that that's that's going to be the case with everything if they have the kind of money to throw that way towards the Afghan war what kind of black ops money do they have to make those jets unlimited those those crazy fucking stealth Chileans much trillions are constantly missing in the Pentagon at back and right before 9/11 was 2.3 trillion missing from the penalty literally I thought about days before but yeah the day before Donald Rumsfeld everyone knows about that but Oh 17 trillion are missing here's the thing - 2.3 trillion was bad where's all this money going exactly so trillions trillions yeah missing this is but what you're saying is not crazy like people who listen to this there's a lot of people that are listen to this that have never heard this before and they think well this is crazy these guys are just making shit up this is some loony fucking left-wing conspiracy theory yeah you guys think that the government was in on this and it was all a scam to hide the fact that they had stolen trillions of dollars but they really did have a press conference and it's really available online and Donald Rumsfeld really does look straight at the camera and he really does say they're missing trillions of dollars two point three trillion trillion trillion and then the next thousand and then the next day 9/11 hits a plane or a bomb blows up a small little section of the Pentagon where all the people that are auditing the Pentagon the counting office blows up and everyone that's a coincidence bro it's a total complete coincidence really happen listen to me man no one would ever kill someone for as little as two point three trillion dollars that's not enough money get people to kill people it's just not people need more money to kill people people kill people for like 50 except somebody gave a really shitty guy he would kill somebody for like a thousand dollars shit is so corrupt and has always been listened to Donald run so I'll talk about this how dare you talk her over guy see if you can find the actual video of him talking cuz it's pretty fascinating it's just a couple minutes Donald Rumsfeld yeah that's a good lot of money Donald where's that go to them where to go son yeah this is that's not the full video of him actually saying it they say not but 9/11 Donald Rumsfeld trillion guarantee debunked and no one ever talked about it again right that was great second one boom what's crazy is it really didn't get brought up after that let's let's do it Rianne trends same time son two point three trillion 2001 10th of September ends according to some estimates we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions two point three trillion with a T the very next day accounting offices were destroyed in the Pentagon to ten point three trillion never brought up again who's more gangster than that they got bigger dude we just gotta say something because you could take the trillions but we gotta make it we gotta admit it and then everyone's gonna forget about what did people say to that people you know what that's one one one of those ones where what does people what do people say to the idea that the plane would hit the perfect spot to hide the two point three trillions of dollars in debt tip for you for someone to know to admit to themselves they'll say everybody will admit the government is corrupt but when something gets brought up they're always believing the government sign you know what I'm saying yeah but this one doesn't even have a side here's still but you know you just watch that and know there was fishy shit 9/11 I don't trust it and everything every now you got to look at 9/11 if you see that and you don't look at 911 with skeptical eyes there your hypnotized well that alone is one of those Arsenio Hall segments things that make you go hmm come on man it's like who you gonna trust you know you're doing yeah like if you were doing business with this organization and then you saw a speech by the chairman of that organization this and he just said we're missing a fifty five billion dollars would you still want a new business with this guy do this one trillions go missing from the military Pentagon can't account for six point five trillion in taxpayer cash the official story I believe the official story yeah they wouldn't do that they wouldn't do that yeah they're corrupt but they wouldn't do that yeah they're evil yeah but they wouldn't do that it's like it doesn't make any sense be the report look at this they cannot provide adequate documentation for how its spent six point five trillion that is hilarious how do they how do they not all go to jail how do you nobody nobody's going to jail here Illuminati nobody goes to jail your riches fuck I know but this is in the Satanism the people that the people that have the money that our taxes go to like they have it our taxes we spend the money or we buy we get the money we send it to them they have it they can't account for six point five trillion that's so much money that's crazy that's like he's in the national debt like thirteen trillion or something what's the national debt it's higher I might have made that up yeah your trillion what do you think it is we think the national debt is it doesn't even matter dude six trillion dollars and nobody's going to jail what I'm saying is it's half of the I think it might be like half the National ten nobody twenty well nobody in the Illuminati goes to jail so look at that our national debt is twenty point four trillion which we cannot pay but we can't account for six point five trillion why even account for any mortgages at this point just fucking just say shut up fuck it let's just cross our fingers yeah well there was an article that was written about the idea that our country was going to descend slowly and something that's not a democracy anymore and the argument you would make if you don't have to account for trillions of dollars that you make us pay for the argument would be that might have already happened like where if it's all about money in control right what more money are you gonna get than six and a half trillion dollars like if it's really all just about money in control that's a shitload of money and well what's the control will the control is it's rarely discussed like there's all sorts of outrageous like their programs gender people using the women's room you know what you know once you're in the Illuminati you're above the motherfucking law nobody's going to jail they're all fucking doing crazy shit nobody goes to jail nobody in the Pentagon's going to jail are you kidding me no one in the CIA is going to jail but what's crazy is that no one talked here are further mysteries what happened to thousands of documents that should be on file but aren't the IG study found that DFA I don't know what that is did not document or or support why the defense departmental reporting system removed at least sixteen thousand five hundred and thirteen of 1.3 million records during quarter three fiscal year 2015 as a result the data use to prepare the fiscal year 2015 a G F I don't know what that is third quarter in year-end financial statements were unreliable and lacked an adequate audit trail so they just started yanking transactions and deleting oh I believe them Oh what else tell me if they have black ops like what we're talking about before so if they have like area 51 which is like groom lake you know that whole area in Nevada where it's illegal to even get close to where they were supposedly developing stealth bombers and all that shit they did all that stuff out there right yeah how much do they get and how do they how does that money work because that is that where all the money's going is all going to crazy military projects like what is a black op you know I'm saying like if they say black ops right is that why they can not account for that I mean doesn't that make sense if they're spending trillions of dollars making these crazy fucking jets it's missing yeah but but is that what it means I wonder if that's what it means I wonder if it means that this is just shit they get to just do whatever the fuck they want with they build these crazy bases and they do supersonic jets you know can you imagine the people at the top like the islands they haven't shit queue management they got pieces they got pieces of land that we don't know nothing about now what James budget has a like an area for classified program so they spent like 59 billion on classified programs Oh so the six point five trillion is on top of that yeah may be classified programs is one level of top secret and it gets all the way down to where we deconstruct alien spacecrafts that's like that Robert Lazar type shit yes yeah we were 15 years ago I don't know why still fascinated yeah that guy's just a little he's he's still alive yeah dude can you imagine him on this podcast that would be freak had the government think he's really good you know what he's friends with John Lear and that guy says the most crazy Charlie or says the this is his his secrets are that there's people there's millions of people on Venus there's millions of people on Mars there's there's people all over the planet and and they're just not telling us about that but isn't John Lear like do you think that it's possible I'm just gonna throw this out there do you think it's possible that John Lear who's like some suit easily a super billionaire character he was a former CIA CIA pilot he was in the CIA for many years once you're in the CIA always in this his but isn't he like some super wealthy businessman I don't know how I'm thinking about these jets - is it like his father created Lear Jets okay but is he a super wealthy businessman he should be I was thinking if I was one of those guys and I was bored I might just be trolling the fuck out of people tell him about people on Mars that's what he's doing he's doing for fun and they let him in the Illuminati if he does that he's like walk yeah I was already in he's probably like like what you can't to die is things like Bohemian Grove here's what you can't to die like I'm I'm one I'm on The Skeptical side of all conspiracy theories but I know me don't get me wrong out there not I'm not going after anybody I'm not trying to indict anybody I feel like there's just too many people are hypnotized to really stop anything you can't stop these trillions of dollars missing how are you gonna do that who's who's gonna stop that there's like it's it's a man too many people are hypnotized it's just it's it's hopeless sometimes you know okay what I'm saying is that what you keep these things you can't deny and one of the things you can't deny this bohemian growth well he mean Grove is a place where these leaders and these bankers and these elites of the world literally do get together and put on fucking robes and they get in front of a giant stone owl and they have like a ceremony and they burn some sticks they burn an effigy it's like it is the when Alex Jones was the first guy to find that you you can criticize Alex Jones all you want and a lot of its deserved he says a lot of crazy shit and he's a character and he gets big and theatrical and it's fun but he's exposed some very real shit that's undeniable and one of the things that's undeniable is that there really is a place called Bohemian Grove or these guys really do get together and they get together and they put on robes and they worship this Molag the owl god that's what's something that's been going on forever that's where people thought Alex was a shield because he would say all this great 9/11 one stuff a 9/11 stuff and then he would say he would work in dough that the world's run by satanic pedophiles you know so then people go okay is the show he's a show you know it's like saying it's like John Lear type shit that's what it sounds like and that's what it sounded like to a lot of people he's a show he's talking about everyone's satanic and they're all pedophiles he's in crap he's he's retarded he's a joke but what do you know about the Chester Pennington Benton a suicide I know that he had a bunch of interviews we talked about being raped a bunch of times when I was young and how fucked up it was I don't know damn there's I don't want to talk too much about personal life no it's there's no personal life this is all I'm saying was was um anytime a dude kills himself he's got a bunch of kids yeah but when you when you you know smells you know Chris Cornell and him were best friends yeah you know that Chris told himself on Chris's birthday you know what Chris Cornell and his wife they have a foundation called the Chris and Vicky Foundation and it's all about helping children that were molested and abused and a lot of them were like a former pedophile child traffickers traffic e/o however you would say it and he was really really into it and this is this this is the conspiracy theory I don't know this is the conspiracy it's not with him no no man this is this is this is this is why shit is is getting fucked up that has something to do with that there's he was a the conspiracy theory is that he was involved in stopping trying to you know Ashton Kutcher is trying to stop human trafficking and you know how corey feldman he got in an interview he said the biggest problem in Hollywood is pedophilia right and and then there's been several people coming out and the dude from Lord of the Rings Elijah Wood he says it many times because there's a big problem there's in Hollywood yeah and everywhere really Hollywood Elijah wasn't one and and Washington DC do you know that a 800,000 to a million kids get kidnapped a year do you know that is that real I don't know look it up I don't know where'd you read that I don't know I mean I somewhere online I don't know if it's true but it didn't 800 to a million kids get kidnapper here and you know what to eight hundred thousand two hundred thousand to Mel and you know what what was that the biggest city where Washington DC really yeah look how many people are kidnapped oh my god two hundred and three thousand children are kidnapped each year by family members eight hundred thousand children are reported missing dude that's huge eight hundred thousand a year four reported missing how many of those are recovered how many people are kidnapped each day in the US how many children are missing in the United States click on that how many children are missing in the United States according to national Center for Missing and Exploited Children roughly 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States that's roughly 2000 per day of those there are 115 child stranger abduction cases each year so a hundred 15 are abducted by children or abducted by strangers each year which means the child was taken by an unknown person so a lot of those they're saying most of those people that were abducted they were taken by family members but still shitload of people yeah even if it was two hundred thousand even if it was twenty thousand kids a year get kidnapped even if it was twenty thousand isn't that fucking huge if it's a hundred twenty twenty it's huge twenty thousand yeah you know and Sandy Hook was twenty so and there's eight hundred thousand to a million and people aren't all over that there's there's no one's all over it everyone's like oh that's what comes like it's a conspiracy people are aware of it exactly she's almost domestics nobody's aware of it but so many statistics when it comes to like how many people died in car accidents and how many people are murdered and how many people die cancer and how many people there's a lot of statistics to follow you know when people are you know there's been overtime you know if there's been a few people that have been suicided but it's like rip they're really murdered but they would call it those two recent ones that were connected to Hillary Clinton was two of them do you know the ones I'm talking about Jim this is really this isn't there's a Haiti thing going on there's a Haiti's just a new one he was supposed to testify about the money in the Clinton Foundation that's what they said I don't know if he's officially going to testify about that but they said he was gonna at least talk about it yeah there was two dudes that died in the same month and they're in the same within a 30-day period and they said they got suicided they both kill themselves they both so testify so who knows maybe they were really depressed me maybe maybe who are those former Haiti government officials shoots himself in the head in Miami area hotel oh my god come on yeah and what was he doing um he was getting ready to testify so it was there another one fine another one there was another one that was really recent it was in the same was that July that you just look at find the other there was a girl there was a girl it was a female was it yeah she was at part of the investigation ends up suiciding ourselves like an episode of the fucking house of cards man isn't that crazy so obviously who knows maybe they were really depressed and they wanted to shoot their brains out maybe we don't know things we don't know but I'm saying there's some fishy shit going on there right here's kind of this year's I think for sure someone that works for the government has had someone killed right for sure even Lyndon Johnson was about to be indicted for two murders before JFK got murdered well let's start from the beginning it was that true yes I believe that yeah and then let's start forcing he becomes president boom it's gone let's start from the beginning okay for sure someone whether it was Nixon or whether it was Theodore Roosevelt or Kennedy someone at some point in time wanted someone dead yeah and they did it yeah and then pulled it off for the best way to do is call it a suicide right and make it look not like a suicide because then you're sending a message right they do it on purpose here's the question if we all agree and I think every reasonable person would agree that somewhere in government somewhere at some point time someone has ordered someone killed and got away with it right yeah that's that's so that's all I'm saying not so then the question is how many other times yeah how often did you find that chick who recently got got suicided but hold on it here's the thing you got to think of military strikes right if you're willing to authorize a military strike you get to the point where you're willing to say okay do it like especially a drone strike how about that like this is the building the apartment building where ninety seven seven percent sure he's in the building do we have the authorization like how many civilians are dealing with somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 100 okay you have my authorization and they do it and they launch I think anytime you do that if you can do that if you can press that button and just wipe out a hundred people including the bad guy anytime you can do that well you just killed a hundred people that didn't do anything wrong now how easy is it going to be to kill some people that you think do a little bit wrong or annoying or keep fucking with you or like you know the michael hastings story you know that story don't ya which ones that michael hastings did he get sir sadist he got journalist did he commit suicide michael hastings with the journalist who wrote for the rolling stone and he followed around at general and he got stuck over there there was something happened i think it was that volcano that went off wasn't it where they limited air travel for like a month anyway he got stuck over there while the the volcanoes it's like they couldn't fly into this shit the the sky was a zee around this area so he stuck around and they you know they got a little loose with them they joking around about stuff and he was you know making jokes about Obama and the Rolling Stone reported it and he wound up getting retired he retired and stepped down he had to sort of step down because he was in shame and after he did that like everybody was furious is this reporter he got a shitload of death threats cuz this guy was a serious general and he really knew his shit and he was well respected amongst his troops and he had a step down and he had like it put those people in danger because this guy had like inside tracked these people and they got a little comfortable around him and they took this one part and put it in this article made this big story about it well he wound up driving his car into a tree like 120 miles an hour I wonder pulled that out the car explode its new cars new cars apparently they could take over the car the car exploded and the engine was launched from the vehicle like the engine like blew up and was on the in like I forget how far away it was from the car fishy right oh so crazy fishing but who knows they said this is what the thing they said they said oh well he had amphetamines in his system well you know why I had em fed amines in his system cuz he's a fuckin writer here's the dirty secret about writers they're all on adderall you got a shit ton of them on adderall like if someone's a writer and you got deadlines you got to be like alert it's way too easy I have a good friend who told me that almost all journalists and writers are taking this stuff when they need it and as it helps me write it helps it absolutely helps but so there's the crash and there's the engine if fuckin it launched a block away and they think that you know this the conspiracy theory is that they drove him not only drove him into a tree but they had set a bomb in his car and that it um it slammed in the bomb exploded in the engine launch look how far away the engine is look at the engine in the upper right-hand corner there's the car and I look at the engine way up there it launched yeah the whole thing's crazy so what my point was let me finish my he fucked up is even if the the conspiracy theory that every now and then politician someone in power even maybe an entertainer has someone suicided because they're in the elite they got all the connections and they can get away with it even if that's not true and that's all bullshit and and every suicide generally is a suicide even though it looks weird and then they make it look like when you when you watch that movie that the documentary the Clinton chronicles on YouTube when you watch that man man they they make it look obvious to send a message like listen we got the corner in our pocket you don't want to fuck with us we can make anything happen no one's going to jail that's what that is but that's the conspiracy theory but if it's not a real damn that's a good idea you know I mean run with that shit that's a great idea if you're if you're corrupt and you want to hold on your power and you want to call them up as high as you can in the political world that's a great idea right you know in the corner go after the corner whoever the wherever your where your may or what go out to the corner you got to own them and then there's evidence that you look at stuff certain cases and it's obvious for certain cases they fly in a corner they fly in it's it's so shady but why wouldn't it be and why wouldn't you believe it well you know and wrong I would do you want to do the best one the Enron whistleblower who shot himself in the head twice shot himself exactly they do that on purpose that's an obvious line if you were a detective would you enter a case like that go listen someone got suicided but it looks fishy would you say it's a suicide don't disrespect the family just keep it a suicide they told us it was know you would want to know what the fuck really happened like if one of like one of your relatives died or whatever and they said she committed suicide you're like fuck but then someone you know that knows who said it wasn't suicide bro wouldn't you want to know the details and so or would you say it was a suicide that's what the cop said you know what we should have respect for their soul and their family we just say that or would you say tell me what the fuck happened what do you know right yeah it's a family fuck yeah so when it comes to stuff like you look at Chris Cornell him and his wife had a foundation him and Chester were best friends the conspiracy theory I don't know if it's true but that we're gonna they found out some shit they found out so yes let's be respectful no like we don't we don't know I don't know look into it okay but let's this guy just died man I just don't think this is thing shit it's that's why you should speculate it when you find out the connection and the way they died it they made it Chris Cornell had nine broken ribs and a gash in the back of his head gums yes and they said the official story is from the CPR the CPR he was already dead when they got there and they break nine ribs during CPR and there's a gash behind his head if the CounterSpy on his head when they cut him loose and he panics it off the ground and he's hanging he's hanging off like one of those exercises and killed him I mean when you look at the evidence you're like holy shit he looked like he was murdered and then Chester right before Chester dies the same way the exact same way let's not do this man no I don't want to even do this okay all right okay I love Chester I love Linkin Park who got you into its conspiracy theories involved in this guy's death first when he just died it just seems so disrespectful no I he was one of my favorite singers of all to understand but if you really did just kill himself like it seemed so disrespectful to speculate that he was murdered for because of some conspiracy theory I don't know what the case is mmm but I don't even want to talk about it all right all right but do you know I'm saying that you know what I said enough I don't even say no more I don't want to get into trouble but I'm just okay I'm not trying to put anybody in jail I'm just I love Linkin Park I love Chester I loved Chris Cornell you can understand us feel like you should really know what the fuck you're talking about when you talk about people we were just talking about suicides we decided when you look okay what they were into they were into that they were into fighting that okay and when you look at exactly how also severely depressed there was also a lot of psychological shit going on yeah I don't know man I don't know why people kill themselves period you know I don't know why but wouldn't you want what things do look into it there's no she should talk about it until it's whatever the fuck reality has been talking about all these crazy suicides we're talking about all that and then this is insane this is this is when you should bring it up not later when everyone forgets about know any facts yeah so when you're bringing it up sounds crazy okay okay all right I get it I get it he was probably sitting he probably did it himself he could have very well easily have done it himself and the whole thing is just connecting him to some conspiracy without like a D because I have a deep understanding of the I care about I care about deep my understanding is I believe you dude you know my understanding is yeah I would assume that you wouldn't just know when it's happened no but I've looked into it what assume you don't know who was trying to kill or assume you weren't there I assume that you don't know it as a fact I would trust me that I looked into it and I was sure that you were sure you have man I'm sure you have I just it just me personally okay feel very sensitive alright that stuff I guess no I get it I totally get it let's change the subject okay let's get into the UFC okay Demian Maia and we turn the tie rod Woodley tyrunt tyrunt I won't say tie rod Tyrann Tyron Oh Karen Woodley that was a boring match but for me there was tremendous data in MMA the fact like gaming my goes down to 170 at 170 takes everybody down he's taking college wrestlers down left and right but could he take tyronn I thought he could I probably I thought that was that he was gonna hit a wall there and he did how are you gonna take that dude down it's gonna be very very hard to take him down so we learned what I learned from that is man you got to get really good at shooting and doing what Paul SAS is an expert at Paul SAS is the best ever I've ever seen in MMA that's making pooling guard option one he just made it not not option three I was talking about the third option I would want my fighter to have the best standard possible the best takedowns possible get on top ground pound and submit them beat them on the feet of your B don't beaten them but if you're getting beat on the feet and you can't take the guy down you better know how to pull guard you got a you got to know how to drag dudes down unorthodox ways not just a regular wrestling way cuz you're gonna hit Tyrod Woodley you got to throw something like flying at minorities on them you got to shoot deep enough just to get a slight clinch and have something you're gonna jump on not with you not continue with the traditional wrestling you got a shoot pull half guard just like Andre Galvao did he when he thought I made me a few times that's all he did is shoot dude sprawled you just pull half guard blum he got up double underhooks got the back you gotta get creative the way Nogueira beat tim sylvia way back in the day tim sylvia could not get taken down he's too tall yet awesome reach Nogueira was getting clipped he couldn't take down Tim Sylvia where'd he do he shot the best he could and when Tim Sylvia countered he pulled half guard he ended up in the in Anna in deep half and boom with the momentum got up swept him so it was an indirect unorthodox takedown is what happened if you shoot pull guard and then sweep that's the takedown you end up in the same place so he went around the the the wall and he ended up guillotine him from but a guillotine from the top you got to have that you got to end you know what he was pulling guard before Demian Maia did pull guard before early in his career and Herrmann just wasn't having it he didn't that wasn't an option tyrants takedown defense that was oh that was that would take down defense yes that was the last option but this is not I'm not talking about traditional takedowns I'm talking about the art of watch Paul SAS don't know totally there's a time you can't just sit on your butt I think I really would gonna take with a guy like tyron woodley is you're gonna have to get a wrestler who's like a elite high caliber wrestler that's gonna be able to figure out how to take him down I don't think like a regular dude like Damien Maya who's not a regular dude who's a world-class grappler but do you hear Dominick Cruz's criticism of his uh his takedown attempts they wasn't following through enough and what he was saying technically was wrong groans yeah you know I think that if it was a real world-class grappler you know a real you know top of the food chain amateur wrestling like the best wrestler what he said about the fence that most of Damien Meyers takedowns a lot of them anyways are against the fence he's really good at going double underhooks and doing some inside trips or outside trips Tyron defended all that shit yeah you know what else Tyron did he clipped him with a huge uppercut in the very first exchange the very first time Damien tried to close the distance tire and hit him with a vicious uppercut and he fucked his left eye up Damien's left eye was fucked up from the very first exchange when Damien shot low tire and hit him with a hard uppercut and just his his eye immediately swole up and it was fucked for the rest of the fight so I think that that played a factor to just tyrants gameplan was in a lot of people's eyes wasn't fun to watch that was the problem and like Dana felt like he should have finished him and tyrunt his thought was look this is this guy's it's his goal is to win the title you gotta come and try to beat me and win the title if I'm beating you why not just keep doing what I'm doing and continue winning the fight you can't do anything but if I change tactics to make myself more vulnerable and he said he did get hit by a left hand or a couple left hands and that the stunned um I guess his attitude was look if this guy wants to win the title he's got to come and get it if he comes get it I'm gonna knock him the fuck out and if he doesn't come and get it why would I you know why would I go after him and put myself out of position I would coach Woodley the exact same way I would be yelling from the corner just keep doing what you're doing don't wanna fucked up exchange and gets a shot in and takes him down and trips him he tries to get up on his knees jumps on his back in that little scramble one little scramble like that boom you just fucked your whole shit up Damien is not the best puncher in the world but he's not the worst either he can fuck you up if you if you make a mistake and if you rush in and maybe he's reserved more energy than you think he has and he fires a very fast straight left hand and catches you on the chin he could fuck you up yeah he could fuck anybody up he's not incompetent on the feet he's just not at the same level as tyrant he doesn't have the same movement desire do you think Damian shit what if Damien had kicks more like maybe not exactly like but more in the vein of Edson Barboza oh yeah or a Yaya Rodriguez wouldn't that be a whole nother dimension but it doesn't even have to be like that how about just like Pedro his oh just attack the legs yeah just make make the legs he's not doing that right no very boxy well Dominic brought it up one time doing the broadcast because he's like I want to see Damien throw high kick a left high kick yeah but I go have you ever seen Damien throw a left high kick he's like I don't know I don't know if he's ever done it I'm not I'm not disagreeing with you yeah but I'm saying I don't think I've ever seen him try it like he doesn't I think he's such a specialist his specialty is just get e to the ground strongly he should I would suggest I don't know hind shit but I would like to see Damon mire with some with adding to his arsenal adding yet kicks adding more rituals like why not for shit but even if he did the problem is it's like Tyron is just so fucking strong and so good at stuff and takedowns and he hits so goddamn hard it's like you have to be like on him you got to figure out how to actually get him to the ground have full control of him and good luck with all that remember Nogueira vs. Mark Coleman yeah that that Mark Coleman wasn't planning on going to the ground with Nogueira at all this was at the height of pride yeah Mark Coleman's plan was to box with him use his wrestling to not go to the ground right that was the plan the whole way through I'm gonna box this Nogueira guy he's got an amazing guard amazing jujitsu and I'm he ain't gonna take me down I'd fucking wrestle to Columbus what happened did Nogueira take him down fuck no he didn't you know what he did he's like I people who can throw high kicks and a lot of head kicks usually don't because they're afraid of going to the ground all the guys that could do that but guys that want to be on the ground and don't mind being on their back and are dangerous off the back and are known for having a dangerous guard like Nogueira they could throw all the high kicks they want and that's exactly what Nogueira did yeah he started throwing high kicks whizzing by Mark Coleman said and then one just barely nipped his forehead so Mark Coleman just snapped into rest and said fuck these baseball bats I'm gonna ground and pound this motherfucker take my chances in his guard he took him down he got triangle yeah that was the glory days of jujitsu do you remember that was a heavyweight champion yeah it was a triangle armbar and not exactly hiding belt back then yeah yeah that's how we've got to fight to the ground is my throwing head kicks and scaring a motherfucker you know cowboy used to do that a lot cowboy has a nasty guard and one of the reasons wise God is mean one of the reasons why so loose with his kicks because he doesn't mind to take him down if you take him down he ties shit up quick exactly that's what many Mongol s throws had kids yeah Vinnie throws head kicks all the time because he his guard is super his gardens you jump in his guard you know there's like 40 50 percent chance you're gonna tap yeah his garden saying yeah he just uh he did an e bi maybe like eight months ago he pulled off some beautiful rubber guard man he looked like a fucking ninja yeah he's a bad motherfucker and he's a bad motherfucker he's got a crazy athletic frame too you know he's like he's he's built like this gigantic superhero type character he's a huge dude built like a big small dude and he's all handsome and shit he's right up there with Alan Joe Bobby for me he's right there I would put him right there but don't you think like when you look at like his proportions and the way he moves he's almost like a you know a lot of big guys like they look like big guys you know I'm saying like like a perfect example it'd be like that do that just submitted Travis Browne was it oliynyk is that they say it no guy that got that submitted no Dino Gill choked off his mask off his back that guy he just be transparent yeah what did you get him no I'm trying to got him in like a rear naked choke on the side oh that's right he does crazy yeah squeeze must be insane oh my sadist he's probably just knowing this gym is like dude he's gonna help get a hold of your neck and just smash it dead he's a he's a spooky good grappler you'd see like when he gets ahold of guys that he's putting like a crush or squeeze on for it people don't understand what he did he let a guy mound him and he choked the guy while the guy was on top of him that is insane and unheard of who was mounted he was mounted which means it's one of the worst position she could ever be in an MMA the guys on top of you he's his hips her above your hips he's pinning you to the ground and this guy choked the guy from the bottom it never happens it never happens the fact that he could do it I mean here we could see it here what how do you say his name is Vasily Alexei that's right Alexei Olynyk so he's just rag dolling Travis here and he gets his back and look at this he's got a rear naked on the side near the body scissors look how he's in the body and just smashing him so he can't breathe he's got him in a lockdown across the body yeah and then he gets the neck he's under the neck just sort of like a sideways rear naked choke the other one he did is even crazier when you see him submit the guy from the bottom with an Ezekiel choke see that kind of guy that looks like a big guy you know time for a mouth he looks like a big guy yeah Vinny Magalhaes looks like a welterweight that's six foot three for some strange reason and 230 pounds is he fighting MMA anymore they're just gonna do Jiu Jitsu I'm not sure I'm not sure he's gonna come back and do the absolute EBI absolutes gonna be after on it look at this shit look at this shit this is crazy who the fuck does that yeah watch him do that no one's ever done that back that up again people gonna try it now so going all the way to the beginning so the guy gets mount and he thinks he's gotta go i got the mount here and he just sinks this in and look how tight he makes this it's really choke into the into the throat yeah rear crazed dude that seems legit fuck yeah it's legit it's a hundred percent legit I think he I think that's super legit yeah if you look at the way the arms are folding up here I mean that's not a goon right that's that's a front naked Chuck yeah it is that is um it's all like real leverage no you see you tell if a guy goon somebody just crushing their head that's not a good that's all squeeze right there yeah and it's it's fitting in like keys right yeah it's fitting in there perfectly your squeeze have something super high-level to get it just choke someone while being mounted oh good lord good lord how many people have that see this tyron woodley thing is very tricky because in my mind like I see that he wanted to win the fight period that is the best way to win the fight if this guy is only offering a certain amount of offense and you could stuff that offense and land your shots and continue to pile up points which he did and don't ever put yourself at risk I get it but I also get the Dana White point of view where he's like you gotta sell tickets like people are paying to see you fight and if people are holding up cell phones and swinging them through the rafters you know because everybody's bored because they don't want to watch it anymore and his thought is like you gotta sell tickets hey who's the greatest takedown artist in UFC history George st. Pierre George st. Pierre vs. Woodley yeah but Woodley apparently because of this fight they're talking about GSP versus Bisping now oh they gotta go to Woodland come on that's the only guy take Woodley down nobody can but what if they just tried to take each other down back and forth and everybody went crazy again SP took him down repeatedly if he didn't that kid would that be great too but what if he did either way I want to see the fight either way because because because Woodley has a style some people don't like it some people like it some people appreciate it or whatever but the only guy that has a shot to beat Woodley the only guy would be the best takedown best MMA takedown artist of all time he has like a million takedowns in the UFC he's the only guy that would be able to if GSP can do it no one can he's also just right yeah very good striker I think those leg kicks this is what you'd have GSP saying like we got to go the pro wrestling angle you know I'm tired of sitting at home watching boring fights as bad GSP impression with him saying like enough already I want might sound like Arnold Kennedy 70 IVs I don't know Bisping's at 185 that's kind of weird is he saying and it's gonna be too hard to make 170 without the hy-vee's I think he was willing to fight you to fight I think he was willing to do 170 or 180 Woodley GSP would be huge that would that would be the biggest fight for what I'm not impressed with because who else is there I won 70 that could has a chance of taking him down well robbie lawler since he's just one you would have to look at Robbie's being you know just pretenders he would just brawl with him he's willing to brawl with them if he can avoid the big bomb that he got hit with in the first fight yeah you know and you got to think Robbie Lawler is coming off of five round war with Rory MacDonald five round war with Carlos Condit war with Johny Hendricks war war war war it's all war every fight he's innocent of the war so like I think that him having that year off was giant and then he fought cowboy and towards the end he was coming after cowboy he was hurting cowboy to the body he hit cobbler with some big shots I felt like a lot of people disagree with that decision but I felt like I give Robby the first round because he jumped all over cowboy in the beginning and was I think it was enough to win the round although I think cowboy was getting the better of the exchanges towards the end I felt still think the volume of it and the impact went to Robbie second round went to cowboy pretty big then Robbie rallied in the third round and I think he dominated the third round I think he hurt cowboy a few times I think that would have been an amazing five round fight that would have been an incredible number who won the fight Robbie one very close decision I think it was a split decision I don't all the fire that my great fire brain is scrambled it was a great fight it was a great fight both gave both took it was it was war it was chaos you know and cowboy definitely caught him with some clean shots he hit him some real good nice the body as well cowboy landed a lot of great shit but you know Robbie looked like Robbie again he looked like the Robbie Lawler that won the title it looked like a killer he looked like the same spooky dude that just keeps coming after you until he puts you away that's what he looked like in the third round third round in particular really looked like he was falling back into the old groove again so there's him you know I think man it's crazy seeing Rory MacDonald over in Bellator looking better than ever looking better than ever when he took down Paul Daley like he cracked Paul on the feet didn't get hit with shit took Paul down and strangled the shit out of him and the way he did it you watch did he go whoa like Rory MacDonald might be the best welterweight on the planet like he might he might right be there you know you got to remember he beat tyron woodley remember that fight I don't remember it Rory shut him down shut down that big overhand right yeah it was pressed against the case recent long ago maybe if I had a guess 2015 I think he fought tyron woodley before he fought Robbie Lawler I think it was one of those elimination what Lee was that was a decision yeah I beat Woodley by decision and he also beat Demian Maia he survived being mounted by Danny and mine in the first round hmm Damien took him down mounted him he defended and then he fucked Damien up in the second and the third round and he's still peaking dude he's like 26 yeah he's one of the best in the world without a doubt he might be the best without a doubt yeah it bums me out seeing him over at Bellator I think that kid is sensational it's Kelvin coming back down to 170 what do you think I think you can make it for sure I think if Kelvin had the kind of discipline that Chris Weidman has to get down to 85 Chris Weidman is a huge guy yeah he has to have real discipline to make that 185 pound limit I mean he has to really watch his calories he walk around it I would like to know it's well north of 200 pounds so he's a big guy you know according to Ray Longo Matt Serra they like Chris is on the big side of 85 like he could easily be on the small side of 205 mm-hmm you know and then do you what do you think about these new weight classes like the athletic commissions now they're they're gonna add 65 75 95 and I think 220 it was a 225 to do UFC gonna do this I don't know well if UFC is gonna do it but I think they should I think they should go every ten pounds not every five pounds but every ten pounds the way it is do you know like it just it makes sense every it makes sense but fighters I don't think we I don't think we need it it makes sense I don't mind the big jumps really find your spot we don't need more it would just be a it'll just I don't know at this point I think you keep it the way it is but who knows what they're gonna do I don't agree I think we need more weight classes I think there's too big of jumps I think the jump of like 185 to 205 is fuck crazy that's a 20-pound jump that's huge the difference between a guy who's 185 and a guy was 205 is significant the amount of power that guy has over the 85 pounder is fucking huge find your spot 55 it's too many there's too many tweeners like Diego Sanchez Davis ang is probably a 65 or you know maybe a little too small for 70 maybe too big for 55 I think there's a few of those guys he's gotten down to 45 I know not good though I mean not not fought like the Diego Sanchez of old yeah I can get I think it was 55 is the spot yeah I think it's hard for him to even make that though so you let him fight at 65 he'd have all his energy it makes sense what you're saying and I get it totally makes sense but the fighting it's just fighting you know it's not diluted we got enough anymore everything doesn't have to be like just all systematically fair you know I don't think that's the case I don't think we have enough I think we get a rule for more champions I think we'd have more super fights could have more guys rise to the top of the division and it would be easier to match them up it's way easier to match up a 75 with an 85 then it is to match up a 70 with an 85 or 55 with an 85 it's just like too much did the gaps are too big I think we have too much already I think it's hard to keep track of shit the way it is really there's an argument for that I guess I don't know I like it though I think it gives people more options and I think heavyweights for sure gives them more options I would also like to see a super heavyweight division I would like to see a full-on freakshow I want to see the mountain from Game of Thrones I want to see that guy how to fight he's like 330 fucking pounds you know that guy that picks up those stone balls and shit do you know I'm talking about carries cars he's one of those dudes how big is he Johnny and how solid six eight yeah Viking straight Viking long hair beard no he's got beard yeah he's like one of those Iceland guys I think Sweden or Iceland one of them one of them Viking characters how big is that mountain dude there's a video of him sparring with Conor McGregor it's hilarious he's six foot nine Jesus Christ what in the fuck is that there a picture of him Jesus Christ he weighs 380 pounds 380 of him picking up cars oh yeah there's a bunch of videos of him doing shit here watch him that's him see if they have some videos of him doing his workouts his workouts are fucking insane or in some sort of strongman competition I ever see go back go back to the screen you just had scroll down to that Conor McGregor video the screen you just had that's it right there see conor mcgregor vs the mountain oh shit and Connor is playing around with them sparring with them look at the size of this guy and Connors like slapping him in the stomach he's like come on I'm gonna grab you look he's trying to grab him oh

he 6 9 6 9 386 he's getting tired he's trying to grab him nope nope not today sir that was like a Bruce Lee laughs yeah okay this is real see looking over no we're gonna keep popping him with that straight left it's funny man it's weird to watch right he tried to give him a high-five to stop hunter said ah yeah you know Oh tagged him yeah look at he's throwing yeah this is not into that nothing to that oh dude oh those are hard shots he gave up Samiha oh shit that was a real fight that was a fight that was like a half a real fight right that looked like a real fight to me didn't they didn't punch the face I don't think he wanted to punch his no it would have been a bad move yeah just stick to the body you can't even reach his face yeah you're not gonna hit that face look at what he does he throws the kettlebell over the top of a fucking dude what if it lands on his head you gotta watch the youtube channel or the weather the Instagram page is it Instagram no Twitter Jesus Christ Twitter page hold my beer have you ever seen a Twitter page hold my beer no dude it's it's perhaps is the greatest Twitter page that's ever existed and it's holding my beer while I do this and they do some stupid shit over and over again what does this hold my beer while I oh that's a good one he opened up a beer with a football but that's not scroll down a little bit let me show you my some kind of ridiculous ones do you find the right one oh there's a ton of videos of one guy did a backflip you try to do a backflip off the top of these bricks oh don't do this one that one's horrible the guy's gonna cry kick that girl in the head look at this oh oh oh I kicked this can off your head watch this guy hold my beer why sit on airbag watch this do they say that no no no they don't but um what's this one is he got lighting the guy on fire oh Jesus Christ the fuck is he doing let's basically hold my beer while I yes I think anything fucking ridiculous he's - oh we blew up oh shit okay scroll down scroll down not that one keep going keep going that one right there this guy's pretty badass look at that he actually made it sometimes they may have yeah but watch this one it's good Oh shit I guess tried you a backflip off a stack of bricks or something okay that's enough that's enough but anybody's interested go to hold my beer on Twitter it's fucking late I try to retweet them at least like once a month he's fine the most ridiculous shit whose Instagram accounts oh yeah do you find funny I think the Beastmaster his Instagram might be the best Instagram I follow do you see the one where the dudes were trying to jump out of the way of some rolling hey they had a bale of hay rolling down the hill and the dude tried to jump by the way and got fucking launched into the air yeah hey I mean he's the most gangster of all fire of shit talkers and do UFC I mean who's more gangster than him he's more gangster than Mike Tyson you know I mean Mike Tyson has said crazy shit he said I'll eat your children ate two children and he said I'll fuck you do you love me but he said that before the fight you know you after the fight he's not saying that you know what I mean he's not you know that when Derrick Lewis when he called out Ronda that was fucked up that's low blow that was a low blow yeah no one no one I mean even Roberto Duran called that said something about sugar and its wife but that was before the fight afterwards they become they become friends they became friends I think is after the second fight they became friends yeah have the first fight he tried to hold that was like one of the famous he'd watch the movie that Roberto Duran pushed him away no I never saw it but after the end of the first fight he tried to like embrace Duran Duran pushed him away like he still wanted to fight it's pretty crazy it's a crazy ending in the fight see if you can pull up the video the very last moments of the round with the first time Roberto Duran fought Sugar Ray Leonard he beat him he knew at the end that he beat him and so with a bell rang he just fuckin drops his glove and he's like staring him down like he's still ready to go it's crazy Roberto Duran was a wild motherfucker you mention if after Michael Mike Tyson knocked down Michael Spinks then when they they get in the post by dinner interview he said I'll eat his children imagine saying that after the fight people go what the fuck wait where Michael Spinks children at finance this is uh the first fight at the very in seconds he goes to shake his hand he's like fuck you see comes near and look at this what the fuck out air he pushes him away fuck you that was after the first fight yeah after the fight was over he pushed him around he's fuckin he's screaming at him he's like fuck you yeah and when did he say that thing to Sugar Ray's wife before for this fight for this yeah that's right he got in his head you did that to get in his head oh well he was just that guy too apparently there was a there was an article written where they went to visit him in Panama and he took a cat and he picked it up by the tail and smashed it against a wall and they were like well according to the movie we move on cuz uh he had moments where he got out of control but generally it was a very good guy in the movie the movies are weird I don't know if they're true but apparently he did that too I've read this story I don't know if the story might be bullshit but I'm like if he was that crazy you know living on the streets in Panama like becoming the savage boxer he was so good to man he was ferocious everybody beat up Davy more remember that Davy more was thought to be the guy like in everybody thought after No Mas Roberto durán was done so they had this kid a stud boxer Davy more World Champion at 154 I believe that was after No Mas yeah that's there was the comeback fight Roberto Duran when he was really fully back he boxed up Davy more and stopped him was a tremendous upset because Davey Moore was a lot bigger than him to like I know David was black guy Davie wound up getting killed working on a car fucked up he was trying to fix his car and he fucked up with the jack and it crushed him they could be conspiracy yes or no look into it oh man so um you saw the UFC this weekend do you see where I fucked up and I interviewed Daniel Cormier after he had been knocked out dude here's here's something that's like people think that somehow another the UFC told me not to do that and I did it nobody said anything it was just a hundred percent my fuck up and it was also my idea in the first place to stop interviewing fighters after they've been knocked out it was a hundred percent my idea how often did it happen before in championship fights it happened often right almost always whether a guy got knocked out or tko'ed or submitted or lost a decision I would interview the winner and I would interview the loser every time every time okay so it's not unless they ran out of the cage which has happened before yeah I get it so you're just on running on instincts here and this is what happened I was there for Gonzaga versus cro cop remember Gonzaga headkick cro cop and just fuck ya into oblivion yeah and it was bad and I interviewed cro cop afterwards and I'm telling you that dude had no idea what I was talking about yeah and I remember saying to the to the production team at the time was like man I don't think we should interview guys after they get knocked out like that that was my saying like that yeah and then the one time it happened again is with Alistar and after when I'll star over in Faust IPE Miocic and he remembered this guillotine that didn't really happen you remember to steep a tapping rather and it didn't really happen I was like this poor guy like he's he really has his memory in his head and it's just not correct cuz he just got knocked the fuck out he got knocked unconscious on television like completely flat line and then a few minutes later I'm asking him to be coherent I'm like I don't think it's fair so it was my idea to stop doing this and the UFC agreed so it's not like like they said we got to stop doing it and I violated my own idea yeah I just did it on this is what happened after the fight was over first of all the fight was crazy shocking how violent the ending was cuz John really did fucking hate Daniel and Daniel I think really did hate John or at least had real anger there was real emotions with these guys it was insane it was intense when John landed that fucking head kick and you saw him moving in for the kill and then he he stopped him right in front of us he got on top of them and just blasted him it was like right there I remember looking over and I'm like Jesus he was just dropping like real close to here it was pretty close if I remember correctly I want to say it was like right off to my right if I remember correctly yeah good look at it I had a real good look at it yeah I mean obviously I'm cage side I got a good look at everything but I had a real good look at that it was intense it was intense and it was also I felt like there was a couple shots too many so I remember being stunned like oh oh I'm a I'm a big fan of John Jones but I'm also a big fan of Daniel and I'm a fan of both of them I know they don't like each other but I like both of them I like them independently just I can't help the fact they're enemies but I love hanging out with John and I love hanging out with Daniel I love doing commentary with Daniel I love that guy so I would never do anything to make him look bad I just got I was in shock there was he was confused cuz he got knocked out so he was confused that um why the fight was stopped and so he was mad that they stopped the fight cuz he just didn't understand because he just Benkei out so he was arguing with Big John I didn't hear the exact words then he was arguing with Dana I didn't hear the exact words of that either but Dana was in front of me it's you got to realize when ko like that happens in a world championship fight and you're standing in the Octagon you're surrounded by all these people screaming and cheering the the fucking noise is so loud it's hard to figure out what the fuck is happening so I couldn't figure out what Daniel and Dana were arguing about but Dana's whole head was red he was like he was like that fight was amazing he fought your heart out like I couldn't tell exactly what he said like you'd hold your head up high it was a great fight that kind of stuff but I think Daniel was still trying to figure out why the fight was stopped because it just had happened he just woken up then he realized he got head kicked and then he was really sad then he was upset and I went to go talk to him and literally as I'm going to talk to him he's turning to me and I have the microphone I'm like why am i interviewing him after he got knocked out what the fuck is wrong with me like I don't even realize what I was doing I was just in shock almost like I went on instinct and I'm interviewing him if I had a chance to stop and think I should have been like oh yeah he's been ko don't do it so in the middle of me even talking to him I say I normally I don't like to interview fighters after they've been knocked out but I just like I was stuck I was already there talking to him and I didn't want to leave walk away from him and I really do care about that guy a great deal and I just watched him get knocked out and now watch him his heart's pouring out and he's crying you know and when he was realizing that he got knocked out and he lost the fight it was all awful and so I put it it was haunting me all night this is nobody that said anything nobody from the UFC got mad at me no one said anything to me there was just me thinking why did I do that like why did I interview him I shouldn't have interviewed him even though we used to do it for every fight it was the right move to stop doing it and ironically it was my idea it was my move I don't even know if other guy I don't know if Brian Stann still interviews guys after they've been knocked out I don't think he does though because Brian actually said thank you to me for that because he got interviewed after he got knocked out by Wanderlei and he remembers thinking I don't remember what happened he didn't know what the fuck happened and they were interviewing him he's trying to keep it together for the interview and he was like you're right it's not fair it's not fair to interview a fighter after they've been knocked out I just fucked up man there's no other way to say it I just if I could go back I definitely would have taken it back I definitely wouldn't have interviewed him because I feel I feel like he didn't any he sent me text message saying it's all good I didn't say anything crazy so it's no big deal but you know he could have you know he could have said I never got stopped I could have said you know he could you don't think anything like if somebody doesn't explain to him well enough what happened yeah and then it takes a few seconds and you forget again that's the other thing about guys have been knocked out like you like say if if I got knocked out and I asked you Eddie what happened and you said all this dude just punched you in your John knocked you out but no way hey man what happened like a few seconds later start asking again when you get knocked out it's real weird so it's a huge fuckup on my part but it was I was in shock honestly it was so ferocious the final barrage was so ferocious and it was the way it was the way John did it when you heard him once you knew he heard him you just started going after him and one of the Bugis things that he did was he tripped him you see how he tripped him like Daniels like sort of stumble him back and John just sort of scoops his leg out from under him and trips him and falls back and John just moves in on them and you could tell Daniel just couldn't get his feet back under him and John just jumped on them I just marked him Cormier did great on his feet for a while there he did great but I was really impressed with John John strong cool dude he throws so much unorthodox those stomps on the knees dude that's high level shit and the volume yes thrown a lot of products yeah that's his rear that's his shit he was in tremendous shape thrown those those elbows from you know from left field mm-hmm you know right down the pipe yeah he's doing a lot of elbows man dude he's throwing all kinds of shit he throws everything front kicks throws a lot of front carry yeah right to the the others foot snap kicks throws those oblique kicks by and hyperextension love them I love that ho I hope he keeps going cuz he's evolving so much as a striker huh I hope he is more the other I hope he gets to get together 100% you never see my rest again no more bullshit no one cares about that I do arrested again it's like he tore his ACL what's the difference he's gonna be back it doesn't matter let him parties the king of the world he's the he's the probably the best fighter of all time let him do some coke let him fire data should be getting some house you know - man fuck it he gets fucked up that's that's actually better press so what he needs is like a snake you should fake duis and drunk instead just like they do in TMZ he just needs a constant security detail to keep everything away from her let him let him do whatever he wants he's the king of the fucking world you don't want him getting we lost a whole year of him and then we lost a year before that I don't want him to get Tyson that that's for sure dude he could get locked up for five years yeah that shit happens to people you want what you want him to do is have fun but don't do anything illegal don't let him drive take his cash take his keys yeah have a rubber party room just say dude you go off for five hours whatever you want boom but you can't leave this this room you ever been in one of them bouncy warehouses we can go from one trampoline to the next Champlain all the time my son go all the time those are the best man yeah the best so anyway even though I already talked to Daniel I felt like I put it on Twitter I apologized on Instagram and I was like I gotta apologize in the podcast too I fucked up and it was just a fuck it wasn't there's no other explanation but is it is it because of the mean of this crying face no I just mean just to talk to him dumb it means you're gonna have memes man yeah except means other ones government there's so many knock out means you have the Rashad Evans one that's pretty pop it's one of those you have the Jose Aldo one that's pretty that's on that underground when you turn on the underground boom it's the Jose Aldo getting clipped yeah there's so many of them did you ever see the video of the dude that came up to her shot and asked him to sign one of the posters ever shot all fucked up wait say that again some dude had the balls to come up to Rashad at a one of those signings and try to get Rashad to sign the picture that one picture was all jacked up I tried to get him to sign that and he shot crumpled they don't him up he thought he's being cute what's this that's the dude he walks up to me supposed to get the fuck out of here man oh shit damn he's like no get out of here go you want to hear it yeah all right so hold on well that rewind it so we'll go before that will you see him rip it up the Mexicans here damnit Mexicans to watch the hands of the picture of shod crumples it up and throws that he's laughing he pushes and said get out of here man [Music] he's laughing this is cute Rashad look he was gonna smash him he took a picture with friend Nicholas I think it was Photoshop Steve that made a he made a Photoshop of like a shot of inside of a plane you see everyone's sitting down and see a bunch of people and you know something you know when you're on a plane you're going overseas and everyone's crashed out at night yeah I mean you're walking you you go take a piss and everyone everyone has their crash out face right so you put like all those famous knock out faces on on people on a planet and you were in there too I think you were wide awake though you're wide awake and and all these favors like beat door knocked out over here so far the greatest photoshop's of all time I don't know where it's at though that's just a price that you pay if you're gonna be a part of that world that public world yeah if you win you get ya insane amount of glory you know but you only get that glory because there's a risk of getting the opposite of that Jamie Foxx was talking about the other day we were talking about Michael Jordan that a lot of people don't even know who Michael Jordan is they just know oh you're the crybaby face you can cry baby face people see that meme it's like you be got you cease to become an individual we've been crying in that mean what was the original source of that Hall of Fame and he was calling out his haters really in his Hall of Fame oh my god it's one of the craziest Hall of Fame speeches ever it made people really eight how they feel about him some people lost like all respect I want to hear that some people understood it he's talking shit about like reporters and coaches and hair players he's telling the truth I'm sure but it's just fascinating to listen to oh that was told you know this isn't it this is like how to fail and still be a winner and all that shit here it goes let me hear this shit 23 minutes long okay just give me a little volume let's get to the good part yeah that was a disrespect Orion to my Carolina guy they all know them I'm true-blue Carolina guide to the heart you know coach Smith Larry Brown Sam Perkins James Worthy you know all of those guys well it all starts with my my parents you guys see all the highlights what is it what is it about me that you guys don't know as I set up in on watching all the other recipients stand up and they give their the history and so many things I didn't know about Jerry Sloan and oh he lived on the farm but I didn't know he was in a small classroom with from first grade to the eighth grade even David Robson obviously I've known David for some time and we're gonna lose the audience here see I don't know what the part where he got mad at people but he was maybe a youtube so Jordan insults whoever gets mad oh he mad oh yeah it's not like that might have had how about Michael Jordan oh oh he mad Jamie's eating that Cape shake those things this shit aren't there can I have one fuck yeah have one right now a bunch in the freezer refrigerator back there they're all keto - yeah give me one of them yeah no affiliation with this company ladies and gentlemen they're just good I don't know shit about them there might be monsters yeah those are good man yeah you got to shake it a little bit there you go they're very thick it's like a like a milkshake or some shit what flavors strawberry so what do you think about the cyborg fight I felt like it was kind of weird you know seeing Tanya avenger' so outsized you know fighting cyborg who's like yeah it's real thick like sometimes I eat it with a spoon what do you think about that bye cyborg is just too goddamn good Tanya avenger' she's a girl she's tough and she's out of her weight class she almost didn't have a chance almost you know what I mean she had a chance but it wasn't the best chance and cyborg fought a very technical fight she's such a good striker Jesus super technical to see she's not taking too many crazy chances she's just picking her spots she's a machine hmm and she's really good on the ground too hard to take down her wrestling's good her work ethics insane she's legit brown belt right this is Jim is she around mo I believe she is last I heard I didn't know maybe she's got her black butt but she's legit what was impressive to me that you know like avenger' was like trying to be crafty and move around and being unorthodox and throwing a good jab and she was looking for her spots just she was just out gun but cyborg didn't just try to guerilla fuck her you know she didn't just try to chase her down Smasher she picked a part out her did a great a great job of hacking at the legs landing shots and then once she had her I love Tonya having her I'd love that girl you know what's what she's tough as fuck ma'am just fine one of the coolest things about MMA is how open-mindedness we are with lesbians right I mean we don't even it's no big deal at all with girls put it on the countdown show two girls who knows the champ yes like totally cool we're all you know Tonya Mengers on instagram live making out with chicks at bars you know what I mean yeah she's she's a party girl you know she's and you're allowed to be a big old lesbian yeah yeah but we're guys no no we're still in Jesus not one dude one dude that I know of it's open the game well he did gay porn it was on tough oh okay wait a minute there's an ultimate was his name Dakota Dakota Cochrane I think his name was cock ring no Cochran Mack that's his last name right there that was like that was a part of the show that's part what they were talking about damn okay there's one yeah hold on we're still we're way behind we're way behind cuz there should be at least necessary means there should be say he's gay I think he's just saying he did gay porn I'm all you know what I love gay people my favorite singer of all time he's a farming gang Peter no anyways I have no problem with problem with people being gay I think they should come out you know I lived in West Hollywood for almost 1 years you were surrounded by gay people every time I'm busy swim to a river gay people warehouse yeah yeah if you got if you're a guy we're still in Jesus times unfortunately I mean maybe maybe it's not the best thing to come out if you're an MMA all right but it's just a my man like for comedy nobody gives a fuck football people care right you can't be can you be opening gay openly gay in football how many guys is one or two came alright before the draft and you got drew now there's a few now think about how many I mean not tons it's no traveling what do you think I'm a PI equal to like the population maybe like 10 percent what no way no way no way guys why do you think there's 50 openly gay football players I want to believe you well gonna say I'm gonna say - ok you say - I say 5 Jamie would you say it's like what 8 to 10 percents that's my like no no 3040 that are out of the closet is it ok I don't know about this no no that's what I'm talking not consider out of the closet does it narrows how many people are gay yes but how many people are out of the closet in the NFL I say there's one or two says there's been a love if there have been 11 known gay players nanofy and they all got they're all there now hmm interesting we're not that open no guys are not that open this thing a lot of players think about how many players there are yeah all right now let's go this way what percentage of the population is gay versus what percentage of the population is out of the closet shit I think if you had yes if all of all the gay people in the United States I would say I'm gonna guess 50% are out of the closet 50 hmm what do then 30 are out of it yeah it could be third it could be 10 yeah it could be 10 depending on where you live if you're in California you're still in the closet you're probably a UFC fighter [Laughter] are you around when the Edmonton fight happens are you around during that week what what's the day a fight companion this is kind of interesting this is totally unrelated to this weekend because actually what is it September 9th September 9th yeah is that a Saturday yeah it's Saturday I'm there on Friday in Edmonton for your doing two shows at this auditorium okay I'm the Jubilee Auditorium - two shows at this theater okay I'm not doing the paper you the next night okay so I do if I compare I go I go back home yeah it was weird because it's a it's a main event its Mighty Mouse versus Ray Bourque and a man a Nunez Valentina Shevchenko but there I don't think they're anticipating that it's going to be a high pay-per-view cell you know let's do it that sounds like fun yeah it's on see I would like to get Kalin and Shaw but Shawn's become too fucking successful he's too successful that fucking baller he's traveling all over the place selling out everywhere he's selling out theaters he's been doing stand-up for like six weeks he sounds a haters do something he's been doing it more than that he's been doing it like a year but he's selling out everywhere down dude he yeah when I said I was like I was telling all these other comedians I say you see what you seen here I go this is what happens when an athlete shows you how lazy you guys are like this guy's like just starting out but he works at it he does like a ton of sets he writes a ton like he actually puts in the time like that's what athletes do comics like to pretend they're working and they fuck off a lot and keep doing the same machine material for 10 years the shop is like out there so I'm doing it I'm no expert at comedy but it's I think in my opinion it's a lot like jujitsu you got to practice and refine it's a lot like writing music because you can you can't if you're gonna rely on just going up there and riffing fuck good luck good luck it's like good trying to write a song like you okay we're gonna record a song we have no idea we're gonna do but we're gonna jam and E alright and then we go and that's the hit song the odds of that happening super slim you got a record a jam pick out little pieces polish it add this two months later ooh you got a middle part now a month later you got the intro it's all coming together might take eight months to get that bit together you know constantly going back and forth that's how music is put together that's how jiu-jitsu just put together you got to constantly refine your game you're out there getting wrecked what are you doing wrong what's working let's stick to what's working let's add some new shit learning from other people techniques and being open-minded understanding that your body's magical and it'll do anything you want it to do you just got to tell it over and over and over again to a point where it does it by itself without you even knowing what the hell is going on it's unconscious you could do anything you could play piano you can play guitars like oh I tried guitar but it's too hard you just didn't practice that's all anybody could play guitar anybody could play guitar anybody can play piano as long as your neurons fire correctly it's just takes time well yeah if you got in a motorcycle accident you smash your hands you're like this you can't play piano but I'm just saying if you have normal limbs you could play piano you could play guitar you can do anything you could you could do anything you can learn jujitsu you can box you can play basketball maybe you never played basketball in your life and you're 55 years old if you practice hard for a year you'd be I I know people don't want to believe that though it's hard for them to believe it because they're not reminded of it that's why a lot of people coming from jujitsu and martial arts in general they become successful because through jujitsu you're constantly reminded that you can suck at something and then you get pretty good at it and then you master it and then it's unconscious you're reminded of that every time you go to jujitsu every day you're reminded damn I can do this with anything and people do it with their business they go all I gotta do is do hustle in the in the jiu-jitsu of business you know and make it happen or whatever you want to do you're reminded like shit you like it when I say magical it's not a metaphor it is magical because your body would do shit on its own like when you like when you're doing jujitsu sometimes I come up with moves I don't know what the fuck I did I did something I have no idea and then it comes up again because I programmed and drilled my body so much and has so many things that I trained it to do on instincts that it's kind of like a suggestion thing like we hit YouTube and they kind of know what you like and here's the suggestions your body will go he always does this in the only does that he always does this unconsciously mm-hmm man he might like this oh shit what was that it's like your body kick it someone else came up with that and then the next time you do like there it is again hmm that's how most of the moves that or transitions that I get good at they come up like on their own and then the third time ago I got it and then I videotape but then I videotape myself doing on my shit I didn't even know I was doing that it was just like your body will make shit up for you you everybody not just me it's everybody you just gotta learn how to capture it it's like comedy people love comedy because they go see a comedian and he's saying all this shit that they agree with and they're laughing they're going yeah I'm like I think that this comedian is amazing he's saying shit that if you're laughing you agree with it but you all the shit that he's saying you said and people around you have said it you just didn't notice it as something to use onstage so once you it's just like music when every time you listen to music like for me anytime I listen to music and I like something musically which is rare I'm gonna find out everything about that song there's that I don't ever get lazy with that I find out what who sang the song I download the song I analyze the song like what is it about this song that makes it so great why am I getting chills listening to the song why do I have this song on repeat you know that's I'm trained musically to always try to capture golden nuggets every time I hear oh I'll be in the middle of a conversation in Japan at TGI Fridays in Tokyo and and in the distant a song would come on and I'm in the conversation with some people and I hear it and it just I know that I tell the people I'm with I'll be right back I gotta find out what this song is I'll write it down to him I just do that as a DJ it's kind of a DJ thing so my point is it's same thing with jiu-jitsu it's same thing with comedy it's same thing with music you just gotta it's all around you you just gotta look for it you got to train yourself to look for maybe you have the right shit on your hand to train remind yourself think think about then once that becomes your instinct once looking for shit and recognizing shit and always be on the call for shit like for instance like editors do to edit videos every time they watch in a movie what are they doing they're breaking down the editing you're right like movie makers are breaking down the lighting they watch the hidden directors of movies you know a lot of ways like the directors they get all these ideas we put it together but a lot of times like you get on television shows well the editor will make these passes at things and they give you like like an editor's first cut and a lot of times like you know the director looking oh I like that like that yes good you don't just get anybody better you got to have an editor who who knows the show who knows yeah you got to be talented not just a slave that's gonna cut shit together there's a lot of talent in the editing yeah he's gonna be especially in television shows right yeah or I guess in movies too man you know yeah I get the editors that I got working from his high level miss it amazing that editor like that movies are still in a theater now so when the rare things you do will you'll go somewhere like just to get some sort of art where it's not live you're gonna go to a place still like they still have them like that and I don't know if I've been brainwashed because I'd like it to be good I'm just saying it's weird it's like one of the few places we have left well we'll go and take in media at a specific location we all meet like we go for a live show we'll go for a live show but if you you're not gonna go to see like of a fake band gigantic screen that's like a hundred times bigger than your TV and the sound is amazing yeah so there's all that crazy though then it's cool sitting with people and when they laugh you laugh yes continue you want to laugh more when there's other people around but you've run the risk of douchebags people talk and people that you got violated the sacred laws of the movie theater you gotta go in which big old kool Moe Dee shades and a beanie oh in a fake beard crazy you know beards are so in these days what happened to the fake beard market like why isn't there like dudes like wearing fake beards into clubs and being you know to me like posters were fake shit girls can wear fake asses they can have fake it's the interface out there it's not fair it's kind of like there's a lot of things that aren't fair and that's one thing that they got you know we can't have we can't be the same so whoever was deciding on men and women like okay you get this you get that it isn't fair like the women like okay okay if you're gonna you get the you know guys you know they're they they can't control it guys are attracted to girls with nice bodies right generally there are somebody's just nice bodies like there's something about actual fake tits that's hot cuz it's like wow this girl is she's in the deck so much she just wants to be like ultra attractive in a cartoonish way like look at those giant fake tits whoa some guys some guys are like I don't like fake tits there's still some of those guys out there there's I got fifteen percent of the population eventually another generation those will be all gone and fake tits would just be accepted by all men but fake ass whoo that's gonna take a couple generations that's gonna take a nap in this generation nobody is cool with fake asses nobody's the worst shit ever the don't get it girls don't even think about it yeah but the gray area is this fat thing they're doing well it's not a fake ass but they're taking fat they're grafting fat that's still gross dee some squats anybody can have a great body just do some squats not that's not true there's there's some people out there they've got some fucked okay there's nothing yeah hillbilly stick people you know one those people you gotta get good at sucking dick you gotta eat know and suck dick they don't want to they have no choice I get that fat stuff in there after a reengineer the older you get the more women eat ass I was reading this thing about CRISPR that they're starting to use CRISPR for four embryos now and that would they think they're really close to genetically engineering the first people that become viable actual humans do you know what CRISPR is no dude it's like Photoshop for jeans there look at this scientists edit human embryos for the first time in the u.s. they're they're using this new technology which is way more complicated than my puny brain has the ability to describe but it's a gene editing tool called CRISPR and there's a so another episode of Radiolab that's about crisper that it might be like a good way for you to get an entertaining but descriptive explanation of it but uh they're they're gonna be able to at least someday in the future if this keeps going they keep perfecting this they're going to be able to edit things out of people like they're going to be able to take away the the gene for Alzheimer's you know I don't know what do you mean you don't know I don't know they always say shit like in the future no they're doing it now Eddie they're doing it now like there's there's real science behind this like you could you could follow the science they're editing the things the same way they're making Photoshop the same way they're making that new thing that allows them to edit videos they're gonna edit genes how about those contact lenses where you can play video games and you're seeing like some that Microsoft made it stuff yeah I don't think they have that yet I think they have glasses so far but I don't think they have contact lenses yeah it's gonna happen if you could do it with a with a glass like Google ever see Google glass you ever put that on uh-huh who's weird what's that Google glass isn't around anymore they've got some new applications for it but what it was like was like a um like a glass frame and yeah this little thing in front of you like a little window like a tiny little TV that was sitting in front of your eyes but it's clear and on that little window you could see through it but you could also see like navigation directions and you get Google things and have it brought up in front of you like maybe seal shit yeah like some some movie shit but it was like the Internet like you're I know these guys your bros no they're not I have no idea who these people are I don't like drinking it yeah you need this yeah well let's not do it while the podcasts going on I'm just sucking on that thing and chewing it we need a spoon okay black helicopters um they're good though I like them you got a spoon or no Eddie Bravo will abandon you in the middle of a podcast for an I'm sorry cape shakes blowing up now their stocks going through the roof what were we just talking about this AR stuff the so this is gonna be built into Apple's new operating system just like you to read how big something is it's a virtual tape measure that you just hold your camera up to stuff and you can talk like they're regular showing that is how accurate it is um oh no real time measure but like let's see the tape measures are staying there they're measuring the size of a picture frame Oh diagonally and it stays in space if I'm saying if you get what I'm saying like yeah I do get 3d space it knows where you're modeling depending on even how far away you are from it and those Wow the other weird thing is by watching that showed the planet of the apps they just started on Apple music I think was in the first episode this guy shows an app that he made that I think Apple bought eventually they're adding into this operating system they're mapping the inside of every everywhere that your camera can take a place or shooting so inside here eventually will be all mapped and this guy said that he he would own the map that's why Apple bottom so now Apple's gonna own it so they're essentially gonna be able to have the inside 3d mapped of every and every building in the world or at least wherever and I didn't kill me with that thing but uh it's built into the phone so there's other cool stuff to this so they can map everything just based on boogies eventually yeah like so something came out about Roombas like the rumors are currently at the inside of everybody's houses and apartments and and I don't know what the hell they're gonna do with that data but people got scared they're gonna sell it to someone it can be good you know what I mean how is that gonna be good we're doing this to protect you how it's gotta be about protection necessarily but it could be used these guys have dollars missing it could be useful it's not the same people Eddie yeah I mean if Jesus Christ making these things people as the Illuminati that run the government it's gonna blind people these are technologists these are people that are creating the greatest stuff yeah it's okay yeah I mean this is not the Illuminati making this stuff Eddie this is this is technologists as Apple yeah the apples not the fucking Illuminati I didn't although Apple did get in trouble recently do you know what they did in China they they made a deal with the Chinese government - to take apps down from their app store that allow you to circumnavigate their censorship system people are very very upset at them because what essentially is they're saying that these apps are illegal in China so they're not allowing them on the Apple Store but they're illegal in China because they allow them to get away from government censorship so government censorship has a certain lockdown on what you're allowed to look at online here it is Apple removes apps from the China Store that help Internet users evade censorship very disappointing to people because they feel like Apple kind of like feels like maybe they have to do this the New York Times trying to get us to pay how dare you New York Times no one's paying for articles online just stop just stop with a fuck pays for articles online who gives newspapers don't you ever get one if you're in a hotel and they offer you the USA Today just see what the fuck the world's pay attention to USA Today that's like this the CNN M newspapers if you had a guess like what percentage of people actually read the whole USA Today every day two percent no way less than one yeah less than one okay for sure a hundred percent but I was just making a point yeah well that's it's just like a entertainment news for the world you know that's it's like it's like very surface yeah I mean it's just you're supposed to get it at a hotel like what's going on oh we won the football game who do you think about that other rooms of Donald Trump and CNN what what I think was crazy was it CNN went and found the guy who made the meme and put it online and they scared him gangster right yeah like what are you doing him blackmail but what how crazy is that like you don't think that that's funny is that we were saying like he was in the WWE you know Donald the WWE yeah you knew that that video is available and they put a CNN thing over your face you're actually mad at that you mad at that you're not mad at the six point five trillion dollars missing but you're mad at that that seems pretty fucking crazy to me that seems pretty crazy to me you're gonna go after a guy who made a comical meme about the president body slamming it and made him apologize publicly dude how many memes are there of us sucking dicks there's got to be thousands right it's like the golden rule of the internet if there's a photo of you online somewhere someone has photoshopped a dick in your mouth yeah and now it's gonna get even crazier there's a lot of ones there's probably at least 50 gay you showed me the one you showed me of you and me in a wrestling statue where the dudes grabbing the dude dick yeah yeah Photoshop Steve but I mean what in my point is like that they would get so mad at that that they would go after the guy who made it that sort of reinforces the side of Trump like people don't get that they don't understand that if you you you have something that's comical right like that meme of Donald Trump's slamming CNN and then you go find the guy who's just joking around made a little animated gif joking around put it online thought it was funny everybody got a laugh you know I smash in fact fake news ha ha ha ha and you go and scare that guy you go and scare that guy what are you doing what's going on you know what's scarier your CNN what's scarier than that is that there's still people that watch that shit every day yeah after that well after knowing that you're gonna still watch it and believe it the other thing was the story they made up about Russian contacts about uh there's like three reporters had to resign whose story that was on CNN they're like greatly exaggerated I think CNN is they just want to start shit I think it's not the money they just want to start shit I think it's part I think it's part of the agenda I think this is what I think dividers they feel like if there's an enemy out there and that enemy is the new president they think there's an enemy and they feel like they're going to war with the enemy and when you have a bunch of soldiers that are going to war for the enemy some of them do some unscrupulous shit like these people that got they had to resign because the story with Russia with the fake facts I forget what the actual thing was but CNN disavowed their article pulled it down removed it whole deal three journalists leave in CNN after retracted article CNN journalists including the executive editor and edge of a new investigative union have resigned after the publication of a Russa russia-related article that was retracted so you can go into details if you wanted it you know what it seemed what if would have seep the CNN Donald Trump feud is like Pro Wrestling what if they're just laughs and they're just slinging shit back and talking to a guy the other day thinks that he thinks it's all about setting up China he said it's all about us going to war these other countries he thinks is all these distractions are happening and that's what's in positioning North Korea and China on the side of North Korea you know it's crazy about North Korea the most they're the most demonized country on the planet oh they're always testing missiles or testaments it since the Korean War you know how many countries they've invaded and killed innocent civilians zero how many countries have we invaded and killed millions of civilians like twenty or thirty since the Korean War but they're the bad guy they're the bad guy they're not invading anybody they've never invaded anybody we invade people all the fucking time and kill innocent children come on there's a big show going on there's nothing don't get that's true but it is a dictatorship like what's the scary dictatorship there I don't control no no it's not it's not the people have been there studied it no one disagrees Eddie I think they have ultimate control it's a pretty country yeah they're all imprisoned by their own will show I think it's for sure there's no show that's Eddie they do they do and it is scary the but their minor league problem in comparison to a lot of other problems you know one I don't believe that because CNN pushes it so everybody pushes it anything I think it's I mean there's no one out there that's saying that North Korea is not a military threat or they're not some sort of a military dictatorship I think it's a distraction oh go in on it I don't think there's that many people out there I've never invaded anybody we've invaded already country but this guy's a psychopath that's running this whole country in 2017 that scares the fuckin CNN says he's a psychopath so we got our michael malice does is an author that I had on the podcast that wrote a book about kim jong hoon and you know he was describing as an owner ill yeah no that's the young guy king kim ja-jeom's and dad about the dad which one is the kid the new one the new one okay so it was chick kim jong-il but it's called dear reader it's a very very good book and interesting and find out how fucked up it is over there it's a system that's set up so that everybody is imprisoned by it everybody tells on everybody else like they're set up to tell on each other like the people that are escaped and have left in gone to South Korea and they'll tell the stories about the prison camp okay people are born in prison camps over there Eddie I think their prisoner actors oh come on jesus fucking christ don't get mad because i say that was am i gonna get killed for sex a whole group of cut the whole country's a bunch of actors they're getting a check I think that preserves and they're forced to do parades yeah they're definitely prisoners Duprey exactly yeah I like the whole countries of prison that's what I'm sad they're not actors they're acting when they're being filmed the guys they're acting they're not that's not real they're not being a sincere they're acting they're forced to act they're prisoners but wait a minute do you think that this country is under the control of a military dictatorship and everyone's terrified of doing anything wrong you think that okay so they're on so you think that what do you mean by their acting though there's they're all terrified like how are they acting and what way they're they're acting like they're in love with Kim Jong yeah they're terrified yeah they all do that that's they well they were arrested they went to jail a bunch of people did for not crying hard enough when his dad died not crying hard enough like people did like six months of hardly come up with all that shit may they all he got a haircut and he made everyone get the same haircut look into that that's that's all that yeah they that's a fake story that everyone thinks is true that he got a haircut and he made every man in the country get a haircut or they get killed or something or get thrown in prison I never saw it so it's it's bullshit maybe did maybe that gangster high top fade or die those motherfuckers on their high top fade or die they don't have shit what do you mean and I'm nuclear weapons you don't think so well let's just bring you to Washington DC and clean up that's I'm just I don't really shit you know they're robbing trillions of dollars I think I think you should not believe in anything coming mainstream media anything if they're all pushing it then it can't be the truth there's no way it's the North Korea themselves I mean they definitely launched them say you don't believe it no who's they that's what they say that they and they're all it's all mainstream media so you think they're all in on it I think ejection I think there's some serious shit going on in Washington DC and they need that shit all their brightness they're sending out missiles again everyone's afraid of World War 3 it's too gangster what are you taking anybody we invaded 30 countries or 20 or 30 countries since the Korean War we killed millions of innocent people on some bullshit ass Wars and we're worried about North Korea it's true but I began that we're brainwashed or maybe they are a military dictatorship with nuclear power I'm very suspect mmm experts latest North Korean missile could strike Boston in New York City Eddie Bravo skeptical hippo face so I mean this this is a trap man yeah yeah it's got a beautiful haircut though look at that suit you know did you know in the Korean War we met in this mainstream news we made 18 cities disappear and oh yeah there's horrible booze well they made the Soviets get the fuck out the Soviets left and and after the Korean War the United States it was like what are we gonna do it that China says we'll take over so since the Korean War it hasn't been officially Soviets the Soviets officially left and then China took over they kind of manage it and govern it I think it does I think it's just like a little prison country that they used to these is the bad guy I think I would be surprised if kim jeong-hoon doesn't even live in korea because it's just fake videos if you watch the videos easily faked easily okay there's no proof of anything there's no proof of shit you're right they're showing complete video but it's missile going up oh I believe that after they still in trillions of dollars still we shouldn't believe shit a smart man wouldn't believe shit you don't even think that the missiles that are getting launched in the air real so all the people's don't really have missiles no I didn't say so that's why I assume they don't have missiles if we thought I'm talk talking about North Korea they've always had missiles that's what they tell you Delta Russian did the Russians sell them shit that's tell you what Chinese the Russians everything they say they who's they the same people that stole the trillion dollars stole the trillions are also running CNN everything it's all connected it's all connected definitely that's the truth they are it's all connected dude there's I don't think I can have everything connected if they're going back and forth with each other like look what's happening between Fox News and CNN right look it's like look at the internal battle gets faked w/e Republican and Democrats it's a fake fucking they're not really in competition with each other either they don't care who gets more ratings more money individually right individually people are worried about their own check in their own family so individually yes but at the top it's just a show and I don't believe shit coming from them too much faking six moon landings come on let me ask you this come on let me ask you this where do you think cuz one of the things that's happened for sure is as times moved on as technology it's gotten more and more powerful and the ability to you know do all the stuff that we can do now with our phones all the information that you can get like almost instantly with your phone like when is it going to reach a point where no one has any control over anyone else because it seems to me that that's inevitable what do you mean seems to me that the idea of these big units of these big groups having control over mass amounts of people I think at a certain point in time if technology keeps moving the way it is more and more people have more and more ability to communicate you're not gonna be able to hide things they're doing right now and I think we're gonna reach a point in time where they can't do that look they could do that so much easier in the 60s they could do anything in the 60s it was easy it was so easy to fake deaths in the 60s 50s faked everything it was so easy no one knew shit it was Jack Ruby runs up on Lee Harvey Oswald just shoots him in the guts in front of everybody yeah this guy run out I'm with a gun in his hand they're bringing them in they go we've got him Lee Harvey Oswald we got him whoa what's that guy what's he doing running our way hey is that a gun bang he just shoots him right in the stomach I mean everybody I mean while he's probably not even dead that looks so stage maybe Lee Harvey Oswald ago do we gotta send you to an island how they shot that dude you can see the bullet hit him shoots him right in the guts I think there's that the elite have that no one knows about man that's what I think I would if I was the elite how would have some shedding oh we don't need to tell these motherfuckers everything you think they you think that the people running shit are like we need to tell the people we need to they need to know they they have a right to really think Clinton does like most of his days I think you just got a bunch of chicks he calls up hey I don't know but when you watch the Sentinels stroke and the resistance there's a I don't they may be bullshit but their son was the Clinton Chronicles the Clinton Chronicles is a documentary made in the 90s that you can find on YouTube and it goes through his career in Arkansas and in the Koch and all that stuff with the CIA Mena Arkansas Wow well George seniors vice president would Ronald Reagan at the Contra all that shit man there's a war on drugs that's a scam there's they're not trying to stop no goddamn drugs they'll bust the a Mexican cartel here and they're just oh just to say they're doing shit but they're taking all that money that I'm gonna say yeah we need to fight this drug war they getting all this fucking money just you think that it's just like the the moon and all the space shit I just was Bill Clinton's doing right now he's probably having a good time I think he's having a fucking great time right now to tell you the truth you think they got him set up two things you got like a sweet house and they bring them grapes and shit unreal is this gonna be come on it's a propaganda film huh it's not a felony if you're doing it for the good guys Wow yeah they're gonna they're gonna make him look really bad wonderful well be able to just say hey is a long time ago how can they make it look they're gonna make it look like we don't do it anymore he was being sent he was at Barry seals reserve he was a there's a trailer Tom Cruise lookin sexy as ever how does he stay he was a badass pilot he had his pilot's license at fifteen and so the CIA recruited him that's mainstream they say I recruited him he was a badass pilot whoo-hoo this who was the trailer is really good the movie like really good that's he's covered in coke and he gets out of a fucking plane covered in coke steals the kids bike Wow he crashed rounded a plane Phil how does Tom Cruise stay looking 35 what is he doing he's Scientologists but what are they doing they may be blood they like running like those little uh cotton gin looking things divers face have you heard have you heard someone Europe this could be bullshit oh no what but people like teens that donate blood old people are buying young blood and and getting transfusions and not in Europe it's here in Silicon Valley oh they're doing it for real you heard is your teal who's a famous billionaire tell me about that woody and they are they've found that if you inject young mice with the or old mice rather with the blood of young mice it makes them act like a young Mouse shit for millennia well it sounds like vampire shit forget about Illuminati it sounds like vampire stuff that's Elizabeth Elizabeth báthory stuff so they they are doing this now where they take like these young healthy guys and they donate blood and then you go there and they take that blood and pump it into your system and they fill your body up with young blood it does it work apparently it has some crazy like rejuvenating effect on you so let me ask you this okay people people freaked out when you say hey the Illuminati they're kidnapping kids and bright and and torturing babies and they want they want it they want to scare the shit out of them because they wanted Rennell eyes blood and they're poking holes all over analyze blood apparently if you scare the shit out of them the adrenal gland flushes into do I have can I just talk I don't know if it's real I don't know if it's real but apparently Adrenaline's blood is the most potent so they scare the kids and they kill them and suck either they drink their blood that's a conspiracy theory that's a conspiracy theory but we're already seeing this with we're being well being slowly getting well if team is good for you for old people I bet some billionaires gonna go what about fucking toddler blood what about that shit what about newborn baby blood I bet they're thinking think about stem cells the thing about stem cells getting placental stem cells we think about all the kidnaps or embryonic 800,000 to a million kidnaps a year so you think they're just taking babies and using them to maybe make rich people stay alive forever would if you were rich in fucking that psychopath can use a respirator to artificially engineer a bunch of headless kids and you take the blood out of them they don't even know you got it if teen blood is working right don't you think baby blood would it would be it wouldn't be a shocker if you found out that baby blood is the best right I wouldn't do this would that be a shock is it immoral to have a warehouse filled with headless fake kids they don't have any had they never did have a head they were engineered with CRISPR to have no head and you have them hooked up to this thing and they're letting blood into these vats and you go there and they tap you and you have to like look up and recognize these artificial people it's gotta be real blood it's a real blood they're real people they just have any heads so they never have a chance to be alive they're connected to some machine is this a movie no probably the matrix but but but we already know teen blood is helping old people I think it's 25 year olds what they sell for No so it's so based on the fact that teen blood is better than getting like a 50 year old blood right right yes so then they're saying toddler blood would be better than team blood maybe you're right here's the other thing that goes the other way which is even more fascinating they took the blood of old mice and they put it into the young mice and the young mice started acting old we just kind of fucked Wow like there's something in the blood and they're trying to isolate what it is of course it like it just makes sense it's easy to believe like yeah young blood is probably better than old blood yeah it's probably better yeah and that's what where everything comes from it comes from the blood everything blood is this cannabis reverses aging process in the brain studies suggest researchers restore the memory performance of math Uzi Suseela mice to juvenile stage whoa - two-month-old whoa yeah using a cannabis active ingredient whoa that's crazy treatment opens up new options when it comes to treating dementia now imagine weed was what you needed I just hardcore edibles we need to act ask Joey some questions he does have some stories we know for a fact that cannabis basically like 90% cures seizures and kids and even in animals yes even a dog dogs that have seizures you give them some cannabis oil but let me ask you this why does it fuck with your memory how come one more high we're like what the fuck was I just talking about my theory is this it's like there's a difference between forgetting something and miss placing something like when you go out to Vegas and you get hammered and you black out there's no way someone's gonna say anything to you that's gonna make that memory come back of this or that makes a dude and then you then you grab her then you picked her up and then you told it get the fuck out of here you're like dude I don't remember any of that you lost your memory even them reminding you and telling you about what happened there's you lost your memory but now when you're stoned and you got all this shit going on you there's you know weed makes blood rush to your head so you got so much shit going on shit gets misplaced you forgot what you were talking about but if someone reminds you of what you were talking about yeah okay then you're back on track you definitely better than booze in there yeah because well there's a difference between actually forgetting something and not remembering at all it just complete you did it you were drunk you did it you don't remember it there's nothing anybody can do to bring it back they could tell you all about it you could watch it on video it ain't coming back maybe the memory were you watching the video will stay in your brain but no memories of it's never coming back with weed you're talking about all this shit you're going up it's you start you start digressing and moving to this and jumping all over the place to go what did I just say right if someone reminded you it'll come back it wasn't like man I don't remember ever talking about that you were just talking about that no I don't remember that so it's different I forget sometimes what I'm talking about but I don't forget moments or instances or fat if you were blackout drunk you or I you would yeah caveman coffees those little things yeah everybody has gotten those moments where blackout yeah where or just when you know that like you're not seeing things where other people are seeing them like where where how like that's why I understand how anybody could do like like ketamine like people that do like recreational ketamine ever done it never done it either but it's scary you go into that k hole to talk about it wouldn't sound good k ol doesn't sound good that doesn't sound good to me I don't want to do that it's some sort of animal tranquilizer right now something you know what is thank you what is it called K hole if it was called wanderlust if something was called wanderlust I'd be like let me try it yeah but they call it a hole after they've been in it yeah it sounds horrible it sounds like darkness I don't want to go there I never has a desire to do something it was gonna put you in a k-hole fuck that like acid not into it we did that acid podcast with Joey hmm I didn't think I can go that was the only guy not on acid but Ari was on acid Joey Lee it's fucking hysterical I wasn't I was like ah you gotta change the name you can't call I'm not gonna take anything called acid that fucks me up that's hilarious anyway should have called it something else they should so I think just call it QT love ya want some QT love ya yeah yeah I'll take some QT love what's it gonna do just make you lose the jelly would drop some as he didn't give a fuck man yeah Joey's he's down there he's gangster that's the most renowned killing it everywhere - Joey's been doing a lot of travel he just sold out the Borgata casino in Atlantic City that's not yeah he wanted to come in and do a podcast to promote it he's like I've got a promoted dog it's already sold the fuck out everybody's killing it it's kind of crazy crazy to see how hard they're killing it on the road Joey's podcasts killing it to him in the Comedy Store holy shit that's young is thriving yeah just back in the day they had so many like hidden bars back there then it was like collecting dust spider webs everywhere now all those back rooms are being used like the old days it's insane look I've never I mean I was hanging out the Comedy Store all the goddamn time with you for like two or three years straight you come pick me up man I come out your car either like like the baddest car on the planet is like just waiting for me I'm out front and now those moments you know the reason I bring that up is last night after EBI me and my wife drove through my own neighborhood and we went down my street I got out of my car I parked right in front my house and I got on my car I just wanted to look at it again I mean I was there for like 15 years and when I turned around and walked back to the car dude when I went back to 2001 where you'd come and pick me up and we drive to the comedy store dude I had that vision that was just last night man it was it was it was insane it's crazy dude that all the goddamn time and the comic store the way it is now holy Sh Tuesday night selling out its fuck that sound almost every night sometimes I'm in the main room was rarely used it was just all about the olhar was struggling it was struggling and then when you left and you had that falling out for for a while then dude darkness and then you come back boom it's it's like it's like Jesus is doing stand-up there now you know what I mean it's so packed and everyone loves it and there's lines outside it's nuts it's weird right yeah it's weird to see because you get to see it in the dark days you got to see it when I first started going here which we weren't getting a lot of crowds no just a no are and it's not rarely so yeah it took like a few years of me going there selling out sellouts weren't happening back then not man maybe if Dave Chappelle came by and did like a set or something maybe everyone talked or maybe on a Friday night it was sellout or a Saturday night in the oor yeah but just the o.r not like both of them you know anybody rare yeah yeah and now it's nuts and every but all the manners like hey leeet's this is all insane it's a beautiful thing man it's crazy it's the internet dude the Internet in that open that fucking place out yeah it's always been a big for text for crazy people - yeah there was something about that place that guy was there last week Robert a poem opera is named the wee Robert William a provide the lead lawyer I'd like to talk to him like is it fair doc you

some some sort of issue he walked that's that the documentary right now getting into that dude you know that dude would do he would put on a jacket and then he would put he was like stuff the jacket filled with plastic bags and walk in the rain he's like sort of a homeless kind of comedian who shows up place where he sleeps yeah he's got a place and he's been at the Comedy Store every week forever every week and he's always there and he's by himself no one usually talks to him right Curtis it's nice guy and he's all his jokes are about marijuana does he have good ones they're not bad they're not bad oh so he's a super weed guy yo yeah it's all about weed everything's all axed about weed what I didn't know that you didn't know that I didn't know that I never wears his whole act is about marijuana what does he say like oh you'd have to go then watch watch i wouldnt want to do his bits but yeah it's all about weed that's crazy my Thursday like he was a lawyer there's this

laundromat just I let her live there you know she's this a homeless person she was really sweet good she's uh she's there all day clean it up and watches I got free security she's nice I'm not gonna throw her out and she's helping everybody everybody loves her and then they did a documentary on what she's you know her life it's pretty fascinating man Zach Galifianakis take has been taking he's known her for years well because she's like in Santa Monica and back when he's a struggling actor he met her at the laundromat and he became friends with her he takes her on red carpet premieres as his date hooks are up there never really there they have a close relationship that's he takes her to legit red carpet big ass movie premieres that's hilarious yeah his accent interesting guy man he's

him out try to keep an eye on them don't do anything nuts really easy he's not doing stand-up anymore was this remind me the story just her dealer did I look in this video up it's not brand new which I thought it was brand new this lady was living in this guy's attic for a couple like I think a year was the way he found out is he put a camera in because he was finding food missing from his apartment like in his kitchen this lady was living in his attic and climbing down when he was gone to like take it take a shower I think it was a year I want to say it might have been a little longer it could have been a little less this is like 54 years old this is like that movie New York what's up we had this little stool there starts with the pee no it's a paranormal activity all right this is crazy this could be faked so she doing this while he's asleep I think he was gone at work she probably don't want anybody to know they she's pissing in my sink what the fuck oh my god she's sitting there in his dad this is his whole apartment that we're looking at this is just like this kitchen you just put like a still camera in there when he went to work to find out what do you know I'm gonna baby him I'll offer this is happen tonight maybe this is a 10 whoa hold on we keep going with that keep going that where is she how did she get up there like she went back up yeah exactly how did she get back up yeah where did she go that's him right that's him where's there she is okay so where's she go dude this got to be fake no way she could get up there let's find out how she does it oh she airs him oh shit oh she hears him coming in and she runs and hides oh yeah my been in middle of night oh my god he got up in the middle of a night Jenna hide oh how is she gonna get back up dude how was shooting it back up that's been doing it every night so it's like but let's see it lets see it dude that is insane so he leaves that she comes back that's it there's no shot of her going back it is just right there okay let's see that Oh oh shit it's real - she lives in his attic that's insane that's so creepy let's say the next morning maybe she'd say the next morning didn't say that the very end of that video does it very same how do how long she was up there for like how long had it been go like right when she pops up go right back to that video please and right when she pops up into the attic area go a little bit further back before when she scrambles up fine when she scrambles up in there I don't see it yeah yeah okay him so him the next morning and does he check the video and find out fuck man you know how creepy that would be if you're sleeping in the house and someone's in your goddamn attic and they climb down while you're while you're sleeping they make themselves some food and they climb right back up there it's like a little human rat what's your name and how long does it say how long she was up there for do they know does she admit it she in jail she insists it's actually her house he knocked and found a dark haired woman who said that Jimmy was letting him live there he called the police but the woman fled before they arrived wait it's not unusual to what he'd go back up a little bit it's not unusual Oh was it say but one man was shocked to find a woman I wonder how often that happens it's not unusual to find unwelcome bats or termites in the Attic but one man found a woman Jesus Christ what is that so she had like a little spot up there if you look this up - it's this isn't an uncommon stories happen a few times to other people oh shit they're just living in their fucking house well there's a lot of homeless people that eventually become squatters that's a big problem with people - someone just set up shop in your house and start living there and cooking and bringing food home and they change the locks and then they say this is my house and then you have to you have to actually figure out some way to prove that it's your house then you didn't send it you know rent it to them or that you you have to figure out a way to kick them out dude you just kick their ass someone living in your house you're gonna fucking try to go to court if you look let's say this side kick right in the throat not maybe me but what if what if what if you're a guy that has a house in Big Bear okay okay and you're not there very often and then you go up to Big Bear one day and the locks changed and some guy's looking at you the window can I help you and you're like this is my house the fuck it is is my house you're like what are you talking about why are you in my house what'd you do to my locks like the guys just squatted dude you come back with some friends and you just fucked fuck this dude out he's got a gun you come with gun he calls the police the police show up and the police is like you're breaking and entering like no isn't my house I know he lives here possessions nine-tenths of the law this gentleman's inside the building I always heard that from kids possessions nine-tenths of the law what what was there a fucking percentage of the law is the law the law possession is nine-tenths of law is that real what that's how it's hard to say what I would do I saw something about it I'd let him have the house some woman bought a house and right when she was about to move in some woman had it just moved in and she had been there for like two weeks and she changed the locks and she was like someone leased it to me online like she said that someone online like was leasing this lady's house is it a scam or is it real could be a scam on both sides could be she's lying or it could be someone ran a scam on her and got her to pay rent for a house and she really thought it was hers could be right mmm yes true totally was I think I was fooled what Eddie called this video out that's properly being fake I think which video did that video the lady in the apartment oh yeah yeah fake I found a story apparently and people are adding this video to that story so yeah this of another side I just said that it was a marketing campaign for a rental website the Daily Mail UK put out a marketing campaign how would they use that to get business so this video is fake it's a marketing campaign Oh interesting my campaign for what goddamn fake news man real fake news calm go watch that shit that's just like Blair Witch so much or shit I believe Blair Witch the first time I saw it I thought it was real did you ever see the Bobcat Goldthwait Blair Witch style movie he made a boat when move about Bigfoot Willow Creek it's a Blair Witch style Bigfoot movie this is good pretty fucking good shit if you want to get scared Owen said it's the idea is that all those people that go missing in the forest that's one thing where people go missing that's legit like a ton of people go missing every year in the national parks national parks and forests easy easy to pick them off there that's good if there's a market for it you don't think there's guys out there trying to make money I think they're getting eat my animals people are there in deep woods and they're falling down and breaking their leg and getting eaten by bears and shit yeah for sure there's a lot of that there's a lot of when you have someone that like if you're in the business that's a good spot get people camping you'll never see it they're never gonna investigate they're gonna say a bear took them yeah that's your business that would be if that was your business go what's the easiest way right but bears no captions get people I know it's that guy that guy's perfect kid just got jacked the other day woke up in his tent to the sound of his skull cracking cuz it bear with biting down on a skull oh oh how often do Everywhere's kill people every year every year every the United States yeah every year someone's getting killed how many five a couple for a couple two three not that many you know kid got killed at Rutgers and then the most recent one a kid got killed he was in a road race in Alaska it was racing like some --trackevent and he was lagging behind and he saw a bear and the bear was going after him he's like he called his mom up said mom is a bear following me and the bear jacked him dragged him into the woods they had to kill the bear the bear was like hoarding like covering the body like protecting it oh they found the bear at because the mom sent someone out yeah they found the bear the found the bear guarding the body like it was his he was gonna eat it how much did he eat at that point whatever he could get tore him apart though mmm it's not a good way to go no how about that documentary what that crazy dude that's one of the best documentaries ever yeah grizzly man the way was set up to cuz the first half of the documentary who really liked that guy this guy really cares about these bears and all the sound bites that were using from the multiple interviews as they took were all stuff that were saying good things about him and you're like oh and then it's slow it gets dark this is this crazy dude out there who's crazier and crazier crazy yes time goes on when I love when the pie it was it a perfect sheriff grizzly man grizzly is it a pirate of the sheriff goes I thought he was retarded it's funny bears you can't be hanging he wasn't just hanging out with bears he was hanging out with him deep into the late-season we're the only ones that were alive that weren't in hibernation were the starving ones like he was in a danger zone yeah like most the time those bears like if you're around bears that are eating salmon you're not even in danger they're just eating so much salmon they don't want to try to chase you didn't even think of you as well yeah yeah there's an area that we was at the Kenai Peninsula that video that we showed where that huge bear wanders up to that dude it's not even trying to kill him doesn't even care because there's like 30 bears on the stream and they're all just jack and salmon they're eating so much salmon but this bear lumbers up and it's like the size of a VW bus it's so fucking big and it's too just sitting there and this bear who just walks over with these dead button eyes they have those black dead eyes oh they're so creepy I mean beautiful in a lot of ways but look at this thing look at this thing right up next to his lawn chair look at this thing's eyes there's just an eating machine that's what that is that's a pitbull times a thousand yeah it's a thousand pound eating machine and they look so lovable yeah of course they look like your friends in the movies that talk well what do you guys want to do teddy bears she would go fishing little fishing going on here and so this guy's hanging out and it just starts walking towards him I mean this thing is ten feet from him they're never eating a bear yeah you'd better meet black bear yeah what does it taste like like a pig fucked a cow nice so look at this this thing's just chew his nails look at those fucking claws holy shit the head on that thing that is an enormous bag from this guy this guy just freezin yeah I mean he was taking pictures he's a photographer and it shows it towards the end of the film video this guy was taking pictures of that River which is filled with bears filled with bears eating salmon and this is just a full bear he's full she says to the bear hey look at the most is that like code just noise just noise now look at that look at that look at all the Bears back back up real quick I want to see this look what he turns look at all these fucking bear holy shit there's so many bears so strong in this area which is overwhelmed by bears there's never been a death reported there they don't kill people there because there's so many fucking salmon that they just gorge themselves on salmon and just chill out but if they're hungry they'll fuck you up I'll just figure you out there like I think I can eat this dude and then once they eat you they well I can't believe I didn't need him before that was easy like that it's like we have this stupid idea that there's no contract we have a stupid idea like there's some contract between us and bears you know they're not gonna fuck us up well they like us we're cool most times bears are scared of people it's not a video event a bear and the lion fighting offshore right China or something if you got to put money on a full-grown bear grizzly bear or a lion what do you think I'm going with the lion all day yeah I'm going with cat they both got tremendous claws yeah I'm going with the cat he's more athletic yeah he moves better cats just fuck everything up they fuck everything up they fuck up crocodiles you seen leopards Jack crocodiles yeah Jaguars Jaguars grab great jack crocodiles I bet leopards do too yeah they just cats are just too fast the to mean they're the meanest of all the animals and they're one of the rare animals that only eats meat like they only kill things like what a bears eat berries what about a polar bear versus a great white shark I gotta go with the shark I think the bear will fuck up the great white I don't think he's gonna be able to fuck him up in the water they swim and they still swim that good they swim all right not that good oh this is a mountain lion what a lot mount line they're really fine yeah holy shit the Mount line is biting the bear in the head in the Bears like whatever bitch barely oh so it's a female it's a male bear and a female mountain lion that's guarding your cubs whatever they are in the face it's like let's make a killer video they just take this captured mountain lion and bear and then just oh that's better go at it I think that's real she's just trying to keep that bear kids because if you just have camera setup where you know mountain lion activity is do you stay away use a zoom lens there's a bunch of different ways I mean they've gotten a bunch of different really incredible encounters between animals just by filming hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours if you stay in the field for months at a time you see things like look at this lion and the bear those are some good camera angles look at this but that's a black bear see someone set this up that's a black bear and a lion that's crazy that's not a big bear that's a small bear in a big line how would a blind never know yeah how would how would they be in the same spot somebody put them together no no other way black lions are only in Africa yeah the players are only in North America this one at least actually probably they probably got some of those in Asia that look similar that looks like a zoo right it is a zoo what the fuck is that animal that's another kids with two lions oh he's about to get some oh he's taking a shit there's a bear in there too oh the bear gets let in later oh shit there's a bear right there oh fuck yeah what's going on here this is like some like a snuff film well they do shit like that in like other Russians yeah I've seen videos where they have betting matches look at this its bearing this line as well oh my oh dude that's a big-ass black bear they fight over the food that's why I'm doing over there just facing to eating something they're eating something this is way weird I don't understand it some I think they're just putting bets what about a full-grown chimp versus a tiger tiger all day really yeah I got with the cat you always I always go with a cat especially the cats bigger like a full-grown cat could be like 900 pounds plus tigers can swim right yeah do they go into water they could swim underwater yeah the tiger versus great white always a great white so much bigs Dilla cat there's a picture of I think I think a tiger surprise I think a tiger would take a fucking if they're taking out crocodiles great white they're not smart that's true they try to eat cages and shit I don't think they'd be able to do anything with it though I don't think it's too much it's like you know a real great whites like a thousand pounds what the fuck's our Tiger gonna do gonna swim with it in its mouth they figured out that you could swim with all sharks now the Sharks are like hit him at the right time or whatever you could swim with fucking sharks except for great whites but there is one lady who swims with great white sharks what is this she's like 15 foot what is this a 14 to 15 foot great white like in 3 foot of water off the coast of Mexico in this Bay I got a guy hit right here with a propeller but they found out it was feeding off stingrays it wasn't like beached or anything oh really oh fuck where's this business that's why I was there I wasn't there because it was stuck is it there cuz it's feeding off stingrays yeah if you watch the whole video the guys there wondering if it's like caught in a net or what's going on with it he gets real close here you can see this lit this injury on its back it got hit by propeller wow I'm not gonna show this online if you want to look it up on YouTube right here's some brothers winery films v yanked oh really - my views on right now it's yeah whenever you try to put someone else's YouTube video on your YouTube video you get yanked look at the scars on his back so y'all got he got fucked up by a propeller that's what happened that it also starts moving around - I think it's pretty dark Wow yeah size of that thing I don't know they were so dark well it's probably just shitty lighting or shitty uh that's scary as fuck that looks like this thing just an eating machine there's been a bunch of videos that are really crazy to watch where they take a drone they fly it over Malibu and you see these people surfing and just a few hundred yards outside of the people shirt surf and you see a great white water no we're in Malibu oh shit now really yeah that guy's in the water right next to that thing walking at it he got hit by a stingray twice in his foot one was like a six inch gash he said oh Jesus so there must be like a school of stingray sting like jacked his foot yeah oh fuck man what are you doing we've retarded get out of that kid step it on stingrays you fuck like you accidentally step on them right don't feel like bury themselves in the sand is there video of that drone filming yeah Malibu yeah pull up pull up great white spotted off of Southern California coast look at that no this is Malibu yes okay that's pretty close it's a couple hours up the coast there's a gang of them and are they great wave is one can they tell what's your shark there yeah they think it's a great white when they get real big there's a there's a quite a few videos that they're catching now drones one of them they had people real recently they evacuated the beach oh the wave it's right there it's right there with everybody you know what they should have those patrolling the beach should be the other one right now oh damn he has no idea isn't that crazy it's right there oh fuck he's just waiting down a wave and that sharks right underneath them dad are you kidding me fuck all that he has no idea he has no idea and what is that thing he's gone he's gone I bet them I bet you sharks all the time they were about to go on some surfer and then they take a fucking away but he saves his ass dude they probably are near-death often those guys are so gangster guys like Kelly Slater and yeah fuck that Orion jaws fucked it up for me man John I know that's brainwashing all that but it worked I was wearing watch this a movie yeah you know what jaws was about you know when it was that what the inspiration was well it's some real shark that was real shark attack in freshwater it's real crazy there's a there's a shark all of bull shark that swims from the ocean up rivers into freshwater and can get as far north as Illinois and then the most aggressive sharks they and they killed a bunch of people in a river in New Jersey huh yeah I think it was like the early 1900s want to say like the 1930s or some shit they killed a bunch of people in a freshwater river in New Jersey these people would be swimming hey let's go swimming all right everybody they didn't know shit back then and then you just get torn apart by sharks I think it happened where's that one Indiana side of the Ohio River the Indiana side of the Ohio River and they catch a fucking bull shark do you know how crazy that is that thing got all the way up the river in freshwater they're the only shark that we know that can do that and weird weirdly it's one of the most aggressive sharks I don't think we know of any other sharks that go up freshwater like that right isn't that the only one I think that's the only one to travel up rivers they have been known to travel as far up as Indiana in the Ohio River although ever been recorded attacks they're probably responsible for the majority of nearshore shark attacks including many attacks attributed to other sharks see if you could find the inspiration for the movie Jaws shark attacks in New Jersey because it was all in fresh water that's what it's fucked up about it wasn't even like the movie Jaws where it was actually in the ocean like these people had no idea they had no idea 1916 imagine all that people were like babies back then they didn't know shit they just landed on the coast of America 1916 how long you been there you know 1776 to 1916 s people just got there no airplane there a hundred years yeah it's crazy like think 1916 in 2017 when you sit back and think about it 1916 was essentially a hundred years ago 101 years ago and just a hundred years before that you got eighteen sixteen hundred years before that yet seventeen sixteen so it's like the beginning of the country just a couple of hundred years into the beginning of the country and that was just a hundred years ago great white shark attack five people near the Jersey Shore huh it's a different story unless they called it a great white shark and it was a bull shark is that mm I think that's different I think that's a different story there was a bunch of attacks on a river in New Jersey in the early 1900's I don't think that's the one I think that's a different one there's obviously been a bunch of attacks Spring Lake and Mott into Matt Swan Creek is that it row great white but I but the one that's a rogue great white huh that's different I thought it was a bull shark that's just what this says hmm what's when's the story from the story since 1916 or from 2012 huh well if it's in the Smithsonian you gotta think that's probably right I could have swore it was bull sharks though and it killed more than one person either way fuck sharks right yeah I don't fuck with the ocean do you go fishing no you're not into it now I'll probably get into it for my son I'll probably as he likes it but I'm trying to go way out in the ocean I have no desire and it goes I like watching it on DVDs and shit the deep and you know that the deepest part of the ocean like I forget what it's called Cameron where he goes down that submarine there's like a there's like a trench yes yeah I like sit like that there's a lot of mysterious shit that goes on there do you know where the best place to go shark fishing in the world is South Africa right off Catalina really dude it's one the best spots in the world that catch these giant mako sharks and they taste good you can eat him for us people get mad at you though that's a new thing people come out of you if you eat sharks if you kill sharks people get mad yeah they shouldn't be mad at that but they don't get mad if you kill like a tuna tunas okay but sharks are bad because people have been brainwashed into thinking that people eat shark fin soup and they waste the shark so then people start thinking of shark fishing like they think of trophy hunting I think of like killing lions or something like that you're just killing it for no reason you're not eating it for food you like nobody does that the Japanese do know they just kill them they kill them because they're getting in the way of their tuna production and they eat them too they have to yep really they eat him they make dolphin burgers really yep ooh seems wrong they trap him in a cove just fucking a harpoon of man thought when they were doing that they were just killing them cuz they were getting in the way of their - they don't we shit they're not gonna just waste that you know that's it have you watched I've seen a documentary it could be bullshit but seem legit but isn't it Fillmore's it feels weird right like eating us eating a dolphin seems fucked up and the Japanese like they were totally into killing whales all the time but don't they still do wailing yeah that's pretty fucked up right definitely they use it for all kinds of stuff right they would eat the whale blubber you know one of the things they do now they they kill whales under the false pretense of they're trying to do scientific research allowed to do some scientific research on whales so they kill a few whales and then they take those whales they kill and they sell whatever Bart's smart that's gangster if I was in the Illuminati I'd be like I'd green like that shit that's a good one thing it's Japanese fishing market that's always been doing that they've been selling and buying and killing whales forever and so then when these new environmental standards got reason they said oh yeah well we have to do a little research gonna do a little research perfect those that company or that group Sea Shepherd's you know they aren't they're the ones who bust people who are whaling in illegal whaling because otherwise you got to think you find some whaling boat in the middle of the fucking ocean think I'll beg the goddamn ocean is there's a boat out there somewhere in the middle of it that's whaling how you gonna find them what you gonna do they go out there and Ram these boats and they let me shoot like air guns or something like that Adam I like water water guns they do a bunch of shit to try to disrupt it and then they try to exist isn't there a TV show about it I think so whale warriors or someplace and they should be fucking whales and dolphins I draw the line yeah they're too smart house okay cows okay hey chicken not that gum have you seen those videos of the cows that they kind of loose yeah they're smarter than we think what about octopus also happy and you know some restaurants and you can eat about live octopus you just boil them we have to fuck that Italian restaurant they had it on the menu last night grilled octopus I've had it we've talked about it on the podcast they're smart they are smart fuck but you know what look at that they're smart it's gonna go through a whole watch it's gonna tiny yeah little tiny asshole right yeah where's the hole right there the hole in the wall I got obsessed with octopus videos for a while I want more I want I want they got a poor fuck NASA and 18 billion dollars put some more money into octopus octopus dolphins monkeys where is that thing going whoa just going through that hole in the wall yep right out the side of the boat Wow look at that shit that's an alien life-form I mean it might as well be for another planet yeah have you found that in another planet you'd be so excited she the one the guy released it into the water and I like came up and it said to count to thank him look at that shit it's hard to tell if they look at it piling out of that crack too slowly that head coming pressing it's a head the brains everything yeah don't why that has to worry about is the beak I don't think they have like a classic brain like like we think of look at that that's nuts to a little tiny hole and right at the end of it you scoop it over the net psyche he tried too hard but I saw it coming bitch it's crazy eat octopus yeah mmm I think they D does too I don't think there's some octopus attack yeah I don't think they're nice nor think they're worried that we're assholes and they're probably right but I don't think there's a lot of morals going on the octopus community do you ever see that one video of octopuses that were taken out sharks in an aquarium they had this big-ass aquarium I kept missing sharks they're like what the fuck is going on it's like someone's killing our sharks and then they put a video they set it up and if it's always the octopus always get busted with right there's somebody hidden camera videos they're like pet octopus is getting out of their aquarium oh yeah and going into another aquarium and jacking the fish and then climbing back in look at this do they attack each other must attack each other that's a very good question octopus wars I'm sure they have them right look how he fucks this shark doesn't have a chance it's a tiny shark it is it's like a toddler it still doesn't have a chance do you know that they feel like they're pretty sure that they found fossil evidence of enormous suction cups which would indicate that at one point in time there was a thing like a Kraken like an enormous hundred footlong octopus I believe that the price if I still exist probably right we don't know shit about the ocean well you see those giant squids right every sea knows yeah they're seen that one they found when they had one of those offshore offshore oil things what are those do they have it on YouTube giant squid what's that offshore oil rig alien squid or the biggest thing we found the biggest squid they found this fucking squid that one they didn't even know this thing existed until they had a camera set up and look at that fucking thing it's got like crab leg they found this enormous giant squid in the ocean they didn't even know it existed until they got this video look how big that shit it's huge it's like it has like yeah little arms I go back image Jamie and and freeze on it it's hard to tell we need something like a boat next to it or it's hard to tell how big it well they've caught them that they've caught giant squid now the giant squid used to be like a rumor they used to find dead ones occasionally stone them and caught them yeah it's huge man what it looks like that thing looks like an alien like look at his like crab like legs where it bends I wonder how smart they are they should do some experiments on giant squids maybe they're just stupid octopus are smart and they're just good for sushi they make a hell of a sushi tell you that I like squid sushi yeah like it you don't like sushi huh I don't like seafood at all you I like canned tuna i like canned tuna what about sardines no fucking waste about shit ever boy stirs hell no but I do like I do like black cod or is it black cod yes from the east it's like from racist I see what says I don't like white god it's black cod they serve it it tastes like candy I like that oh I know what you talking about you're talking about like miso Cod yeah I don't know what's me so I think it's called black cod yeah black cod with like a miso dressing so yeah a lot of Asian restaurants here and it tastes fishy like salmon I don't like that shit trout uh-uh really not into I don't know man very different I wish I was into it goddamn you she sounds so much fun what my show give me organ meat meat liver no so good for you how I want shit that doesn't remind me that it's used to be an animal I mean no desire that's why I like McDonald's go I know that should a meat would eventually but if you were out of farm if you were on a farm and the only way to eat was you had to shoot a cow and butcher it and grind it up how would you handle that could you do it I'd get used to it yeah used to yeah I'm sure I would if I had to eat if I was starving go vegan or would you just kill the cows what was the choice again go vegan no I'm gonna get all your food from the farm I gotta get up okay yeah like say if like we're in some like day the dead fucking nine had chicken night of living dead chickens Walking Dead zombie scenario to kill chickens chickens no problem no problem right no problem um you wouldn't kill I think God put chickens on the planet for us I think other animals right true that's a we do everything deciding chickens out there for the people and dogs and then God bullshit what the fuck these people you have a festival yeah who's eaten dogs how about the Indians think cows are sacred and weed and they must think we're fucking crazy well certain parts of India right what is that is it just the Hindus to think that I think most of India what do you think that's from just culture mushrooms maybe for sure oh that's right for sure yes so siphon grows out of cow shit only it only grows out of cow shit predominantly really yeah damn you can find it feel he's got a couple cows shit dude are you kidding you make your own mushrooms you can get your own mushroom so mushrooms make your own that's right oh yes you buy kits you know what I'm in your closet you're that conspiracy theory that that McDonald's doesn't actually use real meat you know some people caught it but some people believe it and well it's it's easier to believe eventually it's gonna come out that they're not they're using some other kind of shit fillers or whatever that it's not don't they already admit they used some sort of filler yeah but they're not they're not admitting that they're not using meat that McDonald's has never said we don't use meat hold on what and the McRib what are these at that same compound that they say is using yoga mats or something that fake rubber come come on yeah but but they're not McDonald's is not out there sand hey we don't use real meat they're saying a hundred percent beef commercials yeah that for about the they say hundred but here's a conspiracy theory is that 100% beef is actually just a name it's a trademark oh that's wrong I don't know if that's real red that so when they say 100% beef that's just the name of the company that makes the beat I read that that was that's it that's the ultimate mind fuck right there right yeah you know what they do well all they need to do is little by little saying yes we don't use we don't use first they have a fake meat vegan burger yes fake me and slowly tell people inch by inch that oh yeah we don't use real mean real meats bad for you causes cancer why would we're helping you we're trying to save you you'd want to eat meat I feel like that was shut down I think a hundred percent real beef was like shut down like that they were trying to make a product called 100% real beef what a sneaky fucking loophole what kind of lease are you shocked yeah no I'm not but what kind of a monster would do that create a fake meat and call it a hundred percent real beef and that was the name of the meat like you know what's your dog's name all my dog's names 100% real beef like just naming it right just making a name yeah that's so fucking sneaky is that true I don't know it could be it could be a myth she's did McDonald's try to copyright the term 100% real beef and use it on on patties that weren't all beef I think they did I feel like someone did that I don't know if it was McDonald's but I feel like you're right I feel I wouldn't be surprised if it's true but it could be a hoax I remember it you know it's hard to tell what's real these days yeah like you look on Snopes but nobody trusts them anymore what is Snopes I can't trust fall okay what do they say about what's what's caused the rumor well Snopes as well we're saying what's false they're saying don't do this don't do it oh don't do it you can't wait you're hungry are you training again how's your back my knees fucked up it popped out again Saturday I don't know I did a seminar in Oceanside tempranos in Stroud side and if I could pop that again I was on the floor and then this was like I can't squat down for a long time because I was squatting down giving Kyle Bane a brown belt out there he's a badass I was giving him some rubber guard advice while I was squatting on the balls of my feet you know you're on the balls your feet and then blue out there and I swing when I stood up that's how I blew out originally and when I stood up the thing popped out I'm like oh yeah coming in I was in serious pain and then I straighten out my leg and it popped back in man some my I'm gonna need surgery because the doctor said for six weeks that happened six weeks ago and the doctor said make sure you don't do anything stupid on it for the next six weeks because if it pops out again my ACL was hanging on by a thread it's probably all gone now that's probably all gone my knees fucked out so I'm gonna need surgery I'm just gonna do it but meanwhile I'm just gonna lift hard I'm just gonna make sure while my knees recovering my upper body is strong as hell so did you talk to dr. McGee dr. Roddy McGee yeah I talked to him well they have a new way of attaching the ACL or they don't have to give you a cadaver graft anymore when did you talk to him before it popped out again so I need to talk to them again well this is what they're doing now they're changing the recovery times drastically because the old way that what they do is they take a cadaver graft right so they take a piece out of a dead guy or they take your hamstring I'm gonna tell her patella I had the patella done and I had to get to have her done what's better you think the cadaver but the cadaver that can get infected and then it gets real I've never heard of that yeah that's that's a problem I haven't had it happen to me mine was mine went super smooth I did all my rehab I did a good job at the rehab I was good it's great it's greatly my cadaver knee doesn't bother me even a little you had a co both ones both both holy shit yeah and you see what I could do with more legs what year 94 with the patellar tendon graft 2003 with the ACL with the common so the first one was done with the patella gram yes not a hamstring no and then the second one in 2003 was done to divert the cadaver and yeah and both knees are good oh yeah they don't pop out no did they pop out is that how it ripped before it slid out it well the first one fell I tore it kicking the bag I was tired I was doing rounds on the bag and I threw a kick and my leg was planted and it didn't my foot pivot I was just doing rounds I was real tired I was trying to push lock they went out exactly and I was 21 and I think I'd heard it before then I just didn't realize how bad I had heard it and I heard it again it popped like I felt it explode in the gym and then I went to the hospital and they checked it out and the whole deal and and I've eventually got it fixed and then the other one no you know what I heard it a couple different ways but anyway point is it blew out my second one that I got done it was in jiu-jitsu class I was in half guard I was on top and someone had to lock down sideways so instead of straightening me out normal like you know where your leg bends and extends at hyperextends it went this way like against the side of the knee it just was a weird angle and he straighten his leg out and it just pop up you get hurt snap like a carrot snap and I didn't even know it was broken I thought it was just really painful and then the next day I was actually walking around okay and I didn't think anything was wrong I thought it was just really sore and then I was moving some stuff around in my office and I just want the point and just fell out of the socket it slipped out gave out yeah just gave out no and I knew that feeling before because of my other knee and then you have to straighten it out and pop it back in no it did that wasn't a problem because it wasn't there was no meniscus tear on the right one the left one had meniscus tear as well remember one time I blew that out in class and I was my leg locked do you remember that you gonna drive my car driving your NSX stick shift nose grinding the gears your knee was tore apart you we're like you're fucking pissed driving you know cuz your knee and I'm fucking up your car and you're like what the fuck are you doing you don't you know how to fucking drive a stick I'm like dude haven't driven driven a stick and forever it's fuck sticks all about automatics baby it's 2017 of people who still got sticks what the fuck is going on all my cars come on man I love sticks how you supposed to text I don't know I'm kidding that's not a good joke yo yo yo racks protects desu yeah yeah yeah how many people didn't wrecks while their facetiming I saw some dude facetiming on the highway I've seen a couple of people do it FaceTime and while they're driving I'm gonna give you that sweet dick I'm on my way yeah that's incredible I love driving stick shifts though I prefer it I don't like it maybe you'd like it if you drove a sport why don't you why don't you get one of those engines that you crank like a 1910 would you like that control anymore if they made him you would get him maybe what if you had to start your car like cranking it yeah but you don't feel like there's some fun and shifting the gears like you know it was is my first car was a 1977 Pinto station wagon and I got it for $550 and it was a stick shift I always wanted the cheaper cars were always stick shift I could only afford a stick shift the more expensive cars had the automatic and I guess it was just I was brainwashed into thinking fuck one of these days I'm gonna be able to drive an automatic fuck this bag you will bullshit and I think it was just a mind fuck so once I was eight once I got my first automatic car my fuckstick Chevy just I had a bunch of automatics and then I got a stick shift I had a bunch of like muscle cars and then I got an Audi Fox it's a tiny little outie car it was a little front-wheel drive car and it was a stick shift it was like a zippy little car I mean I loved it I was like ooh I love like shifting the gears but it wasn't until I got my first NSX I had to NSX's I had the NSX in ninety five or six maybe 97 97 and then I had another one that I got in like 2004 was a badass car I love those things they're so different now now the new NSX is like this big technological spaceship thing I like it it's dope you know one I don't think so but it's a different thing I like I like the little cars that you can you're in control of like I like I don't like the like big electronic car that's why I like the Porsche is that things light it's light and you control everything you feel it you feel the road like like if you're in a sports car from me like a fast car you want to feel everything makes exciting you know I don't know maybe don't even like liver what was that you don't even like liver you're not you're not very different yeah oh no no I didn't like you sliced hearts there it is there's a no sex look at that looks incredible bishop it's already out oh yeah not only is it out they just released an NSX gt3 so if you want a race if you want to be a race car driver they'll sell you one of those and it costs a half a million bucks holy shit sup beast of a car man and the thing is it's a Honda I mean you call it an Acura but it's a Honda which means it's just not gonna break you could drive that thing forever those things will have unbelievable reliability as opposed to like say a car that my ancestors made you know you get something Italian good luck but is it really Japanese if they're making it in Mexico are they making that in Mexico don't they make Honda's in Mexico and Toyota's do that's what I thought I know they make some of them in America they make Nissan's and that's it worse really that's a good question right is it considered now we're talking about breaking down or oh yeah America there's a awesome American cars but yeah but if they just use standards developed by the Japanese and once they have standards developed by the Japanese like what is it safe for making them in Ohio Ohio oh that's right the NSX is being made in Ohio that's right I forgot about that that good or bad is real good from that's good in Ohio and what a good job as far as X as far as a reliability yeah you know what everything's automated now see that's the thing it's not like you're dealing with skilled craftsmen you're dealing with programmers and shit they're assembly line sure there's some there's some that was the thing about the Corvette factory in Bowling Green Kentucky like those people they put together those Corvettes by themselves like there's a lot that's going on that's animated Auto automated rather but there's a lot that's going on by hand look at this shit this is crazy they're making cars so what is this guy doing right here with this thing yeah what's happening here it's hard to tell what it is they're flipping the thing upside down oh they're working on the chassis this is the bottom of the car these things are just what they are now like that's what the car looks like on the inside before they put the seats in the drivetrain all that stuff but was these things are now look how it's all done by these Roby is someone controlling it real Tyler's there on a program it's good question I would bet it's probably on a program there's probably someone controlling it but they're probably just pressing start they probably lock it into place and this thing I mean the way it's stacking everything that's the things that they're doing now though I mean these cars are so precise they're so different than anything that existed like 20-30 years ago like this car it might not be like the most the fastest best engineered card in the world but it's one of them and it's just that the horsepower wars are so out of control right now that a car like this is almost kind of overlooked because there's so many insane high-performance cars now I mean there's so many that are zero to 60 in three seconds what they're doing now is just making these unbelievable spaceships that a regular person could buy if you have the money you don't have to be a race car driver you don't have to be like super qualified to handle this thing you could just get a car that's 600 horsepower four-wheel drive drives like a demon I mean you could just go out buy it that Tesla Model 3 it's like 35 grand right crazy yeah you're buying a fucking model T model 3 oh you're Bionic fucking spaceship like everything is automated this guy's using torque wrenches everything's all set to the exact amount you're supposed to crank things like everything is nothing's left to the imagination you know it's cool to make like old classics like a new version like the charger and all do Model T's and a new version those things are so like urgh anomaly clumsy and so poorly designed in terms of like aerodynamics and shit if you try to take a Model T on the highway that shit would just fall over like once you got to like make it right though but the wind resistance you're not trying to go fast it's just like like a Harley oh like a cruiser Yeah right yeah maybe I mean they they go they had those cruisers that those fifties type cars right like drag oh yeah what do they call PT Cruisers oh oh yeah that thing that thing's gross I drove one of those ones they were so bad it was like you guys just made a cool outside and threw the shittiest suspension you could it was so bad like every time I go around a corner the Ascend will like kick out and I took it on a dirt road and I was like I could fly off the side of this road and not being able to control this piece of shit oh those were pretty dope that was the Plymouth Prowler is that like based on like a 50s style car sort of that was created by Chip Foose he's the guy that did the design element of my 1970 Barracuda he's a wizard car designer guy he invented a bunch of different cool cars they had that thing the Plymouth Prowler and there was another one that was kind of like that too wasn't there was another one of those fucking retro looking things either you don't have kids if you have a car like that or your shitty father that's your weekend car what kind of car drive around the neighborhood or see you're super rich and you can do that every now and then you put it in your side garage that's the Thunderbird yeah I think Foose was involved in that too guys a goddamn car wizard yeah that's a nice one is that a falcon yeah that's a t-bird that's a that's a Thunderbird but it has a roof on it have they made newer versions of Falcons hmm I don't think so Mo's lost timing made of Falcon in the 60s look at that thing above it was that does that that movie from that movie Christine the one on the right the second one the right the red one yeah yeah what about cars like that maybe no that's a Thunderbird look at that thing what about new cars like that like those that look like the limousine that JFK was in right that's a Thunderbird look how badass that is that's like if you roll around on that in Hollywood like if you're some sort of rock star type character you got a goddamn and it's you're like look at me motherfucker look at me look at my white walls look at that thing and that is a slick ride go back to that last one Jaime that is a slick looking car what years uh it's a fourth Thunderbird right second-generation alone that means if I had a guess I'd say that's like 1960 something right crazy-looking cars like they figured it out they back then man they had just caught a design groove and figured out how to make these really exotic looking sexy shapes 59 Wow amazing what a car there's a lot of remixes possible here for Ford yeah I wonder did they do that or should they they did that to chargers and it was a it's huge dad slam have you seen the new for that got now the Ford GT the new Ford GT Jesus Christ Ford's came out with a car that's like like a super Ferrari looking car hmm let me say it I think it's like three hundred thousand thing yep that's a Ford come on time holy shit holy shit it's about goddamn time they could've did that a long time ago get that thing they should have did that 20 years ago Jesus that's see that's like whatever the NSX is 450 $3,000 okay it's not even a standard you got a automatic transmission oh shit the old ones they used to have a stick the old 4k dad the hell that's only three million bucks gold-plated one driving down sense why not if I had one of those I never had played and I would have liked 3d videos of my dick that like play all over the car it's like your hard dick is like a hologram on LED screens that are all over the car dududududu imagine if a dude drove down the street and he had a Bugatti with like the outside of the car was a screen what did they make all wandick thousand three million it's got 1500 horsepower ma it's a status symbol it's one of those things where people want to show everybody that they don't even give a fuck they drive around three million dollar car maybe whether it's got a gang of them hey ace hood has a song called I will go bid uh Bugatti I saw one drive by the Comedy Store once and everybody looked oh that's a million dollars that's a million dollars used to be a million now the three used to be that was a first the first million dollar car saw a million dollar car look at this my Bugatti is for sale for 4 million is that a hood that's Floyd me well dad's money Mayweather it's in the DuPont registry he's selling it for fuckin 4 million you want to be a baller want to drive around and form a wedge but if he does that often he slips cars are you kidding like an easy one it buy it for to sell it for for not only no that's a good move man it's a smart move right the cars are you kidding with social media he's his own corporation yeah no it's a smart move what's that he's pissed over lowball bids at his Bugatti auction look at his face he's mad 1.5 1.9 million dollar bid because the number was still much lower than Floyd was hoping to get I wonder what he paid for it didn't sell somebody offered 1.9 million he's like not enough whoa reportedly paid 3.5 million oh my goodness so he's reported he was expecting to make a profit and someone tried to short him but no same one though this is oh the white one the one we just saw is the black one oh okay yeah people can afford that or people don't give a shit about that well I think Floyd is just his whole thing is about just being the owner and baller guys guys that are into memorabilia they're usually broke they don't have that much money a hundred people on the planet could have could afford to do that you know and they're not impressed by having someone's celebrity you know what I mean yeah they are as more than a hundred okay a billionaire is gonna be gonna be tripping that it's a Floyd Mayweather's car yeah it's obvious that it's flipping it like they're too smart for that shit but if they wanted to get it and drive around let everybody know in 2013 it says they sold their 400 Veyron Jesus so 400 people babbu Gotti's yeah 400 over a million dollars Jesus that's a lot of money four hundred million dollars in cars well I wonder what it cost to actually make what than 50 bucks no like $20,000 to make okay let's guess website that shows how much does it actually cost to build a Bugatti I want to say $300,000 I'm gonna say because it's so expensive that the people making it will charge more it's probably gonna be $300,000 oh you agree with me what did you say I said wait a minute yeah all right perfect mo we'll see if we're right we'll see if we're both right I think that's a reasonable reasonable thing to imply shit it was they Volkswagen loses six point two five million on each one they sell what Volkswagen loses White's wait a minute Willie's know what they lose six million when they sell it for three million so it cost nine million to make they're lying now there's never no no you would never know I'm going over to Eddie Bravo side on this one Newman not Howard this is tower seven knows a comic bullshit called me Illuminati yeah slamming this guy a friend of mine is doing should be Illuminati the people get tired of talking conspiracy theories with you didn't get tired no they always want to bring it up and I usually it's a good thing tight good way for a young guy to approach you Eddie I'm with you in tower seven yeah I'm with you with the Flat Earth brother bro I'm checking out guys satellites you seem pretty freaked me to the guy a guy came up to me with his uh like twelve year old daughter and they're all like they're all in the flatterer twelve year olds and yeah I know do you talk about Flat Earth at school she goes now they all think I'm crazy I want they just give it the benefit the doubt didn't do it is it really that much money yeah 17-year low with European cars well there's lots of loss makers here's the biggest one says mmm smart cars those pieces of shit this one it's a vehicle for thousand dollars because it's the economy they could be going into like ik the development costs and like all the money they had to spend testing everything well VW is all fucked right now right VW's fuck cuz they got caught lying I think caught lying about fuel emissions or yeah mmm-hmm about uh the fuel mileage of their cars its emissions now apparently they'd just been lying about that shit for a long time who's telling the truth anywhere like when at that level at the super crazy high level well they're trying to sell cars to like how do we sell these cars people don't give a shit they're not just tell them whatever cuz no I don't study say no science report say just whatever do you have any desire to drive around in some baller car fuck yeah I'm not rips though I'm I have like one one 500 million of the money you know I'm driving a Tundra good car good fucking car I like it those Toyota trucks I got it for my English shit for my baby I'm like you know what I had a Beemer before that I'm like I'm not gonna put a babysitting a Beemer motor dies for Hank about the biggest tundra with the biggest cab the biggest world I could find put that baby seat right in the middle so he's if anything happens god forbid he's gonna make it you know what else they do if you're if you're into this they make side sliders on those cars they're they actually act as like side impact protection and make what do you call a rock slider so they they'll raise the car up a few inches and put these Rock sliders on the side of these cars they do it a lot with Land Cruisers and they offer significant side impact protection I need something that what cars have that what cars are the best but the best when it comes to accident accident I would say like a Dodge Ram Volvo is like known for that right they still number one they're known for being like real safe yeah lope yeah maybe over acceptable to you are they still they still make the strongest frames because basically that's what it comes down who's making the strongest frame it's not just that it's also like how the body responds to impact how it how it crumples how it uh how its engineered the best I'm gonna get that I'm gonna get that's my next car I saw this car accident the other day what is that no way number one top rated number one what car as far as active accidents result what wow that's great what about SUVs what about them I would say would have to be like a ram or a Chevy Silverado it's gotta be Joe Blow because that's what they specialize it that's their shit yeah but they're not as big like if you get look is that number one for SUV what about for a cup the number one truck what's number one is that number one what is it what does it say I'm gonna get it 10 safest out e howdy goddamn pop-up ads looks like Audi right there right what is that one that's the Audi q7 Q whatever the fucker that's q7 that's pretty cool car I've seen one of those before in real life as far as side impacts yeah I think they a lot of those cars are the airbags and shit now and they just they're pillars are designed to absorb a certain amount of impact and they give in with stuff too I saw a car accident the other day though at an intersection and it was a Dodge Ram truck in like some little peon Corolla ooh they head and head on the Corolla was destroyed man when I see people driving around with babies and tiny little cars and car seats like right next like right oh yeah it's right whoo scary that's a scary one man one little fuckup you know what's amazing sure baby think about how many cars are on the road how rarely they slam into each other most of the time people keep it together most the time most atomic oh yeah it kind of think the traffic kind of filters out bad drivers cuz bad drivers they're not gonna last they're gonna wreck so will usually we're left with people that have seen wrecks they're like you know what once you've been in a wreck fuck you're super careful you know my mom was in a terrible wreck lost all the front teeth terrible wreck and she since then this has been maybe 35 years she doesn't drive out on the freeway she's like scared of death of the freeway it was a horrible frequent accident and she won't ever drive on the freeway I've seen some bad ones I see some bad ones coming home late night from the Comi store cars flipped over smashed fucked up you know people are dead yeah it happens that you can get a football - any time any time look what happened to Matt Hughes man that could happen to anybody he got hit on to dream he got hit by a train he was trying to cross a train track I don't know what the whole story was but he got hit by a fucking train how's he doing right now he's out of the coma apparently that's good yeah he's responsive oh he should I mean if anybody's gonna survive something like that it's that fucking tank yeah you know guys a tank I mean most most people probably would have been dead yeah it's pretty amazing he was in a coma for quite a while man what's worse I mean getting attacked by a great white shark and getting eaten or well depends Karl comes back from the car wreck and he's like that dude from the dead zone he could see the future he holds your hands see you're gonna run for put all your money on John John's future right what does he just starts like predicting fights and he's yeah how come there's never that like they were they talking about like nuclear fallout how come no one's getting superpowers
