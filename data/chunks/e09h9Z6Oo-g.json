they get the oil what they would do is they would go to the sewer they would take raw sewage out of the sewer and then boil it down the way they'd make wax hash wax they'd boil off the sewage and whatever was left that's cooking oil that they would use it's super fucking harmful and then Selda like a lot of the street noodle guys yeah that face is what I made that same face they were cooking with sewer oil bro it was going around so it's not common but it was possible so it's not like that's the only way they do it no but the street places were like you run a risk here it's cheaper oil oh my god that source oh my god what is this China's food production of course give me some gutter oil making of gutter oil give me some volume Jamie Jesus Christ it's all in a day's work for this woman she opens up a manhole cover and scoops out as much slop as she can delighted by what she finds what others might view is revolting she sees as a bonanza she works in the streets at the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen a foot soldier in China's so-called gutter oil industry oh I seriously almost threw up slop sizes gagged she said she's made enough money to build a house for her family back in her home village of girls to the north people are just awful she's scooping out swamp eventually winds up in a processing plant like this one where it's combined with other animal fat refuse to create recycled cooking oil workers put the oil in barrels for delivery to restaurants coming quarantine Gordon how can you eat this if you eat it it can kill you cooking oil has long been a cherished commodity in China where stir frying in a wok is the mainstay of daily meal preparation the high profit margins from gutter oil production have proven irresistible Chinese experts estimate that one-tenth of China's cooking oil is gutter oil which has been found to contain carcinogens attend the toxins harmful to humans gee you think ha ha ha shit war is bad for you already knows and among street food vendors armonica production sites are often discovered after people living nearby notice a nauseating stench and alert your shit that's really cooking of food one police have arrested scores of people across the country in recent years for gaining more trade and seized thousands of tons of the material look at these guys fake drawing it's my eyes chopping out a little bit barely a swing yeah harsh penalties for producers of tainted products but many consumers doubt that China's dinner tables can be completely free of gutter oil all we can do is accept it in our current society everybody tries to swindle everybody else there's nothing we can do about Wow yeah that's a fuss gusting what that takes discussing to a whole new level I have never whenever you're pouring it from the bucket you hit up go get that soundbite no tap - I almost threw up uh I had a look away that's the first time I've ever had a look away on show like yeah that's a nice cuz you knew where is headed
