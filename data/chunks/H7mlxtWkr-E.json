the Joe Rogan experience how much time we have well I'm at thought you had some connection with these I'm gonna go north okay I'm gonna go to some wooded area yeah well you'll be fine I think the the moon I don't think is gonna happen right now I think I think you know based on some of the things that I've kind of seen online and you know that the chitchat and hearing overhearing conversations with with people that are you know part of NASA and those kind of things and they kind of go we've got 400 years and the planets done whoa 400 years yeah so if you think and you know for me I'm a pipe plan right Bronner that means that if it's if it's you know if we're not here in 400 years or when's when does that start well that started yesterday really I mean when you think about it there's natural resources and there's all those things that start to kind of fall apart and then weird disease to start showing up and mm-hmm weird funguses that take you out that didn't before well another thing to think is we have only been human for quarter million three hundred and fifty thousand years whatever it is there's gonna be something next yeah you know whatever it is it's coming right it's gonna be something that can survive this so if this stuff can figure out how to cool it so yeah it'll become so real and it might it may be a huge a tree I met a severely when I was seven years old he's completely stable yeah for sure who thinks the world's gonna end in 400 years such an idiot why did I say that out loud that's a bad thing I don't think the world's gonna end but I think it's very likely the human beings will be drastically diminished absolutely I feel like that's I guess I should back up that's my point the the thing that we just are so arrogant about is that we're somehow included in the future which is not included we're not included well we've been here for again 300 whatever thousand years right that's not that long yeah you know I mean even Neanderthals have half a million years before us right so going back to now though mm-hmm and us getting along now and surviving better over the next little bit going back to our like the people talking to each other yeah how do we you know how do we see this up somebody can take it and not ruin it with a reality TV show because they you know that every reality TV show you see it's been manipulated you know though yeah they'll they'll they'll poke the person then they know is going to blow up at some point so that it causes drama and again the dopamine dumping oh my god yeah they're basically doing clickbait in terms of how their programming the tone right so how do we how do we make this so that it's not an opportunity to make a buck and to do that like a genuine healing moment but if that would be my one piece of advice going into 2020 starting now pay attention don't believe anything you see until you prove it and that's part of the problem too right see now if we stop believing anything we see right but if I was a skeptical person right if I was a conspiracy minded individual I'd say but you're not this guy who used to work for the CIA is telling us not to believe the news wait I see what you're saying what I'm saying is setting us up okay well it's time for me to go yeah normal skeptical person want a thing like why is he I guess I guess I'm saying I'm saying it wrong because you're right I don't mean to say I don't mean to imply I guess what I'm saying is trust but verify right when when when you're looking at video of a candidate or you're looking at anything real shit on the internet now just be aware of the capabilities maybe that's a better way of putting all of this because you're right you don't want that part of the problem and one of the things that Russia does and and others who are involved in this whole propaganda effort one of the things they do want to do is undermine our confidence obviously in media so you know by me saying don't believe what you see I'm kind of feeding into that so you're right I shouldn't I shouldn't go that route be aware of what the capabilities are pay attention everybody should just be a little bit smarter about what they're doing that's all I'm saying so and also what we're looking at now is so much more powerful than what we had three or four years ago three or four years ago this technology was not available for the consumer but now it is well there was I mean you think about it if you not to get too deep but if you think about the photography how long is photography been around there have been efforts to manipulate photography right so so altering photographs has been around almost as long as the the medium itself go to Photoshop that kind of put it all in the hands of the consumer you know what you were talking about Face Swap the new face app to age people yeah all these things make it easier for whoever's got a smartphone to try to do this but what you're really and that's a problem as well but one of the things that you really have to worry about is against what are the state actors like a Russia I mean Russia was behind the face of Swamp Thing well yeah and that's a good face app right there are Russian companies that are pushing this technology out there and what are they doing you know you every time you do that it's recording data about you Whitney Cummings is here and Whitney Cummings - what do you call her what's your name she's like a little kid just repeats her name I'm Sandler oh that broken don't know why she heard his album name she's like series Oh what's your name was a comedy album - Adam Sandler's so she started rambling about it she really wants to chime in so you never gave her a name her name is bear claw whoa because I bear claw can you say hi people are like listen to this going what in the fuck is going on here do not smoke weed and watch this that what is here is when it's people that are just listening if you're just listening you

it and and it will come true you work hard yeah if you work hard some people just want to wish now you have to work hard there's a lot of shit involved yeah do you use any sort of a sports psychologist or anything like that no not really oh no just motivation my kids you know just a person that wants to do better is gonna do better right and so when you are preparing for a fight do you do you ever have moments where you you know you find yourself feeling down or you find yourself not yeah there's an to play now there's a lot of times like that you know because I'm missing home I'm like man I want to go with my kids I'm gonna go with my girl and man I haven't I haven't fucked or nothing so I'm fucking angry and you know stuff like that that's what a lot of boxers go through you know because this is a lonely sport you know this is a one-man sport and you know you got to do everything on your own and not on your own but when you go to the gym you have your team but you just after the gym is what you do you know I usually just rest watch movies trying to get a show on a show just relax we haven't had you know you're right we haven't had somebody's evil as the Nazis right right but they tried to make guys like that you know you know Kong Saddam Hussein bin Laden but that one was clear-cut like yeah that was oh jesus let's go get hit we're gonna stop this yeah this motherfucker when you see him scream in front of the crowd like yeah why would you follow that they're all high on fucking methamphetamines aren't they though let's say yes eat dead Nazis he was tripping any of him he's definitely tripping yeah he was rubbing his cane on his deck it weakened but a whole country's into that they're just like yeah this is our guy we're gonna do whatever he says yep yeah they didn't even know yeah they didn't even know like what it meant to have someone like him run a country back then how drugs like pervitin and cocaine-fueled the Nazis rise and fall Wow despite Hitler's anti-drug rhetoric Nazi Germany used a little courage pill called pervitin to take Europe by storm and it turns out it was pure methamphetamine why is perverts in methamphetamine hydrochloride who made that it looks like the fucking Germans did because it's yeah I know I'm saying like who like what company what companies making pervert in some Nazi company okay so they were just giving out everybody meth yeah hit of meth DUP country that'll kill six million Jews yeah oh okay it says still couldn't dick ditch an access power meeting so Hitler's personal physician injected the Fuhrer with a drug called Yuka doll think oxycodone combined with cocaine to perk him up so physician took a significant risk in doing so after all Hitler was prone to latching on to addictive substances and refusing to let go but in this case the injection seemed warranted Hitler was doubled over with violent spastic constipation refusing to speak to anyone immediately after the first injection and despite his doctor's wishes a revived Hitler ordered another injection Hitler then left for the meeting with the gussto of a soldier half his age okay so it was like yeah he was messed up man yeah oh I was taking like super pills or whatever he's faking liquid cocaine and meth and oxycodone Hitler reportedly spoke for several hours without stopping yeah at the meeting with Mussolini Hitler reportedly spoke for several hours without stopping the Italian dictator who sat massaging his own back dabbing his forehead with a handkerchief and sighing had hoped to convince Hitler to let Italy drop out of the war he never got the chance you never get a word in edge well my god so you imagine being poor Mussolini you're over there talking to Hitler he's method out of his fucking mind and you're trying to tell him look Italian we don't want to go to war we want to back out of this we would like to just uh kick it back good luck we you know we hope for the best and Hitler comes over all messed up [Applause]
