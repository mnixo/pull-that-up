expert ready boom all right we're live hello John what's up man hey Joe how you doing sir doing so I really appreciate it thanks a lot for having me man it's great I heard you on meteor podcasts and it blew my mind I mean I could not believe let's just let everybody know what this is about you were a game warden now you are a game warden right and what that normally entails is like you know you find a guy and he's got three trout when he's only supposed to have two it's normal stuff like catching people doing something they're not supposed to just making sure people follow the rules right along the way you guys started discovering these illegal grow-ops we're cartels were growing marijuana and you turn from being a regular game warden to essentially well once you let us know what how it worked out yeah Joe it was it was a crazy journey because you don't think of game wardens doing the type of work we were doing when it come to the the trespass gross and the cartel issue you know and what do everybody think they think anyone's check fishing licenses yeah check your deer tag RL tag look for too many you know animals poaching spotlighting and honestly when I started the job I got hired back in 1992 that's what I dreamed of doing you know I grew up hunting and fishing and I got my hunter safety certificate with dad's help at nine years old so I was all in the woods you know was there my church I just loved it because three generations of family my grandfather's career Navy my dad you know as an army guy and you know we just had conservation in our family you know for generations so I got the job get it I did all the traditional stuff to start came down here to Southern California to start my career in Riverside County so I was just over the hill you know from from LA here and working all the traditional stuff fishing regulations night hunting you know working deer openers is really cool to be a deer hunter for all those years and then actually go you know talk to guys on the other side and see all the good guys out there and some problems and then in 1995 I got to go back home toward the Silicon Valley that's where I'm originally from born and raised so live in the suburbs kind of the foothill areas of the Silicon Valley south to San Jose there and in 2004 I've stumbled into my first you know cartel what we call a trespass marijuana grow site and you know to specify this stuff now now that we're regulating you know the last couple of years here in California these are not sanctioned marijuana sites this isn't the legitimate industry that's doing it by the numbers and trying to this is always illegal these are always here you know on public lands destroying our environmental waterways and our wildlife and on private land as well and on that situation I had a good friend of mine that I grew up with that was doing his master's thesis at San Jose State University both of our alma mater on steelhead trout endangered species red-legged yellow-legged frog and all the aquatics and these two creeks and this was right below Henrico State Park where I really met my first game warden that was an inspiration to get the job so these waterways are really sensitive headwaters coming down through this stretch for like three miles all these endangered species in a black tail deer you know all these other great animals we like his conservationists they're thriving on this Creek and he called me one day in April and said hey John this is weird one of my two creeks is bone dry and all the fish the steelhead fry are dead you know everything living on this Creek is dead there's a bunch of like debris and plastic lining and looks like camping stuff that's down at the bottom of where this Creek feeds out so I get him in the truck and I figure I'm thinking okay someone's diverting water up there it's probably a rancher Nina for cattle operation whatever we go the top of the hill Joe then we start the hike down and I'm by myself you know I got my I got my rifle got my gear don't have any radio coverage don't have any cell phone coverage and I have an unarmed civilian my partner biologist with me and we're expecting to find something very predictable that I'd seen up to that point and that would have been a normal water diversion and when we found the water source in a beautiful Canyon I mean crystal-clear water trout Creek the whole nine start hiking down it following this we see the dam we see the water line about a hundred yards down this beautiful little Grand Canyon like Creek and there's much marijuana plants and they're short because it's early in the season they're only about two feet tall and we see two growers and they're not the growers typically you know that I would have suspected these guys are you know they got rifles they got handguns they got knives and they're kind of cruising working their plants coming toward us and that was that oh shit moment you know if something crazy goes down right now and I got no backup I got a civilian with me these guys are armed they're not your typical poacher that I've ever encountered and we didn't get seen we kind of hid out you know he's a hunter I'm a hunter we stayed you know using her stalking and stand to the creek bank and just just watched as these guys work their plantation and went on up the hill and I looked at this and where did we just walk into this is crazy we got out safely and that's when I started to bring in other agencies narcotic groups Task Forces the Sheriff's Office met you know started to learn other agencies in my area this is really on in the game what did you guys do about that one grow up like when you found it like how did how did they resolve that well we got a team together as fast as we could safely and usually it takes a couple of weeks and I want to say within a month we were back there now the interesting part was game wardens aren't known for doing this type of work just like you said at the start right so they're like well you guys know the area you went in there help us find it get us into the area but we're gonna lead the raid and will self course this is your jurisdiction we don't normally do this type of stuff so so go for it so we were the bird dogs we kind of guided him into the area we had like 20 30 officers we kind of let him down to the canyon got him in there safely we found the two growers we spooked them they didn't get caught that day they ran down the canyon nobody pursued some of us wanted to obviously because of the environmental damages but the biggest thing had changed the game for me that day was seeing the environmental damage so that was a 7,000 plant garden and at the time we didn't know about these ban toxic substances these insecticides carbo fearin that they're bringing up from Tijuana and transporting actually smuggling from across the border to put on these plants to keep everything living off of it not to impact their cash crop and that was out there in some extent but it was so early when we're really aware of the level of toxicity to this stuff and how damaging it is so was all new we eradicated that that garden and then when we were done eradicating it we had all this mess in the creek right we had camp trash we had fertilizers pollutants propane tanks all over in this beautiful channel that's now dry exes been diverted unbeknownst to us all that water was totally poisoned that they were diverting to water the plants that's why that Creek was so dry and we we eradicated everything and then it was like okay we're out of here and I looked around and went oh wait a minute man I know we got the I know we got the illegal marijuana out but what are we gonna do about all this environmental damage and nobody was reclamation the damage or cleaning up any of this mess so I the first thing I thought was we have a resource issue that's crazy I mean I've you know spent my whole career up to this point protecting wildlife preserving waterways for all of us to enjoy you know conservationist enthusiast whatever side of the fence you're on and nothing was getting done on that so kind of the light bulb went off a little bit that we need to do more to this if we're gonna get involved and we need to get involved in these type of grow operations because it was the biggest environmental you know train wreck I'd ever seen and I'd worked a lot of traditional gamer and stuff to protect those resources so once they had gotten everyone out and chopped all the plants up or did what they did did they try to reclaim the the creek did they try to remove the dam and get the water to run back again at that time no no one is doing it right and that's that's exactly really what really really kind of upset me and again we were new at the game we were the game wardens nobody really thought of us as mainline law enforcement or you know Narcotics Task Force guys or anything like that at the time so I wasn't gonna make waves we just wanted to integrate and work together we wanted to unify these teams and what I really wanted to do at this point is get back with my command staff and you know my bosses and go hey we got a big big problem out there man and right there's more of this going on and we need to be involved even though it's not traditional because we're sworn to protect our resources and well besides everything game wardens do that you think of from the wildlife standpoint or mainline law enforcement just like every police officer right we through the same training and then what people don't realize is we go through two more months of additional training and a really long Academy that's all wildlife specific wildlife forensics wildlife ID weapons identification all the things you really need to do the game or inside of it with wildlife you know in the backcountry so to speak but we needed to integrate with other agencies and kind of bring them into our world if we were going to participate so that one case started the change in me to try to build those relationships and get into tactics and tactical circles with some of these you know SWAT and Special Operations units that would go in and do this job under normal circumstances if that was just being diverted by a rancher so if a rancher had done that and the cake was dry how would you how would you fix that we would have got with him and it was what's called a stream adulteration violation and as 16:02 in our Fish and Game codes the section but and it's a very common section because water is diverted for a lot of reasons and you can divert water with a permit in certain circumstances but you can't completely denude a creek that has Wildlife thriving that's a waterway of the state for everybody to enjoy which this one was and if normally the case would be that they would have to Reeve just have the the flow come back to exactly how it was before so exactly the dam and yep that would be up to the rancher that would be up to the rancher would be part of a penalty you know it could be a civil it could be a criminal it could be a probationary fix-it your okay so this was no real there's no law involved or nothing in place rather just when you found these grow-ops like there was no previous precedent right exactly it was it was completely brand-new and this was you know one of the first grows I think that any of us have found throughout the state of California is game wardens I mean there are other guys finding some things and working but being from the Silicon Valley and being inspired by those wild lands to everything I became later and what I stand for it was home you know when it hit home but seeing that and getting to meet certain guys from the Sheriff's Department my first book goes into this whole learning experience of you know ad-hoc jumping in with other agencies and doing it is this the hidden war this was the first book war in the woods war in the woods yes so the war in the woods and then hidden war is the new one yeah hidden the brand-new one that just came out and they're basically 10 years apart and the cool part about that Joe is when you look at the difference as we do some major comparisons and what war in the woods covers is that chapter ones that first mission I'm telling you right now because that was like being here it is right we're not in Kansas anymore it was crazy the people at the higher-ups yeah that we're in charge of trying to eradicate the grow up and take the cartel the guys down what so there that was their job was just handling that it was just handling the the marijuana aspect of it right right and the armed cartel guys so there was no one in place that was supposed to take care of the waterway there wasn't that seems so crazy today it does it was one of those things that it was it was based on the fact that a conservation group like from an agency like Fish and Wildlife like us we just weren't involved where we would be looking at those environmental damages right right but from a narcotics officer standpoint you may see the damages but it may not register there might not be a you know a mandate or even objective to clean that stuff up and and back at the time DEA was funding all of our states and all of our county teams based on the number of marijuana plants we eradicated so there wasn't any recognition of the environmental damages and any type of funding based on how much reclamation and cleanup you didn't know I would change fortunately and we were that we were a big part of making that change fortunately but and there wasn't a lot of funding or you know point kickback or value to catching bad guys to catching some of these guys that were doing the damages so a lot of teams then were dropping in on helicopter lines cutting plants getting a big plant count getting funded for it taking taking the weed out and that was it so crazy like yeah I would imagine I mean obviously I don't work in law enforcement no but I would imagine there would be one person who would like detail plan right and I would think that well what happened well we found out that this Creek was yeah yeah okay well we've got to resume the creek yeah wouldn't that be like part of the plan it would and it you would think it should be right but it's all basically new territory completely new and so we're only talking about 15 years ago well which is really crazy yeah it was it was the start of a big shift in my career because I saw this as a big problem I also up until in 2005 we were on you know one of our first second third since third operation since this one we just mentioned in 2004 ending August 5th of 2005 the game completely changed because that's when we were involved in our first gun fight and that's when my partner warden who had trained in the Academy we were partners in the squad I had promoted to be the lieutenant for two and a half counties the Silicon Valley Santa Clara County Monterey part of San Benito 20 days before this incident happened and I had young wardens that wanted to participate and do some of the stuff I was doing with the other agencies on the marijuana you know operational front and this was you know right above the tech capital of the world right there in Silicon Valley in Los Gatos we were in really steep arid country you know August right before the a zone deer opener we were all gearing up for that and was three game wardens three sheriff's officers good sheriff's officers that we met on that first operation in 2004 I just gave you the story on and um they were in harvest time they were fortified they had heavy weapons like SKS is the ak-47 derivative sawed-off shotguns and they had the grouse set up where they were basically defending it and when we came in there was an ambush shot from one of the growers and that was the one shot the bad guys got off and unfortunately that's the shot that hit my partner through both legs and that bullet went through the right thigh and tumbled through his right leg then kept going through his left so he's down and we're trying to keep him from bleeding out of four holes for the better part of three hours waiting for an air rescue and we didn't you know nobody in the country from the standpoint of a law enforcement team had ever been counter-attacked by these growers we'd you know we chased him around they run away sometimes we'd find weapons oftentimes we wouldn't but so this was just a real eye-opener like what the fuck did we just walk into and plus my partner was real close to not making it and fortunately he did survive or I don't know that we'd be sitting here telling this story and talking about it but that day when I saw how well they were equipped the type of weaponry they had and the fact that I don't almost didn't come home that day I went okay this is super dangerous we can't do this as standard patrol Game Wardens we can't do this doing just the traditional stuff we should stay involved in it because aside from being so violent the environmental damage is Joe we're the worst I'd still ever seen and they just kept getting worse and worse the more operations I'd work in my home county right so we learned a lot from that there were a lot of tactical lessons there are a lot of team lessons a lot of things we could have done different and that kind of changed the game where we eventually got to what we're going to talk about a little bit later now since 2004 have there been plans implemented to clean up but also restore waterways and all the different absolutely yeah absolutely and so now there's like a whole they realize this is an issue and so there's there's precedent there's very much so and and that largely came from what we saw you know in those early years the 2004 first stop on down there on Dexter Canyon Creek and then what we had on Sierra's ol well my partner was shot in 2005 about then we started also see the banned poisons in these grows like the carbo fury on bottles and just to give a background this stuff is so deadly it was made as an insecticide rodenticide just to kill anything that you put on any type of agricultural product and it was made originally back and I think like the 50s for legitimate agriculture and then they found out how toxic it was an EPA banned it from use or even possession it's a felony to have it in the country and use it anywhere without special licenses through legitimate channels here in America and they ban it like 15 years ago because it was so nasty but because it does keep everything off the marijuana plants I mean nothing can even get near it without dying almost instantly they still get it in third-world countries they can get it in Mexico and it gets smuggled across the border with the grow groups the drug trafficking groups because it's so effective regardless how poison it is and we were starting to see more and more of that stuff as we were starting to ramp more of a specialty to do in this job more you know thoroughly and safely and get into the cleanup this is one of the many things I brought this up with Dan Crenshaw the other day and I talked about you and because he's against federally getting marijuana federally legal and I said one of the problems with it being illegal is this and I was explaining these grow-ops that for the rest of the country where marijuana is illegal right the vast majority like what was the number that you said the percentage that was is grown in California that's illegally sold through the rest of the country 7080 percent so 70% of the entire marijuana population or marijuana product that you're buying if you live in in place like South Dakota wherever I don't even know it's legal in South Dakota wherever it's illegal right they're buying it from here exactly and it's because one of the reasons is because our state laws say that well first of all we're close to Mexico so the cartel members can come up really quickly right and then the other problem is that our state laws one we made marijuana legal recreationally here weak severely lowered the penalty for an illegal grow-op it became a misdemeanor correct that was the that was the thing you know when when we started the the department's special team that the SpecOps marijuana Enforcement team that hid more goes into part of my job is being the co-founder of that and the team leader was outreach so I was speaking to legislative groups before we legalized under Prop 64 and then the tighter medicinal marijuana laws that came about that same time and I was talking to anybody conservation groups that you and I would you know be part of preservation animal rights groups high school kids you know it assemblies right watch out you know if you're using weed make sure you're not using this stuff because it's so nasty things like that and my whole point was if we're gonna regulate guys we see it comin let's just regulate smart let's not lessen any penalties for the trespass grow that the cartels are doing in our public lands and private lands and also the other gang groups and there's there's other groups you know to a smaller extent but unfortunately when we did regulate and all that was passed two years ago they did water it down so publicly and cultivation went to like you said a felony to a misdemeanor and if you're a juvenile cultivator on public private land and one of these juvenile you know cartel members and there's a lot of young ones learning it's a it's an infraction and that took a lot of assists away from that part of the problem and left us out there basically alone with a couple other agencies to fight it well for the average person that would sound before you knew about the cartel grows that would sound like a good idea well hey if marijuana is legal what's the problem what's a big deal exactly then the other problem is these people that are buying this marijuana in the rest of the country it's highly likely that they're gonna have some of that pesticide on it right and how bad is that stuff is that stuff ever killed someone from smoking this illegal marijuana we don't know if it's killed anybody directly because by the time it gets distributed throughout the country it does dissipate a little bit but it's still highly toxic to put it in perspective about three years ago we had two federal officers back east not even in California in a public land grow that had all that toxic on it so they have cartel grows out there they do they do they actually coast we have them in about 20 25 to 27 other states to a much lesser extent and something we need to look at is California I mean we're one of only six Mediterranean climates on the whole globe so we are a great weed growing state just like our wine industry man we got great great weather for it so we can grow outdoors and indoors I mean February to almost December right and that's why it's grown here and that's why the black market both in you know the private land communities and the cartels are everywhere across the country with this stuff but they'll go wherever they can - you know diversify the network so we do have it in other states to a much lesser extent and then something we need to remember is even though about half the country has these grows in them to a lesser extent in California these same groups are under the same Enterprise they're humid doing human trafficking doing gun running you know to fuel the fight down in Mexico methamphetamine production and now the new synthetic fentanyl that's just killing thousands especially on the East Coast are coming from these groups so it's all one enterprise and of course we focus on the cannabis issue because that's what's affecting our while lands in our waterways it's right at the hub so yeah it is it's it's nationwide it's not a California problem and we made really really careful even though we're talking about a team in California game wardens we're trying to tell a nationwide story because the nation needs to know well it seems like you I mean it just seems like it is you guys were not trained for this right and there was no one else there so it was like like hey put it on the game wardens they're gonna have to handle this now which is really to me kind of insane it is but then at the flipside we're really passionate about protecting what you and I love right our wild lands and our waterways and our wildlife especially so we have a passionate interest in protecting you know those resources and not to mention keeping our public safe in the same in the same breath because these are in public areas I mean we have a lot of these in national parks we have like you know not only you have the armed gunmen that could you know shoot a hunter or a hiker and equestrian anybody in the outdoors and enjoys are you know what the great outdoors have to offer but you have you know all the other threats that come with that you know it's not just an armed gunman they're putting pun Jeep it's literally vietnam-era punji pit Sanh some of these trails land a punji pit for people don't know absolutely so back in the Vietnam conflict with the Vietcong would do to deter our American soldiers is they dig a pit underground on a trail it'll be about 18 to 20 inches deep and you know square to kind of cover a whole trail then they cover it up with bamboo or leaf litter so it just looked like the trail and then our soldiers would kind of walk and they'd step into that and here's the sharpened sticks out of bamboo they're super sharp and they're pointed upwards so when you step into it you're going to share a shin you're going to puncture you know your leg maybe an artery and they would put human excrement excuse me on the points to induce bacteria induced infection and basically take our soldiers you know out of the operation well we started seeing 2015 and the first one we found was actually in the National Park up in Shasta County and Whiskeytown and it was a punji pit going into a grow site on a public trail I mean it was hundreds of yards Joe from the grow but anybody could have walked in on it we were running an operation with Shasta County and this is when we had our full-time dedicated team in the Hidden War era and our point man was about to step into this thing and arcanine Phoebe that I'm sure you know we talked about a nun Steven show that I'm meat-eater and also Mike Ritland who has a show called Mike drop and he's a seal team three veteran and k9 trainer he really got into the dog stories right we talked about that but Phoebe amazing dog she had been trained to sniff these banned poisons so she could smell it you know a mile out with that amazing nose our canines have and right before our point man was about to step into it Phoebe alerted em Brian pulled everybody back her handler and my teammate and sure enough he did some digging and pulled back the tarp and then here's this punji pit and it had the banned toxics actually on the sticks so what would that have done if one of us had stepped into it so that was a real aggressive anti-personnel technique that could have you know that could have decimated a hunter or hiker or anybody else so so that was or wildlife yeah some of these pit traps for wildlife and these big you know wells they're diggin in cisterns and they're doing this to keep people out or they're doing this for animals like what what are they doing something like that is has to be targeted against people but we have there's a lot of different things for animals too there's a lot of things to keep animals away from the plants they'll do you know they'll dig big pit traps that are they'll put garbage in them or they'll use them like when we were in the middle of our really severe drought that we just came out of here in California a couple years ago all these mountain streams were just bone-dry so they would go to the lower lands and we were doing a lot of work you know in the Delta region and Sacramento Delta and the lowlands and they even if they you know we're getting water from the Delta and the Raceland would dry up they would dig and dig wells 20 30 feet deep and they'd leave them open and they're getting water from them and pumping out water out of the bottom but those stay open so yeah our big you our big game animals drop into those or we could drop into them so multiple hazards yeah exactly what is the is there an estimate of how many cartel members are growing in this country right now if you say there's 27 28 states is that what you say what is that is there a rough estimate of how many cartel members are here right now doing this kind of stuff this comes to you know it's it's a real approximation because you only know based on who you catch or graph enable the debrief but like in California we know from the amount of grows we we deal with every year just on the trespass you know cartel front and the number of operatives it takes to run grow and get it started and then to harvest it I mean a conservative estimate ten thousand ten thousand yeah I'd say conservatives California just in California and the reason we say that and I always go very conservative because it's such a kind of a silent enterprise and it's really hard to get some of this data but we've we've just validated it through the numbers of things we run across you know when you look at the fact that it takes two skilled growers that are vetted because they cut their teeth down to Mexico doing it effectively under the Federalist knows and they grow well and and and you mentioned this one yet Mike Baker on the show which was interesting and you hit it on the head when you said man these guys are really resourceful you know you got a you respect their work ethic and now and you have to because they're they're hiking water line they're hiking infrastructure in they're covering their tracks they're out there for six months at a time you said they were walking around with carpet strapped to their feets that didn't leave footprints yeah in hid more especially we have a whole lot of photos in that book about things we've seen on trail cameras and they will put felt lined lined soft felt on their shoes tie them up tight and if they're walking like an Old Forest Road you know that's got a gravel base you'll never see that track I mean you know you you've tracked big game I've done it you know it's the same type of technique and if you don't have any sign I mean they're really good at disguise and we actually found a guy and I have a picture of this in the book and also in the PowerPoint when I when I teach to this throughout the country cow hooves actually carved out of wood because a couple years ago we were you know the US Forest Service a lot of this grow problem is on or national forests you know Northern California northeastern California not so much Silicon Valley where I started but the rest of the state even down here and what these guys would do is there's cattle leases on those properties where you know ranchers can run cattle on part of the forest and you know or a joint on private property and we were getting tips on a bunch of grows you know or you've seen them from the air or hunter or angler would report or we'd have a suspicion because of a waterway or do we get see some plants from satellite or whatever and we go try to find this grow and we're picking up tracks and we're you know we we're pretty good at finding these things now we've been trial and error in it for a lot a lot of years but we're seeing a lot of cattle tracks because we're running around with cows and sure enough they were putting on cow hooves and strapping them on top or underneath their their boots clomping around to disguise themselves as cattle clever right and then once I get way up into a deep canyon where they're gonna put their grow they just take them off and throw them in a backpack and then the light bulb went off we better look at you know our tracks a little more carefully so how do you guys try to go about finding these things do you do you rely on people reporting them or do you have like aerial surveys but how do you it's it's a mix of all of that we get a lot of reports from people on the ground and our best reporting parties or what we call our peas are hunters and anglers hmm when it comes to the outdoor public but anyone in the outdoors could run across some but hunters and anglers especially because where do we go when we're gonna find a good waterhole for elk or you know we're hunting rock tail we're gonna go you know we're not gonna stay on the beaten path man we're gonna go down to the headwaters we're gonna find a pristine area we're going to get away from people so all the people that are going the deepest into the backcountry absolutely absolutely and then they're finding the water you know source and they're maybe they're following it and it's dry or it's diverted like what I found in 2004 that started this whole craziness and then they run into a grow we also do find it from the area you know we do all agencies it's no no secret no no tactical reveal we fly to look for this stuff from the air I have a friend of found one on Tejon ranch really yeah yeah two years back and I didn't think anything of it I thought it was just some crazy person decided to try to grow pot yes this back before was recreationally legal okay and there was no shootout or anything crazy like that they got there after yeah either they realized that their grow-op had been compromised and they took off but you know Tejon Ranch is enormous it's like 270,000 acres yeah and just the the gall of these guys to go deep into that ranch and set up this grow site right and the guys who work there they I guess they just stumbled upon it I think they stumbled upon it because of garbage - if I remember correctly yeah that that follows track and the thing now you're talking about a private hunting ranch just got a cat Elise and all that huge we've done a lot of good stuff with tyonne Ranch and supported you know good hunting programs there but an interesting statistic when I retired last year in December in 2018 you know I mean we keep stats ever since one of the cool things about the our specialized team started in 2013 is we solidified all the documentation to be spot-on you know reporting was kind of haphazard throughout the state we weren't sure what other agencies were doing but we knew what we were doing now and so I'm keeping that data and there was a real shift in just public land presence of these cartel growers and by the time I retired last year it was almost a 50/50 split so ranches like tone ranch a private hunting club in the Silicon Valley one up in Shasta County so you know where they're doing big-time conservation projects to get Blacktail and mule deer and tule elk and everything else up in numbers and now they've got this presence on their hunting Club hitting one of their sensitive waterways you know so so it's it's not just a public land thing and it's really good for everybody listening to know that you could find it anywhere and you stumbled on it and it's funny you mentioned the reporting parties the cool thing after I did Stevens show on a meat-eater and talked to those guys we sort of get tips you know I actually got a tip and you know and it's it's in play and I won't say too much more about it but we'll definitely we'll be talking when it's all over and done but it's it's going to get handled and uh it's so cool to see the guys like you and I that hunt and love it and love the passion of what's out there are out there stumbling on this stuff and getting out safely and and we're fired up enough not to wait you know we're calling people to say hey it's out there can you help us RIT's award and sheriff's or are you ever guys getting an sense of hikers or anyone didn't shot at or yeah it's happened it's happened fortunately it doesn't happen a lot where we have a lot of fatalities but I want to say about five six years ago we had a father-daughter combination on a deer hunt up in one of the DS owns in northeastern California and they were shot at by kartell growers going in on a deer Oh up on her to try to harvest her first deer you know she was coming up through the program yeah it was horrible unfortunately they weren't hurt they got out of the area they reported it we've had people run out of you know run out of Gardens by by some of these growers we have had other shots fired and we've had people just stay out of because once they see it or they see a guy holding a weapon like that in a marijuana plantation they know isn't legit they're out of there so is there an area where they I mean it's all public land mostly or in private land ranch land right but is there an area of the state where they there's more of them you know that's what I thought when I started I mean you heard about the humble you know community the unknown triangle right we're just the hub of it and I thought it was more prevalent there and it's certainly massive up there but I mean I'm from Silicon Valley where I'm from you wouldn't think of those foothills in that part of the state you know being so overrun and during those what I call you know the formative years of learning this and getting involved in it and specializing in it and we were really I got to give a shout out to the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office and the guys then that took as long as equals and my partner's that really brought us in as you know not only tactician x' but tracking and able to identify sign as wardens doing the hunting thing in the woods where we could go and really specialize at this and and be a lot safer and do it a lot better than when my partner got shot no.5 and we were doing 25 public and private land cartel grouse in the Silicon Valley at least 20 to 25 a season geez that's a ton that's insane and that doesn't seem I mean you're only for folks who don't know what the season is explain that yeah the eradication season what we call that you know the grouse season when we operate the heaviest is usually an early start would be sometime mid May and then we go all the way to like about the end of September and I mean there's you know there's some wiggle room on both ends of that depending on water and how long the winner goes but but for me to pretty much stand of September so it's going on just somewhere in the neighborhood of five to six months and you're looking at 25 yeah operations yeah and that's in just Santa Clara County as an example and we when we form the full-time team in 2013 and we had representatives and we have representatives on our marijuana enforcement team our fishing you know our agency-specific team we would we have guys covering every part of the state and responsible team members spread out covering every County and as of now and we've been well we had six full operational years before I retired now it's in good hands and the team's doing fantastic or we've had at least a grow if not several in every county in the state and most counties multiple so to put it in perspective on an average yard team would do 125 missions if not more so that's 125 grow sites that we were responsible for doing the work up the planning going in and doing the apprehension the stocking to catch these guys with our canines and with our tactics then doing the eradication and 90% of them are all you know tainted in that Ferdinand the carbo fear and sometimes to the point that it's so freshly applied that we can't touch the plants for a couple of weeks we can't even even with protective gear with nitrile gloves face protection masks the whole nine is dangerous it's that dangerous and no exaggeration to put it in perspective the two officers on the federal level that we're exposed just ingested some of those fumes and you get blindness you get nausea you can't breathe they were out of circulation fortunately not fatally but they're out of circulation for weeks sometimes months and federal osha came down with the Forest Service and of course working closely from the state level we suddenly were under a lot of protocol on decontamination what we couldn't touch and you know new new basic tactics for our safety for human safety came down and it changed the game so these guys putting this stuff on there we may not be able to even touch the plants or even cut them safely or put them in Nets and contaminate all our gear until it has a chance to sit dissipate a little bit and that's 14 days so what would you guys do if you stumbled upon something and you knew that it was freshly applied would you just have a bunch of office or standby and guard the area to make sure these guys didn't come back to try to reclaim the plants as best we could because here's the problem with that you know you get a big grow and you know you can't go in and touch these things for you know a couple of weeks maybe it could be I mean it could have been applied that day it could have been applied four days ago we hit it we're not sure so we'll give it a 14 day window what we'll keep an eye on it but at the same time we're doing all these other missions right and we're not getting everything and and how people were talking in I mean would guys have to camp there sometimes yeah sometimes so your guard can hike and yeah we've we've set on grouse we've camped out overnight for several days we've surveilled drop points and you know watched you know these guys come and go and try to make sure they don't come back and you have limited resources to begin with right so you guys are the initial jobs to protect wildlife and you're supposed to be doing that so how much of an impact has that had on wildlife because you've guys have been diverted to these illegal grow-ops exactly well you know you hear the term the thin green line right yeah and kind of what I'm all about being a game word and now in Phase two in retirement I'm really trying to speak more nationally to what the Phinn Green Line is and it's never been thinner and the fingering line basically just represents you know game wardens and forest rangers Border Patrol but from the wildlife in the military of course but from a wildlife protector standpoint now that we have this cartel grow problem and you just hit it on the head rather look at the resources it takes and all that traditional stuff that we used to do that we still do those problems aren't going away right so we still have to check you know the night hunter we still have to deal with commercial wildlife sales and all this the ivory importation issue and the wildlife trafficking that's just blowing up so we're getting thinner and thinner and stretched further and further game warden numbers aren't growing very much anywhere in the country yet the population and the impacts of people destroying wildlife especially on this cartel front just keep as a survey being you guys are in charge of ivory importation as well we deal with all that yeah Wow yeah we have teams now in our agency and most of the states do call wildlife trafficking teams and it was a good program that came out of the Obama administration that all the states had to do it we were kind of already doing it but we had to formalize a little bit and that was an added challenge that happened right after we formed the whole cannabis enforcement program which started with with the tactical unit that I you know Co formed and ran and then all these watershed enforcement teams popped up for cannabis regulation to check the new licensed growers people trying to do legitimately in water use and make sure there weren't you know abuses then wildlife trafficking became a huge issue the commercialization of wildlife is a huge billion dollar industry worldwide on everything from abalone to sturgeon Road black bear gall bladders and now ivory especially the black pale girl gallbladder one is so weird it crazy yeah yeah it's it's just it's like a Chinese medicine thing right yeah yeah yeah it's an aphrodisiac yeah but it's not no it's not real but in Albert I think it's BC no BC even though black bear hunting is legal for food yeah you can't open up the the stomach contents right they don't allow them to gut it because they don't want people to be incentivized to sell gallbladder grab that goal it's so strange so you can eat the bear yeah but you can't even open up the cavity the body cavity so like the heart goes to waste other parts that people might eat yeah yeah which which we'd like to see so strange it is but again it gets back to greed and profit and market right when a gallbladder can be worth forty thousand or more or ycs yeah forty thousand yeah that's not much that's how much a gallbladder can be worth with the black market right is that frickin crazy it doesn't do anything yeah crazy it doesn't but because it believe that it does and it's one of those exotics that I got to have and I can't get blackberry so horn yeah exactly like like run or anything so we I did a lot of that type of work before I went into this with this met focus and it just shows you how many challenges game wardens have to do and it's not you know the old traditional game warden just out checking those licenses anymore I mean over thousand we're overwhelmed yeah that's no exaggeration now because this is now a problem that people are aware of have there been significant resources that have been allocated to try to handle this stuff like cuz are there new yeah like programs to train these young officers coming up - is there like a specific task force that handles that and then the rest of the guys handle fish and wildlife or is it just same people but now you have a whole different level of responsibility yeah that it's really cool in California because we are one of the most progressive you know game warden agencies and it's interesting because I just spoke at the back in July I spoke at the new Weah conference which is basically the annual game wardens conference for all of us from all over the country so get to work all the states and you know Florida has some tactical unit for some stuff Texas has it and we're the first state to have a dedicated you know kind of tactical unit for this this cartel grow threat because it's it's so big in California but to share that with everybody nationally in my world in the fingering line and for them to start having it happening on their refuges and even just to know this stuff's getting back to their parts of the world and poisoning their cannabis users you know unsuspectingly horrible information right but we need to know it and a lot of guys didn't know it and so that was one thing to see hey what we need to have a baseline training and the way we do it here in California is we all go through a really stringent Academy everyone gets their basic tools arrests control and defensive tactics you know and firearms training all of that and get good at being the traditional game warden and doing all the traditional stuff and they get you know get their feet wet out doing their own thing for a couple years and then we start to find the people that have the motivation or want to get onto a specialized unit like our met team or one of the watershed teams or the wildlife trafficking team very seldomly do we put a fresh person there because you know I think to really be a good game warden you got to cut your teeth on all the traditional stuff that's critical it just happened it having to check guys with guns all the time you know most cops look at that and go that's crazy I mean everybody you check has a knife or a firearm yeah well fortunately ninety-nine percent when we're guess I Q a me that want to see a game warden and game warden wants to see us but for that one felon that's on parole and he's in the woods hiding out and we run across that a lot and I I ran across a ton of that down here in SoCal really at the start of my career and I've got some interesting stories about that but so guys who are like didn't skip bail and then they go and hide yep and they've got like a no-bail warrant they're wanted on some warrant somewhere and so they're off fishing they have an illegal firearm maybe they're a felon in possession of a firearm they can't even have and now they're out in a remote area where no cops gonna find me here and then on the new game warden in Riverside County you know all freaking motivated really green I don't know totally what I'm doing yet and I'm in that truck cruising and something I got into down here that was just crazy but I will say this it was a heck of a learning curve and I'm really blessed it went out the way it did and it was I was safe in it but we would get gangbangers from LA here and they would go over into Riverside County and get into my kind of rural you know foothills and on the edge of the National Forest and they'd have ak-47s and they'd have you know automatic pistols and they would spotlight through these canyons gunning for everything they kill rabbits that kill coyotes they kill deer they get to the end of like a canyon that has like uh an outlet of a dam throw a gill net out and spend all night they're just gill net and fish and hunting freely and shooting and killing everything with their spotlights grab their gill net grab hundreds of fish pack up and then head back you know back to the LA basin gangbangers I'm not kidding and the craziest portion gangbangers yeah commercial almost commercial fishing does it does it sounds nice right right and what would they do with the fish Oh they'd eat him maybe they'd sell them you know who knows usually with quantities that big they were getting sold but the thing that was crazy is I would be you know alone I'd be in my truck I didn't have a canine yet you know and now I just I just retired with like your marshal I have Apollo yellow lab English lab she's amazing never gonna bite a bad guy but she's gonna lick him to death and try to should try to you know turn him our way but I didn't have a companion dog at the time and I would go and run into these guys and go okay this is what I learned in the Academy that you know that that head on spotlighting stop that you never want to have or getting behind and blacked out and tracking him down and next thing I know I got a case and I got all these frickin prohibited exotic weapons and I'm going this is crazy I'm pulling these guys out alone I don't have a lawsuit just you it was just me how many guys did you run into sometimes would be to one night I pulled like eight people out of a man oh yeah and I was alone oh yeah and they were all armed and it was one of my heaviest most intense cases and I had been on one year so this was 1994 and what we were doing in the Riverside squad is we were just saturating the area because we were getting everybody from over on the LA side here spotlight and all our games so we're like okay let's saturate this and back venj oh the game was to catch a spotlight or it handed because they're so deliberate explain spotlight oh yeah yeah I should I should have done that but spotlighting is where you use an artificial light whether it's a handheld spotlight a flashlight whatever and you go into remote areas and you look to find animals at night because they freeze they're really relax their eyes glow and then you shoot him that way you kill them illegally at night after dark which is never allowed you know it's usually in or out of hunting season because anyone's go spotlighted deer nine times out of ten they're they're not licensed or they're not going to do it during season like we do so they're doing that so in the in our world as game wardens that's the ultimate wildlife criminal because they're gonna kill those you know that that have that unborn trophy buck for good genetics they're gonna kill a trophy deer way in the rut you know that you know needs to go another year or whatever so that's what we focused on that was like if I can cut my teeth and get you know become a reputable game warden I'm going after the hard course that was the game then those 94 and I'm pulling these guys out and calling them out on loudspeaker I've got my weapon on him and I'm like oh man there's a lot of guys out there I can't get him to jail I'm calling back up I got Riverside County coming in I mean we even had the the the Sheriff's Office helicopter come in several nights once we got to know each other and they realized who is this game warden and what are these game horns Riverside County going out into just crazy areas by themself they monitor our traffic and they come in on the helicopter and light it up and call him you know I'll call these bad guys out on loudspeakers just to make sure we were okay and feels good when the Calvary comes on those nights man let me tell you what sort of situations they just didn't know that you would ever run into someone that's that armed that many guys in a van or what have you eight people so there was the reason while you're patrolling by yourself was because they didn't anticipate anything like those well and we do know the bodies right this was one of the things that was crazy we get back to the thin Green Line concept and realize that one game warden is responsible for 200 to 250 square miles give or take whoa and you know how big Riverside County is on the in legend one hundred square miles maybe more you know depending on what more than one game warden so a squad a seven game wardens to put in perspective check this out brother so when I was supervising traditional patrol before we started the special ops mat team in Santa Clara County we always had vacancies because we always low on bodies we couldn't hire game wardens fast enough we weren't funded for it or where the case may be so we might have four or five game wardens for seven positions and we had to cover all of Santa Clara County which is everything from the city to all those foothills and there's a lot of it in silica people don't realize all of San Benito County which is huge Hollister Gilroy right where I'm from in Gilroy that whole area down to the south that is just massive mountain country full of wildlife and then like part of Monterey County and I had five people and myself as a lieutenant that is insane I can't believe that so to go out on a spotlighting patrol to that point and have a partner with you just one other game warden that's tough you know you're basically pulling a whole nother area you can't work night on her so it's spotlighting that common it it is still going on in the state and it's going on a lot back then here because there have been so little presence here in Southern California it was off the hook it was crazy one week in 1994 I remember I was I had a really good ride along with me a wildlife biologist such a savvy hunter great eyes he became kind of like my right-hand man Bryan and we I said we're gonna catch a spot letter every night this week you think so like what's that crazy let's see if we can do it and so we went and worked all night long we started on Monday night how do you catch them do you look for a spotlight like what do you get to a vantage point you glass it's yeah it's just like glass in a big basin for elk right right you're you getting a really good overwatch that you get the most visibility you know hide the truck and you watch and you find areas where it's likely to happen and it takes a while to learn where that's gonna be just because you got this huge district and you could have 20 places where guys spotlight but until you get into the areas a new Ward and really get to figure it all out you don't know where to be and it's a trial and error but you know it took me six months give or take or just just going out there and scouting hard and you've seen where this road goes and how does that canyon look what type of water do I have down there what am I seeing a low light in the evening when animals are coming to water ooh I got a whole herd of elk here I got a whole herd of deer I got some bucks you know I'm seeing other animals running around this is gonna be a hot spot because guys can get to it and if you just put the time in you just kind of lie in wait you know kind of put your little hide together just like hunting big game eventually it starts happening and by 1994 and I've been in district a year down here I pretty much had my spots figured out my partners in other parts of Riverside did too so we'd all be out alone so we could cover more area and talk and back and forth I mean and I'm going to date myself here but cell phones are brand new so we all had those flip cell phones and we're told you I'm gonna be 51 in November I'm 52 yeah yeah so right there you know all that ers so when I started I mean it was the flip phone you know that's not you on communicator I'll call my partner Jerry they love those where are you at they're great like we're yeah because I'm over here in Thomas Mountain like I'm over here you see anything yet I go I got one light working all right I gotta go and then I'll go so but that's crazy like you're talking about enormous pieces of land oh it's you guys are responsible for yeah I mean for it's hard for people to put into perspective that don't spend any time in the woods right that you would be able to even find these folks in this enormous area yeah yeah it's start stuff is a needle in a haystack type thing you know but once you get into it you get fairly good at it but it always is difficult because again just the percentages of catching a guy on the right night that he's going to be out there and then you got the guys that kind of get savvy to know one where the game-worn lives drive in by his house looking for his patrol truck to see if he's out that night where's the truck parked we start getting into that problem so we always kind of you know kind of maintain as covert as we can you know we're known in the neighborhood and the thing is we live at home we work out of our homes home office we're close to our community because if we kept our truck at a field office we have no response time all spread out so we get very community-oriented in in community functions and conservation groups and everybody knows us whether it's a big city or a small little town in the mountains so you got guys doing the cat and mouse thing looking for us and you know making sure hey is this truck there or is he out patrolling well maybe I won't go out tonight but but that that era Joe in in 1994 was was off the hook I didn't get a spot letter every night that week but I got six out of seven and one night I had a double so it was crazy Wow in season a ton of guns and you know some guys were going to jail some weren't but a lot of wildlife was saved that night because they would they would have done a lot of harm you know most of these guys are they doing this recreationally for father they're doing it for food like what are they the the group I was getting into down here it was it was recreational it might have been to sell the meat I couldn't prove that or it was just to go kill stuff you do get people that need me you know that do spotlight after because they need the meat and stuff like that and it's still a violation we still deal with it as such but if we ascertain that we're gonna be fair about it you know we said okay look you're poaching I know you're starving it's out of season it's in season you have a tag but you just really got to get that meat I mean there are certain cases where you just kind of feel for that person ago I see where the motivation was you know and a very small percentage of poachers are that way but some of them are just you know they're just trying to feed their family right and they're it's a whole different game and we're gonna be fair about it or we should be fair but most of them gangbangers or most of them criminals like what does it was zero down here average down here 70 80 percent yeah had criminal histories had illegal weapons associated with gangs so it was almost like recreation for them it almost was what practice yeah yeah and I remember one case down here that was a pretty crazy one it was it was three guys pretty inebriated pretty liquored up and there was a head-on stop and one of them had a like a $50,000 no-bail warrant for cocaine trafficking out of Mexico and that was in that week that we had you know crazy spotlight and things going on so it was just the demographic a down here we're up north it wouldn't it wouldn't be necessarily out felon but that guy that just wanted that trophy buck and to get it cheap to get it you know if I could give you a magic wand okay and you could like I could say John it's up to you fix all this how do you do it you have unlimited resources man that's a great question and I'll do go into the bottle the genie right here mm-hmm one we put more game ones in the field because we do need more and we pay them better and here's the rub because there's this perception that game wardens just check fishing licenses or they might not be real cops we're paid about 40% less than a county sheriff than a highway patrolman really than a city police guy right and because of you think it's because of perception perception and public lack of knowledge perhaps now that is so as far as funds get allocated they say well Morton's right this is the going rate you know this is what we've always paid you know the raise is 30% yeah yeah that's we're in horror we're in a constant constant salary equity fight we've been we've been you know really pushing that for you know 15 years plus or minus something that really started to legitimize us and in 2010 when my first book came out war in the woods that's when the wild Justice game where in reality show a National Geographic Channel aired for the first time and that was our agency and that was the first of what are now a lot of game warden shows and the more the merrier because it's never seen that one yeah yeah it was it's good yeah it was it was it was us you know so I'm partially mostly busting people for wildlife or is it yeah it said the marijuana stuff - do you actually get in the marijuana stuff something the wild justice film crews really resonated with and a lot of the guys that are on the team now myself included ended up being featured like their main people for the better part of like three seasons because we weren't just bringing them the poaching cases the traditional stuff which needed to get shown even and we didn't have our formalized team yet but I was embedded with Santa Clara County Brian and k9 Phoebe were up in Shasta but we were getting brought together for the show and he was starting to work down with me in the Bay Area and bringing that wonder dog Phoebe into the mix that he had honed you know for years and we started to show this cartel marijuana stuff through the show and that's what got the ratings that's what you know that was worldwide broadcast and number-one hit on that Geo for three years and that opened the door you know we needed that exposure and it's the same thing with like writing these books and doing the TV I do it's it's a fine line between risk and some exposure or getting the message out and like I said we're so thin on the thin green line we need all the exposure we can get we're a little agency our funding is limited but we're doing a multitude of jobs even outside of the marijuana stuff so that started to help and now we're starting to get the recognition of the professionalism and the capabilities we have especially with this tactical unit totally help with things like salary and numbers the magic wand brother is number numbers just numbers that officers and they're paid well enough to live in the Silicon Valley to live here in hell that's hilarious right Owens paid well enough to live in so million right moving out yeah and that's where that's where I grew up and if I wasn't embedded there his family member I couldn't have afforded to stay and I had great Grey Wardens come in and do fantastic work that didn't want to leave Silicon Valley but they're like I can't buy a house here I got to go to Butte County I got to go Shasta County I got my be in the woods a little bit drive an hour at work yeah you know so if it has there been discussion like has anybody brought this out a Dan Crenshaw was not aware of this when I discussed it with him when I was talking about federally legalizing marijuana right it's not just about saying it's okay for kids right but it's a it's about mitigating these problems that you have with cartels sure because when there is an illegal opportunity to sell something right there's a demand for then the criminals are going to sell it because that's what you have now exactly and it has there been discussion like to someone to bring this up like this is one of the primary problems with having marijuana federally illegal with California having it state legal that there is this massive confusion and this you know diminishing of penalties in California yeah with growing illegally there totally is and you know you got the opposite ends of the spectrum and here's what we're learning with regulation and I've always said this I said look if we're gonna regulate and we need to regulate to stop this black market let's do it smart you know let's for one everything we really tried to push here in California was regulate legitimate cannabis the correct way keep people safe test it test it make sure those pesticides a cartel pesticides absolutely man and as long as people aren't hurting themselves or other people they're not destroying waterways we're not getting in gun fights over it great you know no problem but for like the you know the outdoor trespassing with these cartels let's take that funding and put more effort in to stop and that you know let's not water it down to misdemeanors and infractions and do things like that and and you know it's and and even we can even take cannabis out of the equation Joe from the standpoint of I remember a few years ago I was quoted by The Associated Press of saying if cherry tomatoes were so desired on the black market and we're illegal and people were paying four thousand dollars a pound for cherry tomatoes we'd be having gun fights over cherry tomatoes and having banned poisons on cherry tomatoes that our kids would be eaten in their salads you know because of the black markets so you can take you know cannabis even out of the equation and look at the environmental impacts and look at the public safety but we have to do something to regulate this thing uniformly over the the board and we have to break the black market but what I've seen and I go into the last chapter in my new book hidden work extensively on this is what are the challenges moving forward after seeing regulation in play for two years boots on the ground watching it and having a great relationship with legit with legitimate cannabis growers and I'll tell you a few stories that really open my eyes and and got us unified right because the whole thing is we need to be unified on this on this concept not polarize left to right anti cannabis Pro cannabis let's get unified environmental safety public safety all of it but because of how we've regulated and the licensing fees and the protocol and everything else we've had all of these you know black market growers in the 215 days that wanted to get legal and saw everything comin in the cost to do it and being on Big Brother's radar or law enforcement radar and they backed out like in Humboldt County we had it like I want to stay in the better part of ten to 50,000 growers ready to regulate and we barely got a thousand you know and they went you know I can't afford to go through this permitting process I can't afford the delay so I'm just gonna go back on a black market I'm not gonna be on the radar Wow and that has to stop if we're gonna regulate right know the thing that was was really interesting and I never saw this coming but when when we were about to roll out prop 64 and you know it had been voted for recreational and the medical laws were tightening up I was the first law enforcement guy being from a marijuana enforcement team to to go into these California grower Association hosted grower meetings and my first moments in Santa Cruz right over the hill from my place right and I mean I'm in the you know I'm gonna be to use the camo bottoms the pole oh I'm going into my my training attire ferment and the look on 500 growers faces when I walked into that meeting just like what's he doing here conflict of interest he's working us he said guys watching our license plates and I'm just like guys everybody breathe I'm gonna tell you a story I'm gonna show you a PowerPoint it's gonna be graphic I'm not here to work anybody you know I'm here to unify just hear what I have to say no judgement and so I was all these guys aware of how big the situation was before you show them I would have thought so because they're in the industry right they know weed than just about anybody I would hi all the time they're not seeing the cartel just yeah that's all I didn't see that guts that kind of true camera what's he got a backpack like three repels a pipe yeah but anyway explain that I mean these guys literally would back in hundreds and hundreds of yards yeah of pipe and tubing like four hoses on their back well they're tough yeah I've got I got photos in the new book on trail cam with felt on their feet covering their tracks with these sea bags 100-plus pounds and a spool of pipe going up man don't know how hard that is to do I mean this just took a legit job yeah it'd be like the best employees you'd ever have they would they would been there they're tough and they're I mean to look at the environment they live in for six months man yeah they're all outdoors but I was at this meeting and I gave the presentation I talked about it and it was crazy to see a look of shock on these these grower groups faces I mean some women were in tears some of the guys were just like pissed off and pumping their fists and they're like that's bullshit we are not about that we're not about doing anything bad with our water we like our wildlife we just want to grow cannabis we want to be regulated you know and it was such a turnaround you know from the traditional relationship between law enforcement and the cannabis world and just to be the one guy there with all of the growing community there and then go from complete horror that I was there as an adversary or judgement or anything of that or you know to to do anything negative from an enforcement standpoint to suddenly having real talks of what was going out and and I could kind of see the authenticity the genuineness on some of their faces the way they reacted to my slides to the videos and so um when I left that first meeting I remember I just got flooded in my patrol truck and I had Apollo with me my little lab and she's an icebreaker I thought well it could be an interesting meeting I should have the dog for pets you know and she jumped in and I all these growers were coming to my truck and I'm packing up my stuff and what well this is weird and it was all these you know farmers supervisors from all over the state you know Mendocino County up in the Emerald triangle Santa Cruz and they're just giving me their card so I go hey lieutenant I have workers I have resources we will hike in and clean up agro with you let us help the met team let us help the cannabis program whatever we can do and no right no charge and and that was genuine man I was really really taken back by that in a positive way and I realized if we get the legitimate farmers on our side and they're aware of this they will help market that message also they have money and they have money yeah yeah the legitimate farmers are making a lot of money that would be a great way for you know we mean tax wise I mean there's extremely high taxes on cannabis as it is right but we could allocate that taxes absolutely to you guys yeah that would be incredible yeah where's the money going let's have a certain percentage of it designated for wardens that's starting to happen too because what's now that we've had a couple of years and we're seeing some of the regulatory funding and the taxes trickle back I'm in contact with my team all the time I still get to see him periodically and train and do things like that and really give him a shout-out for all the amazing you know risks they're taken in the work they're doing and promote their message and what they're out there doing but um the money starting to come back to us now so we're starting to get equipment we're starting to get more bodies we're starting to get like overtime funding so the ridiculous long hours and our small team works they're compensated for that just just happened literally you know within a month or two of being on the show with you so we're seeing some positives coming that those rates raised we're trying yeah we're trying alert the press 40% is discussed this up this coffee saucy damn good man I'm not even a coffee drinker and I'm loving this stuff it's great style cover now it makes your mouth smack though gives you a little it does a little yeah you know like yeah clear you throat a lot yes I'm American healthy Colorado was the first state to legalize it in Washington State do they have similar problems they still have a black market you know and the thing right now because we're not regulating federally and so every state anything that's grown stays in that state per law right but every all the demand is back east in these non-regulated states all right I don't grow it so Colorado has you know an interstate black market that's done by the you know quasi legitimate growers as well as the cartel element so there's still that black market thriving within you know the black market cannabis industry that isn't cartel public lands we've got different mixes and we've okay so it's a different kind of a problem in Colorado so they don't have as many cartel grows not as many they have some they have some I've I've talked to those guys and worked with them a little bit and they do have some but again they're kind of like more I'm at Montana now tight little growing window you know early winners late thaws so they don't have a very big growing season outdoors look the conditions aren't prime like they are here in Cali this is a this is a giant issue that is largely undiscussed and it's one of the reasons why I was so fascinated by that podcast is there and this is one more one more piece of the puzzle when you're talking about border control right that somehow or another we've gotten into this this state in our country this this place in our country where some people want to control the border and some people don't want any borders right and you have to understand that this is the number one problem with the border the number one problem with the border is cartel violence hotel violence cartel crime that's the number one problem and the giant percentage of these people that are coming over and doing illegal activity are doing it because it's profitable right the reason why it's profitable is because it's illegal and so they can do these things and and sell marijuana right all over this country illegally because it's illegal and if it was legal we could regulate it we could tax it the money could go into schools and pay for guys like you and and go to fixing this problem and instead we're playing this little stupid game where you know some states are legal in some states aren't and you know let's let's you know and it's federally it's still Schedule one crime when there's millions of legitimate law-abiding taxpaying citizens that enjoy it and it's crazy it is and into that point you know you you look at you know the discrepancy and just the inconsistency on cannabis regulation some states some nine not really not but when you get to the border issue you brought up that good point of it's not just that cartel element for this can of this poison cannabis stuff for this toxically tainted cannabis is a better way to phrase it it's the smuggling you know the human trafficking it's all those other crimes that may have said amine production so I'm not a you know I get asked a lot like after you know you had a great conversation with with Mike Baker on this was you know our open borders gonna work and know we gotta have some regulation it's just not gonna work because this is the world's not even so that's why open borders not gonna wear it right if the world was even and there was you know there's like extreme crime right Louis and you know I had II D called Iran on who works for yeah Mexico we just started dialogue and last week I like that good guy yeah boy is he scare the shit out of you though the stories about Mexico about how bad is down there yeah and there's there's just an insane amount of violence that's going on down there and it's insane amount of crime and so much of it is connected to the illegal drug trade yeah and look you're not gonna kill at all if you make marijuana legal but you would kill a percentage at least it would make it a little bit better and it would stop that yeah and one of the things we get from from getting that regulation if we can stop that black market for you know cartel weed we're gonna save a lot of wildlife yes we're gonna preserve a lot of waterways right because all those other crimes are very heinous and very destructive and I hate to see the human trafficking and all the meth problems and and anything that relates to violence or deterioration of a soul but you know I love the wild man woods irma Church yours too I mean what you do for conservation the elk honey that you're doing and all those different things I mean it's just it's magical out there and it's just most people just don't even know I don't think no but I mean don't get a chance to experience what it's like to actually yeah real woods be in the real woods which are getting shrinker smaller and smaller and smaller even here in Cali that has so much beauty but I look at it this way I said look if we lose all of our open space to a problem like this and it compounds the problem and we lose our wildlife and good water you may not be into the outdoors right now you might be a preservationist you might be you know on your freakin digital device all the time and looking at wildlife through a screen but if you ever do go out and you get that peace and tranquility and you get centered like we do run a trail Hika you know LA County Mountain trail open-space don't even get that far in the woods it's just soothing yeah you know brings us back to our Center and you know if the new generations that aren't getting that from the cities can get that or they get their kids doing it or their grandkids are here about it but it's not there to go to you that to me man I we're just we're just not paying forward enough so this is this is something I got to stay on and I really appreciate you and what you stand for because of the message I think just so many people don't know yeah I just think that's a big base they don't know what's interesting to me - is that the allocation of resources that it'sit's so when you have something that's illegal you're not getting any of that money no and if it was legal there's an enormous amount of money that could go to schools and fix the roads and we can allocate it to a bunch of different big time really positive ways to spend it yeah and we're not doing that and it's it's the reason why is because it's illegal and this this crime problem is very similar to what they faced during Prohibition with alcohol and you'd the rise of organized crime I mean right that's where they were getting their money from because there was such a demand it's really a disgusting dumb way to approach a problem that is many people's ideas a social problem that money could go to so many different positive things yeah when we're perpetuating it through that reason and many others were basically you know we're basically embedding the problem in our country and Ed said this Calderon we were dialogue and earlier this week and he said you know he's kind of looked at things from the border and south and the issues coming in from the border from the cartel front he said you know now I'm getting into your book and I'm starting to analyze what your you guys are fighting on the ground inside the borders in California in the rest of the country goes it's embedded now I mean it's not like it's just coming across I mean the enterprise is embedded here in the nation because they have the pipeline they have the distribution they have a market and they don't have to deal with a border issue and they're comfortable because of exactly where we're at and yeah what people aren't aware of in California that it's just a misdemeanor which is even more ensue yeah it's that's got to change that's got to change you know I mean it should be something horrendous if you're if you actually have a background in crime right especially particularly violent crime when you get caught doing something like that I mean it should be severe severe penalty it should absolutely be severe now the the saving grace of that is when we get the environmental crimes that we bring from the Fish and Wildlife standpoint to those charges for these guys we get it back to felony status because we had an interesting thing happened as soon as all that regulation started two years ago and the what you know those trespass grill crimes were watered down to what we're talking about District Attorney's all throughout the state said oh men we're not going to be able to prosecute these crimes I mean we're not gonna have you know we're not gonna have a jury that's sympathetic to these issues it's not worth it some sheriff's departments were saying hey we know how violent these guys are we know your team's been in like six gun fights man your partner was almost killed and no five and the first one you guys take these guys head on you know you want to protect your wildlife whatever but they're not stopping and it's a misdemeanor and we can't convict them so we're not going to play so a backlash of those crimes being watered down Joe was team stopped working it except us and like the feds you know and not only that DA's couldn't prosecute so I remember speaking for the California District Attorneys Association on this and saying guys there's a solution everybody no matter where they sit on the cannabis spectrum everybody hates to see Bambi dead water poisoned everyone has a little bit of environmental passion in them on both sides of the fence and that's where I say here we get to the Ute we can unify and not worry about where we sit on the per for against and if you take these water code enhancements if you take the felony on the penal code from the ban toxics like carbo fear in if you take a streambed alteration diversion or dead wildlife or littering close to a state waterway you stack all those up you get all these penalties and you can convict on that you know even in a sympathetic jury on say a cannabis issue so we started to prosecute these cases and they started to come back and it's an arduous end around it's more work than we should have to do but but we're doing it now when they find these cartel members and they bust them and then do prosecute them for these felonies what happens do they they don't get deported right they stay in this country in a jail here it depends they'll go to jail here if it's a sanctuary type state scenario and they're gonna you know stay in our justice system and they will do jail time here if we're working with ice and our feds and homeland security especially ice agents and they clap our classified as a deportable felon they will get deported but get on a watch list or did did they get deported to jail or do they just get freed well they're supposed to go back and be in custody over on that site does that always happen air quotes yes - supposed to operative word suppose especially if there's someone who's high up in the cartel or is making a good Monday for the cartel right it's highly likely that with a lot of corruption they might go free very very true and the case has happened where we've you know got some of these cartel growers deported and a week later they're in a different growing in Northern California we've had some situations where we've we've seen the same guy really four 20 times what no joke so you've busted them how many times we did or another team did or sources tested 20 times yeah they've been Liban and they're still here and they're still your holy shit because of what you just broke in system yeah it's the checked right and what you just said it's like because of because of the money involved and we know and I go into this and hit more a little bit what I can talk about under you know just what we learned without putting names out there is it's four to seven thousand dollars for these grow organizations in these cartel cells to bring their best growers back across and it's a drop in the bucket and they don't even consider the border a border they consider it like a speed bump on the 405 freeway so how do they get guys in do they use boats do these tunnels all of it all of it boats I was always thinking like how the fuck are you gonna protect the border when you just get a boat and just kind of like well Hoss and pulling somewhere in California and hop out yeah well something something we learned recently and it's been about the last five years and it was really starting to hit the California coastline and the Oregon coastline heavy when we started our unit in 2013 was these panga boats and you know they start where Penge it's called panga PA nga called a panga boat and they're there you know the the inside the Mosel on Peninsula and they're loaded up with 6,000 pounds of tainted weed but grown to Mexico same stuff they're doing here for the same toxic sore man or people or both and a couple of growers or you know transporters and they'll run this boat it's a one-way boat and it's there's a lot of money in it you know there's big four-stroke motors it's painted kind of the color of the ocean so it's hard to pick up from the air goes kind of fast it's made to carry big loads and they'll take that thing around the peninsula they'll fuel up offshore somewhere off the San Diego coastline maybe 100 miles out he's going ah there it is nice Jamie well that's a lot of weed that's a lot yeah I got some pretty cool pictures in the book so these guys just pull the boat in and then this is obviously one that got busted yeah and then they just have someone waiting for them and exactly got stuff in the trucks and they got a distribution network ready to go and then that boats just disposed of and it's yeah ladies and gentlemen this is all because of an illegal demand because it's illegal this stuff wouldn't be profitable if we were growing it here in the United States and if the only way you would sell it at a store was if it was regulated and licensed and you knew that it was tested and it was all grown here he had a certificate of where the farmer was and it that element of it yes you take that element completely out of it and they would but you know obviously they're still selling fentanyl and all sorts of other shit that we don't want legal yeah but it's so dark it's such a confusing confusing it was this Banga boat found with 18 million dollars worth of weed that is a lot of weed as weed is not expensive how is a boat got 18 million dollars worth of weed that's a heavy load that's a typical load to Joe and that was probably one of the Monterey boats we helped on because we interdict it a lot there but yeah it's a daunting task when you look at that dude on the right all I said just shoot him super angry yeah very mad yeah I mean obviously I'm not kidding about shoot him but yes there their situation is just as grave I mean you live in in Mexico and you're fucked and there's no way for you to get by legally and you're a young man you get recruited into one of these cartels the next thing you know you've been in for ten years and you committed a few murders and you're involved in your drug trafficking and you're well that's lower yeah you're down the slope it's done how do you get out of that you really don't there's no there's no avenues for them is established you know community outreach centers like hey cartel members like lunch you just grow cherry tomatoes instead right or you know there's no positive reinforcement some people that give a shit you know it's horrible yeah I mean and a lot of that again is backed by illegal drug sales if you don't have a legal drug sales you don't have nearly as much profit or incentive and you have less of that yeah it sounds counterintuitive for people to make things illegal that are legal or make things legal that are illegal and you would you would stop with a crime but that is really how it works it is and I always look at it this way said look it regardless of where you sit on the emotional spectrum on this yes against cannabis for cannabis let's all look at the issue of environmental purity safety in America and really be realists of what's going to help the problem and you hit it on the head when you said well yeah there's all that mess stuff going on and this that and there is but I'm a realist and we got to do something right now yeah and I think if we're gonna figure lis federally regulate to any type of consistency we're still many years off from that you know so what are we gonna do in the meantime if that's going to happen we still got to deal with this this grow mess going on in predominantly California and all this stuff getting out to our public and being tainted we still have to deal with the meth issue and the gun running and all of that and and knowing that it's embedded in our country we need to have people aware of it and we not only law enforcement but bring bring that thin green line a little bigger with conservationists like yourself and people that are in the know people that are in the outdoors and just putting the word out I mean it's it's crazy that ten years have passed since the first book and ten years have passed since we did those you know that's three good years a while justice TV but in that interim it's been a specialty of ours we built a team that's you know notice now for being pretty you know pretty innovative and progressive and non-traditional but putting up some pretty good numbers when it comes to the environmental damage and the public safety issue and how much we took out and bad guys we caught and what our what our can't what canines did especially canine Phoebe but we're only drop in the bucket yeah you know it's one team out of part of the state and other teams are doing some stuff too at the federal level and state level and we're only getting maybe 50% of this stuff if we're lucky is it really that much its if 2% high that's that's all to Mystic yeah that's against magic wand yep if I gave you the magic wand John do whatever you want how would you how many more officers would you hire how big would you make the task force I had much would you branch out your operation I'd make the tactical unit the Met team of the tactician is going just after the cartel front that we formed I you know triple or quadruple it you know have a team like maybe four teams in the state you know have them all trained together have them all uniformly committed to tactics and training because it is it is quite advanced what some of our guys have done went from a sniper team tracking to you know all the stuff we get into not only for this job but for anything else we come up with right from up from a from an American public safety threat after 9/11 stuff changed and we hadn't got into this grow mess yet Joe you know with to the level of the cartel front but I knew back then you know game wardens are gonna have to be tactically trained as well as any other law enforcement officer and we're gonna have to have our own tactical unit because we're doing some pretty crazy stuff for wildlife crimes you know and then Homeland Security on a potential terrorist threat you need to have tactical units that are there with every other agency and military teams because we're all thin in numbers and if something big goes down I need to know that the sniper team we built with met and these tactician --zz can go in and integrate with San Jose PD SWAT they can integrate with military personnel you know wherever same type of deal and we've used we've gone the same direction with some of that good training and found the right people to do that just under a game warden umbrella because it's got now crazy so it is crazy that you guys were required to do that I mean it's sort of like asking a teacher to also be a kickboxer or something right right the idea that you guys were supposed to be doing one thing yeah which is the again warden and then all of a sudden you're involved in narcotics trafficking and cartel operations and getting shot at and you're bringing in dogs and ya know these dogs that you're training you know Phoebe was like that was very interesting listening to how effective using Belgian Malinois is that we're using yeah primarily our main dogs a Belgian male and you know our powerful dogs they are amazing they're so smart yeah just in their eyes no way you can see it as I came in how you doing yeah yeah they're not like looking at a poodle no they're not like looking at our labs not that sweet little face hang out yeah yeah the thing that's that's cool about these dogs and um and I can't talk enough about it man because no matter where you said everybody loves a good dog story and you know some people say well dual-purpose you're gonna bite guys what's with that is it you know really aggressive and when you look at it's a lifesaver for everybody it's a lifesaver for us it's a lifesaver for the suspect too because it usually involves a potential gunfight that the dog basically you know alleviated because she or he was there so we got our k9 program in agency going kind of full speed around 2008 ish I mean at three we have three levels of k9 we have like the companion right along k9 that kind of does everything with yeah she's never gonna buy to anybody and that's Apollo that's like my lab right and then we have the detection level dog and most looser Labradors like Marshall like Apollo because labs have such amazing noses they really can hold on scent you know they can trained to detect many scents and we certify them in different things and then there's the Phoebe's you know the Belgian mouths or the shepherds and really it's become mostly mouths now in our agency and um they just do better in the heat you know Shepherds are longer haired and we're in hundred degree weather we're on long hikes you know or unsupported those dogs might have to sit quietly after hiking eight miles and sit in a prone quietly while we're watching and observing and stocking it on suspects to make an apprehension and arrest safely and hopefully avoid a gunfight so and we've also found with the with the mouths like I said they just hold up better on average and there's certainly exceptions to that but when we got our dual purpose program back on track these are dogs that will bite when they need to on command but they have great noses so they'll still detect wonderfully you know finding evidence finding tainted weed whatever the case may be a firearm a bear gall bladder all of that but they'll also you know like Phoebe was nicknamed the fur missile because when it was time for her to go to work and some guy was going to pull a weapon on us she was all business and a cool thing about a dog like her and and and my krill and I got into this on his show especially and he was blown away he said I've never heard of a dog in a domestic law enforcement team that's had like she had 116 apprehension bites in her career and she had hundred and sixteen no joke joke 16 cartel guys out there telling stories about this dog yeah they're saying no more perro I've been bit too many times no but the cool thing about that was the standpoint of life she saved and she also arrested another eight to nine hundred that she didn't have to buy it in her career that's a lot how many have you guys arrested when I retired we were over a thousand Wow in in five and a half years yeah and we and again all these all grow ops all grow ups yeah these are all grow ops are related to grow up so that these are all guys that are armed all guys that have knives or guns you know that you're not getting bit unless you know you're a deadly force threat on some level or a significant threat so yeah it's been a lot of guys so that number that you're talking about ten thousand that really is conservative very I think it's very much so yeah that is so insane because if you fly over like Humboldt or any any of these areas particularly meta sino northern California yeah the density of the forests of the the the public land out there yeah there's a lot of land there's a lot of land and a lot of you know potential we're not seeing so and that's still still thriving so when you you know when you when you look at Phoebe as a canine and you go well let's see she was in the field doing these type operations for about seven or eight years and yeah that's great from a record standpoint and numbers and the life she saved but it gives you like a like a snapshot of the issue how many guys did we not catch that were out there or right that we weren't involved in you know we weren't involved so and the dogs of just save lives man they have saved Phoebe I go into this in the new book especially in 2012 but right before our team started Phoebe saved my life Brian's life and all these other operators in Santa Clara County in Silicon Valley right where I grew up because she engaged a guy that was pulling a Russian automatic pistol on me and I was the support for the for Brian I was basically his k-9 handler or support guy and Brian had to deal with this other growers partner that had a big Terrace judge revolver on his hip and he was pulling it so he goes for that guy and says John just take my dog and Phoebe's Anka by 8 and he's biting this guy in the calf and you know this guy's nose down and we don't know he's got this weapon and I started to see it coming out and I get on him and I do what I need to do with some physical control and some strikes and whatnot to get the gun out of his hand but had she not been on that guy in a bike show that guns turned on me at 5 feet I'm engaged all the rifleman behind me I'm you know I'm in a gunfight again we've been in too many of those already how many John finds do better our team has been in six and I and I've been on the ground for four out of the six that our guys have been involved in and they've all been around this particular problem we had a lot less once the team got formalized and so we started using dogs but we still had two during the window of the team being operational that we couldn't avoid and dogs played a big part in that as I go into many stories it's so great I mean when I was listening to that podcast with Steve Rinella the meat-eater podcast with you and I was like I can't believe that there's not some sort of another division of law enforcement that gets involved in this and that we were requiring game wardens to essentially become something completely different yeah well well we still have other law enforcement agencies involved Forest Service dedicates a lot of people to it because a lot of this is on federal lands so we work at hand-in-hand Sun Sheriff's Department still work it BLM works it but very few agencies have a dedicated team within their unit just for this problem and it was a big step for us and even though it's not a traditional thing like we'd like we kind of talked about when we started all of us that are doing it want to do it I mean we really everything we do like I said is important we'll never negate anything a wildlife officer game where it has to do but for us that see this problem is the most severe which we all acknowledge and you know we're those kind of team members that have the military the law-enforcement tactical experience we're just wired for this type of stuff and we know I feel like you know in 28 years of being a game warden it felt like a 10-year career and even though we were certainly underpaid like I mentioned I had a dream job you know it was really awesome to you know because you're really doing a difference I think we're making a difference exactly I think every case we make matters and even though it's an uphill battle and with a whole regulation debate and stuff every grow site we interdict and stop and take that you know tainted cannabis out of the market or restore that waterway and clean up that grow site and we clean them all up now that we go into and the other agencies now support us and clean up with their own resources because game wardens have got so legitimate in working with other agencies that are non conservation groups sheriff's departments right DEA task force type units and they're like okay we agree we see we see the value in reclamation cleaning up these grows to the point where Obama's drugs are addressed a lot of us when my team was starting up and our group was working heavy and it was a real compliment but finally more importantly got the news out where he said I want this model rewarded what Fish and Wildlife is doing with this cleanup I mean you guys are arresting guys that's great you're taking guns away your key you know obviously somebody's going to be saved because these guys are violent deadly and you're eradicating the plants that's fantastic keep it out of the market they're poisoned but unless you're doing that reclamation component I know it's dirty and arduous and tiring and it takes resources you know we're not doing we're not making the biggest dent so then funding started to reflect from the federal level through DEA funding rewards for reclamation and that was like one of these men it took it literally took 30 12 13 years to get there so when you guys have a situation like the first one you found in 2004 and you stumble upon this dry creek and yeah there's all this debris and it's toxic chemicals like what kind of a cleanup is involved here and how long does something like that take before you can bring that Creek back to where those steelhead can run and the way it's supposed to be we're looking on an average one full day and we're looking at having to have a helicopter for a whole day and happen to have anywhere between you know ideally 12 to maybe more officers in there and a lot of it will have some volunteer groups coming in we have a program in California Fish and Wildlife called the interview pee program the natural resource volunteer program and when we started our pilot program in 2013 we did an operation called pristine to test this theory if we could have this full-time team being effective and if it wasn't for like 40 of the volunteers that our helicopter trained to go in with us and do a cleanup we would have reclamators you know less than half of what we were able to do but when we do a reclamation it's probably more expensive than doing the tactical operation planning and the takedown for the first part of the phase because you know helicopters are thousands of dollars an hour and blade time and you're bagging up trash you're getting dirty some of these water lines like you saw in the spools and I told Stephan on his show and Mike on his show as well with meat-eater and Mike drop that you know we tracked a water line almost three miles once that was a lot of freaking pipe it went I mean water sources in Merced County on the Pacheco pass Highway in my old home district and it went all the way down Pacheco pass on to this private ranch where the gross started and it was I think was like 2.8 five miles hand laid hand laid and buried under like you know forest roads or fire roads you'd see on like a like a tone ranch yeah 18 inches underground Wow across the road so in that a ditch for three miles that's a lot of work it's a lot of work those guys are pulling up they should do a real job there's a lot of money change it fix it do something different yeah but the the point of it was we have that we have to pick up all that pipe yes you know so how long is it gonna take you know two of my guys Andry miles of pipe eighteen inches of ground yeah that ever that was a couple days you know on an average one we're gonna go a quarter to half a mile at least and you know even though that black pipe isn't poisoning the water directly once all the poisons are taken out that water line is an infrastructure piece that it's their black gold I kind of used the term black gold when I start teaching to this that if you leave that water diversion in place and you take out their whole grow site you know you take out their camp and all that but all they got to do is reconnect the water line and put a tent up and bring in seeds and get their little camouflage system going very small investment to put a grow back there and one of the things that really got other agencies convinced that we need to reclamators not only on an environmental protection standpoint because other agencies care about the environment but it's not a mandate that we're not funded for it but it would it was something like it's also deterrence because when we debrief some of these guys we caught these upper levels and I I dive into this in the new book especially I finally got to ask the gins to these upper-level you know cartel guys running grows and running math run at all and I said you know it's interesting we notice that when you got when we eradicated grow site traditionally back before we changed this process and we just take out the plants and we leave we notice there's a girl like there back there next year or maybe two seasons again and it's the same group and the answer I got was well we know how taxed you guys are and how much resources you expend and you can't possibly get all of our grows so we'll try it you know and 50 percent of the time even though it was rated like two years before and it's on your radar will actually get away with the harvest and I asked well if we start doing this reclamation and we take all your stuff out and restore the waterway and move the tents and and just completely sanitized the site let all the natural growth come back preserve the creeks he said then we're not going to come back to that too much effort we're gonna bring tens of thousands of dollars in new infrastructure we're gonna have to run a whole nother water line it's already on your radar you know from a couple years ago when you guys rated it that's not a good business investment in a business model for us to take that chance and we kind of knew that because we were seeing the trend on the ground but to hear it from this guy's mouth mmm and validate what we suspected and have a comeback is true and all the other things I got to learn I mean just it changed a game for us and that happened I'm gonna say about a year to a year and a half right before we started our unit so we went in building the met team in 2013 with this mind set in place and Nate Arnold who was the district a captain at the time my partner in building this and I'm gonna give a shout out right now and it might carry on who was her chief of the law Enforcement Division and one of my mentors and friends way back ting the Academy in 92 he greenlit us to test this program and take all of us out of patrol in an already depleted force so you can imagine there was some resistance there was some middle management and executive staffers like why are we doing this we're not supposed to be doing marijuana work it's drugs when you cleaning up grow sites chase some bad guys and Mike said no I believe in you guys test it document it and see what we got to do with this and we were six weeks into a three-month test program and he is the chief and all the deputy Chiefs had talked about what we were doing out there and we were now documenting these insane numbers of what was happening and he said we're done I want a full time by January 1st 2014 get your testing do your interviews get the protocol you guys are leaving Patrol you know we're gonna have this many spots and you're gonna work straight for Head Quarters straight line kind of like a military special special ops team that just works for the top they don't really a boundary so where they go you know and that's kind of the approach we needed we needed to do a global statewide approach with no you know hangups to work with whoever we needed to within and without of our agencies and educate and it was really successful and we but we had to break tradition so to your point we like what we do because you said it best we're making a difference every little grow we get out of circulation makes a difference but it is it's an uphill battle because we know we're not getting them all and we know it's not going away anytime soon it must have been very interesting to talk to the cartel members and have them say to you that they know that you guys are taxed oh yeah yeah shit yeah like they know they know you know your operation they know like how do they know they just they look at the number and end I mean we get so little information because they're so my eyes for when you like you're talking to them how many days do you get with them we got an interview just you know one this was one with DEA and a bunch of other officials and multiple interpreters and I get to sit in on it and it was what something that bring Phoebe baby wasn't there on that one but but I do have a good Phoebe story yeah many of them actually but but a good one and it was it from that one where she saved that another gunfight from happening but but the thing about it was we don't get to talking very often when we do it's it's very rare that they'll talk they're put together in an organization where they don't really know last names they only report to one person a lot of times they don't know who they're working next to so it's compartmentalized very compartmentalized and they do this to make sure that people cannot go back exactly can I talk cannot reveal very much information I know a first name of my boss who's my supplier so um this was someone that was taken on other cartel crimes at high level but not a violent guy you know he was very candid and straightforward he's responsible for a lot of stuff in California and I can say that much in other parts of the country but what he revealed was just validating what we knew but it gave it gave us tools to progress and learn from that yeah I was gonna say when they when you do get that information from him did that allow you to get more resources or to like confirm like hey look this is what we know we need to pull out all this infrastructure we need to pull out these pipes if we don't they're gonna come back it is this is gonna make a difference it did and when we when we formed with the new team we said here's how we're gonna approach this we're gonna we're gonna help agencies we're gonna do our own missions we're gonna help other agencies that are doing the work but we're gonna do it under the caveat that we're going to do a three prong approach we're gonna apprehend as diligently as we can and catch these guys through our dogs through our tactics because you know just chasing them around and know when they're going to get away there's no deterrence in that and yeah it's risky and yeah it's dangerous but at least I know if I take them into custody even for a day of five days whatever maybe they're deported maybe they're not that's one really skilled guy doing a lot of environmental damage that's at least out of circulation for a while yeah right so that had to happen we're gonna eradicate every tainted plant and 90% of these grows they're all tainted with this carbo firends so they have any percent 90% it started 10 years ago is about one out of two and by the time those stats were trickling at the end of 2018 I was compiling for the team I'm like oh my gosh man we had carbo Furion and like 89 or 90 percent of every gross site we went into on these trespass grows but then the third thing we had to do and we would only want to work with agencies that agreed is reclamators gonna be dirty guys we might have to come back a different day but give us your helicopter team give us some bodies yeah and it's there's no specific reclamation like group like it's like it seems we should have an agency that does we don't have that in place yet and this an original Creek that you guys had in 2004 did you guys read divert the water we did and so yes all we actually can't let her flow on again yeah it took two years to get the fish back on that one and that was literally what numbers of fish do you guys think you lost in that oh man I mean the the steelhead are federally listed right now in their Valley like 20 to $30,000 of fish yeah there's a threat so catch and release of that I wanted to ask you as a game warden you know I'm not a fan yeah of catching really you don't like to catch or release well it's weird like I like fishing for food right I mean it's like I don't want to shoot a deer with a blow dart either and just go look I got 100 right and then let them like wake up Jesus and get out of there no I'm doing it for food yeah yeah I mean look I know steelhead fishing is fun I know it is it looks it looks awesome I've never caught steelhead but I've caught salmon of crown they're amazing sure there was gorgeous fish but catching them and shoving a hook in their head and then letting them go just seems stupid it's not yeah it's counterintuitive you uh you don't eat them at all steelhead at all well if they're listed and they're so threatened the way to keep steelhead fishing going I know like in California is okay guys you can catch them but you got a release that's so stupid you know so but now what about Oregon and Pacific Northwest's they do they keep them there in some places they do is just good eating fish yeah yeah it's a rainbow trout right yeah derivative yeah but it's but it's spawning is coming from the ocean it's going up a river its spawning going back to the ocean so that's what makes it a steelhead yeah and it's an awesome fish this man can fight like crazy and it's just they do really natural they're tough yeah and you just look at the you look at how sensitive they are and in that one Creek and the 2004 grow that was the worst scenario that could have happened right that they hit the headwaters of the start of this spawning channel that went to a creek called coyote creek that actually went all the way into San Jose to the South Bay of the ocean so that pollution situation from those banned poisons was just decimating you know three to five miles of creeks so we had to take that water away diversion out we had to clean it all up honey clean it up net it up bag all the trash pull all the water lines you know what about the pesticides how do you clean that if it's if it's banned we got to basically get a hazmat team to pull it out you know we got to put it in hazardous material buckets cap it real carefully you know and then and then just get it out safely what's the stuff that gets into the ground you got to move remove the soil you got to go through it and we can't always do that and something that's interesting and we get into this especially in book 2 is there's a group called ier C at a UC Davis dr. Murad Gabriel and his colleagues and they're going in as an NGO and they're the scientists that really validated the devastation these these banned poisons do when the Pacific fissure that was almost completely wiped out as a threatened species in California was linked to DTO grow poisons and that and that kind of came to surface about five or six years ago and then the kind of the light bulb went off that hey this is an outside scientific group of an NGO a non-governmental organization that's working hand in hand with California Department of Fish and Wildlife and u.s. Forest Service but they're showing the devastation of this stuff in the soil and in the water well after the Groves eradicated it's not just you know in and around the plants all right what's going on so some of these sites if you don't do a complete you know soil overhaul and you know get all that lining out of the creeks it's not going to be completely a completely restored and sometimes that can take you know we might have the resources to get back in there for a year or half a year we always try to get it before the end of the year when the rains come but it's not always possible it just can't it can't happen and you were saying that these pesticides dissipate off the plant somewhat some periods of time does that the case with groundwater and in the ground as well they dissipate toxicity somewhat everywhere but they don't dissipate to the point where they're not harmful on some level so is a case in point I have a slide I show on my PowerPoint that actually came from IRC and we've seen this multiple times if you know you have a scientist and he's in the big rubber nitrile gloves the long-sleeve the face protection the hat and he's got a gray fox carcass that right next to a planet in the soil that he ingested this stuff right on an unattainable ant and the Fox died within minutes and then there's a golden eagle that comes in after and it could have been days after we don't know you know and their carrion feeders right so the Golden Eagle lands starts just picking just on the surface on the body of this doesn't even get into the the carcass and here's a dead golden eagle in the photo right next to the it's like man just put a radioactive time bomb in that animal I mean that's a hot carcass and that was days after you know when the scientists are coming back in so dissipated or not it has its effects we see that in California with rat poison yes an eagle or any not Eagles as well very much so yeah that's why getting all those toxic sivan the ones that are illegal out of areas were Al's or any type of raptors or you know carrion feeders nope you don't like coyotes but boy that's the best way to keep those rodents and things under control those coyotes sisa balanced yeah I really said part of the cycle yeah I mean I know people love their little dogs and cats and stuff but you know I was having a conversation with a friend of mine about it I was like you need those things man those coyotes are important as gross as they are well criminals little criminals the neighborhood little criminals in the neighborhood but man you hit it that you got to have that balance yeah you know and and and like we all say on the conservation model everything needs a little bit of hunting control yeah you know it does the Coyotes need it when they're overpopulated you know you know you say it many times in the message with your guests people need to understand that we're helping wildlife as hunters as conservationists we're helping keep what we have and there's no way we can not manage them because we've already developed so much and taken so much wild space right and we've encroached and we've had you know a population of mountain lions it's abdun flowed and climbed and we've had this and we've had that so yeah we have to be involved but this particular problem that we're facing has so many far-reaching effects that we don't even see you know as a hunter it's just disgusting well as it's so counterintuitive to people that maybe animai rights activists or vegans that hunters are responsible for the reason why we have such large populations to these animals and wildlife protection and how much money comes from hunting tags and then recreational firearm sales I mean that's really the majority of the money that goes to preserve these wild lands and keep these animals alive and when you tell that to animal rights people or vegans they panic right it's like listen the reason why these animals exist the reason why they're protected it's because people hunt them exact sounds so counterintuitive but you know you were talking about Rocky Mountain Elk yeah Rocky Mountain Elk Federation has done an amazing job on these really repopulating areas like now they have successful populations in places like Kentucky where they were eradicated at one point time they had been extirpated yeah and because of it not because of us because of market hunting back in the turn of the century right in the 1800's yeah when people you know needed food and they didn't have refrigerators so you would shoot something and it was only good for a few days and they would go out and shoot some more and they would sell that food and that food was these wild animals and it was completely unregulated hunting yeah just a hamburger yeah it's hard it's horrific I mean we know about it with the Buffalo cuz we've all seen those horrific photographs of these mounds of skulls and yeah but it mean that was the case with antelope and deer and and they've done such an amazing job that now there's more deer in this country than there were when Columbus was here yeah it is no he was never here it's interesting when you bring up elk because of you know being a worldwide hunter myself and doing it for so long I've never taken an elk myself but I've been on these amazing elk hunts where I've guided you know people really deserving of getting their first elk as an example and you like this story being a fellow a you know an elk guy we had a tag in Santa Clara County that was for one bull for a tule elk and one thing we have in this this state especially is we have some of the best tule elk on the planet you know they're beautiful you know smaller species and you know great just just a beautiful animal and um I saw this tag pop up you know for for residents or non-residents it was only one tag but nobody would put in for it because all our tule elk are in private land and no one has access so this this gentleman drew this tule elk tag my clients only one tag we give one tag why just because limited numbers we know it's going to be a private land small herd we don't want to take too many bowls and we and we also know that it access is going to be hard so they say experiment with one tag and this gentleman that drew the tag was a 70 year old master hunter education instructor one of our top instructors for like four years so he's teaching hunter ed like we do in the Lord and front he's paying it forward draws his tag he had drawn it in a similar County in Alameda County the year before and could never get to any access harvest is elk so I get a call through the hunter education program like hey man I know you know your ranchers and friends there in Santa Clara County do you have a ranch that we could set him up on I said I'll work something out this guy's awesome I mean how many future conservationists has he raised up so I found him a spot you know rancher me and my sister and family grew up with and had a little little cattle ranch but he had a beautiful herd you know he did good have her like 40 animals and some nice Bulls a couple monsters so we got him set up to harvest one of those bulls you know before he was too old to do it with this tag and we had four generations there Joe it was great we had Mike his son his grandson and his great grandson oh wow and I just had never seen that and then I'm helping you know guide him with the ranch owner and what we thought was the bull we've been watching for months you know in all our scouting was going to be a fairly you know not a super difficult hunt turned out to be an all-day affair of course typical hunt right Murphy's lot kicked in he was hiding on another part of the ranch end of the day gets his pull it was just this magnificent feeling you know he had worked hard he had paid it forward and in the whole hunting world through hunter education and we did an article in photos where we saw four generations with this beautiful tule elk and on a hunter education magazine and I have that picture you know to this day I just look at it and go man this is what it's about this is awesome then the following year we got that same tag and the 17 year old daughter of a San Jose police detective friend of mine drew it and she had been hunting with her dad deer antelope doing her thing learning to hand load like like dad taught her doing it all and she never shot an elk yet and so we did the same thing I took her and her dad and you know we had in fact one of my buddies from the Santa Clara Matt team Hunter you'll read about him in book two he's a big hunter as well and an elk guy so you know he was in that circle so we all did it as a big kind of family affair same things year before what should have been a fairly you know couple hour hunt turned out to be an all-day affair and we end up getting her a nice nice five by six bull at the end of the evening I mean it was excellent you know oh it's the best ever people don't know yes it's we're lucky it's not commercially available folks lean healthy best yeah delicious yeah but but but seeing people like that you harvest an animal they'd never have access to it's just amazing and then unfortunately that tag got got eliminated in our department and I've been pushing with our well life management side to bring that tag back man give them give people a chance show that we can still do some cool hunting of a magnificent you know elk species here in California because it's here they're just cool yeah I mean hunting in California is so unusual to begin with right because we have these big population centers like San Francisco and Los Angeles and most people don't hunt there's less than I think it's below 1% now for the it is so we're becoming a non-consumptive State when it comes to conservation to the point where our agency is having to deal with more input and impacts from non-consumptive users of the outdoors and that's sad to see you know it's one of the reasons why I love California and I'm here all the time doing business but I'm a Montana resident now you know the wide-open spaces the mindset gorgeous over there the conservation you know kind of mindset and no ding here it's just it's a different vibe you know that's well it's a hunter friendly exactly they're very much hunter encouraged yeah you kind of the oddball if you're right well it's people it's part of the tradition it's people's way of life up there for so long yeah that it's not unusual and then the population numbers are low and there's so much rural area it just becomes and you know you could I mean I was there just two summers ago with my family we spotted a hundred heard a hundred strong herd of elk that's magnificent pulled over luckily I had my nose in the car how the kids looking out the window screaming and freaking out they couldn't believe it because if you never seen you know we see a deer occasionally in California a neighborhood will see a deer but see 100 you can see a hundred in that country and just gorgeous green grass and these animals just hanging out there and you know was in the summer so none of them even had their antlers are just chilling it's incredibly well it's incredible and it's funny you mentioned your kids because I I see it with the nieces and nephews you know and all the all the youth I ate in hunter ed and just to see that go to grizzly island and see a tule elk for the first time or anything they're just like what is that yeah I don't know what that animal is giant deer did I see that some animation some pics movie is that real well when you see one in real life and you see one scream that's me that's that was to me I was hub man the first time I went to elk hunting my friend campaigns took me to Colorado and they was screaming it was just we were pretty close I mean like within 15 20 that is insane that that animal can make that noise yes I just got a bugle it for contact us and it's felt as breath that's yeah it doesn't get any better than that but it's just such a magnificent creature yeah what kind of an impact has your book and your books have that has it had on policy and people recognize that that this is a big issue and hopefully change you know it's it's been positive we were we were you know hopeful that we'd get a big reach especially with book 2 and being retired I can speak a little more freely and you know go more national I mean obviously when I was working agency you got to be careful what you say and everything's are very very stringently looked at but but it's been really good because it hasn't just played to you know the audience I normally work with conservation and tactics and law enforcement and hunters and outdoorsmen and women it's the cannabis community is really behind this book I mean they're promoting it you know they're you know should flash it on their Instagram page I mean the Northern California growers actually look at the Met team they had a term that that a couple girl were colleagues kind of coined about two years ago and they said you guys are earth warriors this is amazing I like it and I went oh and you know a special ops law enforcement team called Earth warriors in California and I meant it's accurate that's badass is it very accurate and and it just shows you that you know you're not this rigid tactically oriented stereotypical cop right you know we're out here for a while I have waterways and something that I'm doing with hidden more especially in book 2 is I look at it as three-prong you know first thing I got to do is protect everybody I can you know and I can do a lot more by talking and being on venues with you and stuff like this then I can push in a rifle anymore or push in the team I can do more for the team or for the agency by outreach that they can't necessarily do so that's that's a blessing awesome and then the first besides protecting I want to inform you know I want to be able to tell this story I mean I've been doing this for 10 plus years and I never get tired of it I do a presentation you and I talk about it I get the chills I get fired up I feel it it doesn't matter who I'm talking to I could talk to ten people or you know I've been in groups of thousands it's the same I get fired up I can't I'm lucky to be able to tell the message given what we've learned I feel like it has it it has an impact so so yeah we are we are getting the reach out there much further quicker right now has it changed policy maybe you know it's a little too early to tell I think it's going to have some effect from the standpoint of when we start to see the non-consumptive users as enraged from on the issue as well you know equal to or you know mimicking what you and I as conservationists or you know people that are consumptive users that's the third part of my approach is protect inform than unify I think we need a documentary we got something like that coming up do you really we got something like that coming up and I in a context like that changes things for people positive or negative even when they're inaccurate you know you hear all sorts of rumblings about things after a good influential documentary comes out yeah we're actually um it's cool you brought that up because I'm co-producing with a very good independent filmmaker named Lou Doris a film called altered state and this one's been in the works for about a year and it's it's actually going to be going to be networked and distributed through new it's called planet cannabis Entertainment Network and they're they're a new channel planet cannabis Entertainment Network they got 40 million viewers they're doing main content like other channels are but they're also doing some you know some fun and independent projects and this is one of them and the nice thing is the reason we're green to do it with them is there's no content control you know issues we're going to get to tell an objective story not biased we're going to tell you know we're going to be embedded with legitimate growers that we've worked effectively with all on the environmental issue what are the environmental impacts what's working what's not working with regulation now what do we need to do to regulation to fix it or embed it with law enforcement teams again doing the work you know I've done with the team and telling their story and we're in production currently so this is this is gonna be a cool process and I'm gonna be involved in on the ground and you know working with Lu to narrate it and interview folks and and I'll be back in the field you know all throughout the state for the next couple of months and beyond that's awesome well John let me know when that comes out and I should really let people know you said about my Instagram and Twitter and all that job that'd be awesome thanks Joe and thank you thank you for everything that you've done man it's it's it's amazing and thank you for sharing this story too because if I had not listened to that Steve Rinella show I would have no idea yes I'd only heard my friend talk about that one grow up that they found but there was no one there and I would never have known there's gun fights and all this crazy shit that you guys are dealing with yeah Steven was great because he he thought you'd like liked the story too and I love your show and I got a give I like how killer Mike gave a couple shoutouts on a previous show so if you'll indulge me I'll give a couple shout outs here in a minute but one of the things that I always liked was how you approach this whole issue you know and how you came into it not being a hunter early on in your life all life and you come into it you know fairly later in life but just connected you know and coming from such a broad demographic of listeners that are sometimes out out of my world previously so thank you for your doing and this will be really cool because the guy's a media tour saw it too and and they in the you know to be able to connect here with you is really cool and hey the more we can do the message the better right yes for sure my pleasure so um please one more time list the books tell people where they can get them yep you can get both books hit more as a new one more in the woods is the first one on Amazon you can also get updates on my website just John Norris comm and it's an o re s it is not Chuck not Chuck Uncle Chuck brother from another mother yeah he's in Orr is but yeah you can also hit me on instagram and follow for all that stuff besides my website it's just Jo HN NMR yes and I do put this out that if people want to email me directly and they want a signed copy of the book or they have questions and since media tour another podcast I get so many people wanting to be Game Wardens now coming out of the military little kids growing up and I've been non-stop on that since since Steve show that's amazing so we're getting more people out there but for get you guys more money we're not a man yeah hopefully someone's listening yeah thanks for the sentiment but I got to give a shout-out to Blake B and Brian and Blake's here in the green room with me now and I gotta give them credit for tuning me into your podcast they're big friends so thank you guys and I'm also doing a I'm doing a cool custom knife with Mike Vella camp out of V knives and we're making the Trailblazer custom folder it's like the dream knife show that I never had 30 years on ops but it's an everyday carry so some stuff there and being an elk owner you'll appreciate this I'm doing some pretty cool stuff with axial precision rifles they're a long-range rifle company at Idaho they're just amazing and my partner Terry Kuhn and I are running that new 300 PRC for everything from long distance from our tactical experienced target shooting but also a good elk gun and that's that's going to kind of become my my new elk platform so cool so this is all connected to you know because of this your effort that you put out all this all these pieces are falling into place yeah and these and these groups are it's not only about good product you know but it's about them sending the same message and they are endorsing the book they're getting that message out and a lot of these groups that are that our product sponsor or anything didn't know you most people didn't so that's that's one of the really really cool things and my publisher caribou publishing and this is interesting you know I think you'll appreciate how this kind of comes together but Henry Wu and my friends over at a recoil Magazine and Gun Digest in caribou and blade show and blade magazine they're all the same entity and this book with caribou publishing was a step out an expansion book of national issues related to things they hold dear coming from a gun publication you know and written objectively not against cannabis so it's really a you know it didn't seem like the right fit when you look at it from the outside but it was perfect you know I think everybody wants the same objective right they want safety and for sure anybody who cares and loves about loves wildlife in these wild lands they they don't want this to continue they want this to be cleaned up and we've got to find a solution we do and without you guys without boots on the ground there is no solution none at all none at all and and like I said we keep unifying and we hope to just get more message out there and I'll get some changes all right day at a time buddy thank you really thanks brother thank you so much thank you really appreciate it you everybody and [Music] [Applause] [Music]
