in four three two one hey Jimmy hi Joe how you doing brother doing good now we're on the radio fantastic it's 3:30 129 minutes before 4 o'clock here's Val with the weather hot hot as fuck back to you Jimmy Bob so how we got a car fire breakdown lane so you were getting emotional in the green room listening to Henry Rollins talk about Putin you're about to quote Chomsky like yes so he was I just caught the end of my scent went in the greenroom and I like you know everybody loves Henry Rollins right and stop Henry that's why so good may be that he's constantly grinding yeah but he was doing that thing about Oh Putin do you know there was a journalist who wrote a book about him ended up dead Putin's a bad guy he's a bad guy as opposed to who well nobody you mean he's definitely a bad guy right we all agree that yeah but I mean just because other people are also bad guys doesn't negate his point of Putin being a bad guy what he was saying is just that it's very bizarre that the Republicans these people that were you know at the forefront of the Cold War these ones who really know I mean these are the people that remember Khrushchev banging on the desk you know saying we'll bury you with with Kennedy and these people are now like they're whitewashing Putin they're essentially like trying to paint out Putin to be a good guy because Trump is in this position where he's trying to be friends with this guy so well here's the quote I wanted to send you right so that whole thing if if Nuremberg Laws were applied then every post-war American president would have been hanged since says Noam Chomsky Putin kills journalists we just torture ours so I mean Chelsea Manning is a whistleblower we took Brock Obama torturer so we have our president our war we have Presidents and vice presidents who are legit war criminals that walk around today then a torture program okay so you know Barack Obama who got a Peace Prize and then he had a kill list that's right a Peace Prize winner with a killer a drone kilee would you keep the kill list next to the Peace Prize where do you keep those through things are they anyway so this way that some of the people that were killed were American citizens with no due process no due process and so nobody has a problem with Trump being buddy-buddies with Benjamin Netanyahu who is a psychopathic maniac who shoots who shoots with precision medics who are trying to help people in nurses and journalists by the way well some Israeli troops right things really troops do that that's a really depressing thing you know I had Abby Martin on and she sort of illuminated that whole situation I mean I really didn't know how bad it was nor did she until she went over there right and you know just experiencing what it's like that the the it's crazy that people that went through the Holocaust that realized the cost of dehumanizing an entire race of people now are capable at least some of them are capable of doing that to the Palestinians yeah it's it's kind of mind-blowing so I wanted to hear and I have friends who do that everyone's doing this right everyone's getting caught up in this Asteria that's why there's a word called hysteria cuz it happens and we're in one and you know what I like is what Noam Chomsky said about this Russia hysteria that's happening he said if you care about effects on our pristine elections which he said very sarcastically he said if you care about what's affecting our pristine elections the Russia gate is the last place I would look and the first place he would look if you could worried about foreign control of or influence on our government he said he would look to Israel they're the ones Benjamin Netanyahu came here and addressed the joint session of Congress without the permission or invitation of the president member when Obama was president he did that he did that that's a guy coming here to tell our guys how to vote in direct defiance of our president and everyone embraced him can you imagine the Putin did that Putin came to America and addressed our joint session of Congress against the will of the President so this idea that somehow because Putin is a bad guy Trump shouldn't have a good friendship with them is BS the guys who are really influencing our government here are Benjamin Netanyahu Saudi Arabia but Trump opened eight businesses in Saudi Arabia during the election and no one gives a crap about any of that stuff because they're our friends so Rabia by the way just bombed us school today school bus 29 kids dead so yeah I just retweeted that from Sarab Dilla so why would they do that because they're in Yemen there dude there they're bombing we're committing genocide and rent Yemen right now so we're helping Saudi Arabia committed genocide in Yemen and the way we're doing it is they're doing a thing called siege warfare which is a war crime and we did the fact they just prosecuted someone a few months ago and at The Hague for it so but since we're doing it and were the enforcers and Saudi Arabia is not in the Human Rights Council so it's assist everything's a joke now right so we've were past it where it's at farce we're living in this farce and so when I see a guy that I love like Henry Rollins saying stuff like Oh Putin's this special kind of bad I just quote back Chomsky we're out there we have nothing we have legit war criminals just one presidency away do you think he's a step removed from that though I mean he'll assassinate journalists in his own country right now so right now we're trying to assassinate Julian Assange right now yes they're trying to kill that guy yes they want at that guy dead Hillary Clinton was I can't we drone that guy can't we kill him yes she really did say that yeah she really did say that after she just got done killing Qaddafi and then laughed about it yeah that that's we played that several times you came we saw he died ha ha ha the fact that any human being would ever do that that she and by the way the way he died that's some dark shit they watch they stabbed him in the asshole right and there's a video of it I'm stabbing him in the asshole why standing there just confused not knowing what they're doing this guy's jamming a sword up his ass have you seen the video no I have not seen oh my god it's awful you want to see it no the video of them capturing him is fascinating because it's a guy who has lived with an iron fist controlled these people been a brutal dictator been a horrible monster of a human being now all the scene these rebels have captured him and they can't believe they have him and they're shooting him and stabbing him and and then eventually they have his body and they parade his body around after they've killed him but there's there's there's video of him should look at it for just for a moment because it's so stunning to see him capture and alive and can't believe that these rebels have him that it's not even it's not even like yeah you know I have seen video of him captured and in that look at his face so I know you're talking about just the guys shoving but I did not i shoving a knife up his ass I am I hit a dog with my car a while ago and I just can't have no stomach for any of that stuff anymore I just I don't saw something went something I had a real breakdown like I had we took it to the vet it lived I didn't I didn't that so I had to cook I hit a dog it killed it about a year and a half ago it might have already been dead it had been done because I think it was laying in the street because I don't know yeah he's I didn't see it so it had to be already lay in there anyways so it you know I just and then I saw I was driving to my pot store in Eagle Rock and I saw this little black pup dog run across the street in front of our car and there's this big median like a grass median and it was good and I go stop stop and the cards hasn't started coming yet the other way and I stopped so my wife stops and I jump out and I'm running and I see the cars coming and they're just I don't see the dog anymore and then I see the dog next to the curb and it's kind of like just going like like that and it just crushed me he's like even now to think of it he's twitching like yeah yes it got hit and so might we would pick that up and we'd grant and we drove to hospital as soon as we could I mean you know Animal Hospital which there was one not far away and it lived the dog lived but I couldn't believe you take it as a pet you know no no no they just might my wife called back you know to the thing and they said yeah it's gonna live and we have someone's gonna take it like oh okay thank God but like I was so surprised at how I just broke down over that puppy the dog I ran over I was like numb to but that dog for some reason it just everything open and I was just I couldn't it was such a bad puppies are so cute it was such I was just hit by a car that's such how so and so it's just like I can see and ice and I feel like I don't know if I have this but I feel like I have PTSD over that right like I weigh overreacted to that situation so there was a lot more going on there and so when someone says something like the qaddafi video you like yeah so I can't even imagine guys who have to go to war and the stuff they have to see and the things that they have to do I don't know how they all don't come up know anybody who went over there yeah I've been to Afghanistan nobody I know so but yeah I mean I'd known they not personally like they'd come to my show that kind of stuff I know those people I don't have a close friend who was actually in combat like that no I have a few close friends that have been in combat and when they start drinking and that's when you know inhibitions get loosened up and then stories start flowing and you know it's like most people but it's it's not something people are designed to see you know especially not when no one else is seeing it writing is if we all lived in the Roman times and everybody was getting sorted up every day and people getting hit with arrows all the time it's a normal part of life people start accepting the fact there's gonna be lost but there's something about living today where the majority of human beings live in this Ober safe environment that's probably a safe more safe than any people have ever lived ever and just overall in general like the the modern Western civilization but then you're going over to Afghanistan and you're you know you're dealing with bombings and schools and buses and sniper attacks and you know your buddy just lost a leg from an IEE D and you know that that kind of shit just wears on a person yeah just and any anything like oh I can't I can't believe we still do war like this it's just you know I'm very see I get in a lot of trouble because I'm anti-war and all words are bullshit I get in trouble because you're anti-war well for instance pro war at the entire establishment is pro war you know that every every newscaster is pro war if you're on if you're not pro war you don't get on TV if you're against the war you get fired like Phil Donahue like Ed Schultz like Jesse Ventura like Ashleigh Banfield fear if you tell it like Chris Hedges if you tell the truth about the war you will get from establishment news and solo establishment news that will let you talk openly other than RT RT seems to be pretty open which is really ironic that's ironic right yeah I mean when Abby Martin was working hard Till's like Jesus Christ like how's that work you know the Empire files and you're working for Russia I know it it's a crazy crazy juxtaposition it is weird ed Schultz was the one who said that you know he wasn't that he was told what to cover what not to cover at MSNBC he was told not to cover Bernie Sanders he wanted to cover Bernie Sanders anyway he said that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the head of NBC News and ELAC were joined at the hip and he tried to cover Bernie Sanders he was told not to he was yelled at by the head of MSNBC that's how he described it and a month later he was fired he was out well genk had a seer a similar situation Jack from The Young Turks Jay he was told that our friends in Washington don't like your tone oh my god that is hilarious and he was winning his timeslot and they told him that and they moved into the weekend to give out shall they this is true this is true so they moved him to the weekend and they said they wanted him to work on his presentation skills' guys winning his time fly they're saying we want you to work on your presentation skills and meanwhile who they replaced him with al Sharpton he's got great presentation skills that's all al has Sudan al sharp did you ever see him try to read a teleprompter it's brutal yeah I mean he's a great orator yeah but he's not a teleprompter reader no and it was like we was I have clips we used to make fun all the time on my show if it was hilarious and then the to find out that that's the reason they gave was because he's a better presenter he's a better or he's a great orator that's different than being a news presenter right and that is not in Al Sharpton's wheelhouse no it's just he's not the most trustworthy person either I mean he's got a history of deception so you having no the way he got that job yeah well how about the way he became famous the Tawana Brawley case I mean he became famous through deception and so you're seeing this guy who was basically a famous con man who's now on television on an News program well they had they have there's a lot of look at Brian Williams yes I mean back they dark in the air yes he has the 11th hour on MSNBC so this is everybody forgotten everybody has forgotten I get his punishment was he had to he had to go spend six months giggling with Rachel Maddow what did they do these shows they got like these around tables at the other and he has to laugh and pretend they all pretend fucked up about him he all he had to do is tell the truth and I'm scary enough no shit yeah I mean you were in Iraq you really were there you really were there yeah I mean you really were there or Afghanistan was at Iraq or Afghanistan I think it was Iraq and you really shots were fired Hillary did the same goddamn thing oh that's right she lied about being shot at it's fuckin straight-up lied about being in Bosnia right yes she was and and who was it the it was the comedian who outed her it was Sinbad yeah it was Sinbad who was on that trip and he's like oh she was busted straight up lying about being shot at so it's just it's always shocking to me when I find out that politicians are lying isn't it something usually true they're all dirt that's weird it's it's such a only the purest of people are drawn to that but freshmen it's whenever I find out their narcissistic smegal is not a statistic megalomaniacs I'm always sure you know what it is Jimmy we're weeding out the bad apples and then we're eventually gonna get to the good ones yeah we just gotta get rid of these bad ones first so that's why it comes back to when he was talking about how Putin he's like hey I want to tell Trump slow down don't be friends with this guy no I want Trump to be friends with Putin because he's a nuclear power I want Trump to be friends with anybody we need a tunt you know NATO is the one wrapping up tensions ramping up tensions with Russia and we have ever since the Cold War and supposedly ended and so you know was Justin feet anyway so I just think yes Putin is a bad guy they're all bad guys right there's why you know I just had John Kerry aaku on my show I don't know is he so he is ex-cia guy he went to prison because he exposed a torture program yeah so Robert Miller actually prosecuted that guy so now he's he's a member of veterans intelligence professionals for sanity VIPs and they were they were invented or they were originally organized to debunk the weapons of mass destruction about Iraq so they were intelligence professionals who knew what was happening that this we're being sold a bill of goods because the military-industrial complex wanted its war right and so they they were like all the top guys ray mcgovern bill Binney and they and they created this organization to help debunk it well know penny is the guy who was the first whistleblower for the NSF yes correct they tried to throw in the FBI tried to throw him in jail and of course he's the smartest guy the NSA ever had so he outsmarted the FBI well how did he do that so he had the story but I forget the story he told it to me but they had them secretly recorded saying certain things and so when they tried to show the evidence against him he's like actually I got you guys and they're like oh shit and so they could it so he had him so he outsmarted them and he tells the story on my show you know was about a year ago so I don't remember exactly I went but he told me a lot of mind-blowing stuff on my show a lot of stuff just a you know like about how they spy on us well he was the one that first exposed this program that was essentially spying on every single email every single voicemail every single conversation that you have is being recorded so William Binney invented a thing called thin thread so thin thread was a data collection so what he did is he hooked up every cell phone to every cell phone in the in the universe its I and he did it and it was hard to do and everybody said you couldn't do it he did it and so he knew that metadata what was more predictive than say if I tap your phone and listen to your actual phone conversation they actually learned more by looking at a larger data set and when when when contacts start happening that means movements happening that means an attack is gonna happen that means more so if the metadata means more and so he found a way to track people and keep your identities secret so it was constitutional that's what he cared about the Constitution and my right to privacy and thinthread did that it was a better and and they got rid of thin thread and a couple weeks later 9/11 happened so that's what built so that - bill Benny is and so he said they got rid of it because there's billions of dollars in the nupro they brought in a much I think was called trailblazer and not as good as a tracker not as good as a metadata thing and but it was you know it's five six billion dollars - Booz Allen and whoever invented it and that's what it's is all about this is all about money and you don't want to disappoint people who want to have a lot of money paid their way and then so that's what so he blew the whistle on that and they come back at them and they try to put him if that's what they do to whistleblowers that's what we do so that's funny to hear him saying oh if somebody wrote a bad book about Putin and they ended up dead what do you think we do in this country look what they did to Chelsea Manning look what we did to people who expose war crimes inside of our country right now we're trying to try and assassinate Julian Assange they haven't been basically solitary confinement we literally did torture Chelsea Manning so and then you know Brock Obama used he prosecuted lots of whistleblowing journalists using the UNAM blanking on the word it's called but Espionage Act so this idea that's yeah I'm sure Putin maybe Putin did maybe that woman who wrote that book about Putin has a lot of powerful enemies usually you do when you are that kind of an a journalist where you're exposing the powerful she probably didn't just expose Putin so she probably exposed a lot of people my point being is that you know now who's being naive gay well I mean she probably did expose a lot of people but it's also very likely the Putin had her killed yeah yes I'm not I'm not denying that yeah Barack Obama had a kill list yeah so these guys are out you know he took us from two wars to seven he did Libya turn it into a failed state right now they have open slave trading no you watch it on YouTube yeah so dark and they want to do it again they want to do it in Syria they want so Joe let me ask you a question if we get rid of Assad in Syria do you know who takes over the Jesus that's right Jesus is that who starts running things Moses he's your own Belka al Qaeda al nusra yeah so that the power vacuum that always happens the Wahhabi terrorists funded by Saudi Arabia that's who takes over and I have videotape after videotape of our top a fish admitting that Saudi Arabia funds Isis and that we also did so and that we created we created al-qaeda we got we created an Isis was created because of our invasion of Iraq but then we actually fund them and we shipped them arms so for what reason to overthrow Assad so we can put a pipeline through Syria so we fund them so that they fight Assad but then Saudi Arabia funds this isn't the first time we did that we funded al Qaeda so they would fight the Russians right so this is same and then we live with them when was the Mujahideen that's when they were the Musha yes Lucia Hadean mm-hmm so and I have videotapes of Hillary Clinton screaming about this we created this problem she says this on video I have it so that's why I get in trouble because I tell the truth about the war and if you tell the truth about the war you'll be called a conspiracy theorist by the establishment news that's exactly what's happened that happened to me are you conspiracy theorists no that's what they say well you know what the biggest because I tell the truth about Syria right the biggest conspiracy of my lifetime was the Iraq war that was a conspiracy yeah that's a conspiracy yeah I mean that's one you can actually prove right I mean I used to have a whole bit about it I used to have a whole bit about like that they're the only way to find out if someone was like from 2005 it was that the reason why they put George Bush in power is the only way to find out if someone was really stupid is to put an actual stupid guy in his president and find out if everybody freaks out cuz the only way to really tell and we were like well we could put a smart guy in there and have MACT I'm like no no no we'll never know we'll never know get it we get a dumb guy let's just try it out and see what happens and then it was all the whole thing about us going to war in Iraq like why did we go to the war over there and what did we tell them and they bought that holy shit the and then it was he won again he won again fuck and I go and you know there's someone in the back of the room going I think we can go dumber and that became Trump that's I mean that was from 2005 from my Showtime special from 13 years ago so let me tell you something Trump it will be allowed to be President and was allowed to be president because he's doing the bidding of the establishment they're on board with most of the stuff he's doing there like that he's he's not rep he's not pulling back on any of the Wars he's they've all ramped up the military budget isn't it funny Joe they're not protecting him from Muir they're not protecting him from this this investigation well he's nothing's happened right though again it's and by the way what they've got him on is all regular corruption like I said Trump is corrupt yes he's corrupt he's corrupt with Coe Saudi Arabia he's corrupt with Russia he's corrupt with Israel he's get they're all corrupt but he's a the Clinton Foundation there they're all what the Chomsky quote they'd all be hung if we applied the Nuremberg standards so this is the world we're living in so this idea that somehow we need to focus extra on Trump and somehow boot and you know what journalists the anti-putin journalists in Russia will tell you that we're a bunch of numskulls over here because we're inflating Putin's power so we are blood like he's this all-powerful guy who's got his finger in every decision everywhere at all times Alyssa Milano's now blaming the Green Party being controlled by the Russians for an Ohio election a special election I'm not getting I could see the tweet it links the Milano you think I and I who doesn't love Alyssa Milano right he's beautiful doesn't she's one of the prettiest of all time I met her in a hotel once did you really wandering through the hotel we were got an elevator together so here I can't believe them in a hotel mmm hello hello back that was it did she know you were she says you know what sucks because of our unwillingness to pass policy that protects our election integrity I immediately think the Green Party vote stand tonight's our Russian meddling why else would Eddy would cast a protest vote in Ohio when there's so much at stake so much at stake that's so delusional like what is a protest vote what's your vote worth if everyone votes and they all vote green is that a protest it's like is it possible that the Green Party can win like you have no faith so what they're doing is essentially just bowing down to a rigged system saying the system's rigged so just vote for side B even though side a and B are funded by the same people I know I know but ideologically side B is our side that's what she's saying so what they've gone past so now the hashtag resistance have gone beyond voter shaming and now what they're actually doing is democracy shaming you don't get to participate in democracies and those people so let me tell you something people say oh you know the Greens take away vote I would not have voted in the presidential election if I did not have the opportunity to vote for the Green Party right so those votes you don't own those votes the way electoral politics works is that if you don't have enough votes to win you have to go get them and you have to appeal to those votes but they don't have an appeal to voters the Democratic Party they have nothing and so what they have left is fear and voter shaming and that's it now they're actually shaming democracy well you would also think that by the toe after we've gotten through this past election where no one literally no one in the mainstream media then maybe Fox News predicted that Trump was gonna win no one's they all were a hundred percent sure right Hillary was gonna win they were they were had in the 90 percent range of probability of her winning and they were displaying it on CNN so they know that that's wrong so why would someone think that a Green Party candidate has to be or a libertarian candidate has to be a protest vote why can't it be a real vote at this point when you're talking about the kind of social media outreach that that is capable today that's possible today for you a person who has some really good points and as a real look at this woman who won in New York the 28 year old girl is a Democratic Socialist I like Alexandria Cosmo says look if dad doesn't tell you like this world is changing in a radical way and upstarts and and people who are huge underdogs have the possibility of winning it's not a protest vote it's an actual vote and if everybody who thinks this way votes towards that protest vote guess what they win that's right that's what it is so I used to have a joke I would say no you can't vote for you can't vote for a third party candidate until a lot of people are already voting for a third party candidate that's what they say you can't vote so they have no chance to win so you have to wait till a lot of people are already so that you people don't understand that inherent contradiction and by the way people maybe if you spent a tenth of the energy trying to excite the half of the country that doesn't vote yeah as you do and trying to voter shame progressives or Green Party or environmentalist for not giving you their vote which you do not fucking own right if you were to spend a tenth of the energy trying to excite people who don't participate do participate instead of shaming the people who do participate maybe you'd get somewhere it's also this reluctance to admit that both sides are corrupt is this a very strange thing that exists on people who operate within this narrow bandwidth and this narrow bandwidth is whatever side you're on whether it's you're on the right of the left this is the side that you want to win and it's the right side and they're the good people and the other side even though well even though our side does wrong this side does worse and they operate in this real narrow bandwidth this is why she would think something that's possibly negative for her side is a protest vote instead of being your actual feelings on the issue and if these people really cared about voting integrity wouldn't they want paper ballots if they really cared about voter integrity wouldn't they want rank choice voting when they want that then you don't you don't you don't have to worry about this choice voting rank choice so they have it in Maine now right so it's where so you know you you get to this is my first choice this is my second choice this is my third choice so you don't get to so it eliminates that you're a spoiler right yeah so and and they voted in in Maine and the politicians of course don't want it so they got rid of it and they had to court reinstate it they had I think it's happened twice now how does it work in terms of like say if you're gonna vote for you know governor of Maine you have a first choice a second choice let's say there's three choices right so you get to you get to say well let's say let's say if your first choice was a Green Party candidate you okay that's my first choice but my second choice would be the Democrat so in and my center choice would be you know maybe nobody and so does like second choice have different points so if you that if your first choice doesn't get enough votes to win then your second choice goes right so that's how it works so you're never wasting your vote and you know what's ironic is that and I might have you know there's bit people who can better explain that so plea I know people are gonna admit Jamie the way better way to say that there's better ways but the thing that kills me is that Bernie Sanders his whole career was about being an independent and I have videotapes of him saying you know what kills me as I go I do I do these four talks and I think dr. people they come up to me after these debates and they say you know I like what you said and you you make the most sense but I can't vote for you cuz you're never gonna win I hate that they go I want to waste my vote off there's one thing I hate more than that'sthat's phrase waste your vote this was what he was saying his entire career until now and I want to know why I want to know what the hell does Bernie Sanders in 2018 know that Bernie Sanders in 2006 didn't know and Bernie Sanders in 1996 doesn't know and he tells everybody who got to run and he's you know getting people to come into the Democratic Party which is actively cheating them yet he's deluding him and him and he still runs as an independent in Maine I mean in Vermont he still runs it everybody said you got you can't he gets to run as an independent he gets the running isn't independent while representing the Democratic Party yes yes so they have a special sweetheart deal is what is he saying when he says he's saying now that protest votes are a waste like was he saying he told everybody vote for Hillary he told her I mean he's not starting a third party and you know his whole life he was like he said that we have to have the the verbage he used one time I saw him was that you know Jesse Jackson's correct we need we need a rainbow coalition of people but it has to happen outside of the Democratic Party he said that that was him so we have to have a progressive coalition but it has to happen outside and who better to lead it but Bernie Sanders so that's why it's hard to start a third party because you need people who are already pop famous and popular and in government so if he left and he got say Tulsi Gabbard and Nina Turner and Alexandra Cosmo court and he got a bunch of people that are super popular on the left we'd have a third party and that would be polling at 10-15 percent and now the Democrats would have to form a coalition instead of what they're doing now which is ignoring progressives after she cheated Bernie Sanders after the Democrats cheated Bernie Sanders in the primary Hillary Clinton didn't choose Bernie Sanders as her vice president as a olive branch she didn't choose Elizabeth Warren as an bread she went to her right she got tim kaine was to the right of her who's anti-union whose everything bad thing you want in the corporate Democrat he's prolong the whole deal she went so just so if we had a third party that actually pulled at ten or fifteen percent they would have to they couldn't do that anymore they'd have to they'd have to do a thing called joke voter outreach instead of voter shaming or it's what it's devolved to now which is democracy shaming they're literally shaming people for participating in democracy you don't get to participate in democracy because you're a third party will fuck you that's called democracy and so yes I do and I get to vote my conscience and we'll be right back break that break right there solid on a radio show that would be the way to go hey one of the reasons why we came in today is because we wanted to talk about the Alex Jones situation I know you were not just a vocal critic of Alex Jones you spit in his face on live internet no I did not spit in his face that was completely involuntary he coughed and liquid came out of your mouth as you know Alex Jones is hilarious there's no doubt there's no denying that he's occasionally very hilarious yes and I told you what happened I was walking up he's having this they're just about to go fisticuffs the whole time yeah and as I walk up he goes hey I've just tried to be nice and I had a mouthful iced tea and that was that that's my story I'm sticking to it good story you know in Trump meant to say would would actually say would yeah yeah actually What did he say I don't see any reason why they would but he meant to say would is yeah that was one of the worst lies I think anybody has ever told on television in front of millions of people that was a disturbing lie because in the context of the words and the way he was communicating it's very clear is very clear he meant to say would it may it was it was disconcerting to me for a different reason it was disconcerting to me because it showed that he think MIT got him to cave yeah someone talked to him someone pulled them aside and said do you understand what the fuck is going on here by the way when they go oh he did he trump contradicted our intelligence communities in public in Helsinki and that's reason no asswipe that's not treason the president sets our foreign policy you're not supposed to contradict the fucking president whatever the president says goes and I hate fucking saying this because I'm not a fucking fan of Donald Trump but goddamn it did we all lose our head and think that the unelected spies run our foreign policy they do not yeah spies spies our spies unelected yeah so and the ones who led us into Iraq let's not forget that the very do anyway don't do you ever play that video I played almost weekly on my show of Robert Miller lying about weapons of mass destruction to Congress to get us into the Iraq war well he was misinformed at the time he wasn't aware of all the information and you know him along with : Powell and many others yeah they're just good guys who did that better for me good people good people do it in a bad those those no-bid contracts at Halliburton got for billions and billions of dollars it's just because they were the right ones for the job I mean why have bids when you've got Halliburton and you've got a guy was really close to Halliburton Dick Cheney who used to be the CEO of Halliburton as the vice president you got a sweet deal here take advantage of it and Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a 30 million dollar downpayment when he became vice president give me a nice gun don't shoot your friend the face that's how used to do a bit about that too he's shot his friend in the face and his friend apologize friend apologize yeah that's how gangster Dick Cheney is I should have been there I look like a bird the whole thing was so fucking crazy you know we were talking about Alex Jones on the platform yeah I mean it seems to be like across the board like there it's almost they waited for Apple seems like and when Apple pulled them from iTunes and then you know YouTube had danced with it right they'd given him some strikes it was really recently like within the last case but juice yeah Facebook had given him some strikes and YouTube gave him some strikes and people like hey you know there was some I felt like almost like unfounded speculation that they would remove him from the platform I said man forget him remove him that's crazy that's too far and then all of a sudden boom everybody in one fell swoop Spotify spot if I remove him they were yes they did right iTunes removed him but there's a loophole though that somebody I saw an article today where people I'd want nothing but less than total destruction that Apple attacked Alex Jones and got rid of him but they offered him a safety net in the form of the app that he has on their their App Store that they're still so they're trying to take that down to like take down his his show became instantly way more popular oh I'm sure so okay the unintended consequences I try to tell people that you know I'm not defending Alex Jones I'm defending you know the principle of freedom of speech you know people who are convicted of killers are on death row they still get their freedom of speech you're allowed to print articles and they're allowed to have you know I mean they're still allowed well he's allowed to still I mean he hasn't been silenced he has his website but he could put his show out on his website he can he could host it from his website and it could all be fine but these major media companies now they just decided we've had enough we don't want this on and here's the thing like I don't know what he said that that they would there was a straw that broke the camel's back it seemed like it's not a recent statement just go to the court transcript and we'll figure out oh there wasn't there's no hearing or no there wasn't a judicial hearing there was no come on they do they just what they they let some jag off billionaire in the middle of the night on a whim fuckin do this is that what happened yeah you think that's what it is there was some billionaire or do you think it's the middle managers and the Perdue you know the executives at all these giant tech companies that just decided I don't know it's it's definitely the government tells Facebook what to do a lot of times right and so they bow to the government all the time because they don't want to be regulated right so that's why they just they just started having hearings with the that's why they had those hearings should we regulate Facebook so those hearings by the way were fucking bizarre it was like a guy pretending to be human you know it was like some sort of a robot or an alien the way he would sip water he would take like this like a fucking sips water it was like a guy spitting dip into a glass he would go I did it was the weirdest little sips someone should make a compilation of Zuckerberg sips of water whoever is that guy who makes tech compilations of your show he does a good job there's a funny joke about those okay no senator no sir watch this up watch that sip give me another one else oh there is one watch him sip who fucking sips water like that it's like he has to think about it mmm yeah act normal be human humans drink water drink look how slowly he tilted that glass him and the guy behind him have the same color tie mm-hmm mmm that's the guy they're gonna shoot in the head keeping eye contact while he's drinking the water it's kind of weird yeah trying to at least fantastic that that whole thing was so strange it was so okay what a better guide to us to keep to protect us from fake news and tell us what's real news and and you know what's has integrity and what doesn't then a guy who made a couple of billion dollars off a stole an idea from his friends I mean I think that's the perfect guy to be the true story is that what he were actually did he I think that's what was in the movie right that was in the movie that's what I know I didn't see the movie okay yeah I know the story though was that he ripped people off that it wasn't his idea but he was the one who figured out a way to wrestle it yeah Green I don't know get Rich's fart but this is Matt Taibbi wrote an article on this second August 2nd about this and there's been a lot of people being the platform from Facebook that you don't know about looking like this isn't like okay so here's here's what he's they shut down lots of other side set the behest of the government and Israel like the and the Atlantic Council so pages like black elevation they got shut down a page called mindful being they got shut down a Facebook also wiped out no unite the right to it which is a page appearing to advertise a counter rally on the upcoming you know anniversary of the violence and Charlotte Phil so they shut that down to mats how you beat let me just give you a quick quote from his article he says Facebook was helped in its efforts to wipe out these dangerous memes by the Atlantic Council on whose board you'll find confidence-inspiring names like Henry Kissinger CIA Chief Michael Hayden former acting CIA it had Michael Morell and former Bush era homeland security chief Michael Chertoff these people now have their hands on what is essentially a direct lever over nationwide news distribution it's hard know to state the potential mischief that lurks behind this Union of Internet platforms and would-be government censors at Kennedy's read you one more paragraph because this is this is exactly what we're talking about he says it is already a scandal that these de facto private media regulators have secret algorithmic processes that push down some news organizations in favor of others which they do witness the complaints by outlets like alternate TruthDig and others that big platforms have been de-emphasizing alternative sites in the name of combating fake news but this week's revelation is worse when Facebook works with the government and want to want to be star chamber organizations like the Atlantic Council to delete sites on national security grounds using secret methodology it opens the door to nightmare possibilities that you'd only find in dystopian novels so he goes on and it's it's awesome what he says but we would have more comfort if they would I mean there's no like one of the things that they're doing is they use that blanket term hate speech yes oh by the way so now they're trying to put a bill have you heard about this in Congress to make police a protected class of people so if you say shit about them now it's considered hate speech did you know that what yeah they're trying to make people yes so fuck the police would be considered hate speech so they would just retroactively the arrest nwa they could and about i steven cop-killer remember a motherfucking cop killer and so now that I do have a rally that's against the police that's a hate rally yeah and they can take your YouTube channel down if you said hate stuff about the cops and so so that that's where we are hate speech the fuck how come I'm not allowed to hate shit by the way right I hate Nazis can I say I hate fucking Nazis I hate the KKK can I say I hate them that's right Beach I strongly dislike the KKK I can strongly dislike something I when I was a kid I hated the fucking Dodgers I know hates because I was a Cubs fan and the daughters Oaks kicked its fish hate speech is a strange blanket term almost like drugs yeah like drugs is caffeine but it's also heroin you know it's like drugs what's wrong with you I don't understand what is there's hate out there so what so what's right so by the way I but it's a bad way of expressing things like hate speech is it's it's not a good descriptive because I agree when you you stop what is it entail like you know I had a conversation with a woman at YouTube about Sam Harris and Douglas Murray in a podcast where they had had a conversation and someone put it on their YouTube channel in their playlist just put it in their playlist and they got a Community Guidelines draw I asked I asked why and the woman said very cleanly it was hate speech and I said what are you talking about I could did you listen to it is it to intellectuals who to public intellectuals discussing immigration and some of the problems that Europe is having right now and you decided that that's hate speech and you don't even know what they said but that but the fact that she so confidently described it in that way sort of it sort of embodies what this problem is is that they have these blanket terms they'd rather throw on problems and there's a million other fires to put out so there's no more needing to put any more consideration into this this guy is a problem this is problematic this is hate speech shut it down people don't realize how bad it is feral you do because you know this story yeah but people go oh good for alex jones he shouldn't be able to do that's enough what he's doing not good I'm like do not understand that this is the shot across the bow that if they can do this too Alex Jones that they're coming I've already been trashed by the establishment meaty by the Washington Post by CNN I've already been equated to pedophiles and those kind of things and conspiracy theorists and I put in articles with Alex Jones they've done it to me so because I tell the truth about the war and so the antidote to bad speech if you really hate what Alex Jones is doing the antidote to bad speech is not censorship the antidote to bad speech is more speech if using speech if you think what Alex Jones is doing needs to be debunked create a Facebook page called debunking Alex Jones and debunk him right Neal Kyle kolinsky does that kind of stuff all the time people do that stuff all the time that's how you convert if you're afraid of an idea you don't shut down the idea you expose the idea and you can bunk it but if you have a private platform and you own this you start a business and your business is putting up YouTube videos and you decide that someone is putting up something that's hurtful and damaging and racist and it could be used to attack large groups of people and then you see like all the craziness that's been connected to the alt-right movement and you associate that with this individual do you have to keep that on your platform I mean there's no regulation right now no not like that public utilities or it should be though that's my point my point is that 70% of the people get their news from Google of Facebook and they're monopoly right so they've lined up ballistic powers 70% yeah that's that was a that was a stat I read today so you can't it's like well it's written that I don't know if I believe it hey they took they took yeah they took why do you think it's a stress it's a lot of it says 45% of the people get it straight from Facebook that means a hundred and fifty million people are on Facebook every single day yeah I think that's not accurate no but I think that's right but when they get there we don't know three people in this room art so that's numbering people right here that are but I get my news from Google somehow I have that Google app on my phone and every every day I go to it in the morning when I'm taking a shit and I go over like what's crazy today what's happened Oh new Porsche coming out Sacha Baron Cohen do one census well let's see what they said I just looked at its what it said 45% I get from from Facebook according to is it a Gallup poll it was it according to their stats and I went back to read another Rolling Stone article to find out well right yeah it's a bunch of like Facebook article selling advertisements trying to find a dish so even even even if you quibble with those you we can't tonight like Alex Jones cannot now go well just go to the other YouTube hey just go to the other Facebook there is another so we have to recognize that the way we are organized as a society that the town square is now owned by corporations who'd that need to be regulated right like if like before if you know when AT&T was the phone carrier for everybody they couldn't go I'm not gonna give Alex Jones a phone service because I don't like the shitty saying okay that so you know we you can't deny services somebody all that stuff that's not really valid comparison because the phone service wasn't distributed information to people right the phone service is just a method of communication it was just a utility with what he's been able to do through Infowars is if you've got him on your platform he's gonna say some things and he's gonna use your platform to say some things that you know might not be true it might be crazy so you got to decide like when does it become a problem and I think where they drew the line with Sandy Hook so here's what I say Joe we need to treat these as public utilities because they are right Facebook there is no alternative there is an alternative to YouTube we need to regulate them it's long overdue by the way and they are monopolies we that's obvious to everyone that their monopolies but you know when you when you invent something called whatsapp and then Facebook buys it for twenty billion dollars there's AB innopolis there's no way there's no way to to compete with these people so these are monopolies they need to be regulated and people need to be protected and it it that's how that's where we need to go because right now we're leaving it up to the whims of a billion I'll you say hey if Alex Jones really did some shit that was wrong and he should be taken up or his free speech should be a bridge for it do it let's see it go to a court or go to a thing or go people go well he docks his people and he is if Daxing is illegal he should be prosecuted if that's what happened but you shouldn't take away did he docks people that's what they're saying they're saying he's died he's wanted he docks people from new town or whatever from the school shooting so that's what we talked about the individuals that he gave their addresses in their names that's what they were saying that he ducky but let's let's find out if you actually did that does that sounds get raised II I I'm I don't know if he did but they're not saying what he actually did this is what's crazy I keep hearing that he promoted the idea that Sandy Hook was a false it was false and then it was a false flag and that these were all actors right I don't know if he actually said that I think what he actually said was I don't know if that happened I think that's what he actually said and people are saying well that's promoting the idea that that it was a hoax somehow but I want to know if that's what he really said see I don't know if that's even the case because I've heard it I've heard it written that he promoted the idea that Sandy Hook was a conspiracy but I they're not quoting then when they say that there's no quotes there's no Sandy Hook was a hoax those kids were actors those kids are not dead I don't see that anywhere right but they keep attributing that to him without quotation but again if this if there was some kind of process due process we could go back and look at the transcript and we would notice not only that if during this whole time where he's being tried he was still labeled to be on YouTube and have his videos he could show in his videos that he didn't say that he could show what he actually said and tell you what he actually said and show clips he can't do that anymore so now the narrative is completely in the hands of the mainstream media 100% so the alex jones narrative is being taken 100% out of his hands and now it's in the mainstream media and now there's Sandy Hook denier conspiracy theorists right-wing lunatic all these different things which Mayor some of it I mean Alex my fucking nuts my point is we've had nuts people with a still of that when I was a kid joke maybe you remember Johnny Carson used to go apeshit about the National Enquirer yes remember that and it was a big deal he would stop his show and I'm putting my foot down about this yeah they still have the National and nobody said take it out of the supermarkets nobody was like we got a band that newspaper because we can't handle the ideas from this newspaper that they're still right there you go to Ralph's they're right there they're the last thing you see before they leave they're right at the eye level for kids yeah nobody what says take away the National Enquirer I went to Facebook they still have a Facebook page that National Enquirer yes yes so does the world news daily and you know what the first news news story was that came up on your news dailies was a British man can only defecate through his mouth that was the first story that came up the first story and you don't have to look for it British man defecates through his mob buddies this is like South Park right yeah and it's not like you want them to be taken down as well but it's what's interesting is like World nudes daily and Star Magazine and all those they've sort of been there a joke like you know it's not real you know The Enquirer is not real but we know that but it's not it's it's just nobody's buying those somebody's buying those right but are they buy are they kind of buying I'm somebody one in Urdu somebody watches professional wrestling here goes lawsuit quotes Jones sayings yeah so Sandy Hook is a synthetic completely fake is is a thin synthetic completely fake with actors in my view manufactured okay right January 13th 2015 the lawsuit quotes Jones saying yeah so sandy yeah so Sandy Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors in my view manufactured yeah yeah that you actually nail that impression I spent a lot of time with that dude drunk if there's a he's like that's that's a real problem saying something like that it's crazy but he's look he his whole business is saying things that are sometimes right and saying things that are sometimes absolutely wrong you know and and that and yeah all wild and it's all globalists and you see that song that they did where these guys took his actual words and rants but then they have like this like emo song singing the words no it's fucking genius when we get pulled over you off of youtube if we play that let's find out if we get yanked for this one because it's brilliant cuz it's it's a parody but it's so it's Saudi folk song yeah you said you must sign enough first to indie folk emo just you know some low testosterone music play listen to this listen s that's why we're doing simple things pointing out that were meant to be in nature it be natural and this is where we find the source that God made to transcend the New World Order and that's why they want to try to keep us out of it watch this [Music] [Laughter] what oh you taking the audio of Alex Jones rants as an indie folk song for people that are just listening to this YouTube oh my god you know I think there's something there's something about his struggle right now that's representative of the chaotic world that we live in that that he does have this giant voice than he does is that have his giant following and that it is this this his actual words come out and song like that and are so hysterical and that they think that somehow another yanking this guy off of all these platforms is gonna like remove it do they understand the Streisand effect cuz this is just gonna it's there's gonna be another way but what's this try said effect Barbra Streisand had a house in Malibu just giant ass house they took pictures of it and she went apeshit and you know complained to all these you know newspapers and complained to the police and everything that they're taking photos of her house and get the fuck out of here this I'm Barbra Streisand and because of that it became a giant story that Barbra Streisand is pissed if someone's showing her house and they're like well it must be a hell of a house where is it and then there it is the Streisand effect is a phenomenon there's the house we're we're by an attempt to hide remove or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more wildly usually facilitated by the Internet okay yeah but on prey again people are make the fall sequelae you're defending Alex Jo I'm not defending you're defending free speech I'm defending free speech and I understand the argument that hey it's a private corporation I get that I get that but if you took a look at the bigger picture these should be everyone thinks the Internet should be a public utility I mean most people do and that's what they're upset that they're not treating it like a public utility Obama administration did they decided to at the last minute and so if you think the Internet should be a public until I said I think YouTube and Facebook should be a public utility also and but there's the there's an opening for other people to make their own YouTube like make a version of it if you have an efficient capital but you don't and there's something and if you do start it they'll just buy you out like I just showed you the example of whatsapp with then they give you 20 night with 19 billion dollars on whatever they pay for some crazy so that's they just eat up their competition right now we need to Teddy Roosevelt to come along and break up all these monopolies it's never gonna happen the end of the Empire is coming so here's the question like is there a valid parallel of valid comparison like are there people that have things that are more hateful that are on YouTube that haven't been deep platformed is it the influence that he has that that's terrifying is it the fact that he's a figurehead this kind of stuff is that what it is like that he's that this whole Infowars movement is in some people's mind a figurehead for this pro-trump thing they're trying to stop and silence like what is it I don't know it's very curious that it all happened at the same time right and because of there's a there's a in 1996 there was a law passed that actually insulates the platforms from being sued did you know that so like if someone puts up something and selects say he put something up that leads to someone getting killed right now look you can sue you can't sue YouTube you can't sue Facebook for it that's in that 1996 law so there's that so I get that they're a private company but again they have to have the protection of the law they have Congress protecting them so they have a certain type of regulation you're regulating from you can't sue them Yeah right so I'm looking for this tweet by Glenn Greenwald that really because if we're gonna take down here I'll find it I'll find it here it is he says there's been a tactic of sensors for centuries they start with someone who is so utterly hated and marginalized that everyone is blinded by their hatred for the first censorship target that they cheer and forget that they're endorsing a principle and power that will then expand yeah and so right now they came for the Jews yeah right now we're allowing the whim of billionaires in the middle of the night to decide who gets to be on these monopolistic platforms and who doesn't if there was 10 YouTube's no one would care but there isn't there's one YouTube there's one Facebook and they are monopolies and that's the world we live in right now and that's why they're doing whatever the government wants them to because they don't want the government to regulate them that's why he went there and was sip in the water like that entry trying to make ID tag to contact him be nice cuz he doesn't want them to regulate him he'll do it for out dude Julian Assange in 2010 gave a speech which I saw recently on a plane where he predicted this he was like the corporation's are an extension of the government and they will do the censorship in the future and that's exactly what's happening right now so do you think is the government that censoring Alex Jones because I would think that the government that's in power currently would want to keep Alex Johnson because he's a supporter of Trump he's a supporter of you know why did so white is why is Trump going after Julian Assange it's because he's afraid he'll expose him someday I don't know why is he allowing the CIA to do that to go after Julian Assange and you know that just shows you how shitty the journalists in are in America because not one of them are standing up for Julian Assange and they're all pretending that when Trump says mean things about Jim Acosta that somehow that's this unbelievable violation of our freedom agree and our press and he's got you son of a bitch you don't care if you cared about freedom of the press you would say something about Julian Assange and no one is saying what lie has Julian Assange ever printed not never never been improved never what did Julian Assange do he revealed that our election was being rigged by the Democratic Party not Russia but by the Democratic Party and that is a sin you can't commit you cannot tell the truth about the powerful and that's what's happening right now and you know he revealed the CIA within has all those spying techniques but that they can get your TV to listen to you your phone vault seven all that stuff he revealed that's why they want to get him but I and Trump you know I just think that Trump is just you know he's not really clued in right he's let's other he's glad to let the generals do the job and his four underlings he doesn't really want he wants to paint broad strokes and lets everyone you want to kill Julia sons go ahead I don't give a half that's I think how he feels I don't think it's his plan to do it but everybody else underneath it wants to and certainly the intelligence community and everyone forgets this Chuck Schumer went on Rachel Maddow Show like two years ago and right out in public said that Trump is making a mistake by crossing the intelligence community because when you mess with them they have six ways to Sunday to mess with you back holy shit and nobody cared that he said that so what he's saying is the president should be afraid of unelected spooks unelected bureaucrats the he's no they should be should be afraid of them that is and no one went what what the eff could you imagine saying that about Barack Obama hey Barack Obama better be nice to the CIA they're gonna f with him as an elected official yeah yes he was officials saying that almost all sanctioning it yes and then we have Eugene Robinson in the Washington Post writing an article begging the deep state to undermine about Trump's foreign policy did you see that article no yes Pulitzer prize-winner first they spend all their life denying there is a deep state and then Eugene Robinson writes an article begging the deep state to defy President President Trump are they so blinded by ideology that they don't see the consequences there's unintended consequences and here they are and but they're coming at they've already come for me they're already coming for the left that this is how this is how this works so again that's why I warned all my friends about the Russia gate nonsense Chomsky said if you care about the people meddling in our election Russia would be the last place I would look the first place to look is concentrated capital that's what dictates who are gonna be our government that's why we don't have the things the rest of the world has because we have a cup cut capital has captured our government which is why we don't have Medicare for all which is why we don't have free college which is why we don't have an infrastructure plan which is why we're in a wars meanwhile people have two countries poorer low income 63% of the country can't afford $1,000 emergency and quarter of all kids are in poverty in the richest country in the world Joe what do you call a system that takes the richest country in the world and renders half of its population poor or low-income that's a failed fucking system and that's what we're living in right now and it's failing worldwide now if you or someone like Google though or who owns YouTube or if you were iTunes or any of these platforms that have Spotify when you get an overwhelming volume of complaints about someone who's in the news right now because the fact that Alex Jones is being sued by the Sandy Hook parents this is what started this all off because it mean right to people this is so egregious these poor parents lost their children and here's yeah it's horrible saying that it's fake and that they don't want that on their platform so would you think that they should just delete the episode that has that that says that should they do that or should they allow that episode no they scream I so here's the solution if there's if he did do some thing in a video that is illegal hmm take that video down until it gets adjudicated you don't the platform 100 you don't give them the death penalty right so okay what about like storm front what if you got like some white supremacist group that's calling for violence against people you take them down I think you would again you would have to I would like to see in some kind of adjudication you know again I the blanket policies things saying things like hate speech right again it's all interpretation and by just a week ago Mark Zuckerberg was defending it he was defending that that we have Holocaust deniers on our platform Holocaust deniers Joe and that's not fake news that's knocking your not gonna take that down like I just told you they have guys defecating out of their mouth they have this thing they had they have the the the the National Enquirer they're so cool so this is a very squiggly line Joe and again there's there's no board there's no adjudication it's not transparent it's not transparent it's not rational either it's not a rational debate let me just the sheer let me just give you one more thing about what he says when who's mrs. Matt Taibbi he says the sheer market power of these companies over information flow has always been the real threat this is why breaking them up she'd have long ago become a national priority instead as was obvious during the Senate hearing with Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year politicians are more interested in using than curtailing the power of these companies the platform for their part will cave rather than be regulated the endgame here couldn't be clearer this is how authoritarianism that people who believe that he's a Sandy Hook denier and they read those words they don't want him to have a platform they don't want him to be able to spread that hate they understand that they would feel like imagine being one of those parents and you lost your kid and you're you're seeing this guy on TV or on YouTube saying it's all fake it's it's outrageous and it's repulsive I agree it's offensive and I get that but I think it's it's it's very dangerous it's very dangerous to silence people that may or may not have any other recourse in terms of like he doesn't have the ability to defend himself it doesn't have the ability to make a video about it unless he puts it on his own website and then who's gonna watch it like this the stuff that they're doing with YouTube it's just it's a slippery slope you know and especially when they use these terms like hate speech they're not like when you say like what are they saying they're saying that he violated their Terms correct yes so what are those terms that he violated and what is a specific violation like what are the words that he said well you were like enough is enough if that's the case how did you let him get away with saying all this other shit for years and years and when when do you draw this line like just that video that we played you know they smell like sulfur they they want to eat babies they're screaming I love Satan and they want any babies like well where does the line get drawn I just I don't think I don't think that should be up to subjectivity I think that should be a very very hard question that's answered with very clear facts you should have an adversarial judicial process with an impartial judge or jury right and how would you even get someone impartial instead they have in-house decide decisions okay well you heard that I mean you heard Matt Taibbi does delineate the people who are involved in this stuff and by the way Facebook's taken down pages of people who are Palestinians because the Israeli government tells them to what they do and do you know about that right I had heard about yes yeah so there that's them doing the bidding the government says take it - okay take it down aren't you they don't get free speech okay cuz I don't want the government to get mad at me because we're making so much goddamn money right now I don't want the government to get mad at us that's what Facebook and YouTube is doing see if I would like that if someone you know I'm not saying that no one should be taken down if someone's calling for the death of all black people and like maybe this it's not a good place to give them a platform but I feel like the problem that I'm having with this is these things like air quotes hate speech because I told you that they said that about Harrison Douglas Murray now that is fucking crazy so when does it stop being hate speech like when when do you draw the line when it's is it mildly offensive is that hate speech like where does it go where does it go where people I don't understand why you're I don't get that do you get this I'm not being a dick I honestly why aren't you allowed to hate things right well I don't I understand that calling for action I think is the so call for action might be I mean I guess if it's a legal term this is not a legal term though that when they blanket things with hate speech like we're saying with like was calling something a drug this is an illegal drug well what if caffeine becomes an illegal drug then is that the same as meth it's clearly not there's different things so when you say hate speech and you also lump Douglas Murray having an intellectual conversation with Sam Harris about immigration you lump that in oh that's the cut with ROM talk and so did you know that right before a fourth of July there was a newspaper I think it was in Texas and so they wanted to for the 4th of July they wanted to post the Declaration of Independence so they posted the first half of it yeah did you know about this yeah Facebook gave him a strike for hate speech yes hate speech they gave him a strike and so now they're like they were like that was an algorithm though right that picked up some of the the phrase I'm phrasing in there about slavery and stuff like that yeah and then being animals or something like that I don't know something like that I'm not sure what it was but and then the newspaper said now we're afraid to post the second half of the Declaration because we'll get a second strike and they might pull our whole page yeah so again they release that strike correct so so yeah so what is this book till what is this idea that I need a nanny state to protect me from ideas well I think they're worried about the power of propaganda and it's just they don't know exactly what the consequences of suppressing that power propaganda are I think that's that's really the primary issue they're worried that a guy like Alex Jones already has this massive following is what he's done it by calling Sandy Hook fake may-maybe awful I believe it is but is it enough to completely deep platform am how how are they how are they justified even if it was let's say it was let's just say you and I agree that it is okay this shouldn't shouldn't there still be some kind of a process there should be that's what I'm saying it shouldn't be even if we agreed and again I hate that guy I hate it as much as you hate it yeah I'm with you and that people are gonna I know it's joke last time I was on your show I said I said people are gonna take what I'm saying right now and twist it and that's exactly what they did so I'm sure people did who took it and twisted it I don't hello we don't have to name names what do they do they said they twisted what we were so when we were talking about Seth rich they twist and I said you know all I did was cover it on my show until this day people still say I was pushing it I do a new show I covered it but even discussing it and even you can't even discuss like I couldn't cover it couldn't discuss it and that and so that's exactly what happened pump me cut me saying that and cut some other stuff and put it together and I was like son of a bitch but you so what are you gonna do right so we're gonna do so so I just want people to know this is again I'm just as offended as everybody I'm saying we need to have these things be public utilities for a lot of reasons and that you know exactly what Matt Taibbi said what the end game here is very clear and they want to be able to censor people they want to be able to censor and the first people are gonna come after his left-wing organizations that could come after black lives matter they're come back they've already come after left he's like me Joe why do these things they're gonna come after black lives matter what do you mean they're at the hate speech against the police you kidding me they already said they're controlled by the Russians well who is they who's they saying that and who's they gonna come after them what do you mean by that so well the FBI will infiltrate them they are I'm sure they already have you know how that works see you know how all that stuff works so that's how that stuff works and then they discredit them and then they they will commit violence in their name and say oh look black lives matters are violent no that was a cop doing it you know that do you have that that's what happened up in dapple you know that's the kind of stuff they do up there and then they each were provocateur yes exactly right so by the way I learned about that from Alex Jones so that's the problem with Alex Jones he's right about stuff sometimes and while he was way more right about stuff in the past Alex himself and I've talked to him about this says his drinks too much and he's getting too crazy he needs to go on a diet and exercise and start getting his life in order and he takes things too far sometimes and he he takes those off of the rails he goes off the rails like he he and I had a conversation but he got mad at me for saying that I didn't think George Soros was a Nazi and so he had this whole thing ranted ray and he we talked back and forth and he apologized and you know he said I but I think he recognizes that sometimes he's just caught up in that cycle of outrage that cycle of outrage it's just there's no room for for like there's no room to step back and to sort of reset this it's it's just constant outrage and constantly under attack and then there's these words that get thrown around that sort of lose their meaning like globalists you know and shills and and and you know and this this sort of like attitude that there's this there's this cabal of evil that is trying to take take over the world and in one point Alex had this idea that they were gonna try to kill off most people and you remember that and I heard about there was this idea that they wanted to euthanize it was genocide they wanted to they wanted to break it down to what is the word where they talked about doing that to talk about reducing the population there's like some sort of a conspiracy theorists term of reduction of population to a sustainable number of super evil geniuses that could live forever and they wanted to get it down to like you know 500 million people worldwide that can live for a million years or some crazy shit but I think that that's that whole cycle of like constant outrage and everything's a conspiracy and you get just whacked whacked out and caught up in it if you go back to Alex's earlier videos I met Alex in 98 I believe and back then Alex was he was going after george w bush when george w bush was running for president and he was saying that this guy is he's a puppet and that he's a puppet of the CIA and you know in and he you know he supports genocide and he was showing up at campaign and they were arresting him he was anti right-wing I mean he was he was anti what he thought was this globalist agenda he also infiltrated Bohemian Grove when everybody thought that Bohemian Grove was nonsense there's nothing really going I he's like no these really rich people are getting together with heads of state and foreign dignitaries and they're dressing up like fucking druids and they have an effigy that they burn in front of the owl god Molech and people like he's crazy then he releases the video and like oh my god they really do do that like he did some good work the World Trade Organization protests in his his video 9/11 a road to tyranny right after 9/11 he releases this video that shows that the World Trade Organization protests were infiltrated by these agent provocateurs who are most likely government agents with government agent boots on by the way shows this in the video they smash windows they're all wearing masks had light things on fire then they're all holed up in one house they negotiate with the police and are all eventually released this is all done under me he proved all this he showed all how this is going like look at these peaceful protesters then the consequences of that they established a no protest line at the WTO well you couldn't go by with a pin on if you tried to get through with a pin that said WTO with a red line through it they told you you could not wear that pin you can't come through here this is a no protest zone and he's like this is the consequences of this kind of censorship and this is how they establish the censorship they make it seem like your organization is violent and dangerous by introducing violent and dangerous elements in the in the form of undercover police officers or military they smash windows tip over newspaper stands and was fucking create chaos so that the government has to come in because now we have a violent situation so then the military comes in and arrests protesters and silences the protests so they don't look embarrassing in front of all these people from foreign countries that are coming here to the World Trade Organization I I didn't know he said that but dude he look he's not wrong always and he was more right back then he was also more sane back then his he was more and more calm it wasn't this he didn't have the big moon face back then either and he wasn't drinking as much I don't think and screaming and spitting and and you know you ask him he'll say I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer volume of corruption all the shit that he sees every day look remember he was crying when Trump bombed Syria he was crying because he was crying that Trump fucked us yeah you know I mean he I really genuinely believe most the time that he means well the the the thing is we look for conspiracies everywhere like everything that's a conspiracy you're off track and I don't think there's anyone there that can sit down and go stop hold on let's examine this in a factual way let's stop cut the hyperbole out and let's look at what the facts are and where are we getting these facts and why do we think this is happening and why do you think this is fake because that sounds fucking crazy to me no one's there to do that if someone was there to do that I think he probably would be stopped and would examine things and would balance out you know like one of the reasons why I wanted to have him on my podcast when I did is because I wanted people to see the Alex that I know because people like how could you know that guy I'm like look at how he is when I get him high and we get drunk and he's laughing about stuff and talking about interdimensional child molesters and all that I think this is what I wanted everybody to see like this is Alex Jones he's a fun guy it's just that that is not a good position to be in where you're constantly looking for conspiracies everywhere you go and you might nail a few but then you might call out a bunch of another fake which not just negates the ones that you nailed but negates everything you say as soon as you're one of those guys that everything's a conspiracy and then dead kids aren't really dead and everyone's an actor and like everything that you say that's good they're gonna stop my thing is that I I focus on the ones that are important right that I think that's right I'm like I don't I care about wars and the lies that are about told about wars from the media which the media pushes everywhere in my lifetime so that's the ones I care about I hear everything you're saying and yeah I didn't really know I got a saccade I didn't really know much about Alex Jones until the I met him you know very famously at that incident I didn't really I never really watched him I went home that night and watched some of his videos which is when I found out some of them are really funny and so I did honest to God I didn't really know much about him and so I don't even know this stuff so maybe you find it Jamie see you they pull all that stuff from YouTube everything but doesn't sometimes have it probably on their channel and I did I never did videos about him or debunk but I just you know it's just I will he wasn't in my line of sight yeah I was busy making fun of NamUs NBC and CNN that's what I like to do yeah it's it's it's all very confusing to me and look I don't think he should say those things I don't think he should say lies about kids not being dead the horrors of being a parent and your kid was shot in school shooting and then some guy is saying that there are a hundred percent actors and faked and yeah that's horrible stuff there's a guy who was one of the parents that was a conspiracy theorist until this happened you know he was a conspiracy theorist he believed all that stuff and then his son was killed and then they started calling him a fraud and saying he was an actor and saying it never happened that he's a page he'll and you know and there's a big article about this this guy I mean you see this guy talk and it's heartbreaking you know you read his words it's heartbreaking you can imagine your son was murdered in one of the biggest school massacres ever if not the biggest right and here's people running around emailing you and sending you guys and Facebook messages that you're a fraud and then you you know you work for the globalists and this is all just a plot to take our guns away it's like that's what they say these things are that's the people who think that all these school shootings that they're all set up to mixes so they can take our guns away they think that about everything they thought that about the country music festival shooting in Vegas because they felt like hey here's a way to get those people on our side because those are all the Second Amendment people's the country music people what better people to get to turn against the Second Amendment that a bunch of people that are I I guarantee you if you have like a red light that went off every time like on the top of someone's head if there were national rifles say if they were NRA member in that audience I would there be a lot of fuckin lights but a lot of those people are NRA people a lot of people are gun owners I better just gun owners how many people are gun owners fuckin half at least half the audience probably one of the strongest demographics you could find country music gun owners that's a that's a giant connection and so the thought was hey of this guy okay they make this Manchurian Candidate make him gunned down all these people some people think he didn't even do it they think they shot him in the room and then agents did it and they killed all these people and then this bullets coming out of all these different windows and all these different areas and like no it's exhausting I know it's exhausting it's also horrific man I mean the whole thing's horrific the idea that they think that the government would create a false flag that by the way didn't do anything second amendment still in place but that they would create a false flag and they would be willing to gun down what are they he killed like 50-plus people and shot like 500 something fucking insane like that that that would be that that that's they would get together and go you know we got to do we got to get this guy and get him get him to shoot all these people and that's how we're gonna get rid of guns it's totally uneffective it hasn't done anything no here's the thing I'm not the first person to make this point about guns is people who are big strong Second Amendment people say that why you know cuz whenever I advocate for gun control people say oh good that only the governor will have guns which is it's not a bad argument right it's not I understand that argument but the whole point of you keeping your guns to protect yourself from the government is that the government's gonna take your rights away so you need to have your guns to protect your rights well the governor took your rights away they're already reading your every email they're already reading you're listening on every time you already lost your right to privacy they'll let you keep your guns while they took the rest of your rights away so now you still have your guns now why don't you go get your rights back you have your gun that's out there they're never gonna do it right I already report was an interesting take on that right like the one day technology to reach a point you know for them was like through those little psychic dudes that we're gonna be able to predict future crime right and then arrest you for a future crime yeah mm-hmm yeah that's kinda already cut yeah they kind of do that now they can arrest you for a conspiracy to commit a crime well you don't even have to have a crime right you just have some emails talking shit mm-hmm I mean you could have a role-playing thing that you do with your wife we talked about you know listen you and i we're Bonnie and Clyde we're gonna take down the government and they just fucking kick down your door in the middle of the night yeah who's that who's that comic who had the ice agents breakdown oh my god that guy I started following him after that he made a joke yeah was the joke oh I forget but that was hilarious pretty funny by the way - that guy's pretty funny I do I forgot I was that story he tells us hilarious about those I scoured they were ice cops right yeah coming in to his place what is his name that's part-time stand-up comic podcast host and self-described pizza delivery guy who in a strange twist of fate recently found himself debating immigration policy with for homeland security agents in his home the agents paying him an early-morning visit last Sunday because of some jokes he tweeted about Cinco de Mayo holy shit yeah okay this what he said here's our Cinco de Mayo works in 2018 white people allowed the culture appropriate on the condition that you helped destroy ice you kill one ice agent you get to wear a sombrero two kills you get to wear a poncho the place that you can't joke around about killing an agent right there's you know so if he had a Sirius XM radio show he'd be fired right now oh yeah well they fired Nick DiPaolo for that for saying something very similar to that and so I say about that it's like so Nick can't make a joke about someone going into a university go hey the next school shooter that was his joke next to ensure that professors Lee's go to Berkeley and go to the teachers lounge or something like that right which everyone knows it's obviously a joke he's a goddamn comedian Jesus and he's a right-wing communities all right everybody so so but you can go on those same radio shows in those same radio stations and you can advocate for killing hundreds of thousands of people in another country that you don't know and nobody said shit all the time people do that people lie about so that's that that's the weird thing you know we can have a torture program America nobody goes you know it's just weird that and then the the media goes along they don't even called torture they call it enhanced interrogation techniques because we're doing it but Nick said that that's all the sudden so it's just such a weird squiggly bullshit line of morality and and so and now Nicola Bob would be better off for it anyway yeah Nick will be better off for it and he has a podcast now but I think unfortunately he's doing a subscription service which I tried to talk all these guys out of because you can't hear it at all for free you have to pay and bring all of it I don't know but it's a bad idea yeah it limits your growth I mean he's a famous comedian so I'm sure he'll get some money and I know he's probably doing really well with it but it's just it's impossible to grow is it a subscription service I was Jamie's shaking his head with a 99 on patreon for the 10 bucks a month he doesn't give you anymore don't start at 10 and then keep adding more so know what we do is we we'd to give away all our stuff for free except we do a couple extra we maybe do a couple extra hours a week for our patrons yeah that's like bonus right see don't but you don't want to that's not the worst thing in the world I just think that you know and people have different you do bonus stuff no no everything's for everything's free oh you're really lucky you're super super popular yeah but when I wasn't super popular is all free - yeah I had it free in the beginning when I was getting a thousand downloads it's always been free I just when did it start to cook it kick in free when did you start to take off this show two years ago three years ago something like that really say about two years ago three years ago was it an issue or what is it you had a special guest I what was it you think I don't know it's a momentum just over time just just always just constantly doing it grinding being in here delivering on three four days a week yeah you you do your best do your best get better at it make mistakes apologize for your mistakes keep going see because when I lied when I did your show last time I just you know years in my head ever since like I always like you are doing what I want to do like you don't I loved when I go Jodo because people always try and discredit man I don't know how I got into a position or have to worry about being discredited I'm a fuck nightclub jagoff comedian and afterward that's why you're like I don't I announced Cagefighting I spoke the pod I'm not a reputable person gonna be you gotta be that's who I want to be I've got a reputable person fuck you well I do my best to be honest you know I mean I approach issues yeah in an honest way but I'm not your source of reason but you know what I mean yeah yeah I'm not I'm not that good I want to be a provocateur I want to be the guy on the outside throwing spitballs that's that's who I want to be doing that and that's I am I'm doing that but somehow I got caught up in this thing where people are gonna try to discredit you goddamn it that's so it's it's like Strad I'm confused you know I'm confused by this this alex jones thing because although i don't support a lot of the things that he said i don't know why more people don't think that this could be a real problem that they could just throw that hate speech blanket on things and if i didn't have that experience of talking to that woman when she was describing the Douglas Murray Sam Harris podcast which doesn't have a single slur there's no hateful rhetoric there's no I mean it's not hate speech I listen to it it's just a description I mean it's it's a discussion rather so you have that insight I know I know that how calmly and confidently she said it's hate speech it was like you know what it was like do you remember those old commercials where there was a guy and he was eating with another guy and he was saying that if you buy drugs you support terrorism yacek what do you mean he's like it's a fact it's just a fact FA CT fact and he's eating a salad he's a no-nonsense guy fact hey what do you mean it's a fact it's a fact FA CT fact you buy pot you're supporting terrorism but it's basically what she said it's hate speech it's basically the same sort of yeah self-righteous in certain Asian yeah yeah where she didn't but you know when I was pressing her on it it was almost like she was my boss and I couldn't talk to about him like yeah I don't work for you you understand this kind of what this method of communication that you're you accustomed to this does not apply here you you have to you have to discuss these ideas I want to know the merit of your thoughts you know I want to see where you where your thought process lies that you could just throw this hate speech blanket on things and turns out there was no thought and there was no consideration there was no examination she didn't know the content of the conversation and her confidence in saying that it was hate speech was merely towing this company line the same company line that got James d'amour fired for the Google memo you know you talked to actual evolutionary biologists and people understand psychology and people who are clinical psychologists well they talk to you about the real differences between men and women what he actually said in these documents where he's not he didn't make some sort of a quantitative like a ruling that women are less valuable or that women are worth less money or that women are in somehow is in any way shape or form inferior he simply wrote about clinical studies that have shown tendencies to gravitate towards different professions and even had a page and a half in that about how there's ways that we could encourage more women to get into tech so was net it was not negative in any way towards women but I saw all these people describing it as hateful rhetoric and then that it was reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes like what with actual studies actual studies of science those are these are harmful gender stereotypes because they don't add up to your vision of gnarnia diversity that you did that only exists in Wakanda and some clouds somewhere that you you've put up these aren't this is not real numbers there's there's reasons why people gravitate towards certain professions some of them are cultural some of them are biological they're fascinating to study but it doesn't mean that a person who becomes a nurse is any better than a person who becomes a carpenter or vice or a guy who it becomes a surgeon is any better than someone who becomes a computer coder this is not what anyone saying what they're saying is there's reasons why people find different things interesting and some of them might be the amount of testosterone they have in their system the fact they have XY chromosomes they're their genetic history the history of their their family and the the culture that they grew up in there's all these variable and these variables are fascinating but as soon as you say that these variables must even out at the end we must have an equality of outcome based on gender and based on race well you're not even talking about people anymore now you're just talking about something that you need to say in order for you to keep your job because you want to keep collecting ones and zeros and you understand that there's this confusion as to why there's not more women that are leaders why there's not more women that are intact why there's not more this more why don't you really want to concentrate on diversity you really want to concentrate on fairness concentrate on why they're trying to keep Asians out of Harvard how about that because that's some real fucking racism that's going on right now no one's saying a word about it because it's about people that are kicking ass they're kicking ass too hard so they're trying to they're trying to make it more difficult it's a giant class-action lawsuit Asians are suing Harvard because it's more difficult for them to get in than anybody else well when I was a kid I was told that they pee pee in your coke and that's I didn't I know I was like a Chinese yeah I drove now I grew up I know that's bullshit that's just a thing that they would tell us little kids little kids but it's like Joe I seen people antidote to it to the charles murray chat with the the antidote to that isn't a sense for them the antidote to that is is good speak more speech it wasn't even if you wanted to but whatever is person to put it on their playlist which is crazy someone got a Community Guidelines strike for putting it on their playlist that's why I say we need to have it be the YouTube Facebook these are public utilities they need to be regulated and there's no wait girls no getting around it right they have super control in our culture they have massive impact but so does CBS right so if you say something in CBS fires you is that legal isn't it funny that les Moonves is getting in trouble for something he did to an actress instead of in their 80s yeah and instead of him being a long time ago was it the 80s I think it was at least 20 years ago someone's 1996 with the one Oh wasn't yeah okay so that's still a long time yeah so oh the 80s was I'm sorry that was confirmed that with you're thinking of the Sylvester Stallone no I wasn't thinking the Stallone I was thinking it's George Takei Oh George Takei it's some guy popped down from the 80-85 said he grabbed his dick like hey let it go buddy Jesus Christ you know it's and it's also it's not this you know there was a molester at my church we had a priest those a molester named father halogen shocker wait a minute is it a Catholic Church he's yuck what the fuck man you can't trust anybody and the kids we used to call him happy hands Holohan because he because whatever we come up he'd always like what a wrestle you but he's the last kind of guy he was a nerd he was he was like he's not a wrestling type guy was crying he'd always come up like hey I'm like why do you do then you're just trying to grab me and so we would call him happy hands Holohan and we would get in trouble if we if they if our parents hurt us a don't get disrespectful to the way like you know he's grabbing our dicks yeah so they finally they finally caught him and I don't know why I started talking about this but why did I start talking about this oh I know because we're talking I we always did George Takei we always thought it was like it was up to you to not get molested by it like if you got us and we would laugh right we would laugh at kids who got caught little kids yeah so we got to run faster fucker he would take us he had a summer house right with a boat and all up in Wisconsin right so he would take us and it was like an hour and a half away we get in his station wagon he'd take like six boys up to there and we're gonna go waterskiing or whatever right and so he had the day set up where he once you got there you had to first do cleaning so you had to change into your cleaning clothes and yeah and so every time we had to go in the room and change he would find a reason to come in the room and wrestle one of us oh and then we're like alright we got to put up with it cuz we want to go on his boat we don't we're poor poor isn't it funny how it's only funny if it's you like you're allowed to laugh about getting molested as long as it's you yeah you know like no one could say like you like heat well heat Jimmy was on the Joe Rogan when he was laughing about child molestation oh my god was that is that true hate speech put the blanket on it hate speech but no was he was he was talking about him getting molested well he's normalizing he's a sexual assault he would take us this priest would try to teach you how to ski you know how do you teach someone how to water-ski you put your dick in their mouth for your dick in their mouth do you know how to breathe underwater hold you no no spitting so he the way you teach them what is water skis you put water skis out of them and then he sit there on the dock and you pull away right and that's how you learn so he would take us in shallow water and then he would go it would put the skis on you so he couldn't run away from oh and then he would like put his hands he would put his hands underneath your crotch like this from Ikea and then he goes now when the boat pulls its gonna pull you up like this and it's gonna it's gonna jerk you off and the only way to catch it in your mouth and so it was a fuck man so we looked at it like it was your job to get out of that situation if you got caught we all laugh that yeah I remember my friend my friend Danny he's in this we let he's we see who's in the shallow water and he's gone now if the boat pulls you and he goes like this and Danny looks at us Dan he goes now did he actually molest any money yes inappropriate touch molested people oh boy there's he had to leave the church and all that stuff didn't read the church that he's moving this moved him he Arizona first sabbatical yeah yeah he's good he needs our prayers that they sent out a note like a letter to everybody's house who was in the proof you gave money they give you a letter did hear no evil the documentary where they you know there was one priest that Benedict who became Pope moved who went on to molest a hundred deaf kids oh no oh no yeah horrific horrific show that that that process of moving people was always terrifying because they basically let them know hey you're not even gonna be punished - we're just gonna move you I'm just gonna move you yeah so yeah it doesn't I know it I don't understand verifying terrifying stuff yeah why isn't the FBI infiltrate the Catholic Church yeah imagine I I did a joke about on stage while back I was like a man shift that many NASCAR drivers were fucking kids how quick would they shut down NASCAR NASCAR pulled into town just fucked all the kids and drove around the circle real quick they'd be like we got to shut this down this is a crazy organization but meanwhile way more people getting molested by the Catholic Church I couldn't agree more it's a terrifying number when you look at the numbers of people that have just accused them of sexual assault and molestation it's terrifying yeah it's terrifying and all the money they take that you give them on Sunday to go pay these people off is also yeah I feel very fortunate that I ducked that I got lucky once out of Catholic school you went to Catholic school yeah for one year only first grade I was gone after first grade and I you know I had friends that stayed and I know new people that got touched you know it's just it was it's it's for people who outside the Catholic faith people who are bet is there's something that had that happened and it probably happened when they told them they couldn't get married anymore because it used to be the Pope could he get married Pope was allowed to have children and that priests were allowed to be marry and priests were allowed to have children but they were rock stars you have to realize like back in the Lutheran days the days of Martin Luther in those those guys were fucking everybody they would get at you and I that confession you know the in the confession booth tell me what you did Dolores Flores out there just sucking dicks all day show me hey suck it de leurs when they were banging everybody and then they came up with some sort of a reason why they should have to be celibate and from then on well so here's what here's what I heard what happened it was that so there was two ways to become nobility and the been evil times you could be born noble or you could get into by you way into the church and so you could become nobility and so what would happen is these rich motherfuckers who would by the way and if the church would die and then all their money would go to their kids their firstborn and the church is like we got to get some fuck that money and so they passed the law hey nobody can get married legally they all did they still had kids and shit and they still had mistresses amore ever but when they died all their money and property went to the church that makes sense and so of course it's all about mite so that's the story I heard if anybody heard differently both I bet it's I bet it had something to do with sex as well and preventing those guys from fucking everybody you know because they were rock stars there was no rock stars back then so the guys that there were the spokespersons for God would most likely be the ones who had the most influence in the community I mean yes there's a kid that we went to school with who was clearly gay and nice guy and he was gonna become a priest when we were on high school together so as we were like riding the bus going to high school he was a couple years ahead of me and he was leaving school and he was already on his way what is it Divinity School or seminary seminary I think yeah he was on his way and we were all like we're all calling him father already and it was just ridiculous we're all accepting the fact this guy was gonna be a priest but you know for him it was he was so obviously gay that you know I mean I didn't give a shit but I knew you could tell he's gay he's a gay guy he never had any interesting girls never was around them kind of just an oddly feminine man and decided to take up the priesthood and we all you know treated him like he was different because he was going to become a priest it was very weird yeah that you know priests are still treated like rock stars in the Catholic Church today I mean he was meanwhile I was just another sixteen-year-old kid just like us you know maybe he was 17 at the time and I think I was 15 but it was just he wasn't a different than us but we were calling him father and stuff and it was just so strange I had two uncles that went to seminary who one of them became a priest and the other one over the summer had a friend who got pregnant and he had to stop being a kid drop out of seminary Wow but when you went to my grandmother's house as you walked up the steps into their living room the two pictures she would have greeting you was a picture of both her sons in their priests outfit so one was actually a priest and one had to go but they that's the picture she kept up the guy's bringing over his four kids to her house there's the picture of him alone daddy why are you in the priest outfit one point I'm so so yeah that's uh are you still religious you still go to church no okay no I go because my I go to church for a Baptist Church in Pasadena because Mike my mother-in-law goes and she wanted she asked me to go oh it's probably fun and I said okay I'll go I'm being protested by the Westboro Baptist Church tomorrow are you yes we're in Kansas City oh very excited oh that is that I've always wanted to be protested very excited good for you put out a press release and they even responded to my my I put out a post and they had a tweet someone who has no idea what God wants is speaking for God I said that if God you know if there is a God they said I was an atheist which I I'm really not I mean I don't consider myself anything I don't consider myself religious I'm not an atheist I'm just a person who doesn't know and I that's called an agnostic I think right I'm more agnostic than anything but I don't even want to put a label on it why should I have to be right someone's camp you know my my opinions are allowed to evolve and I'm allowed to and I've done a lot of drugs I've seen some shit that I can't explain you know on psychedelics man will they'll get you whatever confidence you have that there's no God you go through a DMT trip and you come out in the other and you like okay maybe I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about maybe I don't know anything and that's I mean maybe I don't know anything camp so I said that if where there was a God I don't know if there's guy but if there was a God he or she would probably be very disappointed these hateful twats pretending they speak for him putting up signs and say God hates fags like you really think this is what God would want that's outrageous and so that's what they're upset about that he says that did I speak for God oh but they could speak for good they see God hates fags taken let's do that written anywhere look to the Bible never says God hates fags that's their website is God hates fags calm just stop and think about that I think they should take their Facebook page away do they have a youtube channel the Westboro Baptist Church our YouTube channel but yeah but don't don't use speech yeah don't you think we're living in a weird era of like people wanting to just discredit people just like get rid of them like oh you you tussle you don't believe this one thing that the establishment says you have to blur is only one narrative on this Syrian war and if you can go if you go away from it you're you're a bad person and you're Allah and you're a you're an apologist for Assad and you're a buton puppet at all it's like what the fuck no I just have a different view on the war and it's based on facts and evidence and I don't know if you know but those people you're trusting now we're the ones who continuously lied to us so I've never lied to you about a war you're you're upset because I'm skeptical of the people who constantly lie about war that's just though and so that's just a weird thing and it's like this but I guess it's probably always been this way Joe I don't know I just now that I'm experienced it because I'm in the public talking about this stuff and it's just weird how people are so quick to go along with the establishment look at how the lefties are defending the intelligence community wishing Robert Moeller a fucking happy birthday on Twitter like a bunch of idiots so ridiculous it's like do you guys have any sense of history do you have any sense of recent history no it's just it's it's it shows you how the hatred of someone could make people's lizard brains excited and then rational thinking goes out though so I love you know raffle Conan on my show says you know I hate Trump as much as anybody but I'm not gonna let him steal my critical thinking skills and so that's the same and so the thing that I like about you know what our show does we're very consistent I don't have one set of rules first people I like and another set of rules for people I oppose and I really really appreciate that about you and that's one of the things that I said about you the first time we came on and say you shoot straight no matter whether it's right or left whatever you see you call it like you see it there's no partisan politics and I think that's very important and it's so rare it doesn't exist anymore you know I was I was watching I was listening rather the Sam Harris is one of his podcast recently where his guest made a really important point saying that we're this strange time in history where the the news is different depending on what channel you watch it used to be you at different people telling you the news now you have different news if you wholly differently different news yes isn't that something and it's completely partisan I mean yeah it's it's a hundred percent left or a hundred percent right and you're either all in with us and I feel like what we're talking about here what you're describing his idea sports like this this this needing to shut people down they want to get a result they want to win the game you know what right now they just slam dunked on Alex Jones and they're high-fiving all around the coffee shop all the baristas are fucking psyched you know they're they're really excited they're making espresso yeah we shut him down we fucking shut them down we're gonna put on our masks in our bike lock so I'm gonna whack Trump supporters in the head tonight like this is is a strange time for ideas you can't you can't even you can't even objectively assess the merits of an idea because the ideas have already been clearly delineated these are the acceptable ideas this is the acceptable parameters of this conversation these are the acceptable ideas and if you go over them you are could persona non grata yeah that's it that's where I know and you know meanwhile you turn on NBC is just littered with liars yeah and so is Fox and of course you know what I love Shepard Smith Shep Smith he's a fascinating character what he is doing over there is going against everything he goes to get like that you ever seen that what Sean Hannity says versus Shepard Smith yeah I've seen those videos fucking hilarity is pretty funny and he's right and he's not just right he's right constitutionally like what he's saying when he's describing what Sean Hannity said versus the reality he's right he's right in terms of what is a law he's right in terms of what you know whether or not something is legal or whether or not it's unethical yeah and you know that that's the thing about like Shep Smith like when he gets something wrong I think he's just genuinely getting it wrong I don't think it's because he's trying to push in there he's he might be unconsciously corrupted but not consciously how did he get over there I was he over there I don't I don't know you tell me do you remember when Hannity was on with combs it was Hannity and Colmes yeah took the weasel iasts weakest looking liberal they could find a guy who looks like he just sweats canola oil and they put him on TV opposite like this well Deano right-wingers II know how John met him right-wingers used to hire Allen combs to come performances parties and he would just call her in the corner and that's okay I'm kidding I feel sorry feel bad making fun him because he's not alive anymore he's not Alex Ellen combs I'm pretty sure he's dead Oh when did he die like a year ago or two years ago can you google that and see if he i'm priy hannity in him split up the band broke up long before that yeah it's like crosby Stills Nash and young yeah February last year so yeah he was this guy he's a very nice guy I'm sure he was a nice guy but it was almost like he didn't get riled up on purpose to keep his job he got riled up enough to make liberals look like pushovers and so the people at home and Kansas would be like five stupid liberals yeah Sean Hannity's my man Sean Hannity's I've got American yes you know like Sean Hannity with his big fat white bread eating face and that he was just the one who's telling the truth about the real problem and the Dems didn't it's it's so fascinating to see that video with Shepard Smith just clearly and and and and and very cleanly dissecting everything that handy says well the idea right here it is right here oh yeah that's a video if we can't play this all right on YouTube 18 months the Russian investigation is the opposite of a hoax and now indictments against Russian organizations and persons have been handed up it's hilarious yeah it goes on and on it's a Fox News Shep Smith shuts down Sean Hannity's lies in propaganda how is how is Shep Smith still at Fox News how does that work can you tell me it's interesting right yeah it is this is Sean Hannity's eyes look like he's drugged up yeah there's an anchor Eisley he looks like something's wrong who's the chief anchor yeah bill any other breaking news division but let me tell you about what Sean Hannity has been doing is that woman of Alexandria Acacio Cortes from New York who beat Joe Crowley and she's the big Democratic Socialist and everybody's got their bush in a knot over it because oh my god she's the corporate Democrats hate her the right wing she freaks out right because he's actually going to help people and Sean Hannity's been like reading out like look what she likes she wants to have us medicare-for-all she wants to have free college she wants a living wage she wants to end the wars and people I'm sure almost half his audience are like that sounds looking pretty good that's so I don't know if you know Sean things are tough out here in the heartland is that possible to do all those weekend I don't have to worry about medical bills for my fucking kids anymore a big measure for that I don't have to worry about sending my kids to kasam cuz you have what you have endless money for these wars I'm sure you have some money for us right I mean college subsidized and why is it why is it soaks it so it's actually backfiring in fact I there was a poll that fox and friends and friends and friends put out that said Fox's offense it had said do you think the thirty two point six trillion dollars for Bernie Sanders Medicare for all plan is worth it of course they left out the other part which turns out it saves two point something trillion dollars right that's the part they leave out so they're gaslighting their own viewers just like all news organizations light of their own viewers so they that pull pull one up and 73% of the Fox and friends and friends and friends viewers said they want Bernie Sanders Medicare fraud seventy three percent and thirty thousand people voted in that poll so that's not just nothing so III it's it's like so now they're they think that's scary socialism scare doesn't scare people anymore cuz now there's the internet people can go look what it's like the live in Denmark once I say it though it's like they say do you support communism do you support socialist and then people say no no don't support communism do you support Medicare yeah do you support Social Security of course do you for public education yes okay are you support for public roads are you for the post office we for the fire department me for the yeah yes yes this is all socialism yeah you like libraries just like yes that south socialism yeah as good aspects to it and so he's particularly like free health care who the fuck wants someone that you love to be shit out of luck where they can't go to a doctor because they can't afford it and what if they die come on so when I went to Norway at my friend Stevo went to Norway to and something that he noticed is Norwegian broad oh did we ever the fellas they I gotta tell you they do we're comically tight pants the guys in Europe it's like you know my wife said it's like you know those she goes up to the Fashion Designers are fucking with you you know that right it's like oh I always wanted to know what your keys look like shrink-wrapped that's fantastic how many comics you see on stage you can see what their fucking phone make is and that key oh you drive a BMW that's nice it's like what the fuck I make sure they can't run away quick yes we have their legs bound up skinny jeans anyway but over there when they talk about health care we don't we all you do you like free health care think we don't call it free health care we call it included because it's included in your taxes just like just like your public education here just like your streets and roads here just like your fire department the fire department your kites included we don't go you get free police you get free fire department no it's included in your roses Road road maintenance and so that's the funny thing that that Sean Hannity in the right wing they think they can scare people by saying look all the stuff they're off no if the Democrats would have been off Hillary Clinton would have been offering people something maybe half the country who didn't vote what it came out and voted for her so that's the thing you Democrats have nothing to offer people and which is why they're a shit show on a failed party and they've lost they're wiped out at every level of government and so if they take over it's they ain't like in the Congress there's a big chance a chance they might it's just again it's there they're the ones doing the bidding for Trump they just handed him more money for defense than he even asked for so if trumpet here's the thing here's the funny thing if Trump is a maniac they all just say he's unhinged he's a maniac and he shouldn't have his finger on the button let's give him eighty billion more dollars for bombs those two things are incongruent those don't go together so you're bullshitting me at one end or another do you think he's gonna get through this without going to jail he um yes do you think his sons gonna go to jail I you know I've got a good at predicting things but they should all go to jail because they're probably all corrupt doing corrupt shit but if you put a special prosecutor on anybody I could they'll find crimes on anybody you know the stick they're prosecuting man afford for doesn't have anything to do with the election or Trump's campaign it's all shit before the Trump's campaign when he was in collusion with Tony Podesta from the Podesta group he was bundling money from fucking Ukraine and they were giving it through the Podesta found a so some of his kid in charge he's he's charge for shit that happened before he ever even worked for Trump so that's the part they don't tell you they go metaphor charge man and then an 80th paragraph they go this has nothing to do with the election every articles like that so it's just a matter of them deciding to put a microscope up your ass and find things you did wrong they put a microscope up Bill Clinton's ass about some land deal in Arkansas and end up going to a blow job in Alva Oval Office and he got impeached for it so they got rid of this special prosecutor after that because they realize that you'll find crimes on anybody that if you put a special prosecutor on them and they go and now they bring it back for Trump they don't they're not prosecuting literal fucking war criminals Joe literal we know they're war criminals there was a thing called the torture program we know that it was a real thing no one goes to jail nobody's prosecuted but goddamn it they got a special prosecutor for Trump not that they shouldn't but we all know if you put a special prosecutor on anybody in Washington they're gonna find a lot of fucking crimes yeah they know what they're doing that's all the same game with this thing about not registering as foreign agents and they all play the same game they don't register as foreign agents until they get caught and then the government allows them to go backtrack and re-register but they're not doing that it done now oh we're not gonna let the man afford to he made a mistake so again there's ways to oppose Trump and the Russia thing isn't it the way to oppose Trump is you offer people something else he ran to the left of Hillary Clinton on foreign policy he wanted to end our Foreign Wars is according to his rhetoric in his campaign he wanted to give everybody health care remember everyone's gonna get health care that's gonna be cheaper that was his play of course he's that he's doing the exact opposite yeah so but who does the thing they say they're gonna do ever whoever doesn't who's ever done it oh nobody that's why you got that's why democracy is not based on trust it's based on mistrust it's based on transparency remember that bit that bill Bill Hicks used to do about is something along the lines of I think that when you get elected they bring into a smoky room filled with globalists and they show you an angle of the Kennedy assassination that you've never seen before they they roll it they go to any questions like what's my agenda but it almost seems like that's what happens Obama Obama changes tune and the hope and change website that had all that shit about whistleblowers oh yeah afforded protection that was all gone the day he got elected that was up well he stood up for all ago it took a while for him being office before they realized that was still in their unand deleted at all he disbanded his own followers right so when he got elected Barack Obama he had all these young people who were activated and they signed up he had a mailing list he had all their name and we want to go do shit for you want to go be AK and he'd they were like get rid of them and he did he got rid of them because you can't control them then yes they fuck them and that's examiner's has his campaign and says everybody we got to fight this fuckin evil machine and then on a dime he goes hey by the way let's join this evil machine it's silly think happens I don't know you know I really don't know I'm not good at that I know what people have said Chris Hedges said that Bernie Sanders didn't want to end up like Ralph Nader who was unfairly held accountable again for the demo the Democrats lost to Hill to fuckin a game show host okay and that's what this is all about they can't come to terms with this and they don't want us to examine the system that gave us Trump and they don't want to examine how they could have the most qualified person but couldn't even beat fucking Donald Trump that's how qualified you were you son of a bitch well they wanted Trump to win because they thought he'd be the easiest guy to beat in the election that was the so isn't it funny that nobody gets mad at them nobody's upset at Chris Hayes for having empty podiums of Trump for a whole show which I saw and then he wags his finger at Susan Sarandon you're the son of a bitch who prop Trump up and you didn't cover Bernie Sanders because you were fucking told not to and we know that for a fact cuz it ed Schultz and now you're gonna pretend like you're a sanctimonious fucking prick and you're gonna wag your finger at people with no money and no power meanwhile you have the biggest microphone of anybody and you fucking prop Donald Trump up and you don't take responsibility that's why he's a piece of shit very excited very excited that's why he's doing their bidding right now all those people are doing their bidding because Ed Schultz revealed and Phil Donahue if you tell the truth they will fucking fire your ass they've got guys like Ellie veggie and Rachel Maddow pretending they don't know how to net neutrality works I don't know is it good it's a big thing I know it's important but I don't know what went well we'll see how its rolls out I don't know that's what tools hate I'm not saying I wouldn't do it too I'm just not being offered 30 grand a day to sell my soul I would it seems confusing to me that they're thinking about using Hillary again because it seems to me that she's starting to make her way back into new cycles and given speeches she has a pack that's supposed to be supporting women who are running for office except not Cynthia Nixon she's gonna prop up the most corrupt motherfucker New York has had for a long time why it was supposed to be about just women who was gender she says that's what she gender-based she said she was starting a PAC to help encourage women to run that's I read that in an interview with her and I'm like really why isn't that PAC then supporting Cynthia Nixon why are you supporting you know what the fuck this is gender she was she independent she's running a Democrat and she's running against Cuomo and of course running for mayor no governor was running for governor in New York mm-hmm I knew she was running for something I didn't know was that big and you know Cuomo is just one of the most corrupt moment he said he's just again we have a one-party rule we have corporate rule and all these people are in bed with the corporations because they're bought because that's the way our elections work and that's the problem and I'm not saying she's the only one but she's the one that we know actually literally said that because the WikiLeaks thank God and that again I'll go back to Julian Assange the fact that none of the reporters in the United States are sticking up for Julian Assange shows you that what they do is fucking wrestling and they don't do real journalism wrestling and what's really interesting about the Julian Assange thing is if you ask people what he did because of the reductionist thinking because of their they've allowed this narrative to play for it they'll say he's accused of sexual assault and when you find out the actual facts of it his ridiculous woman consensual sex and in the middle of the night he stuck it in without a condom and they could they're calling it they were calling it surprise sex right but there's no I mean it didn't make any sense and why you attracted him to the United States for surprise sex that he had and where is it Norway or something that's the first of course they want to kind of come at you of course that if they want to if the CIA wants to get you the first thing do always wipe my butt cheese are rapists let's get some people's and that whole prosecutor who tries to prosecute was discredited for doing so they were apologized to Julian decides the UN yeah and he stuck up for his good up for Julian Assange and the woman yeah so this is while they're still they still have him holed up in the Ecuador embassy mm-hmm what is he gonna do they want to kick him out right well the ACLU is I think supporting him in the United States so and you know certain people of character are ours I think supporting him or the the I did I guess not him but the idea of journalistic integrity freedom of speech the right to publish if you watch that movie than what the post which was all about Daniel Ellsberg and though in the Vietnam the Pentagon Papers which has exposed that for administrations were lying to us about the Vietnam War not a Republican not a Democrat they're all that's again the same fucking two wings of the same party two right wins it's the military industrial party and the hero that movie is the woman who was the head of the Washington Post not Daniel Ellsberg he's the real fuckin hero but how can you make that movie in this day and age and not mention Chelsea Manning not mention Edward Snowden and not go you know this the Daniel Ellsberg's of today we imprison them and that's what we're doing we imprison the Daniel Ellsberg's of today and everybody i watch panels of the actors from that movie and the director and sit around talk nobody ever brings that shit up it's un-fuckin'-believable to me that they don't understand that they're just they're doing that's propaganda look how good our Washington Post is Washington Post went on to let us into every fucking war after that movie was supposedly made right so after after they did that and they printed that they backed every goddamn war since they're the ones who told us that the Saddam had a weapons of mass destruction and it was irrefutable that was the headline on their editorial page it wasn't some op-ed it was their editorial board said irrefutable that oh isn't that fake news should they have their Facebook page taken down that actually led to the fucking death of millions of people so this is what this is what this is why I have a show this is what I'm talking about and thank God the in a sense thank God the media sucks so bad because now I get to do their job that I'm a fucking idiot I have a C student jag off nightclub comedian and I do my job better than they do well you don't have a boss that's the thing not you're not beholden to anybody I was just offered a TV show and I want to say by who and Layton I was Satan and I was offered anything I wanted Jimmy you want to do you want to do five days in the morning you want to do one day a week you want to do this I'll give you your own studio your own crew the whole deal and I had to look at the guy I said yeah I've been waiting my whole career for someone to make me an offer like this and I just have to tell you no thanks Wow and he's like what what do you want and I said I don't want anything I already have everything I want and then he and I go I don't want to drive across town and go do a showing up somebody else's studio I walk out my back door I do my show in my garage I don't fucking need your money I don't need boss I don't need it I'm selling out theaters right now that's what I want to do I go I don't want I want to spend less time in the studio or more time touring because that's fun yeah dude it is unbelievable I I the best part of my life is right now it's unbelievable fine so glad I didn't kill myself eight years ago I was so close to killing myself I'm so glad I did it and it was my hatred for people that kept me alive amazing cuz I was I didn't want people I already said the same thing to you I didn't want people to go out hi he didn't make it I was like fuck you I am making it and then I'm gonna kill myself sees that he killed himself he didn't get suicided he didn't get silence I didn't mmm-hmm so I was I was just back in Chicago and I played a place called Thalia Hall which is fucking that's where Bryan Callen just did is uh his new special beautiful I have a video up from that show on my channel ah it was so I used to live when I started to be a comedian I moved to that neighborhood it was back then it wasn't a nice neighborhood right it was like a tougher neighborhood but I got to live closer to the city and all my comedian friends lived there because it was affordable and now it's being gentrified and shit and they've got this new theater and it's not new but it's old and they refurbished it and it's 600 people and I came out and it was just like it's just like heaven you know and there I kept my whole career I tried to figure out how to get people to stand up at the end of my set like how do I get what I don't want to do it in a shitty way I want to manipulate them but I want to have it come from my heart and inspire people and make them want to stand up you know to get a standing ovation right and now they said I want to come out Wow I don't have to worry about it it's already done so this is the greatest time in my life and it's because nobody you know people can get anywhere else what I'm doing there's just nothing else like it you know bill Marv god bless his soul you know he's a corporatist and he's part of the problem right and I like I like Bill Maher I'd loved I read his book that he read about I wrote about calm and I bet you even know he had one it was it was really funny no no no the other novel it screwed Troost I think we had a true story story yeah that's a great book twice who's one guy's name shit shit fuck chink and something else yeah well you better be careful better be careful because that's not find out about that book yeah ethnic slur that's right characters names that's right those from the 80s wasn't it 90s 90s yeah so you've been here own about it he brought about how a comedy modern-day comedy got started yeah and how it was really interested about he would go on the road and it would be the feed be the first comedian the club had ever seen and they didn't know he was like the waitresses didn't know he was leaving the next week shit like that it was like like it didn't sink in how things work it was such an interesting book to read anyway but you know now he's you know he brags he gave a million dollars to Barack Obama which fantastic to you but did he really yeah I'm not an heir so you know it's just like I get it I aspire to be Bill Maher I aspire to be a millionaire for 30 years and a little bit out of a touch I thought that's good for you you did it you did it so anyway but it's good you know again I get upset because I want him to be better or be more like I want him to be yeah but it actually helps me right so the more he's he shifts to the right the more his audience comes to me right and the more I get on style after you as mention his name on stage at a live show of people fuck boom right yeah it's progressives don't like him no he's he doesn't happen when did that happen for Bernie Sanders campaign he doesn't get that there's a difference that there's a difference between Hillary and Bernie Sanders how could he not get it you tell me he's had I play videos of him saying that yeah now they were basically the same what's the big deal then these progressives are just being babies and isn't it funny progressives are being babies when they won't support warmongering corporatists but centrist corporatists are being adults when they fuck over progressives they don't they don't ever accommodate them they don't ever drop their values and come over and be progressives we're always supposed to go that way they never go the other way that the Unity means hey you guys shut the fuck up and fall line and become a corporatist that's what they mean when they say unity and it ain't happening and I'm telling you Bernie Sanders is making a big mistake by not starting a third party right now that's how you influence if he does not win the Democratic nomination in 2020 what does he built over these four years fucking nothing do you think he's gonna run 2020 yes that's what this is all about that's what this is all about I thought he had said he was done I thought he said he was gonna try again there's I'll make that prediction yeah I'll make that prediction a dollar I'll bet you two dollars Oh Double Down okay five bucks okay all right we're on I'll go five bucks all tall your Hall you can afford five bucks that's not my life I can't I can't believe it's so nice and I have no representation right now by the way that's even better it's almost guess that's even better you get all the cheddar I was working I was working with this guy Alex Murray who's a great guy I love Alex Murray and he got me special she got me Comedy Central specials and who's especially he sold a book for me fucking great guy I love Alex Murray but he got real busy red he represents a bunch of really big Chris Hardwick and yeah I'd like anyway and Jim Gaffigan all these guys he represents so he got too busy for me which I understand it was weird he stopped so we stopped working together right is my job right is that like what the fuck all of a sudden people start showing up to clubs when I'm there and I'm like whoa whoa and we start selling out weeks ahead of time on Mike holy fuck I did the Chicago theater and how many seats is that 3,700 Jesus you are popular pretty popular Jesus Christ I don't know what happened but I did the Chicago theater many years ago and I remember saying something about the podcast and I said how many you guys listen to podcast and it was a roar through the crowd and I went whoa that was when I realized I was like whoa oh yeah what's going on yeah like I didn't think I thought I was gonna be like 10% of the people yeah I got it I don't I don't pay attention anything man this is one of the secrets for me staying me the people and the people have accused me of changing it's called it I evolved again I learned more I study myself I'm ruthlessly critical of myself I'm very analytical self analytical and I don't like a lot of stuff I do this so I get better at it hopefully but I just didn't know that anybody was paying attention I did wasn't I wasn't looking I don't look at numbers and I occasionally look who - I don't want to think about that and I don't think about it I just do it but that moment where I was in front of 3700 people I know how many guys listen to the podcast they went yeah I was like whoa okay this is not what I expected I thought it was gonna be a bunch of people you know watch people like no man no fear factor UFC whatever and that's when I realized something's going on that's a weird feeling right when you realize all these people come and see because of something you did yourself yeah was that yes because it's something you did it was it was when I stopped trying almost is when I aim with Maren you know and man stop trying is when WTF - yes that's same with me like when I stop censoring myself or overthinking like I would go on stage and I would have my jokes down to a science right yeah and that's obviously YouTube is not that way and I just let it rip and that's the thing that connected with people are so amazing in the Burbank that they had that Burbank Comedy Festival at that flappers comedy club and they asked me would you do is you know your podcast here and I did five o'clock on a Thursday or whatever and I was like okay I'll do it for you whatever and I do about five people there who's gonna fucking show up at five o'clock on a Thursday in Burbank right place is almost full and I was like oh that's what I was like what the fuck's going on five o'clock and they were there were girls there I mean I'll never forget this that they came from Compton they're like oh we had to get off work we had to get arrived we got here we walked who had to see and I was like wow I'm really connecting with people right that that don't look like me and but they share the same ideology and it's just it's like when I would go see George Carlin if you ever went and saw him live there were 80 year old hippies and there were teenager kids and there was everybody in between and that's when it looks like I might shows and it makes me so fuckin happy it's it's so that's when that's when it's brows like whoo and I was like thanks flappers for making me do this show because now I realize listen Jimmy I'm happy for you too and I really think that you're one of the only people out there that really doesn't toe a line one way or the other you really do speak the truth and I said that about you the first time I said it about you before I ever had you on I was like this guy just says what he thinks whether you agree with them or disagree with them you can't point to him and say oh this guy is just a left-wing hack or this guy is a right-wing apologist or whatever it is you just say what you think and that is so refreshing and it's so valuable there's just not enough of that today there's not enough and these people that are super intelligent that think that if you vote one way it's a protest vote and you shouldn't have a protest vote because you're throwing away your vote and you're gonna let the right-wing people win like you're missing everything you're missing this whole thing this whole thing is super complicated it's very complicated and the only way to see through the haze is to be honest and you're one of the only people that's doing it well I really appreciate you saying that and I think that there's a lot of common ground especially when it comes to getting corporations fingers out of our government and ending Wars I think a lot of people agree on that and that actually scares the establishment yeah I think it does Jimmy Joe thanks for being here man thanks for having me I really
